People have told me this and I tried and found out they copied the files in the wrong way.<br>  2) Verify in your BIOS , hit Delete Key at boot up and make sure that the CD is the first bootable device. <br>  <br>  Usually you will find a menu option to select bootable devices, move the CD ROM to the top of the list. Then save and exit your BIOS. At bootup make sure the CD is in. It should prompt you to hit a key to boot from CD.|`|Kg5jezNWaa	Go into the bios and make sure your main drive is set for it.|`|cP6uWIhHaa	You need to set your BIOS to boot-up from a CD.<br>  Now to do this, it is different with every computer.<br>  When the first screen comes on (when you bootup your computer), it says something similar to "Change BIOS" or "Setup" when you see the text press the command button that is next to it. If you are unsure, just click the command buttons for each of the options each time your re-boot.<br>  E.g. You may get a message at the bottom saying "Press F2 for Setup options" - This may be different from your computer.<br>  <br>  Once your in your BIOS, it should be a blue screen, on some computers it lets you straightaway be able to change how you boot-up; however if it just comes up with a blue screen, use your arrow keys to point to an option which may say "Boot-up Options" "Boot-up" "Options" or "CD/DVD options" you have to search for a bit, but don't change anything you are unsure off. When you come across an option which says "Boot-up from" change it to boot-up from CD, then click save from the command button at the bottom of your screen. After you have done this you can exit, and then it should reboot from the CD.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Sorry if it sounds confusing.|`|r7i3u5aAaa	If you are sure that your BIOS is set to boot from CD before HD, then it won't boot from it because it is scratched or illegitimate.

AA11044492	Those Opterons you linked to are NOT AM2, they are Socket F.  And you've got the hierarchy exactly backwards for the processors.  The Opteron is the best, the FX is next, and the X2 is the "lowest" of the three.|`|ce9864e08a14a933ced7cdc4de839112aa	Opteron is a Server & Workstation Processor. AM2 is the latest socket type replacing Socket 939. FX is the top of the line for high performance gaming computer. Many models are Dual-Core or X2. They are phasing out a lot of the AMD 64's. I have a Socket 939  AMD  4000+ and they are discontinuing it.|`|AA11211130	Ok, so those opterons are clearly AM2. The FX are the best for gaming.

Gw97sxGhaa	It sounds like you may have a clog. Try running a print head cleaning a couple of times -- that should fix the problem.  If it doesn't you may need to swab the cartridge and contacts in the printer with some alcohol to remove dried ink.

4iAMrHd1aa	They simply wear out.  Hard drives are mechanical devices with moving parts, and they break.  Is your drive overly full?  If it is and you are reading and writing to one small area, that can wear out the drive quickly.  Most likely though, you just got a dud.  It happens.  <br>  <br>  If you want to protect from this, buy two drives and set up a RAID 1 mirror between the two.  If you don't have the expertise to do that, buy an external storage device that does RAID 1.  That basically automates the process, and puts all your data external to the computer so it's easy to change the PC later.|`|v4FZs5WIaa	because they are made by humans and not by God|`|KTeztymJaa	Don't leave your computer running 24/7 and use two or more hard drives instead of making one do all the work...use one for storage and the other to run the operating system on,works for me,good luck

Ink cartridges tend to dry up if you don't use them fast enough.<br>  <br>  Many combo machines (print / fax / scan / copy) that are low cost have a short life time as the low end units are poorly built.  <br>  <br>  Some people allow their pc to print and receive fax.  With a scanner they can also send fax.  This can be less costly.  Receiving fax on the pc allows you to delete the FAX without printing it - nice way to avoid paper waste from junk fax.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	The more you print, the more economical a laser printer is.  Per page, they are far cheaper than inkjet.  Plus, they look much more professional for a business.  Go with laser.|`|F5XS5CBoaa	lazers cost more but they have lots more ink then the inkjet. So what ever you plan to buy its going to be about the same cost.|`|BqHw8MFSaa	You don't have to go Laser anymore for the cost of ink.  HP has a 7000 series, 7590, 7680, or 7780 in which is a great printer!  The high capacity cartiridges, 88xl will run you about $38 for 2500 prints.  An equivilant in a laser would be about $110.  If you're not printing labels or need anything for an extended amount of time, you could go with one of these printers.  However, if you file things away or print out shipping labels, you should go with a laser, so they don't fade, or wipe away.<br>  <br>  Good luck@!!|`|Bw2P5Vbmaa	Color inkjet printers have been fixtures in most small businesses for many years. They're cheap (under $60 in some cases), last a couple of years and everybody uses them. So they must be the perfect office tools, right?

I can tell you from experience, every game programmer has their own ideas, and they want to work on them first (myself included).  The creators of Grand Theft Auto do not have any programming experience, but they did have access to a publisher and secured funding to create the GTA franchise.  We're talking lots of $ here.  Not to discourage you, but you probably won't find people willing to implement your idea if your idea is all you can contribute.  Perhaps you might want to investigate learning to program and build something yourself?

When purchasing a laptop or desktop two things really only make or break a brand, customer service after you purchase (warranties, returns, english speaking people :) and such) and the looks or the item.  everything else will pretty much be the same cause you can pretty much get the same hardware from each company.  Oh yeah, the price also, forgot about that. <br>  <br>  A) HP or toshiba as laptop, i feel they have the best bang for buck ratio for hardware<br>  B) Never looked into desktops cause i build my own but dells look nice on the outside :)<br>  C) alienware is covenanted for gamer laptops and dell xps also but both come at a high price tag.  But as well with HP, all 3 can be outfitted with top of the line video cards which really matters the most and can have raid setups also.<br>  D) any can work for this purpose, go to their websites and just try to customize them with the worst hardware available for the cheapest price.  500 bucks will get you good enough laptop for business.<br>  <br>  I am in the market to buy a laptop for gaming and portability and would only buy a HP or toshiba because i have owned both and have had no problem at all and like the look of them over other brands.  prices were a bit cheaper for me also.|`|a519b752e69157d235098b090fe3bcf4aa	alienware is now owned by Dell

Right click a blank spot on your desktop, choose properties. Click on the screen saver tab. Down towards the bottom you should have something similar to a monitor power "power" button. Click on that and something like Power Options Properties should pop up. There should be a tab marked hibernation there, click on that. In mine there is a box that says enable hibernation. Mine is unchecked. Yours is probably check by default to save power on your lap top. Hope this helps. Check your user manual for hibernation.

OGvMRmWOaa	Ciao, la carta, senza alcun dubbio, il pc, non abbiamo ancora una certezza, che la sua memoria non svanisca con il tempo. La carta certamente si corrode, ma basta averne cura.<br>  Pensa, ai tesori che i benedettini ci hanno trasmesso, agli scribi, che hanno trascritto per secoli la bibbia, i testi di omero ecc... siamo sicuri che il silicio conservi tutto?<br>  e se cambia la tecnologia? o regrediamo tecnologicamente?<br>  Anche per i disegni architettonici, oggi ormai siamo rimasti in pochi a sporcarsi i popastrelli con il nero di china, ma che piacere, poter usare la sana manualità... certo il pc è più veloce, preciso, e quando sbagli un clic ed è risolto. Per non parlare del copia ed incolla. Ma quando vedi una mostra con gli schizzi e i disegni e poi vedi l'oggetto o l'edificio realizzato, è un piacere dell'anima.

cd835c0dab37eb7fdcb069f1913325c0aa	This probably happened because one of your programs was requesting too much memory. The system will fix itself. Some programs might shut down automatically because Windows is denying some programs memory to run the memory-hogging one.<br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with the amount of space on your Hard-Drive.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Allow me to be more clear. Considering the fact that you are using only a 4th of your hard drive space, then you should not worry about trying to free up hard drive memory for virtual memory. That would be rather overkill in my opinion. Yes, if you wipe everything but system files, then you will have more virtual memory, but you should have more than enough virtual memory to run in normal circumstances. A better solution would be to track your program usage, and expand from there.|`|8a9d0864b6e8ff48528cb89b9cd4699caa	"virtual memory" means it's memory, but isn't.  The physical memory is what's called RAM (Random Access Memory).  Those are the long strips (commonly known as Memory Cards) that serve as part of the "brains" of your computer.<br>  <br>    There's also something in Windows called a Paging File/Pagefile.  THIS is part of the hard disk drive.  When you install a hard drive, your motherboard already has preassigned a certain amount of hard disk space to act as "Virtual Memory".  Virtual means ALMOST like the real thing..in this case it's ALMOST like the memory cards you have installed on your motherboard.  <br>  <br>    Like the previous person stated, if you have a memory-hogging program or "process" running, or if the RAM is full, the computer has to work harder to process what that memhog program is trying to do, so it seeks more memory, which, in turn will either cause you to want to kick your computer because it's going soooooo slllllllow, or it will give "The Blue Screen Of Death".  One of the best things to do is to make sure you have a large amount of RAM installed, as well as a moderate pagefile/virtual memory setting.  Also, regular defragmenting is known to speed access to your hard disk drive, as it "unclutters" the files present, and stacks them neatly side-by-side.<br>  <br>    If you're not certain how to set the pagefile/virtual memory, ask someone you know who is good with technical aspects to help set it..Too little or too much may or may not cause problems.  This may or may not solve your dilemma, but, I hope I've helped answer at least part of your question.|`|AA11789409	virtual memory is hard disk space being used as memory. epending on what operating system you are using, and how its set up, you may have alot or not that much, but usually in Windows, the amount is set automatically, by windows. And most of the time, it is whatever is left free on the C drive.<br>  <br>  If you are getting that message there are a couple possibilites, either somebody set up the virtual memory settings on your computer to use less space than all the free space on drive C, or you are trying to run too many things at once, or you may have spyware or a virus. My guess would be the spyware or virus.<br>  <br>  If you are the only person using the computer, and you set it up the first time, then it should be set to normal windows default settings, which would mean the virtual memory would be all the free space on drive C and if C is less than half full, it should be way more than enough.<br>  <br>  If you aren't running a ton of stuff at one time, then again, you should have way more virtual memory than you need, So I think its likely you have some spyware runnig in the background using up virtual memory, or a virus that is causing it to seem low.<br>  <br>  Get a good anti-spyware program, and good anti-virus software, and make sure they are both up to date.|`|b4f64caf471137b01ceadae6d62b2bb0aa	Don't panic!!!<br>  You've got too many programs running at once, and Windows needs more VM to deal with it.<br>  There is a way to increase the VM manually, but it's usually best just to leave it alone, try and open only one or a couple of different programs at any one time, and let Windows keep on deciding when it needs more VM (which is when it tells you it's temporarily increasing the VM size to cope with what you're doing).<br>  <br>  It's perfectly OK and nothing to worry about.|`|AA10593884	Virtual Memory Means capacity at your RAM drive.<br>  Do Upgrade your RAM Drive with bigger capacity like if you are using 128MB of RAM Drive, upgrade it with 512MB and so on.<br>  <br>  ...stay happy<br>  sIncerely;<br>  [ r.Ahmad ]|`|d1d84975b071165f4685a152e459f5aeaa	It has nothing to do with your HD space.  You have justs been using too many high powered programs at the same time or over a short period of time.   Just try rebooting when that happens.  Cause just turning off the programs does not get all your memory back.. but rebooting does.  <br>  E|`|c72bcba1b751fcada14ce3f17bdf382eaa	This has EVERYTHING to do with space on your hard drive. When your system runs out of available physical memory (RAM) it uses part of the hard drive that's called "virtual memory" or a "paging file" or just a "pagefile." This is a section of the hard disk that the system treats as memory, writing data back and forth from it just like it would RAM. Since you don't have enough RAM in your system, it's going to this paging file and also running out of space there.<br>  <br>  To check out what's up with your pagefile size:<br>  <br>  Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Advanced tab > Settings under Performance > Advanced tab > Change under Virtual Memory.<br>  <br>  You can either set it to System Managed Size, or if you try that and it doesn't seem to resolve the problem, you can set Initial Size to a couple of GB and the Max size to a few more GB - there's a lot of info out there on what you should set these to, try searching around and reading up a bit.<br>  <br>  For a "better" (read: more expensive) solution to the problem, you can invest in some more RAM, which will also dramatically increase the performance of your computer, since it won't need to use the hard disk so much, which is ridiculously slow compared to RAM access speeds.

imaeeL9Naa	Is the computer functional?  Or does she just not know how to use it?  Well she could return it, or you could be a good friend and teach her how to use it.  Teach her the basics, getting on the internet.  Turning it on and off, playing music, and watching movies.  Saving files, opening files and using common applications.  She probably bought it wanting to do simple stuff like broswing the internet and listening to music.  I know many older people who buy computers for those simple things.  So if you don't have time to teach her, find her a nice book with lots of pictures.  I know, I know she's not a kid and doesn't need pictures, but they help tremendously.  If she see's how to move files around in a video or a picture then she'll remember how and can do it herself.

elbhMi2Oaa	I would say go with the 1520.  I've read some reviews about this card (8600M GT) and people are running games like F.E.A.R. with maxed out settings and still get decent fps at proper resolutions.  Also, both of the computers are preloaded with Vista premium so it's nice to have the better video card to help with all of the features of Vista.  The 1720 has the option also for the 8600M GT, but its a bit more expensive and bigger screens require more juice from the video card (this was said also above this entry).  I actually just ordered the 1520 a few days ago and this is what I ordered.<br>  <br>  -Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 2.0Ghz/800Mhz FSB/4MB Cache<br>  -Midnight Blue<br>  -2GB Shared Dual Channel DDR2 at 667MHz <br>  -High Resolution Glossy (1680x1050)<br>  -256MB NVIDIA? GeForce? Go 8600M GT<br>  -Vista Premium<br>  -160GB SATA Hard Drive (5400RPM)<br>  -87 Whr 9-Cell <br>  -lots of other not so important specs<br>  <br>  I ordered the larger battery just in case the larger video card and processor use a little more power than expected.  I'm a college student so having battery life is important for being in the classroom.  I've heard you can get 3-4 hours with the 9-cell and  some more if you tune everything down and shut some stuff off (ie brightness down, wireless card off, ect.).  This may be exaggerated, but i'm hoping for 2.5-3hrs.<br>  <br>  If you are going to college, make sure to take advantage of the discounts you can get (<a href="http://www.delluniversity.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.delluniversity.com).</a>  You can get up to 12% on some systems.  All said and done, I got this computer for a very good price.  I will post again when I recieve my computer to let you know what I think of it.  I should recieve it either late next week or early the week after.<br>  <br>  Feel free to ask me any questions.  Hope this helps! 8-)|`|9c08779a8f66a29897e189c73d6e4198aa	hard to decide. both are good cards but different screen sizes. more screen requires more video power for games. especially for vista. probably go with the 15". easier to carry, more batt life and bigger video card. its good that you are going with dell. my personal favorite computer company.|`|n77sPyegaa	To put it this way, an 8400GS is half of what an 8600GT is.<br>  As long as you don't mind losing some of that great resolution on the 1720 while gaming, go with the 8400GS<br>  <br>  With the 8600GT you can probably play with settings almost maxed out and still get some decent(but not great - but if you want great then you wouldn't be 'moderate gamer' anyways) fps on most current games.<br>  <br>  The 1720 also comes with a 8600GT, but if price is an issue, maybe downgrade processor? I don't know what you chose, but the T7300 should be more than enough. Also be sure to look for all their crazy coupons, like: G01JG242730SDT $300 off any inspiron...<br>  <br>  It's a shame Dell forces 2Gigs of memory on the 1720. That's about $50-$60 lost on memory if we consider that outside Dell memory is usually half the price.|`|gpBZJdnVaa	The  8600m GT with 256MB is going to be noticeably better.

I mean you loose some size, but I mean a 128 is good, I used to have a 6600gt for agp slot and it rocked for 128. But I think you will far more enjoy better graphics and sacrifice a inch of screen., games will look great IMO of course...But 128 just dont cut it with todays games as well anymore. I havent researched any of these cards tho so dont know if it can be overclocked...

Double click it, select "View Wireless Networks", then connect to your network.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|oXA2rovnaa	If you are conecting the computer to the internet with a hard wire or using the ethernet cable, you have to unplug the power from the router, and turn off you computer. then wait 30 secs. or a min. then plug the ac or power back on. Afterwards you plug the ethernet cable and turn on your computer. wait five min. or until your computer recognises the conection. It will tell you if you are connected. Then click internet explorer and it should load. If it doesn't hit the re-fresh button for a couple of times and that should get it going. If you are using wireless internet. Make sure oyur computer is picking up the signal and that it isn't locked. If it is type the key and connect and you should be in. Best Buy are bastards b careful.

AA12240997	Creative idea you have there, but there will always be a gap between real life and fiction. Not everyone can remove viruses by themselves so they will always ask someone to help them. Making the game too difficult will have no appeal among gamers (it will only frustrate them) but if done right, with cool graphics and easy game play features, I believe the game will certainly make people more aware of viruses and their dangers. It still have to be seen if major game making companies will actually like this idea.<br>  <br>  Still a very intuitive and cool idea.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cybertopcops.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cybertopcops.com/</a>|`|f26c6e827f9349459aa7ecc532b42ab0aa	I do not know such a tool.

Then Type away as desired. Since you cannot have an image and text in the same layer, you will have your image in another layer. Then you can easily move the image and text around to make it look the way you want.

The website will say that a "special" codec is needed to view it, and  asks to download it to you.

The moral is, never allow a website to download "stuff" unless it's a well known and respected site. And oh yeah, that video would have played just fine without that "special" codec!

Nowadays, systems are so big and complex that teams of architects, analysts, programmers, testers and users must work together to create the millions of lines of custom-written code that drive our enterprises. <br>  <br>  To manage this, a number of system development life cycle (SDLC) models have been created: waterfall, fountain, spiral, build and fix, rapid prototyping, incremental, and synchronize and stabilize. <br>  <br>  The oldest of these, and the best known, is the waterfall: a sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the input for the next. These stages can be characterized and divided up in different ways, including the following: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Project planning, feasibility study: Establishes a high-level view of the intended project and determines its goals. <br>  <br>  Systems analysis, requirements definition: Refines project goals into defined functions and operation of the intended application. Analyzes end-user information needs. <br>  <br>  Systems design: Describes desired features and operations in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode and other documentation. <br>  <br>  Implementation: The real code is written here. <br>  <br>  Integration and testing: Brings all the pieces together into a special testing environment, then checks for errors, bugs and interoperability. <br>  <br>  Acceptance, installation, deployment: The final stage of initial development, where the software is put into production and runs actual business. <br>  <br>  Maintenance: What happens during the rest of the software's life: changes, correction, additions, moves to a different computing platform and more. This, the least glamorous and perhaps most important step of all, goes on seemingly forever.

For a new service, a site has to be able to get this message across immediately.<br>  <br>  The first text I see on the site is:<br>  "Sponsormytalent will be a snapshot of human excellence aiming to provide a global platform for talented people around the world to express, share, view and collaborate on different projects.

Flash movies as a gateway page to your site that provides no useful navigation are already not such a good idea.  However, in this case, there's no movement... so why use flash?  Just use an image.

If the linksys adapter that you have has a proprietary feature enabled like "Speed Booster" that particular feature will not work, but the card should work just fine for standards compliant wireless access.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

For consumers, PodZinger’s search engine is the only one that allows users to find audio and video content based on keyword searches, skim the results for relevance the same way they would for text, and then jump to a specific location in the audio and video without fast forwarding or listening to the entire file. <br>  <br>  I’ve illustrated a PodZinger search result on Britney Spears divorce. Please note image above right which is fairly small; please go to PodZinger’s site for larger image examples. You can view the snippets of text to determine if this is relevant and note that each snippet has a time-stamp of where these words were spoken. The search terms are highlighted in the results. Then you can click on any part of those text results to begin playing from that location.<br>  <br>  The value PodZinger brings to advertisers is a more relevant way to deliver and associate their brand messages to consumers via the most appropriate Web content.<br>  <br>  For content creators, PodZinger enables them to generate revenue and give their viewers and listeners a more valuable experience. <br>  <br>  How is PodZinger different from other search engines? <br>  <br>  All the major video sites provide search just through the use of the metadata or tags, which are very inconsistent and often unreliable. We have found that publishers, particularly the user-generated variety, often put irrelevant tags into the metadata in an attempt to improve their ability to be “found.”<br>  <br>  The PodZinger difference is that we search the words inside audio and video to find relevant content using speech recognition technology in addition to searching the metadata. This provides a much more relevant search and results experience for the consumer.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out.

With a camrecorder, you can record and edit video clips to enhance your presentation with visuals you couldn't achieve otherwise. You've probably come across video clips on the Internet or perhaps you've seen them used in a presentation before. But, many times they were probably built-in stock clips, clips found on a CD-ROM, or the Web. <br>  <br>  Custom video clips add a punch to any presentation. For example, you can liven up the annual fiscal budget presentation with snippets of the company's CEO live from the shareholders' meeting. Other ideas include, capturing video that demonstrates how to use a product or records momentous company events. The ideas are endless, so let's get on with how to create the presentation itself. <br>  <br>  In order to use video in a PowerPoint presentation, make sure you've got the right equipment. At minimum, you'll need both video and audio software and hardware, including a microphone if you wish to record sound. In addition, if you want to perform basic editing tasks, you'll need video-editing equipment. In most cases, you can use the Media Player, which comes with Windows 95 and Windows 98. <br>  <br>  First, create a 30-second video using your video recorder to use as a test video clip. If your video recorder utilizes the USB (Universal Serial Bus) interface, you can simply plug the device into the back of a computer without having to purchase and install additional hardware, such as a video capture board. For these purposes, the USB port is superior to other port options because it allows for faster data transmission and the capability to plug various peripherals into a single port. <br>  <br>  Now that you've tested your video equipment, you're ready to create video to share the world in your PowerPoint presentation.|`|cc7014bb32aabf66a57f7fd559af62b5aa	Well you make a video then save it as a format such as.mov.

AA11131625	lol that's funny. Myspace is so overrated anyway, so I wouldn't worry too much. I have one, but I don't change the layout like every week. Just make sure you have a decent layout, some pictures, one snazzy feature or two and try to invite people you know, all with the understanding your profile should, above all, reflect YOUR personality. I also believe that blogging is a great, yet woefully underused, tool on Myspace as well. It's not eye candy, and you can tell your friends how you really feel without using pre-formulated questions made up by people who don't even know you. Try to keep in touch with your friends somewhat regularly. Other than that, just sit back and appreciate the fact that people who can't appreciate you for who are are probably not worth impressing and focus on people who are interested in getting to know you.<br>  <br>  P.S. If you want, add me on Myspace. E-mail me for my URL.|`|n77sPyegaa	So myspace lets you design a webpage about you, then you add some 'friends', a lot of whom you don't even know.

These modules are mounted on a printed circuit board and designed for use in personal computers. DIMMs began to replace SIMMs (single in-line memory modules) as the predominant type of memory module as Intel's Pentium processors began to control the market.<br>  <br>  The main difference between SIMMs and DIMMs is that SIMMs have a 32-bit data path, while DIMMs have a 64-bit data path.|`|9ywoPzTsaa	Dual In line Memory Module<br>  <br>  Single In line Memory Module<br>  <br>  Its the way the memory chips are arranged and accessed.<br>  <br>  Also... a DIMM won't fit a SIMM slot, nor will a SIMM fit where a DIMM belongs.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the poor old SIPP either...

n77sPyegaa	By 'drive', I suppose you mean Hard Drive, and not DVD/CD Drive right?<br>  If so, Hard Drive might be dying.<br>  Make sure you back up all that's important to you as soon as possible(pictures, music, videos, documents, etc).<br>  <br>  Are you using Windows? Try the CheckDisk utility(Strat > Run: "chkdsk"(without quotes). Also, run disk defragmenter.<br>  <br>  PS. Make sure you are not confusing Hard Drive sounds with fans or other hardware. Hard Drive usually sounds like 'trrrr trrrr', well I guess that's not a good interpretation of the sound<shame on me>, but anyways a little LED light should turn on everytime the hard drive is being used(the one with like 3 disks, one on top of each other). So if that light stays on while you hear that sound, then it's defenitely the hard drive.<br>  <br>  Also Check DVD/CD Drive, make sure there is nothing in there.

If you cant figure out what your current memory settings are, just ditch it.  Memory is pretty inexpensive these days.  Newegg has great prices.  Go with a reputable manufacturer.
kUwknrzraa	After checking the main website on the specs of your machine, you should look into buying 2 sticks of 1GB RAM (The ones that comes with your machine are 2 sticks of 256MB at PC3200 speed, so you might want something faster: probably PC5300).<br>  <br>  Video card, your machine has a PCI-Express? (PCI-E x16) slot available.  I would recommend GeForce 8000+ series (I posted a link in the bottom that you can use as a reference for the video card and RAM).<br>  <br>  An LCD display... maybe something like this? <a href="http://www.frys.com/product/5212607" rel="nofollow">http://www.frys.com/product/5212607</a><br>  <br>  As for installation, it is very easy and the products will give you installation instructions.  Just remember to always ground yourself first before touching any components (you can touch the metal case) so there is no static electronicity that might fry the hardware.|`|FD6DzHCfaa	well your board will support 4 gigs of ram and you have an available PCI-E (pciexpress) X16 slot for a video card<br>  <br>  dont bother going over 3G of ram though and winblows cant deal with it|`|mwcFJI0Paa	You should upgrade your RAM to at least 1GB, depending on what type of games you want to play you may soon find that 2GB is a better option.  Expect to pay close to $200 for that much RAM though.  A PCI Express x16 graphics card would work just fine for your machine.  You have a ton of options here so try to find one that fits your budget.  ASUS, EVGA, BFG are all good card manufacturers.  <br>  <br>  If you wanted to go a step farther, you could also upgrade your processor to the 4000+.  This may give you a boost in speed and the chip is pretty reasonable at around $60.  <br>  <br>  If you have never worked on a computer before, search online for some times prior to opening the case.  You can destroy your system if you arent careful.|`|VsgCCeW3aa	just upgrade... but keep in mind what vid card  ur MB can use... same for RAM

If you want cheap, get a tuner with software that uses the processor on the laptop to record TV. Some examples of such tuners are:<br>  pinnacle PCTV HD USB tuner: <a href="http://www.everythingusb.com/pinnacle_pctv_hd_pro_stick.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.everythingusb.com/pinnacle_pc...</a><br>  and Hauppauge WinTV-HVR 950: <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2648707&cp=&sr=1&origkw=usb+tuner&kw=usb+tuner&parentPage=search" rel="nofollow">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index....</a><br>  Of course, probably cheaper on ebay...<br>  <br>  Note, I said those tuners use the processor on your laptop, so you will need a somewhat good processor to record regular TV(any core 2 duo), and a really good processor(core 2 duo clocked 2GHz or more) to record HDTV.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned about processing power, you should look into tuners that have an onboard processing feature, like this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2504195&cp=&sr=1&origkw=usb+tuner&kw=usb+tuner&parentPage=search" rel="nofollow">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index....</a>|`|wLfabgMTaa	you need a TV tuner.

xekQ7czsaa	It is the same thing, they are just asking if you want another hard drive, just to store data on.  Many of us who build/repair PCs use the terminology of, O.S. hard drive, (Operating System Drive) and Data Drive (Storage Drive).  Sorry about the confusion.|`|mwcFJI0Paa	Same thing.  It could be like a storage hard drive.  Sometimes computers are built with two drives running some kind of RAID configuration and a separate storage drive that usually has a very high capacity.  There really is no difference.

mwcFJI0Paa	If you are using dial-up, this is typical if alot of people are using the same dial-up number.  If you are using DSL, sometimes a slow down can occur, just wait it out.  If you are using cable broadband and have cable TV, multiple TV's on at once can slow you down a little bit.  Sometimes a service provider will slow connections down during maintenance periods.  I know this is frustrating but try again in an hour or so.  If the slowdown persists, contact customer support.|`|uuDSix48aa	Change the AOL dialup miss|`|a3e4c62cbdec05e6fb74afc04f472ac8aa	Do you have other things downloading at the same time?  This can slow it down.|`|M8qWvWNcaa	There are many different reasons why this could be happening.  The most obvious reason is that you have viruses.  Slow processing speed can also result from low memory and fragmented files.  You should run a spy ware scan, ad ware scan and virus scan.  Clean up with those first.  Here are three recommended programs: SpyBot, AdawareSE and AVG anti-virus.  Your next step would be to run your disk defragmenter.  Click on Start, go to All Programs, Accessories, then System Tools and click on Disk Defragmenter.  Don't worry about trying to analyze anything or make out what's on the reports.  Just click the button that says "Defragment" and let the computer go through the process.  This could take several minutes (half hour or so).  After you do all these things, make sure you delete all cookies and temporary internet files and you should see substantial improvement.
mwcFJI0Paa	Try right clicking on the desktop and go to properties.  Go to settings tab and change resolution to 1024 x 768.  you can change this setting higher based on your preference.|`|0CEG2yMtaa	its just the options go to control panel it should explain it in there|`|Dxk1IAvwaa	You have probebly changed the resolution<br>  <br>  to change it back, right click on the desktop, then go to properties and then settings and in screen resolution move the scrool bar to the left and adjust acording to what you like
mwcFJI0Paa	Restarting doesnt hurt your computer but pressing the power button without properly shutting down can cause serious damage.|`|LmbRVb4Qaa	Restarting in and of itself is not bad for a system. It gives it a chance to clear out the RAM and may even free up resources for you. However, there are moving parts in a computer. You have the fans for the CPU, the case, and your video card as well has the HD. Moving part wear out. When you leave your system on, these parts for the most part do not stop moving. It is the start and stop that causes the wear and tear. This is not a problem in the sort term but after years of doing it, don't be surprised if something fails.

Another solution is either borrow a monitor from a friend or buy one from a store to see what stuff you need it back.  Final solution is to connect the computer into a network and then use another computer to connect to that computer.

zdgUBAuSaa	Most often on the internet if it's too good to be true it is. You will most likely not be getting a free phone but you will be getting a lot of spam in your E-Mail. This is also the #1 cause if identity theft. I would not recommend filling out anything like that, because your identity can be stolen with as little information as your address, name, and email. If you are using Internet Explorer or Safari to browse the web I would STRONGLY recommend switching to Mozilla Firefox. It is very secure and almost no pop ups can make it through.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>            allthough 250 watts isnt powerful enough to run most graphic cards well this depends on the other hardware you are running in your p.c and which card you want to run,however the 7800gt requires a 450watt or more psu,and if you tried to run it on just a 250watt psu it would either crash mid game or worst case scenario it would burst into flames <br>             your first task should be to visit <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp,and" rel="nofollow">http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul...</a> use the "eXtreme Power Supply Calculator Lite v2.5",by entering your hardware in the marked feilds you then press "calculate" which gives you a amount in watts ,this is how much power your p.c uses,and you may be suprised how little your p.c requires,especially if you only have 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive<br>                however even if your pc only requires something like 220watts this still dosent mean your 250watt psu will be enough,you also need to consider the ampage on the 12v rails,for example i have the geforce 7900gs and the manufactuer("xfx") state i required a 400watt(or more) psu with a minimum of 20A on the 12v rail,i ended up buying a inexpensive(but excellent) psu in the shape of the "Hiper 425W PSU HPU-4S425 " from <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Power+Supplies/200w+to+449w/Hiper+425W+PSU+HPU-4S425?productId=30570" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a><br>               this has 425watts of rated power and has dual 12v rails with a maximum of 28A over the two rails,this was more than enough to run the 7900gs and since this card is around the same in performance terms to the 7800gt its a excellent choice if you need to buy another psu,and at just ￡28.39 inc. VAT this represents excellent value<br>                however there are cheaper psu,s and i recently purchased the "600W ATX SurgeControl Power Supply " to upgrade my wifes pc when i bought a radeon HD2600xt for her,and considering its ￡14 price tag its running pretty well,and comes with both sata and pci-express power connectors which is excellent considering it price<br>                   in respect to installing a graphic card the procedure is very easy,in laymans terms you first need to uninstall any old drivers from the pc,and then after restarting your p.c shut it down<br>                now open the pc case and locate the graphic card,after touching a radiator to earth yourself take a screwdriver and remove the screw holding the cards bracket to the case,and then unplug any power connectors to the card and slowly remove the card from the slot,and place in its box if you still have it,or use the box which comes with your new card<br>                now take the new graphics card and slowly slot into place in the pci-express graphic slot and gently press in until it slots home,then screw in the screw to the backing plate and connect the pci-express 6pin power connector<br>               also make sure you install the new card in such a way so it gets decent air flow,and if needed add another case fan to the side and rear to draw more air in<br>                close the case and after starting your p.c up download the latest forceware drivers from nvidia,s website at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.asp...</a><br>                  after installing the latest drivers its then time to set the resolution and refresh rate however some carda auto-detect your monitor and set the resolution to the monitors default resolution( so if you have a 19" widescreen it will be 1280x1024)<br>               i hope this has helped however any problems let me know<br>                 good luck mate !|`|fE7zhp3Caa	Ouch.  No, you won't be able to run a 7800GT.  I've got a 7800GS, and it needs at least a 450 watt power supply.  The 7800GT needs a little more than that.  The only video cards you could run off a 250 watt power supply are low-end PCI cards.  Anything else will over-tax your power supply and blow it.  Most newer PCI cards will want 300 watts or higher.<br>  <br>  If you want to upgrade to a better video card, your first step needs to be getting a better power supply.  Something with 2 separate +12V rails totaling more than 36A would probably be best.  You can find some 500 watt power supplies with high enough ratings, but you'll likely need to look in the 550 watts or higher range to find one.|`|QZuu8nUfaa	Here's the problem.  I  am in the same boat as you on this issues that's how I know.  You could install a card but it will draw way more power than anything else in your system which can lead to other devices (CD/DVD combo drive, hardrive, etc) not getting the power they need.  I just installed a Diamond Radeon HD 2400 PRO in my computer with a 250W Power Supply and now my CD/DVD Burner sometime will not read a DVD.  The system is maybe 6 weeks old.  My Radeon card only consumes 25W (max) and needs no 6 pin PCIe cable to run.  The card works fine until I turn on AA or AF in my games. Then the games stop working.<br>  Here is a PSU calculator and GPU review tool to help.  I would get a better PSU though.<br>  ============================<br>  <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul...</a><br>  ============================<br>  <a href="http://www.gpureview.com/show_cards.php?card1=313&card2=586" rel="nofollow">http://www.gpureview.com/show_cards.php?...</a><br>  ============================<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817339012&nm_mc=EMC-IGNEFL021709&cm_mmc=EMC-IGNEFL021709-_-PowerSupplies-_-LI2C-_-17339012" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  ============================|`|cgjbw1jKaa	my old comp was 250 watts and i ran a nvidia 8500 gt card fine. as long as it has a pci express slot on the mother board . its not fairly simple to install .turn the comp off first open the case find the pci express slot,insert the card then plug your monitor in the cards output socket. turn on the comp then you`ll have to adjust the monitor settings for the new resolution you will have. damn its not easy to describe this sorry .|`|9c8c262c1c81f0d7344afbabc821ebd6aa	When ever you want to upgrade a graphics card you should upgrade your power.<br>  If you don't, you will start getting random PC shutdowns or blue screens of death at the worst times during your games or projects. <br>  <br>  Most cards require at least a 350w PSU.

2SSA9e9Naa	They actually only build upon the very core (driver model, etc). There were some significant changes to other sections when they went to Vista and then going to W7.<br>  <br>  If you look beyond the flashy GUI, especially at Windows 7, there is a lot of infrastructure improvements. THere are more coming that cannot be mentioned yet.<br>  <br>  So, they have been improving on the XP model it is just that with Vista, the flashy gui is what people notice most. The security model was significantly changed over what XP had - improved in some, not so much in others (User Access Control). In W7 it has gotten even better.<br>  <br>  The self-diagnostic and repair of the systems have gotten a lot better. One of the really neat features of W7 is if an upgrade fails, it can back itself out automatically.<br>  <br>  There are improvements coming to support virutalization and a number other areas.<br>  <br>  You really need to look past the immediate interfaces to what else is under the hood.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Microsoft decided it would be better to start from scratch rather like somebody demolishing his house to totally rebuild it instead of struggling to modify what is already there.

They are fairly cheap, about $25 for the one I got, and plug it all up. Your other computer will then see it and allow you to get into it. There is another way, though it is more difficult but cost nothing. Download a linux Live CD like a version of Ubuntu and then run it off the CD without installing it. You should be able to see the hard drive from there. Another way is to boot into the recovery console if possible and use the command prompt to copy it over to another drive.

AA10464818	I have an online magazine since 1999, and my main advice is to not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your revenue sources -- use Adsense in combination with banner ad networks, sell your own ads, even join affiliate programs.<br>  <br>  With Adsense, it is important to understand the main factors that bring you money. The amount you can earn will depend on the <br>  <br>  1. Responsiveness of audience to the ads = A travel website that provides information on travel to Spain will attract visitors looking for ways to arrange their travel and spend money on their vacation to Spain. Your site provides the info, but the ads will provide hotels, travel agencies, tourist destinations, car rentals -- ads that are likely to get the attention of the users of your site. This is a site that will most likely do well with Adsense.  However, if you are a gaming website where the main purpose of the user is to play games on your site, then Adsense will not perform as well.<br>  <br>  2. Ad format = some types of ads do better than others depending on your content and layout. In our case, large rectangles in the middle of the content is the best, while leaderboards do not generate as much as income. Skys are the worst for us. Experiment and measure the results via channels and see which formats work best for you.<br>  <br>  3. Ad placement - check Google's heat map as they have tested where the best placements are <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=17954&ctx=en:search&query=adsense+heat+map&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/support/adsense/b...</a> <br>  <br>  4. Ad colors - sometimes ads blended into the content works wonders, but sometimes ads that contrast your site colors work best<br>  <br>  5. Number of ad units on a page = we are allowed maximum of 3 ads + 1 ad links + 1 search box on a page. Maximize the allowed number based on the resulting look of your page (you don't want an overkill of ads). Users going to your page and reading your content may ignore the banner or rectangle at the top of the page, but may click on the ad at the bottom of the article<br>  <br>  6. Smartpricing - the big unknown in Adsense. No one knows how this actually works. But it can affect the pricing of the ads on your site. If the advertiser paid for $0.50/click - but your site is smartpriced - then the cost may be discounted lower (e.g. $0.25). So you may try to develop a site based on high paying keywords but if smartpricing gets to you, then you may not get as much per click as what you are expecting from your keywords.<br>  <br>  Here is Google's explanation of smart pricing <a href="https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=9562&query=smart+pricing&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/a...</a><br>  <br>  Google's smart pricing feature automatically adjusts the cost of a keyword-targeted content click based on its effectiveness compared to a search click. So if our data shows that a click from a content page is less likely to turn into actionable business results -- such as online sales, registrations, phone calls, or newsletter signups -- we reduce the price you pay for that click.<br>  <br>  Experiment with the factors above (except smartpricing, which you can't control), and see which combination works best. Remember though that not all sites do well with Adsense - even if you get gazillions of traffic but your visitors are not interested in looking for ways to spend their money, they won't be interested in your ads and won't click.|`|fXvOEZ8Yaa	I own several websites and blogs with Adsense on them, and they do a fairly good job generating income.<br>  Of course it all depends on the topic of your website, the traffic you have (the more the better of course), your optimisation of your website, and the optimisation of your ads.<br>  I'd say, follow my blog on <a href="http://www.icantinternet.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.icantinternet.org</a> , read the tips and tricks regarding adsense, seo and internet marketing, and get successfull! ;-)<br>  Good luck!|`|Pfq8xzd3aa	It's so hard to find good ad revenue opportunities, but with the <a href="http://www.my-song.ca/idevaffiliate" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-song.ca/idevaffiliate</a> affiliate program, I can get commission from click-through sales from a great product!

70fb0aa24bd7d50c1017339723461a95aa	If you have a bootable version of Windows XP, then you can restart the computer and boot the machine from the CD.  Most computers have a special "F" (function) key that pops up the boot menu, by which you can select the disk you want to boot from, such as Hard Drive, CD ROM etc.  Once you boot from the CD ROM, then you will have an opportunity to format the hard drive before installing Windows again.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you have a valid license for the operating system you are installing.  Otherwise, you'll be stuck with a machine without an operating system once you pass the point of no return (ie formatted your PC).<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to back up all of your data.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

zorYTX59aa	There are 3 possible ways to find individual people on <br>  YouTube:<br>  <br>  1 -- Type their username in the search box. Hopefully,<br>  they'll have a unique username that is not a common <br>  word (like "airplane", "boeing" or "landing"), otherwise <br>  you'll get back lots of results. Also, keep in mind that <br>  YouTube's search-engine results can't distinguish the<br>  difference between video titles and usernames.<br>  <br>  2 -- You can also type in a video-title of theirs, or very<br>  unique words from one of their videos, descriptions or<br>  tags. But be careful, because those too may bring up<br>  dozens of results -- so try to remember just the most <br>  unique words.<br>  <br>  Of course, these first 2 methods can only work if that<br>  person has an actual video on YouTube. What if they <br>  do not, and you really want to find that person?<br>  <br>  3 -- Then, you most definitely have to remember their <br>  username, and type it in using a totally other manner.<br>  Each registered user with YouTube actually has their <br>  very own website, so rather than type their username<br>  in the search box, type their URL in your address bar. <br>  Thus as an example, if you wanted to view my profile, <br>  you would simply type the following onto the URL bar:<br>  " www . youtube . com / inukjuak89 "|`|aZXnW6AUaa	search her user name.|`|94CO7YtNaa	ohh  ive tried lol! the person you are looking for has to have videos on their account for you to find them! i met up with my friends cause i told her to comment a certain video and thats where i fount her and added her. so unless she has videos or you have videos for her to search you than you can find her or she can find you :)|`|QiwZRLf8aa	try searching her username

Don't forget what you named it and where you saved it; you will need to know this later.<br>  <br>  2) in MS Word (if you have 2003 version) open a clean document, go to TOOLS/LETTERS & MAILINGS/MAIL MERGE<br>  <br>  3) in your mail merge pane that opens (probably on the right), select LABELS then down below that should be a blue link that says "Next...) click on it. (((The next several steps below will take place in this same mail merge pane.)))<br>  <br>  4) select change document layout. You'll also see Label options, if you click on that, you an select thge style of labels you want.<br>  <br>  5) click on the link "Select Recipients"  and in teh next window select "Use Existing list" and below that select browse and go to the excel file you want to merge and click on it as if to open it.<br>  <br>  6) the nedt window that opens shows you all the records in your excel file. If there are some you wish to omit, de-select the check box. When finished, click ok. <br>  <br>  7) in the lower part of your mail merge menu pane click the link "Next: Arrange your labels" then the next part has several different links, click MORE ITEMS to get the headers you created in your excel file.<br>  <br>  8) After you've clicked "More Items" you can go back to your Word document and put your cursor in the very first cell (the one that's all blank) This is where you can select and arrange the headers the way you want the real information to appear in the word document. <br>  <br>  For instance, select FIRST NAME (then click select) then go to the word document and time a space then go back to your selection screen and select the middle name/ initial or LAST NAME or whatever you want, then press SELECT, when you're finished with this line, go to the word document and press ENTER to get to the next line to add the address or whatever it is you want. Continue this with all the information you want to add on that person...careful, space is limited.<br>  <br>  9) highlight all those headers in your first cell and copy/past them into the rest of your cells AFTER the << NEXT RECORD>> indicator...do NOT delete this indicator....NOTE...if you have hundreds of records, it would be helpful that after you've completed one whole row like this to to copy and past the entire row to the next row below. Be sure the first row you copy has each cell the same...that each cell begins with <<NEXT RECORD>> then has all the header info you want. Best advice: copy and paste row 2 like crazy. Have hundreds to paste to? Just hold down CNTRL V and let the program continue pasting like crazy.<br>  <br>  OK...you're almost finished here!<br>  <br>  10) Click UPDATE ALL FIELDS then click the link "Preview your labels.<br>  <br>  11) VIOLA!

Even though Linux is generally lighter on resources than Windows there are some Distros of Linux that are lighter or heavier on resources than others. E.G.: Ubuntu is heavier on resources than, say, PCLinuxOS. But Puppy Linux is lighter on resources than PCLOS and Ubuntu, both....especially Ubuntu.<br>  <br>  The difference between one Distro and the next is only the package of software that surround the Linux Kernel (the OS), itself.

I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|8QWr77YZaa	oooooooooooooooooooooo k... what?<br>  <br>  Update your windows, we are way past sp1.  www.microsoftupdate.com<br>  <br>  need tons more ram 1gb min.  8mb vid card?

FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|tM2MN5NOaa	They don`t want you "messing about" with youtube while at school. They want you to study.

f9wQ8RcAaa	A typewriter huh? Thought all of them got thrown away. This really has nothing to do with computers at all. A typewriter is a mechanical printing devise, while computers are digital. You need a mechanic, not any type of tech support. It certainly has nothing to do with printers.

imaeeL9Naa	Your video out on your laptop would either be, S-Video, VGA or even DVI.  The video out connector will allow you to view your computer screen on a tv, projector or so on, and also allow you to use another monitor for two screens.  <br>  <br>  You can go to the website of your computer, owners manual, or under system information to see your types of video out.<br>  <br>  ~Justin|`|obWKkriPaa	You mean the VGA cable?|`|2yXwk3nlaa	Video out is used to connect external monitors instead of using the LCD on the laptop.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|WJGdemGOaa	It is usually called an s-video or y/c. <br>  It is an analog video signal that carries the video data as two separate signals (brightness and color), unlike composite video which carries the video signals mixed in one line. S-Video, as most commonly implemented, carries 480i or 576i resolution video, i.e. standard definition video. Three-line component video cables are commonly used to carry video resolutions higher than those supported by a S-Video cable — for example, YPrPb component video cables can easily handle 1080p resolution video. S-Video does not carry audio on the same cable.<br>  <br>  picture: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/SVideoConnector.jpg/300px-SVideoConnector.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a>

DvAvrVejaa	Etsy's non-paying feature is not like Ebay's.  It's much easier to use and you get a much quicker response.  As a seller, make sure that your window for buyers paying for their purchases is clearly stated in your shop policies.  I personally allow 7 days in my Etsy store TwoSeasideBabes.  If after 3 days they have not paid, I contact them both through their personal email and Etsy profile to remind them about their purchase and kindly let them know I will ship as soon as payment is received.  If they still haven't paid after 6 days, I again send out emails to those two areas and let them know that if I don't receive payment within 24 hours, I will cancel the sale.<br>  <br>  It's as simple as that.  As a buyer, there is a button under "Your Etsy" and "Items" to "Cancel a Sale".  Simply input the transaction information and in as little as an hour you will get the sale canceled and be refunded both your $.20 listing fee and the transaction fee.

Do you get anything on the screen?  It may be that your screen has gone out.  You might be able to hook it up to an external monitor via a VGA cable.  You will probably have to hit something like Func+F6 or Func+F8 key combination on your laptop to get the image to show on the external monitor.

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either<br>  a film / video creator or producer, an artist (musician, singer, comedian, actor),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own original videos (meaning videos nobody else has done)<br>  -- The content is 100% yours (there aren't any elements that belong to others)<br>  -- You own all of the implied copyrights<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,<br>  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:<br>  -- a special "banner" for your profile page <br>  -- a mini-banner beside each played video <br>  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"<br>  -- extra channel boxes: bulletins, profile ?<br>  -- automatic higher quality to your videos<br>  -- videos which are over 11 minutes long<br>  -- more options for your video thumbnails<br>  -- being at the very top of search results<br>  -- unique skins/sizes for the video player<br>  -- the possibility of earning "ad revenue"<br>  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (if you are considered a "broadcaster")<br>  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section<br>  and featuring only your uploaded videos.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page, <br>  click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner".

1Bto3sZeaa	Bittorrent... Frostwire, Limewire... they are all about equal d/l-wise, as it really depends on the other person's upload, not just your download speed.  If they can upload at 1 Mb p/s, then the fastest you can d/l from them will be 1 Mb p/s.  Also, if they are sharing that same file between you and 1 other person at the same time, then you'll have to halve that speed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/</a><br>  <br>  Downloading copywritten/pirated material is illegal...

a8eeb508e9838423866dd84a2d141f67aa	To do part 3 you need to add a counter to part 2 that counts the number of guesses the user has made.  After you find out the guess was incorrect, make sure that the user hasn't made 5 guesses.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Change the line where you declare your variables to:<br>  int iSecret, iGuess, iCount = 0;<br>  I would change the do-while loop to:<br>  do {<br>  printf ("Guess the number (1 to 20): ");<br>  scanf ("%d",&iGuess);<br>  if (iSecret<iGuess) puts ("The secret number is lower");<br>  else if (iSecret>iGuess) puts ("The secret number is higher");<br>  } while (iSecret!=iGuess && count++ < 5);<br>  <br>  if(count == 5)<br>  puts("Out of guesses");<br>  else<br>  puts ("Congratulations!");|`|pXzvu866aa	You need to declare two variables:<br>  <br>  const int maxGuesses = 5;<br>  int numGuesses = 0;<br>  <br>  Then the end of your 'while' loop can look like this:<br>  <br>  } while ( (iSecret != iGuess) && <br>  ? ? ? ? ? ? (++numGuesses < maxGuesses) )<br>  <br>  Don't congratulate a loser: <br>  <br>  if (iSecret == iGuess) puts("Congratulations");<br>  <br>  Advice: if you're using C++, don't use C's stdio. If you do want to use C's stdio, don't use scanf. Use fgets and sscanf instead. Did you test your code by entering bogus input, i.e. not an integer? With fgets and sscanf you can protect yourself against bad input making your program  misbehave. Of course C++'s iostream and sstream provide good features for getting and validating input, so I'd also recommend learning how to use them. I'm not really anti-C, it is; after all, a subset of C++. There's nothing wrong with writing C code, and using a C compiler. You should strive to be fluent in both C and C++.

lMG4o27Raa	Not true! Leave your battery in at all times, battery life is determined by the battery. Using your laptop without the battery could ruin your motherboard. <br>  completely draining the battery and then recharging does extend the battery life.|`|NBJXduAAaa	Don't do that. It's not going to work, and it could cause problems. Esp with motherboard.|`|AA10459818	new rechargeable batteries (LI-ion) don't like to be less then 10% or above 90%.  Its pretty unpractical to stop charging at 90%, but if your willing to take the battery out you can.  The main thing is to not let it go all the way down to 0%.  That will hurt the battery.  Unfortunately if you don't go down all the way every once in a  while your meeter will become inaccurate and the computer will shut down prematurely.  After every 30 charge cycles let it run until it shuts off.  disable auto shut down and let it "crash".  Save everything and log out first.  this will recalibrate your meter.  I don't ever take my batt out and charge to 100%.  I plug in or shut down at 10%.  My batt after 4 years only lost 30 min of charge time.  It last 3 hours now.

79FON9cCaa	Yes!!!  VB is still extremely common for ASP .NET development since it calls pretty much the same librarys as c#.  People like it because it's a wordy language which doesnt have all of the punctuation - easier to follow if you ask me because it offers a smooth transition from psuedocode to real code..  Here's also a fun fact for you, the newest version of the silverlight compiler was written in VB! <br>  <br>  All of the .NET languages are pretty much on par with each other when it comes to web development;  I have personally done some amazing things with VB.  Take the course, and good luck! :)|`|8b28725938a24c16394919e965619fd9aa	Yes, you can use VB.Net working as code-behind for your ASP.NET pages.|`|9LGbWZAqaa	Visual Basic is still very commonly used for web programming. However, you can't use regular Visual Basic, you have to use Visual Basic Web Developer, which is slightly different from regular Visual Basic. <br>  <br>  As for ASP.NET.... It's a terrible language, I highly recommend you do NOT learn it.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you want my opinion, drop what you've been learning and learn PHP. It's free, open source, and its the best language to learn if you're going to become a web developer. A good tutorial can be found on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com,</a> and you can download PHP from <a href="http://www.php.net." rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net.</a>

How big is your file?<br>  <br>  A 3 minute movie can be as big as 100-some megabytes, which can take between 20 and 30 minutes to upload with high speed internet.<br>  <br>  After the upload is complete, your video will go through a 'processing' phase which can take up to a day before it can be seen by the public.<br>  <br>  You could also try: Tinypic, Photobucket (I believe they do video), or megaupload!<br>  <br>  Of course if it's a video that you want lots of people to see, Youtube is the way to go.|`|lQeSD8dqaa	fiirst of all iits YOUTUBE !!!

Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....<br>  <br>  this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'.

2RQ4qDhXaa	Pros:<br>  Easier user interface than Windows - it takes a very short time to get used to Mac OS X. Everything is drag-and-drop, it's faster and more stable than Windows, and the day to day use is very similar to Windows so it's not a ton to learn.<br>  <br>  No viruses. You can still get malware if you are dumb enough to pirate software or steal music, but there are no viruses that will attack your Mac without you installing the software yourself. If you know what you are installing, you will never get a virus or trojan.<br>  <br>  You can run Windows on your Mac. I used Boot Camp (included with OS X) to run XP Pro for the few time I have a program or game that is Windows-only. I basically have two computers in one. If I want XP, I simply restart. If I was OS X, I restart again. You can always run Windows on a Mac easily, but installing OS X on a PC is very very hard.<br>  <br>  The software. iLife '09 (the software package that comes with Macs) is awesome! iPhoto, iCalander, iTunes, iDVD, iMovie, GarageBand....there are programs LIKE those for Windows, but not just like them.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  Price. Macs are more expensive than PC's. However, if you install Windows on your MacBook in addition to OS X, you are basically getting two laptops in one so the price makes sence. <br>  <br>  You can't upgrade the hardware yourself except for RAM. But then again, who do you know that installs a new processor in their laptop except for people who are really, really good with computers and system building? Unless you plan on building your own system, not being able to upgrade a laptop is normal. You can't easily upgrade the processor or video card in a HP or Dell laptop either.<br>  <br>  Windows-only Software. Sure, it's a pain not to be able to play games or use most MS software, but if you install Windows via Boot Camp it runs native on the Mac system and you can run anything that Windows can.<br>  <br>  Can you tell I love my iMac? I was really scared to change from PC's (which I used for years!) to Mac, but I never looked back. I got my first Mac in late 2007 and I plan on getting a MacBook Pro in the next month or so - that will go along with my iPod Shuffle, my iPod Nano, my iPhone, and my iMac.  :)|`|9wojIiiWaa	you are probably a nube at this computer stuff since you dont know the diff, so for people that jsut wana do media stuff like listen to music or look at pics get a mac, if you have programs you need for i duno lets say work, then you might not be able to run it on the mac so check compadability online. also when you do get it make sure you use the multiple desktop thing since if you dont no  point of getting mac|`|Y61uc4bHaa	Pros: Design, portability<br>  Cons: Games are scarce, difficult navigation compared to PC, price|`|hTH5pGgeaa	Pros: nothing<br>  Cons: everything|`|0WJAyVgsaa	Pros: Its expensive and pretty.<br>  Cons: Cant play any games on it, cant do anything at all on it rly, its apple...|`|2wsw2gzgaa	Actually there are viruses for Apple/Mac's.<br>  <br>  They are becoming more and more prevelant.|`|4QHanq1Laa	i LOVE my mac book, I just got it 2 months ago after haivng a pc for 20 years<br>  <br>  pro- easier burning cds/dvds<br>         no viruses<br>         looks awesome<br>         itunes uploads faster<br>         so many cool applications like photobooth and garage band<br>  <br>  Cons- might take u a week to figure it all out. but its worth it.

7cf2315c89717c9e6aa8da4d01d3c5eaaa	Well I don't know C++ but I know a lot of Java so I might be able to help.<br>  <br>  You'll need several methods for overloading, and you'll need variables which hold your information (to match to theirs) or, as I've done below, accept multiple parameters for match. Example:<br>  <br>   count to keep the count of how many matches you get:<br>  int count = 0;<br>  <br>  public boolean match(String s, String myS) {<br>  if(s == myS) {<br>      count++; // that's whatever matches you've gotten so far + 1<br>      return true;<br>    }<br>  return false; // if it's not true it's false :P<br>  }<br>  <br>  public boolean match(int x, int myX) {<br>  if(s == myS) {<br>      count++; // that's whatever matches you've gotten so far + 1<br>      return true;<br>    }<br>  return false; // if it's not true it's false<br>  }<br>  <br>  // ETC... and for the main method you'll have (adapted to C++ of course):<br>  <br>  public boolean matchingRoomate() {<br>      String gender;<br>      int age, pets;<br>      boolean smoking;<br>      //etc..<br>  <br>     // prompt user for info here<br>     match(theirAnswer, yourAnswer); // do this several times, one for each question, obviously<br>  <br>     // finally determine if he or she is a match:<br>     if(count > 5) { // count can be w/e you want, remember that count means how many total matches you got with roommate<br>          return true; }<br>      return false; // else return false;<br>  }<br>  <br>  Feel free to IM me if you have any other questions about this! I'm sorry that my knowledge on C++ is minimal (at best).

Only uncheck programs you recognise and not stuff like virus software. It might sound a little complex but it is very simple.

7vh5fOeRaa	Certainly you can...<br>  <br>  In fact, I would guess that MOST computers being sold right now are 64-bit hardware machines running 32-bit OSes.  <br>  <br>  The Intel Core Duo line of processors (and their AMD counterparts) have been 64-bit for quite some time now.  But unless you know that you are running a 64-bit OS (Windows XP 64-bit, Windows Vista 64-bit, MAC OSX), most likely the computer you purchased from a big-box computer company is running a 32-bit Operating System.<br>  <br>  The biggest downside is the one you have already touched on.  32-bit Windows Operating Systems have that 4-GB RAM limit.  So if you are running 32-bit Windows you will be limited to 4-GB of RAM at a maximum.  64-bit Windows blows the lid off of that limitation... if memory serves, the memory limit for 64-bit Windows is in the Petabytes...<br>  <br>  There are a few other advantages that running a 64-bit Operating System will provide... but many of those have not trickled down to the home user/consumer level yet.  Hardware and driver support is just now becoming easier to find and will continue to get better as we move forward.  Still, depending on what your intended use for your computer is, you may still be better off running the 32-bit OS.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of nice little articles that give you some of the advantages of a 64-bit OS and explain in detail how a 64-bit OS can take advantage of 64-bit hardware:<br>  <a href="http://www.windows-vista-update.com/Windows_Vista_64_bit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.windows-vista-update.com/Wind...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_ff_x64.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/win...</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy and good luck!|`|3xRmLJUGaa	You can but you won't get the benefit of having 64 bit hardware.

RAM speed and timings, FSB, CPU cache, HDD cache and speed, soundcard sampling rate and SnR, ethernet speed and graphics speed and memory size are all specifications that are very important to the enthusiast, yet the average user would notice zero difference between top-of-the-line and budget solutions.

Couldn't hurt to try. But malware is designed to be difficult to remove and designed to hide parts of itself. So the designers of MalwareBytes can do only their best to figure out which system files Antivirus 360 changes or infected or added and then fix those.<br>  <br>  Here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files to an external hard drive or high-capacity iPod.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows.<br>  <br>  3. Use a limited user account.<br>  <br>  4. Google "social engineering" and read the first five results and take them to heart<br>  <br>  5. Don't pirate software, music, videos<br>  <br>  6. Use Firefox with NoScript<br>  <br>  7.

Some of objects listed among fake threats are real and, moreover, these are system files. Their deletion results in system collapse. Remove Antivirus 360 not just for this misleading tip. The main danger comes from Vundo.trojan, a regular manger of Antivirus 360 installation. This trojan will slow down Windows intentionally to create greater effect and thus increase chances for purchase of the full version of Antivirus 360.

You can defrag your hard drive or clean your registry but not defrag your registry.  Defragging a computers hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve if you defrag the computer.<br>  <br>  CCleaner is an excellent registry cleaner (and much more). CCleaner also has the option to save changes to the registry in case you need to revert back.<br>  <br>  Auslogics Registry Defrag and Defraggler are the best free registry defrag programs. Defraggler is brought to you by the same company (Piriform) that makes CCleaner.

This means you wont be able to VNC into a GUI, rather just login via ssh. <br>  <br>  If you want to use a GUI you would have to use the desktop version. However if the use is primarily for network storage, you may want to consider using freenas.

3mRxTEC1aa	The best OS is and always will be Mac. Just don't install Mac OS on a non-Apple computer as it is a violation of copyrights and Apple's terms of use. Even though there are bootlegged versions out there, so called "PC compatible" versions, and people on youtube running it on a PC, it runs the best on an Apple Computer. It will run slow on a PC and a lot of hardware will not be compatible which takes away a lot of functionality. Also, you will not be able to have a lot of programs or files on your laptop because of its lack of hdd memory and it will be very slow with the newest versions of Operating Systems because of its lack of ram. My suggestion, buy a mac laptop. If you think it's too expensive, buy it refurbished or used. But whatever you do, only buy from Apple Authorized Resellers. Some online stores will have the "Apple Authorized Reseller" logo but aren't truly genuine. To confirm if it is Authorized, check to see if their website is listed on this website: <a href="http://wheretobuy.apple.com/Catalog.html" rel="nofollow">http://wheretobuy.apple.com/Catalog.html</a><br>  Unauthorized resellers are untrusted and may sell you phony computers, swap out components for cheaper ones and sell the originals, or even take your money and not even ship you a computer.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>                      your p.c is actually very good however the Sapphire RADEON HD 3450 isnt the best gaming card and with demanding games like crysis you need something with a better memory clock and bus interface<br>                    there are some excellent and inexpensive gaming cards around and i know of one excellent card that was reviewed in last months pc gamer,the MSI Radeon HD 4830 512MB PCI-E 2.0 ( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Graphics+Cards/PCI-E/ATI+Radeon+4000+Series/MSI+Radeon+HD+4830+512MB+PCI-E+2.0+?productId=34187" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> ) is a excellent gaming card and has some brilliant specifications aswell<br>            these include a 585mhz core clock and 512mb of gddr3 memory running at 1800mhz,along with this theres a sizable 256bit memory bus interface which equates to a 57.6gb/sec memory bandwidth<br>           in benchmarks the HD4830 ran crysis on medium settings managing a playable 35fps,and when run on high detail these dropped to a still capable 30fps(frames per second)<br>          considering that high end cards like the radeon HD4870x2 can only manage 50fps on high detail these are pretty impressive,however it all depends on what frame rate you consider as playable,well its been said that 55fps is the benchmark of "seamless gaming" however games running at 25fps can be quite smooth however it also depends on which type of games you are running,for example racing games require a higher fps than a first person shooter,basically because racing games have more scenes to render than a shooting game which is more static and linear<br>            another card worth considering is the much acclaimed "nVidia GeForce 9600GT 512MB PCI-E "( <a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Graphics+Cards/PCI-E/nVIDIA+GeForce+9+Series/nVidia+GeForce+9600GT+512MB+PCI-E+?productId=30589" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> ) which is popular among gamers,and its specs are pretty decent with a 650mhz core clock and 512mb of ddr3 memory running at 1800mhz<br>               again this comes with a 256bit memory bus and is pretty similar to the HD4830 in performance,however the 9600gt has support for "physx" which is becoming more and more popular in games,these include infernal,ghost recon advanced warfighter and gears of war 2 among others<br>               any of these cards will vastly improve your crysis gaming experience however i would personally opt for the geforce 9600gt,however dont dismiss the HD4830 as its also a excellent performer across all titles<br>                for a budget gaming card the ATI Radeon HD4670 1GB DDR3 PCI-E(<a href="http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Components/Graphics+Cards/PCI-E/ATI+Radeon+4000+Series/ATI+Radeon+HD4670+1GB+DDR3+PCI-E+?productId=34137)" rel="nofollow">http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...</a> is also worth checking out,its specs are similar to the other two( 750MHz GPU, 1800MHz GDDR3) however it only has a 128bit memory bus interface which will lose you around 5 to 10fps on crysis,but when you take into consideration your pc,s other specifications (Intel Quad Core Q8200 ,4GB(2 x 2GB) DDR2 677Mhz/PC2-6400 Memory ) this card may suprise you<br>            i hope this helps,however any problems let me know <br>             good luck mate !|`|AA11605143	Yea, when you play Crysis, You gotta have the higher end cards. I just got Crysis this morning as a matter of fact. I have SLi GTX 260 C216's By default it sets it to High but I play on Very high with not a problem yet.|`|ukXWyrYraa	that card won't do. <br>  in my opinion, you can try building your own, probably that one doesn't come with a good power supply. but if you wait until april, get the 4750, it'll play crysis. if you can't wait, get the 4830 or 9800GT
AA12271834	I found from personal experience that the best laptop for a student is a small laptop with a long battery life.  Any extra features are just icing on the cake.  I would look at a wide range of 13" or smaller laptops and pay close attention to batter life.  Nothing is more annoying then being in the middle of class and having your laptop shut down because it is out of juice.  <br>  <br>  I suggest the following laptops to look at:<br>  <a href="http://system76.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=89" rel="nofollow">http://system76.com/product_info.php?cPa...</a><br>  <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://eeepc.asus.com/global/index.html</a><br>  <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&current-category-id=135A781CA29B4ECB9ADAD8E72CF6FD61" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/contr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-13?c=ca&cs=cadhs1&l=en&s=dhs" rel="nofollow">http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products...</a><br>  <a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air?mco=MTE3MDc" rel="nofollow">http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/sh...</a>|`|Hyzu8QWzaa	I would say a Mac because since your classes are online the Mac is 100 times faster then a PC. If a PC has 2 gb's and a Mac has 2 gb's, it will still seem like the Mac has 4 gb's and not 2. <br>  Although if you just want a PC like Dell or HP, I would defenitly do with HP. It's faster and have better features to it. Although an HP is sometimes more expensive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Alexia|`|99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	For a manufacured system, I prefer Dell.  Perhaps it is my exposure to them.  The last, including my present, 4 employers all use Dell.<br>  <br>  I have never experienced any issues with them.  I have a home built PC, but when I bought a laptop - I went to Dell.  I have no complaints at all.  Depending on the money you have, when you pick a laptop try to increase the RAM as much as it will let you.  You will appreciate the difference it makes.<br>  <br>  Since you are a student, you will want to make sure you get a copy of Microsoft Office.  You'll probably have a use for Word, Power Point, and Excel.  You might be able to get a "student" version thruogh your school for less than through Dell.  So check with your school first.|`|3xRmLJUGaa	If that's all you'll be using it for, just buy the cheapest.
48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	The thing is, how good something is is relative to each person. What one person thinks is amazing another might think is junk. Someone like me, who plays computer games, thinks that Dells are pieces of crap because they cant handle the games. However, I know people who swear by them.<br>  That being said, the laptop is decent. It's got a sort of slow processor, but the 4GB of RAM is a definite positive. Video card is decent. Like I said, everything is pretty nice. If you're going to play games on it, you'd have a decent time running on low to medium settings.<br>  Good laptop for the price.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Looks good to me.|`|KNppmXiXaa	Good deal for the price.  Should work very well for office usage, video playback, and possibly light gaming (lower settings).<br>  <br>  I have a higher end Asus with the 9700M GT video card and I really like the laptop.  Only complaint so far is weak speakers in it but we either have desktop speakers or a headset connected usually anyway.|`|XiN9fYCNaa	Yeah.  I paid $799 for mine and... well compare this to yours.<br>  <br>  Intel core 2 duo T5540<br>  1 GB Memory<br>  120GB Hard Drive<br>  <br>  Slightly over 6 pounds...|`|YOIycFeNaa	Thats a GREAT deal...well done!|`|ZHvWLxwQaa	little overpriced, chk out the vendor directly and see if any difference

qRx3ynKdaa	You can use “Save As...” in your OpenOffice.org Calc application to save your file as a Microsoft Office Excel document. When the dialog box comes up, select the “Save as type:” bar and when it opens up as a list box, select “Microsoft Excel 97\2000\XP (.xls) (*.xls)”.<br>  <br>  Make sure that Auto-Extension is checked. Then mouse-press “Save”.<br>  <br>  You should now have a duplicate file with an “.xls” suffix that can be read by Excel. <br>  <br>  Note that this “.xls' version will now be the current version in Calc during the current session. That is, you can save again to it just by pressing “Save”. So if you make any changes, it may be a good idea to use “Save As...” again and save them to OpenOffice.org from as “ODF Spreadsheet (.odf) (*.odf)”/<br>  <br>  You can also download and install the Sun ODF Plugin from <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plugin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plu...</a> .

These downloads are generally invisible and can take hours in some cases, depending on your web bandwith and how much of that you're using at the moment.<br>  <br>  It could be that you've contracted some kind of virus or spyware, and that it's picking up information or downloading more junk on your dime.  Run a virus check if you have (I hope) some virus software installed (and btw...regular utility maintenance, like virus detection, spyware checks, etc., can run in the background on a schedule; make sure you know if your machine is doing this, and that you control when it happens).<br>  <br>  You could have a RAM problem.  press ctrl-alt-delete (in Windows up to XP; don't know Vista, sorry) to bring up the Task Manager and click the Process tab.  Check the bottom figure of CPU Usage to make sure it's no more than 50-60% tops.  If it's in the 90's, scan the list up and down (if you can...saturated RAM makes EVERYTHING slow) and see which apps are using high CPU and MEM usage (usually your browser, if you have a lot of stuff open) and try closing some apps you don't need at the moment.  Do NOT have too many web pages open at once.  With Explorer, I could never get 30 pages or so open without trouble; with Firefox I do a lot better, but around 45 pages becomes iffy, and any page with more than 20 or so Tabs gets things really sketchy, especially if each "active" page has a lot of flash or ActiveX stuff running (like animated advertising).  Close some of that!<br>  <br>  Finally, make absolutely sure that your hard drives are in good shape.  If the noise is accompanied by a whining, like a bad fan bearing, or a fast clicking, like sticking a pencil in a fan, then your drive may be crashing and need diagnostics or backup and replacement.  If it's just full (less than about 3% total space free), then you may just be hearing your poor CPU straining to find swapfile space to do the work you're demanding of it.  Offload, compress, or delete some stuff to bring that figure up to 10-20% free space, MINIMUM, and run a defrag to stack all that stuff in a nice, neat, accessible order.<br>  <br>  There are other possibilities as well, but they are pretty bad and all come back to three things: your CPU is working overtime on something, whether intentionally or otherwise, or your hard drives have issues.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|f33xIzFWaa	i agree with other posters. to make the process easier go here <a href="http://www.iobit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iobit.com/</a><br>  download the advanced systemcare program and run it. it wll clean up your pc. open the task manager with cntrl, alt delete and see what is using so many resources. in advanced systemcare if you click the utilities button, then on the right click admin tools tab and select the startup manager you can deselect programs so they won't load when you restart your pc if you find that one of these programs is the issue|`|svsWJI1Xaa	A lot of programs run in the background and withdraw huge resources from the computer.

1bRRODd2aa	To answer your last question first. Yes it would be a circular reference. Best not to do that.<br>  <br>  Yes you can automatically load values into cells depending on the value of another cell.<br>  <br>  You can either write a VBA function to return the value, the most flexible way will be to define a Named Range of values for each of the sets of values.  Use the values in the Named ranges to return the corresponding value for each of the other columns.<br>  <br>  Or you can use a (pre-2007) nested IF statement to determine the correct values alternatively, if the values are 1 to 1, then create a table on another sheet with all the values in three columns and VLOOKUP will work.<br>  <br>  2007, instead of the nested IF, you can use IFS or VLOOKUP.

Re-install your OS again without telling him.  Of course, he would know once he gets online and see that he is not able to spy on you anymore.  <br>  <br>  Use a password on your pc.  Keep changing it.  DO NOT let him use your computer without your presence, if that's possible.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could do a reverse psychology on him.

GTDH0wBDaa	The short answer is no. You can use a second router but the solution is some what complicated and involves wiring the second router to the first, and that involves running an ethernet line to the room anyway, so unless you need more than one wired connection upstairs you can get away with just wiring it.<br>  <br>  There are some other options such as ethernet over phone line, as well as ethernet over power lines. Keep in mind both of these solutions require special hardware that can be quite expensive.<br>  <br>  Finally an option you might consider is simply getting one of two things, or both. There are devices called repeaters, or wireless extenders. These work by accessing your wireless connection and then rebroadcasting it so the signal is stronger, further away from the router. One problem here is that the repeater can only repeat as strong as signal as it gets so it needs to be placed in a good signal quality spot, to rebroadcast that quality. A higher gain antennae for your router may also be available, these can increase the strength of the signal coming out of the router and broadcasting further.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps, let me know.<br>  <br>  ****************EDIT ANSWER 02/27/08 12:00AM*************<br>  <br>  Since you inquired about wireless N I will answer that for you as well. Everything needs to be switched over in order to gain the advantages, this includes the router and all network cards. Two things to keep in mind, first is that if there is a laptop involved and you currently use built in wireless, many of the recent notebooks have not begun to support wireless N built in (it is a feature on a few higher end laptops), if this is the case with you, you will also need to buy an external wireless N card for your laptop that slides into an available PCMCIA or other cardslot. The second consideration is that wireless N routers are backwards compatible with the G B and A standards, this means your older gear will still work, but you will not be able to take advantage of the features of the new N standard.|`|AA10375835	No, you can't have two routers using the same incoming connection.  The best solution would be to upgrade to Wireless-N, which has a better signal range before loss.  We use Wireless-N at one of the facilities I monitor, and even with all the metal we can get a good signal about 200' from the wireless access point.  Just be sure to set the security features (have a unique SSID, require the MAC address to match the entries on the router, and have a strong WEP password) because your next door neighbors will also get a good signal from your wireless.

They will not affect how the document prints, they are only visible on screen and are not actually part of the text. Some people like to work with those marks showing so they can more easily see if they have proper paragraph breaks, single spaces between words and so on, but others find it distracting.|`|1bRRODd2aa	On your tool bar you should have a small icon that looks like a filled in P.

FjCcc561aa	SQL Injection is a trick to inject SQL query/command as an input possibly via web pages. Many web pages take parameters from web user, and make SQL query to the database. Take for instance when a user login, web page that user name and password and make SQL query to the database to check if a user has valid name and password. With SQL Injection, it is possible for us to send crafted user name and/or password field that will change the SQL query and thus grant us something else. <br>  <br>  Try to look for pages that allow you to submit data, i.e: login page, search page, feedback, etc. Sometimes, HTML pages use POST command to send parameters to another ASP page. Therefore, you may not see the parameters in the URL. However, you can check the source code of the HTML, and look for "FORM" tag in the HTML code. You may find something like this in some HTML codes:<br>  <br>  <FORM action=Search/search.asp method=post><br>  <input type=hidden name=A value=C><br>  </FORM><br>  <br>  You should look for pages like ASP, JSP, CGI, or PHP web pages. Try to look especially for URL that takes parameters, like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://duck/index.asp?id=10" rel="nofollow">http://duck/index.asp?id=10</a><br>  <br>  Start with a single quote trick. Input something like:<br>  <br>  hi' or 1=1--<br>  <br>  Into login, or password, or even in the URL. Example:<br>  <br>  Login: hi' or 1=1-- Pass: hi' or 1=1-- <a href="http://duck/index.asp?id=hi'" rel="nofollow">http://duck/index.asp?id=hi'</a> or 1=1--<br>  <br>  If you must do this with a hidden field, just download the source HTML from the site, save it in your hard disk, modify the URL and hidden field accordingly. Example:<br>  <br>  <FORM action=http://duck/Search/search.asp method=post><br>  <input type=hidden name=A value="hi' or 1=1--"><br>  </FORM><br>  <br>  If luck is on your side, you will get login without any login name or password. <br>  <br>  Let us look at another example why ' or 1=1-- is important. Other than bypassing login, it is also possible to view extra information that is not normally available. Take an asp page that will link you to another page with the following URL:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://duck/index.asp?category=food" rel="nofollow">http://duck/index.asp?category=food</a><br>  <br>  In the URL, 'category' is the variable name, and 'food' is the value assigned to the variable. In order to do that, an ASP might contain the following code (OK, this is the actual code that we created for this exercise):<br>  <br>  v_cat = request("category")<br>  sqlstr="SELECT * FROM product WHERE PCategory='" & v_cat & "'"<br>  set rs=conn.execute(sqlstr)<br>  <br>  As we can see, our variable will be wrapped into v_cat and thus the SQL statement should become:<br>  <br>  SELECT * FROM product WHERE PCategory='food'<br>  <br>  The query should return a resultset containing one or more rows that match the WHERE condition, in this case, 'food'.<br>  <br>  Now, assume that we change the URL into something like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://duck/index.asp?category=food'" rel="nofollow">http://duck/index.asp?category=food'</a> or 1=1--<br>  <br>  Now, our variable v_cat equals to "food' or 1=1-- ", if we substitute this in the SQL query, we will have:<br>  <br>  SELECT * FROM product WHERE PCategory='food' or 1=1--'<br>  <br>  The query now should now select everything from the product table regardless if PCategory is equal to 'food' or not. A double dash "--" tell MS SQL server ignore the rest of the query, which will get rid of the last hanging single quote ('). Sometimes, it may be possible to replace double dash with single hash "#".<br>  <br>  However, if it is not an SQL server, or you simply cannot ignore the rest of the query, you also may try<br>  <br>  ' or 'a'='a<br>  <br>  The SQL query will now become:<br>  <br>  SELECT * FROM product WHERE PCategory='food' or 'a'='a'<br>  <br>  It should return the same result.<br>  <br>  Depending on the actual SQL query, you may have to try some of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  ' or 1=1--<br>  " or 1=1--<br>  or 1=1--<br>  ' or 'a'='a<br>  " or "a"="a<br>  ') or ('a'='a

If the server is on a domain, create however many groups in active directory that you want to add / remove users to in order to control and facilitate RDP access to that particular server.<br>  <br>  If it is not on a domain, then just create the groups locally or just add the users themselves that are locally setup on that box.<br>  <br>  1. Go into Terminal Services Configuration (under administrative tools)<br>  <br>  2. Right click "RDP Protocol" under the connections area, and click "properties"<br>  <br>  3. Under the access tab, remove and add as many users or groups as you want, that you wish to have access to this server.<br>  <br>  <br>  Simple!

Edit the value using Binary and replace the space character with 0D00 . Remember that one letter of normal text is equal to four characters in the binary editor.<br>  <br>  Windows 2000 does not seem to use the LegalNoticeCaption or LegalNoticeText registry settings. I used the Local Security Policy console to set a legal notice, and the above registry keys were empty although Windows 2000 was displaying a legal notice and title.<br>  <br>     * Click Start/Settings/Control Panel<br>     * Double-click Administrative Tools / Local Security Settings / Local Policies / Security Options<br>     * Set Message text for users attempting to log on<br>     * Set Message title for users attempting to log on<br>     * Logoff/Logon to test <br>  <br>  This sets the local pc security policy. If the PC is part of a domain, the domain security policy value will override if it exists.<br>  <br>  Without notice on each entry into the network (each workstation/server) via such legal notice messages, one has little chance to prosecute intruders. CIAC has published an informational article Creating Login Banners covering the issue for various platforms in some detail.<br>  <br>  Default message in windows is delivered is Welcome. LegalNoticeCaption/LegalNoticeText create a text box displayed prior to logon which one must respond "OK" to before one can continue the logon process. LogonPrompt is displayed in the standard logon screen (this probably makes LogonPrompt less "distinct" and less useful for legal notices purposes). The logon screen variables are usually used to personalize the logon dialog such as setting the Welcome value ="Welcome to Wayne's Computer". This works in Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.|`|lMG4o27Raa	<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310430" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310430</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck<br>  Adam
RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

You should turn off your laptop when not in use though. You have to be careful with programs in which you download and share files... such as limewire... remember you are just getting a song from another person, that can potentially have a virus... The more things you put in it, specially songs that take up space, it'lll get slower eventually... You can maintain your computer by not downloading unnecessary things... Do download an anti-virus program such as nod32 and make sure you keep it on at all times. <br>  <br>  If you go to <a href="http://techguys.com" rel="nofollow">http://techguys.com</a> they are very good at trying to solve your computer problems and you don't have to pay anything.

FEQMb7wIaa	The easiest way is to use a simple iPod to computer transfer software. You don't even need to run iTunes and risk losing anything. I've used a piece of software called YamiPod before.

So it really sounds as if you restored your computer to the factory settings or reinstalled Windows / Mac OS X.<br>  <br>  Some advice for the future: if your computer "crashes" next time, you can use a live CD to back up all your data:<br>  <a href="http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/recovering-windows-files-with-a-ubuntu-cd-ii-getting-your-files/" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/reco...</a><br>  <br>  Though really you should be making regular backups anyway. It's worth it to invest in an external hard drive.<br>  <br>  That said, you can copy the music back from your iPod.<br>  <br>  1. In iTunes, go to Edit > Preferences and make sure syncing is turned off. If you have syncing turned on, when you plug in your iPod, all your music on the iPod will be erased.<br>  <br>  2. Plug in your iPod.<br>  <br>  3. Make sure you show hidden files in Explorer ( <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial62.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorial...</a> ) of Finder ( <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/command-line/show-hidden-files-in-finder-188892.php" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/software/command-l...</a> )<br>  <br>  4. Do a search for all .mp3 or m4p files<br>  <br>  5.

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

AA10455677	I am just guessing that it is a scam, why would a website give a way thousands of free laptops?|`|IFtV7g2Zaa	Typically these things are kind of a scam.<br>  <br>  They may in fact give away a free laptop, but you have to jump through hoops, give them your right arm, left knee, and grandma's social security number to get it, in a process that will take an hour.  Then they'll SPAM you to death for 10 years.<br>  <br>  The first thing they'll want is your email address.  Then if you actually get through all of the screens (and 99.99999% of the people won't), signed up for 3 or 5 services, and purchased $1000 worth of goods from other vendors, then and only then, you'll get a laptop.  And when you realize that you actually have to buy something from somebody else before you get your free laptop, you'll quit.  Unfortunately, you didn't get that far without giving them your email address, and by giving it to them you've OPTed IN to their SPAM engine.  So you're guaranteed to get more crap than you bargained for.<br>  <br>  There are lots of these types of scams around.  Two other examples, <br>  of this, that are more frequently in front of you, are, from television, the Video Professor who makes you actually purchase something that you can return in 10 days else your credit card is charged, and FreeCreditReport.com which states in their advertisement that you have to buy something from somebody else before you get your credit report for free.<br>  <br>  So, technically, its not a scam, because you really can get the laptop free.  But in reality it is a scam because its deceptive advertising.

They have different backup programs. Backup and restore is an option to backup your computer. Once you back it up then if you have problems you can restore it to that backup. Let's say you do a backup. Then two weeks later you have a problem with your computer. You can restore your computer to the way it was before the problem. Your computer will be like it was the day  you did the backup. To use backup and restore you must set it up. The destination drive would be an External hard drive. Or you could back up to a cd or dvd. Once you set up your Destination then you can do a backup. Norton has help files in your Norton program that will help you set it up. Norton can not fix the problem without you setting it up for backups. All backup programs work that way. You must tell them where to backup to. Also you must tell them what you want to back up. Like your C drive, or maybe you only want to back up your Music files. It's up to you to decide. How often you want to backup.

Actually i was told that despite being a slower speed that the quad core would out beat a dual core or higher speeds now i'm sure that there is a limit to that, it's beleiveable because the more cores the more it can do, one core can run the game while another core runs vista, while another one runs your media player, it goes on. Speed isn't everything anymore these days, if i got that computer though i would do 2 things, upgrade ram to at least 3gb if not 4gb and buy a graphics card as the onboard one won't turn any heads.

WuhIoS1laa	Right. <br>  <br>  This is how it works.  Windows is a collection of settings defined in something called the registry.  The registry makes your computer unique from all other computers and that includes what software is installed. For programs like The Sims 2, if your operating system has never had the correct registry entries applied, it doesn't know that program exists. <br>  <br>  The easiest, and often only way of adding these registry entries is by installing the software in the operating system under which you wish to run the game. <br>  <br>  There is an advanced option to export registry keys from one OS installation and import them into another, but frankly I don't know how dissimilar Windows 7 is from XP. It sounds like you don't either. If you mess with the registry without knowing what effect it will have, you can completely hose your windows installation and wind up having to reinstall everything from the partition level up.<br>  <br>  In short, you need to reinstall the software under Windows 7.<br>  <br>  If it would help to not have to eat up extra disc space for the reinstall, reinstall it if possible into the exact same directories where the game files are now.  This will not affect the registry of your Windows XP installation, and if it works, won't take up more hard drive space for the binaries. <br>  <br>  Your saved game files are another matter.  You will have to copy the files under Windows XP from My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2 and then, put them under whatever passes for the same location in Windows 7. <br>  <br>  I recommend running the game first, finding where it tries to place the saved files, then replacing them with the version copied from your Windows XP profile.   That way your neighborhood files will start off right where you left off under Windows XP. <br>  <br>  But Windows XP and Windows 7 will probably not share the same save files.|`|dILqe7nBaa	install it on windows 7 beta|`|AA11850311	run your games using XP.  Every time that I have upgraded Windows, it would always forget the path / directory where my games were installed, and I would have to re-install them.  <br>  You might be able to find the .exe file for each game in the Program Files area (or whatever Windows 7 Beta calls) and then just double click the .exe file to get your game to play.

AA12271834	All the Macs have excellent hardware so any of them will make excellent gaming machines once you have Windows working.  I would strongly advise going the Boot Camp approach over Crossover because with Crossover your still not playing the game in the native OS.  It is great for applications that FPS don't matter but for games you will experience lag.|`|030531ee855433dc337dbac40412f7c6aa	I actually laughed a little when I first read this question, No way should you be buying a Macbook if you have gaming in mind.|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	Why would you buy a Macbook for gaming?<br>  Sure, it may run Team Fortress 2 with little problems, but anything else? It'll look terrible!<br>  Macs are not meant for gaming, plain, pure and simple. Most games aren't even compatible with the Mac OS.<br>  So, you should ask "Will my Mac play Team Fortress 2?" instead of generalizing into "gaming".<br>  <br>  LOL... macs have excellent hardware for gaming?? LMAO.
Xi8LpZC0aa	Simple answer is your school does not allow you to do it so don't even try wait till you get home and check it then or do you do nothing in school like learning things instead of trying to break the rules they have,grow up!!!<br>  Source(s):<br>  Seen this same question hundreds of times by pupils wanting the same solution!! DOH!!!!|`|6Xreht4Qaa	Try using a new proxy !

A proxy will allow you to you to go to any website within the first site.<br>  Try these:<br>  <a href="https://www.vtunnel.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.vtunnel.com/</a><br>  <a href="https://www.kproxy.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.kproxy.com/</a>|`|0q4nPE2zaa	The only way you can get on myspace on school is to download a proxy program then also put it on a software storage device and download it to a school computer. Then go to myspace through the proxy. I wouldn't do it if I were you though. Proxy's usually come with a virus affecting you computer and the computer you downloaded to, then the school's whole computer network. And if the teachers have a virus, in some schools they can tell who downloaded what. And it also takes a longtime to load, so its a big chance of getting caught.<br>  <br>  Also, why would you want to get on myspace while all your friends are at school? There won't be anyone to talk to. It's pointless if you ask me.|`|N6KtPPRqaa	um you get over it suck it up and wait till you get home your at school to learn not destroy your brain with crap like myspace you dont need to be on there!

2vL8wOHZaa	Buy it and slap it in. Check your Mother board specs at there website and see if it needs a bios update for that CPU. I believe that should be a new enough board that it shouldn't need one. I hope this helps.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Shouldn't be an issue. FSB support varies slightly with the OEM of the X38 board, but most have at least 1333 support (which is the FSB of the E8400).|`|AA12092556	yeah you're covered.|`|8yaT7l9oaa	google is your best friend.

25vVBQAJaa	PSP X2 uses a lot of memory. The size of your brush increases the memory usage. The larger the brush size, the more memory it uses. Try clearing your PSP cache. Also try increasing your windows paging file so there will be more memory available.
sv64Uy3Saa	Try running msconfig then choose Diagnostic mode, apply, ok. PC will restart. Install VideoSpin. After a successful installation you can run msconfig again then choose normal mode.<br>  <br>  Sometimes one of the background processes conflicts or blocks a new installation of software and even drivers.

M7i30zP6aa	Log on to your school email and look for help/support link within.  Most of time you will find helpful settings and contact information there.<br>  <br>  Also try searching on your school website if there is one.|`|7vh5fOeRaa	That information must be given to you by your mail provider.<br>  <br>  Usually this is provided to you as part of your welcome packet when you subscribe to a new service.  It can usually be found on-line at your providers website as well.<br>  <br>  For example, if you sign up to Comcast as your ISP and mail provider, they will usually tell you two addresses:  your SMTP address (outgoing) and your POP3 address (incoming).  They'll usually be in a similar format:<br>  <br>  SMTP:  smtp.comcast.net<br>  POP3:  mail.comcast.net<br>  <br>  *NOTE:  Both of those are examples and are not meant to be the actual SMTP and POP3 addresses for Comcast.<br>  <br>  This procedure is identical for a school-provided e-mail address.  They will have specific information you need to configure your e-mail program.  They may have an on-line site to look for answers, or you may have to call the IT support line for your school.<br>  <br>  If you don't have any paperwork with this info, check your providers website, or contact the individual or company who hosts your mail server.

To do this simply right click on the wireless network icon on the lower right of the task bar and select repair.  You can also pull up command prompt do a ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew_all.<br>  <br>  2) You can also hard code in your IP address in your wireless TCP/IP setting with a IP that's within the range of what the router would assign.|`|AA11595360	If your neighbor isnt within a 100 feet anything can interfere with the reception of your signal.

When you log in, the service (DHCP) in the DSL or cable modem that hands out IP addresses is trying to hand you one that's in use; hence, tell you that there is an IP conflict.  Your neighbor, if knowledgeable, can set that devices address in a manner that you'll not bump into it.|`|D9BpCvTraa	r u sure u have ur neighbors permision? i no of a lot of ppl tht use their neighbors internet without permission. r u a moocher?
