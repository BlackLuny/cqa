KrkftOfkaa	Wow...not a fan of chiro?  Ha-ha!  The few times I've needed their services I've been happy with the results. Better than being wacked out of my mind from pain pills and muscle relaxers for several days instead.|`|lfrAJxNEaa	I thought all chiro's were quacks when my mother decided to become a chiropractor. After seeing her education and going to her classes with her I realize there are many different kinds of chiro's the same way there are different doctors (some who just give you pills to get out of their offices vs. those who say you are fine and tell you to leave...). Yes I have meet a few quacks, who think that strep throat can be cured by a chiro visit (crazies) and then others who work well with your 'normal' doctor and understand that sometimes you need medicine help versus a chiro visit.    As well, my mother got into med school and decided to become a chiro, and no she did not fail out... she choose to change tracks.|`|1RtawTJdaa	umm. judgmental, are we?|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Drug companies that buy off regulatory agencies and push shady drugs with mass propaganda in commercials and have drugs on the market that harm people because they hid data on it. Or how long it takes the paid off FDA to pull a drug off the market. Those guys are the enemy of "Health Care".    America is a factory of sickness.    You target the wrong thing. Chiropractic does not harm people, so I don't care.    Big Pharma harms people. I could go more into detail but it would take me days to finish my answer.
BhNP2P8Xaa	Well, if you stop taking them, and within an hour you're willing to practically kill someone to get more, you're addicted.    Seriously, depending on the drug, I'd watch for irritability, shakes, excessive sweating, sleeplessness, and any other drastic physical changes.    Get help if you think you need it. Don't let it spiral out of control, or we'll all be watching you on "Intervention."|`|q5BkV27Daa	When you cant stop taking them, and get panicky when you don take them, or get panicky thinking about not taking them.

They aren't that much help.  No smoking, no beer, no booze, no drugs.  Get off junk food & sugary sweet soda's.  Eat a good, helalthy balanced diet.  Drink lots of water & fat free milk. Snack on LOTS of raw fruits & veggies.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Within 90 days you will be surprised how lean & mean you've become.  When you have time, sneak in a few push ups, pull ups & sit ups for good measure.

A7lghafHaa	good question  1. while you are alseep your salivary flow decreases significantly therefore the natural salivary flow which celans out the mouth thru out the day is not working as effectively. this allows bacteria to feast on any "food" you may have in your mouth.    2.  your are lying down and allowing your sinus drainage and your nasal drainage to flow to the back of your throat which as yo know is connected to your mouth.  3.  as you sleep the cilia in your throat are pushing mucous etc.. up your throat so you can eithe r cough it out or spit it out in the morning  4.  most people breathe thru their mouth while they sleep this contributes (the drying) to the bad breathe  5.  tiny invisible men sprinkle smelly powder in your mouth (not really i just wante dto see if you were still reading)    floss your teeth ever night and brush your tongue and drink lots of water and brush really well  some medicines will dry your mouth out and contribute to halitosis  also some foods (indian food fore example) will give you bad breathe    oh one other tihnig if you have gastroesophageal reflux then that can also cause bad breathe    thats all i can come up with right now  im going to lie down and amke bad breathe!|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Bad breath is the highest in the morning when you wake up, why? Because bad breath is caused by bacteria that grow on the top of your tongue and during the night they grow without you eating, drinking, etc.  I learned about the real cause of bad breath a short time ago.  I have cured my bad breath by  using an OraBrush tongue cleaner and some mouthwash and I clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth, twice a day.  To check for bacteria, just stick out your tongue and look for "white stuff" on the top of your tongue.

5lhSnnKZaa	It is unlikely that a supernumerary tooth or an extra wisdom tooth would cause the symptoms you described.  "Lockjaw" is a symptom of tetanus infection.

7dc556d67f0e9a4f5714fa5d96b331b7aa	First of all throw away all your eye make-up and buy new stuff.  Replace it every 3 months because bacteria starts to grow in it.  Don't ever share make-up with anyone.    If you wear contacts you might want to switch to glasses instead.    My sister had reoccurring eye infections and had to see a specialist.  He told her to take a clean, wet washcloth with a drop or 2 of baby shampoo and wash her eye by gently putting the eye lid down.  It seemed to work and her infections stopped.    I've used it myself and on pets and it seems to work well.  Just make sure it's baby shampoo because it's made so if you get it in your eyes that it doesn't burn.|`|MWdDBMHsaa	I'm not aware of any way to prevent tear duct infections other then avoid touching/rubbing your eye. They do have a procedure though where they are stick a very thin wire through the tear duct to remove any blockage. If you have a blockage, it could cause reoccurring infections unless removed. The procedure it called Tear Duct Probing and Irrigation.

But, Also, she may just need to go see a dentist about the black stuff. That doesn't sound good. She may be really good about taking care of it, but in between teeth is a kinda hard to reach spot.

ilFCy4Jfaa	The reactions you are feeling could be derived from anxiety created by not taking the Lexapro. You may be worried about stopping cold turkey which then causes a chain reaction. Almost seems like a catch 22 doesn't it?
p5oRMt9Saa	Ambien can have a very unusual and even dangerous effect. I used to abuse it because it made me feel euphoric. According to my housemates I used to speak in tongues and acted like someone who had very serious mental issues. They got quite scared. I couldn't remember a thing tho. That was when I took too much. So no I didn't feel sleepy lol.     So if you do decide to take it be very very careful and go to sleep as soon as you feel sleepy otherwise you may do something weird/bad and not remember it.     I don't remember ever hallucinating but then I may have done and not remembered it. Zolpidem can do that to you.|`|Shp5riE6aa	It's a sedative, it actually relaxes me like a Valium would, but it's not addicting as far as I know.  They make me tired.|`|oYSDEWrfaa	From my personal experience:    I was prescribed Ambien along with another medication for depression right after a very bad car accident. I refused to take the depression medication but I did take the Ambien. I had a very bad reaction to Ambien, it gave me bad headaches and made me feel horrible in the mornings. I stopped taking it after about a week. I really really did not like this medication and I felt it was making me worse not better. I started looking into different ways to help myself that did not include medication.   It was a very touchy situation because I also kept in mind I didn't want to become dependent on medication to sleep. I decided to stop taking Ambien because of the headaches and because I felt sluggish and more depressed when I would try to wake up. Ambien made it very hard for me to start my days. This is just my opinion from my experience.     Good luck & Best wishes!    Ms. K
EZt7ZHIiaa	Because each person has anxiety for slightly different reasons, this guy's approach isn't going to work for everyone.  As a therapist myself, I can tell you that your best bet is to find someone who will work with you on a personal level as opposed to a more clinical level, and that way you can work on problems specific to you with someone you trust.  If you are interested in online counseling you can check out the link on my profile, but I think what you are going to find is that many self-help resources don't get deep enough into your specific reasons and triggers for anxiety which is necessary in order to really get to the bottom of it and resolve it, however they can provide some useful coping mechanisms and some general guidance if that is more of what you are looking for.  Good luck to you.    Ryan
uzQhahFzaa	Hi, sorry you're feeling so bad. First of all, I hope you have a good doctor because you need to have a COMPLETE physical. I had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia years ago, but when it became much worse, my doctor just kept giving me more drugs. I was working as an RN and I had to drag myself to work. I felt as if I was dying, but still no help from my doctor. Finally, I just went to his office and told him I couldn't take another step. Long story short, I had a totally degenerated disk, another doctor told me likely for over 2 years. The point is, you SHOULD get better, but if you don't, likely there is something else no one is looking for. Don't force yourself to work if you don't have to. My body is totally ruined now and I am on disability. I'm not saying this to scare you, but I don't feel doctors look deep enough to find out the cause of pain/weakness. Don't suffer like I did. I hope you get help - good luck!  PS - I tried exercising too, because I thought I was just out of shape, or lazy! No, my body was trying to tell me something was very wrong.

FfoLrCH5aa	The most common cause of blood in the toilet is from straining too much.  You can rupture blood vessels in your anus and cause hemorrhoids.     Increase your water drinking - dehydration is a big constipation causer. Also avoid foods that are constipating and eat more fiber (think green veggies).  That should clear up the constipation if it is normal constipation.    If it was a small amount I'd wait and see if that fixes it. If it was a large amount and your parents won't help you - please tell a school nurse.|`|9d0ffimQaa	Well, i think your stomach from inside has become very very hot, so you might be facing blood dysentery, without any further delay consult your physician or doctor & get yourself cured, there are medicines for these things.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	They really shouldn't take it lightly. Blood found after defecating could be a sign of something serious. In most cases, it turns out to be hemorrhoids. My sister once had it.
tVF9O1Olaa	You need to go back to your doctors and explain everything, how can they give you the proper help you need if you don't tell them important information.   When you tell them how much you are struggling they can then give you the help you need. They may offer you group therapy or one to one therapy or send you to see you community mental health team for more support.  If you don't think you can tell your doctor everything then why not write down everything and show them the list, i have done this before as i get anxious talking to people how i feel.   Good luck|`|vd9mdriYaa	I suffer from both. I went to my doctor and told her everything that was going on with me, inside my head, and physically.

(:|`|P2BjtJnUaa	You should go see a mental health professional as well as your primary MD. Yes you can have depression, anxiety, stress, and all sorts of things going on at once. A mental health professional will help you with finding the cause and establishing healthy coping methods and in some cases you may want to consider medications as well as therapy. Don't be ashamed, this happens to a lot of us. good luck and be well.|`|bc440202ee9d2423974a61a0588cabf7aa	Yep, you are suffering from both.  Been there myself in the past.    My solution was to quit the job and go into business for myself and never be tied down with one company again.  It may or may not be your solution.  Also I stopped worrying about what others thought of me, dumped a few of my "friends" who were not really friends, and found a few REAL friends that I could actually talk to and tell things to without them blabbing it to the world or thinking I was weird or whatever.    You need a few good changes in your life.  But what works for one person wont necessarily work for another.  Times are scary right now, so you have to be really careful when leaving a job or moving to a new one, its so unknown.  Maybe you may want to sign up for a job at the White House - they are recruiting now.  You never know.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	It is possible to suffer from depression and stress at the same time because I do.  I am on anti-anxiety medication and an anti-depressant and I also see a counselor twice a week.  My doctor also recommended an over the counter sleeping pill to help when I have trouble sleeping.  I see a psychiatrist that prescribes my depression and anxiety medicine.  I hope this helps...as I'm sure you know drinking is only a temporary fix...it makes you feel better for the moment, but in the morning you're problems are still there.|`|uE8FyJijaa	First of all, quit feeling bad for wanting to get help and not knowing exactly what is going on.  That's what doctors get paid to do.  It's absolutely possible to suffer from depression/stress.  They go hand in hand.  You've done the right thing by beginning to look for professional help.  As I'm sure you know, drinking is the last thing you want to start doing.  See a mental health professional and discuss what you can do to get to feeling better.  Hang in there!  The hardest part is coming to the realization that you are depressed and need help.
AA11785060	Penis size has nothing to do with the amount of semen a guy ejaculates if that is what your *s mean.  How much are you expecting? The average adult male only ejaculates about a teaspoon-- which is why there is not much of a resevoir in the end of a condom-- not much space is needed.     Also, 5.5 inches is a decent average adult size penis.  Most guys are near this size.

EMNwWAuvaa	Yes, work on strengthening the leg that was uninjured.  Work on the hamstrings.  Try this, sit on a straight chair and cross your ankles in this pattern.  Place the injured foot flat on the floor so that the knee is at 90 degrees and the good leg's ankle is in front of the injured ankle.  Now pull back into the injured leg as hard as you can for fifteen seconds and then rest for thirty.  The trick here is not to let the injured foot move at all.  After the thirty seconds rest have the good leg pull again for fifteen seconds as hard as you can and then rest for thirty seconds.  Do that routine once more.  Now get up and walk around.  How does the injured leg feel?  It should feel better and have less pain.  Now sit on the chair again but this time reverse the feet positions.  Do the same routine that you originally did but you may not be able to pull back as hard as the first time, that is okay just make sure that the pull is for the full fifteen seconds and then rest.  Again do that routine twice more and then get up and move around.  There should be a difference in the way the leg feels.  Do this a few times a day and things should be back to normal soon.  Keep the ice on for fifteen minutes per hour until there is no more pain or restriction.

Don't overdo it, however. You merely want to relax your body, not exhaust it. Too long in hot water and your body is drained of vitality.      Use bath salts, or throw in Epsom salts and baking sodaone cup of each. These will relax you and also help remove toxins from your body.    Get a Massage   Have your spouse (or whoever) give you a massage just before going to sleep. If you can convince them to give you a full body massage, great. If not, even a short backrub and/or a face and scalp massage can be a big help. Have them make the massage strokes slow, gentle, yet firm, to work the tension out of your muscles and soothe you to sleep.      Listen to Music   Play some soft, soothing music that will lull you to sleep. There are even cassettes and records designed for that very purpose. Some are specially composed music, others simply have sounds of waves rhythmically breaking, or the steady pattern of a heartbeat.     Drink Warm Milk   A glass of warm milk 15 minutes before going to bed will soothe your nervous system. Milk contains calcium, which works directly on jagged nerves to make them (and you) relax.      Drink Herb Tea   If you don't like milkor are avoiding dairy productstry a cup of hot camomile, catnip, anise or fennel tea. All contain natural ingredients which will help you sleep. Most health food stores will also have special blends of herb tea designed to soothe you and help you get to sleep.

wRtzGgRxaa	It's good that you have effective ways of relieving stress (boxing, lifting weights), but I suggest that you learn different techniques for controlling stress when in the classroom.  It's normal for someone of your age to have high emotions about things, but it's inappropriate to act out on every one that you feel.|`|1a5be627b850e833c95c0e781eaac7a1aa	Is it normal?  Unfortunately, sometimes it is.    I see this a lot in my field.  I'm pretty new at teaching, but I try try to treat students with the respect they deserve in my classroom.  Too many teachers get an ego-trip from yelling, and I don't understand that.  What exactly does a grownup prove by yelling at a kid, besides that he's a big jerk?    Effective discipline dictates that teachers do not get into shouting matches or power struggles with students.  The main goal for any teacher should be a peaceful classroom.  It sounds like you have a teacher who would rather "show them who's boss."  Not professional.      Why don't you mention this to your parents and ask them to chat with your teacher about his discipline techniques?  Have them let your teacher know that yelling is not always the solution.    I admire you for keeping calm when you can.  That's obviously more than your teacher can do!  As long as you remain calm, you're the grownup in that situation.    I wish you were in my class instead.  Best of luck!

If it does, it may take a day or two to a week or more.  There is a risk that it will become lodged in your intestine and create an obstruction.  You should consult a physician and get an abdominal x-ray.  If the plate has any metal in it, it will show on the x-ray.

Diphenhydramine HCl.  One medication might differ from the next in terms of mg of the chemical.  Most sleep aids use that antihistamine.  Prescription sleep aids are generally different drugs manufactured by their respective pharmaceutical companies.  Look on the label of sleep aids and look at the active ingredients (this goes for any over the counter medication).  You will find that their active ingredients are more or less the same and that's all you really need to care about.|`|jfOcpuUxaa	No,  they're different and work differently.  These are some different types of prescription sleep aids:    Melatonin Receptor Agonists-  it works with receptors in your brain that are believed to regulate the bodys circadian rhythm.    Non-benzodiazepines-  they are eliminated from the body quickly, they are less likely to cause daytime sleepiness. they are "selective" which means they target specific receptors in the brain    Benzodiazepines-  this is prescribed as both a sleep aid and anxiety medicine. this class includes both long-acting medicines (which can linger in the body and potentially cause daytime drowsiness) and short-acting medicines (which do not stay in the bloodstream as long).    Antidepressants-  Antidepressants are not FDA approved to treat insomnia. However, doctors will sometimes prescribe them to help with sleep problems.          There are over-the-counter sleep aids which contain antihistamines (also in cold medicine)    And there are natural sleep aids which contain natural herbs and you can get over the counter|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	It just depends.

This can be a dangerous condition. An oxygen           saturation below 93% would be very worrisome.    Here's a landmark paper on the role of Cannabinoids in sleep.    Sleep. 2002 Jun 15;25(4):391-8.  Related Articles, Links           Return Back To Main Medical Page      Comment in:   Sleep. 2002 Jun 15;25(4):399-400.    Functional role for Cannabinoids in respiratory stability during sleep.    Carley DW, Paviovic S, Janelidze M, Radulovacki M.    Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 60612, USA.   dwcarley@uic.edu    STUDY OBJECTIVES: Serotonin, acting in the peripheral nervous system,   can exacerbate sleep-related apnea, and systemically administered   serotonin antagonists reduce sleep-disordered respiration in rats and   bulldogs. Because Cannabinoid receptor agonists are known to inhibit   the excitatory effects of serotonin on nodose ganglion cells, we examined   the effects of endogenous (oleamide) and exogenous   (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol; delta9THC) cannabimimetic agents on   sleep-related apnea.   DESIGN: Sleep architecture, respiratory pattern,   and apnea expression in rats were assessed by polysomnography. A   repeated measures, within-subjects, fully nested crossover design was   used in which each animal was recorded on exactly 12 occasions.     PARTICIPANTS: Eleven adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented   for chronic polysomnography.   INTERVENTIONS: Animals were recorded   following intraperitoneal injection of various doses of delta9THC,   oleamide, and serotonin, alone and in combination.   MEASUREMENTS AND   RESULTS: Our data show that delta9THC and oleamide each stabilized   respiration during all sleep stages. With delta9THC, apnea index   decreased by 42% (F=2.63; p=0.04) and 58% (F=2.68; p=0.04) in NREM and   REM sleep, respectively. Oleamide produced equivalent apnea   suppression.     This observation suggests an important role for endocannabinoids in   maintaining autonomic stability during sleep. Oleamide and delta9THC   blocked serotonin-induced exacerbation of sleep apnea (p  each), suggesting that inhibitory coupling between Cannabinoids and serotonin   receptors in the peripheral nervous system may act on apnea expression.          CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates potent suppression of   sleep-related apnea by both exogenous and endogenous Cannabinoids.   These findings are of relevance to the pathogenesis   and pharmacological treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders.|`|d7ccOZbdaa	no, becausse its about the dose, how much you take and how it works

fbPY8ZHsaa	Hmmmm, it seems like a mixture of the virus/stomach bug (I know it came out of the front end but it does happen) and your extraction.    Unless you had previous reactions to ibrofen (which from this, I doubt) or local anaesthetic, like the doc says, I pretty doubt it. It seems you are still recovering from your virus/stomach bug and of course the extraction wouldn't have done your body any good the way you were to begin with. Shock may play a factor like you said and being a bit dehydrated, it may have caused you to be dizzy and have a headache. To be honest, there are all sorts flying around, like I said, I reckon it's a bit of a mixture, I'm no doc but I guess the virus/stomach bug and the extraction cause you to shiver and feel like poo    As for the pee, it can be the weather, believe me, it's happen to me. What I suggest is drinking as little as often, so instead of downing a glass of water, have occasionally sips, not much. Hope this helps a bit|`|SiSplXXsaa	It sounds like the flu.

92VH41EZaa	Hash (hashish) is the resin collected from the flowers of the cannabis plant. The primary active substance is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) although several other cannabinoids are known to occur.     Hash is usually smoked in pipes, water pipes, joints, and hookahs, sometimes mixed with cannabis flowers or tobacco. It can also be eaten.     The most common effects of hash and cannabis are: a sense of wellbeing, relaxation, rapid flow of ideas, increased appreciation of music and food, heightened senses, sleepiness, pain relief, nausea relief and increased appetite.     There are also several negative effects including dry mouth, rapid heart beat, impaired short term memory, anxiety, and panic attacks.     There are some serious long term effects linked to hash but not enough research has gone into it yet for  there to be like  a definate link. Its definatly a weaker drug, but still pretty bad.    Almost all of the THC is absorbed within the first few seconds even if held in the lungs over a long period of time.    Its also illegal (obviously) but tbh its easier to get hold of than alcohol in most places.    hope this helped =)|`|3rgJpqjZaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish|`|FOCOywTfaa	Hash is a mature form of weed.

If she isn't certified or qualified, she could get in a lot of trouble including potential jail time and huge fees.   Also, she should look into state laws about reselling products that were purchased outside of the country. If she is getting supplements from across the border and resells them, your state may require that she get a business license. Some states don't require it if it's under certain amounts, like in the example of garage sales... you don't have to get a license to sell stuff there unless you make a business out of it and/or sell X amount per month. However, if she's getting drugs and selling them here, that is totally illegal and she would serve jail time if she was caught for that. Definitely look into it.

The hyperventilation syndrome is such a problem. In this syndrome, a nervous or anxious person becomes concerned about his or her breathing and feels unable to get enough air into the lungs. This is often associated with chest pain or tightness.  The sensation of being out of breath leads to overbreathing and a lowering of the carbon dioxide level in the blood. The lower level of carbon dioxide bring on symptoms of numbness and tingling of the hands and dizziness.  The numbness and tingling may extend to the feet and may also be noted around the mouth. Occasionally muscle spasm may occur in the hands. And good luck.
RYQ01pHgaa	From all of your stated problems, it seems that you have allergies triggering your sinus infections.  You must first start by changing your eating habits and get on some kind of routine.  If you don't, your immune system will suffer by not getting the nourishment your body needs and the vitamins as well.  Then you must try to get your allergies under control.  See an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist for this.  Your allergies can trigger other illnesses and also cause nausea from the nasal drip, etc.  As far as the yeast infection, this was probably caused by the use of an antibiotic.  When taking antibiotics, you should try eating yogurt at that time because it can help to prevent this problem.  As far as your heart palpitations, do you consume a lot of caffeine?  This can cause that but if you don't have any caffeine, then see your general practitioner on that.  At any rate, you should probably be checked by a physician but you can try some of the above mentioned recommendations.|`|eee38ecc482b2dd0f83eabff45085cabaa	My best advice would be to share these concerns with your doctor. Take a log of your eating habits over a week, or longer, period and take it in with you. Be honest about it, it will help, and he/she won't judge.    You also may want to look into a general vitamin.

If absolutely everything is normal then one needs to consider a condition called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.  There is a national website for this condition www.cvsaonline.org  There you will find a comprehensive list of tests and conditions to be ruled out before this can be ruled in.  It may take considerable time to get to any diagnosis.  Unfortunately nausea/vomiting are pretty non specific symptoms.      Good luck.

My first time did hurt mostly at the begin because that part of your body is not used to the stretching and the blood well everyone is different personally didn'tnt bleed but if you do dont be embarrassed     the best thing to do is to RELAX!!!!! dont think about the pain just relax your body and make sure the person you are with takes it Slow and try slot of foreplay it helps alot.|`|gWSWRUAbaa	If you have to ask this question then you're probably not as ready as you think.    I wasn't scared to loose my virginity... I waited till I Was completely comfortable with the whole thing.    It didn't hurt. Felt a little uncomfortable and couldn't go very fast.  There wasnt any blood.    Actually it overall sucked. It was the guys first time too so he didn't know what he was really doing.  I didn't really feel any pleasure and it was over with in 3 minutes... A complete of a first time.  I wish I would of waited till I was more older and mature I probably would of enjoyed it much more.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	In my opinion, you will not know until you experience. I wasnt scared to LOSE (loose means something is no longer tight) my virginity..I was nervous. I always heard friends say, it hurts a lot, it didnt hurt me, it felt very uncomfortable (then again I have a high tolerance for pain). There was blood, but not a lot...kinda like a spotting from a period.|`|Nx5EiTxfaa	we're on the exact same page. i love my boyfriend, and i want to, but im havin the same problem as you.  so ive tlked to some of the girls in a grade above me and i found out...  theres only a little bit of blood and it doesnt rly get anywhere, jst mostly on his..yeah.  it depends on how big it is for how much its gona hurt. my friend tried with a guy whos 12 inches, and they couldnt do it because it wouldnt fit. if he strts out rly slow and if you can put big tampons in with no problem, you should be okay.   im a little scared too, not that im not ready or that im making a mistake..but i think it would be rly embarresing if you bleed on him =X  also, i dnt exactly knw wht to do during it.  anyways, i hope i helped you.  good luck with everything!|`|yKcZC9Dhaa	I was not scared, I did not plan on losing my virginity til I was older. I ended up in love with a boy (still am, and we're still together, happier than ever) I was 16. and It hurt so badly I thought something was wrong with me. We couldn't do it. I went to the doctor, and they told me it was all in my head. The next day we ended up doing it for real, I did not bleed, although it was uncomfortable that time, it wasn't pure pain like the first times we tried. Don't do it until you're sure you're ready, and you discuss what would happen if you did bleed, or were in pain, make sure he goes slow and kisses you. it will calm you down.|`|MHTIe6hTaa	well if your scared then your most likely not ready to loose it any time soon. Just wait till you feel ready and the right time.|`|CzAwjF76aa	You sound young. too young to be thinking about sex. You can only give this gift once.     I was scared.  It did hurt, there is a tearing feeling and a pop sensation,  yes there was blood but not too much for about 2 days.|`|DYH49qGxaa	DO NOT BELIEVE SOFIA N!!! PEOPLE LIKE HER LIVE TO SCREW ARROUND WITH OTHER PEOPLES MINDS!... it will hurt, but if u tell him to go slow, and be gentle you should be fine, luck to you|`|BVlACgFaaa	Keep Zylocaine gelly [a local anesthetic] with u. just before u engage yourself  in the coitus. If it is likely to cause any pain on penetration, apply the jelly and enjoy. otherwise, no problem. good luck to u..|`|cF236fvTaa	I'm not going to lie i was scared to, i bleed a little, and it did hurt but if he goes slow you will be fine. It will hurt the first couple times but you will get past it, just make sure you are ready. I am 15 going on 16 and lost it 7 month ago to the love of my life.|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	if youre scared then youre just not ready. once youre really ready to have sex you wont be as scared as you are now|`|YOfR18lCaa	I have to agree with Ladyhawke707. You sound way too young to even be thinking of losing your virginity.  I'm a guy and even i feel bad about even thinking of hurting someone to gain pleasure(by the way, I am still a virgin).|`|838VJJGvaa	Totally normal to be scared.  I'm waiting until I'm married, but even the very though of it is both scary and exciting.|`|hRRsnfglaa	ALL GIRLS HAD TO GO THREW IT JUST TELL HIM TO GO SLOW    BELIEVE ME MY GIRL WAS THE EXACT SAME WAY|`|Xrvutzmdaa	there will be LOTS OF BLOOD and ALOT OF SCREAMING pain i would wait if i were you|`|xT8FmGhiaa	Wait until your married.

6NZeItMAaa	What has happened in the past thirty years that has caused us to become such a nation of stressed out individuals? Is society expecting too much from us or are we expecting too much from ourselves? Why are so many people suffering from the following:    ? Anxiety disorder  ? Social anxiety disorder  ? Obsessive compulsive disorder  ? Anorexia Nervosa  ? Depression  ? Panic attacks    Years ago, no one ever even heard of these conditions, now they are featured in every magazine you encounter. There is a huge market to treat both depression and anxiety, which usually go hand in hand and are the offspring of stress.    Pharmaceutical companies are cranking out different anti-depressants all of the time. These are said to be better than the other anti-depressants that they discovered a year prior. Thirty years ago, no one ever even heard the term anti-depressant. If you used that expression back then, people would think you were talking about something to do with your car.     Today it seems as if every single person you encounter is on something for stress, depression or anxiety. All of them can neatly be lumped into the same category and are caused by stress.     Stress is usually at the root of all of the above psychological disorders. It also affects us physically as well. Stress has been linked to every disease known to man, including heart disease and cancer. Clearly, it is not a good idea for people to be under stress. But, as human beings, we are going to experience stressful situations. There is no avoiding this fact. Therefore, in order to really be able to help cure ourselves from being stressed out we need to know how to do the following:    ? Identify stressors that affect our daily lives;  ? Eliminate the stressors of which we can free ourselves;  ? Learn to deal with stressful situations in a healthy way     If you are one of the millions of people who are feeling stressed out, you must take a look at the reasons why you are stressed out and try to do what you can to eliminate as much stress as you can from your life. If you continue to be stressed out you will most likely find yourself taking some sort of prescription drug for one of the above disorders. Taking prescription drugs for stress does not mean that you are crazy" but these should be the last ressort.    Natural remedies include herbal remedies, aomatherapie, yoga and meditation, exercise, proper diet, talking about your problems with someone, etc.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I don't know how you decided that meds don't work.  Have you tried everything they have?    I was misdiagnosed w/ depression for 10 years.  I took the wrong medicine the whole time, which made it worse.    Once I found a competent doctor, I started taking anti-convulsants for bi-polar disorder and I haven't had an episode since.    I'd be willing to guess that your fighting isn't the cause, it's the effect of your mental illness.    Be well.|`|YAwvszITaa	Exercise on a regular basis is a good start. I have suffered with depression for the past 6 years and exercising 5 days a week has helped me a lot. I am now taking a natural supplement and I feel better than ever. It is great that your husband agrees to go with you to counseling you need that extra support to get through these times. I still get depressed sometimes but the exercise and supplement has helped me tremendously on my journey to happiness. I took it up because Zoloft was not working for me after a while. The withdrawal symptoms were horrible and I would never tell anyone to get on those types of meds. Getting out is a great thing to and just have fun. I do understand it is hard to do when you are feeling very low and blue but if you push past it and go have fun you will more than likely feel somewhat better.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Meds can help.  How many have you tried?  How long were you on them?  Most medications take at least 6 weeks to 8 weeks to reach full effect.  And most doctors will start you at a low dose.  You might need a higher dose or a different medication than was given to you before.    My husband has depression, anxiety with a panic disorder and has been on so many different meds trying to find a combo that works.  It's taken a good 5 years to find the right mix.  And at least 4 different psychiatrists!  Keep trying.  The counseling is great!  Eat well, get your rest and exercise is wonderful also.  Hang in there, it can get better.  If you haven't seen a psychiatrist, see if you can get a referral to one.  They specialize in dealing with illness' like you have and understand how these drugs really work and you won't have to lay on a couch and answer questions.  Most family doctors meddle in antidepressants but don't truly have the education in how they work.|`|KvyB0E77aa	It's best to work with a psychologist/psychiatrist when your feeling long term depression. Even though you feel medication does not work it depends on what the medication is and at what dosage.  It's wise that you and your husband are seeking counseling as well because  you don't want to pass this energy to your children.   Give yourself credit for the love that you and your husband have for your children and try to remember the way you both fell in love.  Most things you fight about are usually forgotten with time and aren't worth fighting over.|`|lBe1dpESaa	hmmm... sounds like it could be a situational depression.  If you are a stay at home mom you should definitely find time to spend doing what ever it is you like to do, on your own.  Being at home with the kids all the time (no matter how well behaved) can drive you BANANAS.  Somebody suggested exercise and that's not a bad idea... it should definitely give you a boost.      You're still very young... I'm am in no way condoning divorce but since you've been with the same guy since you were a young teen, it is very possible you may have chosen the wrong person or made a mistake.  Counseling will help with that situation and give you some clarity... just make sure you don't argue in front of the kids.  You'd be surprised at what a young mind can remember and how it can negatively affect them for the rest of their lives....     Try and think of an activity you enjoy and make it a point to take some time for yourself to do it... Might I suggest salsa dancing?  :)      Whatever happens, good luck.  Try to keep an open mind and take care of yourself as well, because after all, you should stay healthy so you can watch your kids grow up.|`|f2hfuMKFaa	exercise regularly|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	Try exercise and getting outside. Sunlight is really good for you and exercise relieves stress. Try running, runners get something called a runners high that's great.|`|lJYvGLKLaa	Whatever you do, DO NOT go on Effexor. My boyfriend is just getting off of it. it made his depression ten times worse and it has awful withdrawl symptoms.    Counseling really helped me. Perhaps try looking up some herbal remedies?|`|ZVGGAO62aa	i think you should go somewhere beautiful and somewhere you can be alone maybe somewhere outdoors also maybe a hobbie or sport that can keep you competitive and occupied|`|QtII0R54aa	Try to get out and be more active. Go to a gym and take some fun classes (exercise produces endorphins that make you feel good) or join a book club or something (it's interesting and social). Get involved through community service maybe. Anything that makes you active and gives you things to look forward to are better than relying on medication or trying to "sleep it off".|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	You are moving in the right direction.  Depression is bad isn't it.  People don't understand.  They think all you have to do is to smile and it goes away.    Counseling is good.  Find a way to stop arguing with your husband.  That is bad for you and the kids.    Try to do something positive for your self.  Start back to school and get a degree or take art class.  Do something that will make you feel good about yourself.    Good luck|`|HBWPA8rEaa	It's a battle you are making the right step altho I only had counseling for myself as it was most of my hang ups causing problems .   It'll take time but maybe things like starting a diary writing down how you feel about things . Sounds simple but counting your blessings to remind yourself of how lucky you are compared to some . It also depends on the root of problem mine came from child hood , bullying and attitudes of parents growing up . take it one day at a time try eat right , sleep well and exercise helps too . Hope you feel better soon , good luck .|`|qz8z8DC6aa	I used to be very depressed myself, almost suicidal. I started seeing the school counsellor out of pure coincidence, and I ended up stopping to write in my diary. When I left school, I started writing again. It's a really good outlet. I refuse to be put on meds, and I keep myself from falling back into that pit. I can honestly say I have never been happier. I still sometimes feel it coming on, but you gotta make a concious decision to stop this. It's a sickness, I understand, but it's all in your head. You have the power to pull yourself out, if not for you do it for your kids. My dad survived serious cancer by positive thinking, after going off chemo (which wasn't recommended). I live by his example now. Just do it. Don't look for a way. Just do it. It's like quitting smoking.|`|CRsSw0ssaa	Masterbate.|`|fe37gfRvaa	what is exactly depressing you?
uoxvfZz7aa	you have an eating disorder. Try a healthy diet and a good exercise regimen you will stick to.|`|5yq9R52Eaa	Yes, you certainly do have an eating disorder and need to get medical attention to help you deal with it.  To go for two weeks without eating is crazy and can do horrible things to your body.  At 117 pounds you were not fat.  Instead of trying to crash diet, step up your activities and try to eat good healthy food, stay away from fried foods and white sugar and white flour.  That is the way to stay at a healthy weight and still be nourishing your body.  Talk to someone about it, a friend or family member.|`|7YdYYpLZaa	yes|`|CdLXkCnVaa	just eat what you wanna eat, most of the time when i look at girls i think, the skinnyer they are the more likley they are to be bulimic or whatever, it just doesnt look healty
XYSy9Y9Uaa	Don't ignore that your symptoms are not normal, Tequila is right this could be a serious issue and only a doctor could tell you what you have after they have done tests, a simple blood test could eliminate or pinpoint what is wrong. Hyperthyroidism has the signs that you have mentioned but it also has other symptoms as well, but what it sounds like and what it is, could be two different things, anyone can presume what might be wrong but without tests you won't know and you could be leaving something untreated that medication could help. Good Luck and go to your friendly doctor and see what they have to say ;-)|`|uoxvfZz7aa	Please see a Dr. Don't leave your questions of such a serious issue up to the Russian roulette of a web base answering system.
9huxAcK9aa	Playtex Gentle Glide! They rock!  They glide very gently ( Hence the name )  But try different brands.  Everyone is different.  You may like playtex, tampax, kotex ( Why do they all end in x...?) And comfort, size, and price may be important.   But remember, tampons are *Heaven* compared to pads!    Good Luck    :-)    ~Summer|`|4qvvHTGLaa	well for beginnners Platex Gentle Glide works good, but thats for lighter flows, there easier to put in. Tampax maxi is good for looser down theres, and there more absorbant|`|t1rn1jDBaa	i like the pads but i really dont know y they just work|`|9tJq8OXXaa	i personally like "tampax cardboard"...i know..it doesnt sound comfy AT ALL but ive NEVER had a leak or any problems whatsoever...    im a very active athlete and whenever i have my period i use this particular brand and have never had any problems..even during hard running sessions, jumping, agility ladders, lifting, sprinting...etc.|`|yzEC5O6gaa	i use playtex gentil glide and playtex sport.    try each brand and see witch one you like the best or get some samples or ask one from your friend. but its whatever you like the best.    :)
UOZP4Ma5aa	It does not have an influence on it, makes it hot maybe due to muscles working
IMPvzBk1aa	If there is bruising it could be a fracture, which would have to be xrayed to diagnose.  I would do that, just to be sure.|`|UmdPAqataa	Stress fractures are usually overuse injuries that result from repetitive micro-trauma to the bone, eventually freaking it down until you experience a fracture.  It usually doesn't break the whole bone, just a spot.    The pain progression is usually as follows:  -Pain after activity  -Pain with activity  -Pain with walking  -Pain all the time    Does this sound familiar?      It can be a tough injury to diagnose though, because it's hard to x-ray, but definitely worth a shot if you think it could be a stress fracture.  The reason that it's hard to x-ray is, that a lot of the time, a stress fracture doesn't show up on X-ray until it's started to heal (2-3 weeks later).    Good luck.
fAcVndo7aa	You need to moisten the gauze to get it to come off.  Soak it in water (distilled or sterile would be best) or saline solution, or pour some over it.    If you have a problem with the gauze sticking, try special non-stick gauze or use an ointment or cream (if your doc approves, of course).      As the wound heals, if the gauze sticks to it, when you remove the gauze by "ripping it off" like someone suggested, you can actually take off a few layers of the new skin your body is trying to grow to heal the wound.  So whatever you do, if it's stuck, keep trying to moisten it and get it to come off without pulling at the wound.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	1 DO NOT POUR ALCOHOL IN YOUR WOUND........... It will burn like hell and you will be crying in pain,   2. Pour a little water or saline solution on the gauze and wait about 30 seconds, it will come right off.  I do it all the time for my patients.|`|a8UX1tHLaa	This is what I would do:::  try putting ice on it for a while to numb it. Then rip it off, "Like a band-aid!" Then put more ice on it so u wont feel anything. Or if you want, you can rip it off slowly between the ice. Your choice.
PAvYZJK2aa	i would say a large one|`|0x4MpgCNaa	dud u got a chode???  u mean 6 inches around?  aahah well it depends wat brand condem  and uh try a medium and if it hurts go large but i wouldnt start large with 7 inches  im 13 and mines 8 but last year i tried a large trojan lubed and my penis was 7 inches and it was a little too big|`|E64juLwJaa	All sizes are good.One fits all is good already  If you think that is to tight :buy bigger ones  Planets|`|fnXITOVnaa	Well, I'm actually about the same size... Awkward... haha. But I could not use normal condoms.. They were way too uncomfortable for me. I just tried out Trojan Magnums this weekend ( HEE ) and they were totally perfect! That's what I'd try dude. It's the right size for you. Have fun : ) Let me also say that condoms have absolutely NOTHING to do with length. It's all about width. That's the only reason it shouldn't fit. Good luck!|`|mJOLjVaTaa	i agree with the above post
ERjGLJaEaa	I had a small mole like that that was skin colored and it looked kinda the same. They just did it right there in the office. They put a needle in it to numb it and then cut it out. I did have 2 small stitches, but it was painless and I don't even have a scar.|`|Xbw7lR9Uaa	no they can laser it off|`|3lEMNFFzaa	Possibly, but go to a dermatolgist.  Most general physicians won't mess with it, as it needs to be ascertained that it is non-cancerous.  Ask your regular doc about it, and he can either do it, or refer you to a doctor who can.|`|JEXiKUmGaa	Yes a doctor could remove a mole like that, but if don't want to go to the doctor there is something you can try. Dermatend, I have used it on several moles that were on my body, and everyone is now gone. One of them was even gone in 5 days.    Personally I don't like doctor offices so I needed another method, and this method came with a 100% guarantee. I could use it at home, and only natural ingredients were in it's formula. Give it try, I am sure you will have the same results as me.
uoxvfZz7aa	you're using your cell phone too much, pretty soon the teeth in the left side of your mouth are going to start to crumble and you're going to get migraines. Try using a land line as much as possible.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If it's a definite high-pitched tone, then it's tinitis. This can be caused by excessive exposure to loud sounds or just listening fatigue (like using headphones for a long time). There is no cure for it. You just wait for it to subside.    Sometimes you can get a bit of swelling in your inner ear closing your eustachian tubes, causing distortion that sounds like an audible buzz. This especially happens when you get a cold and your sinuses get stuffy. Sometimes you can clear the problem by pinching your nose shut and blowing out through your nose. The pressure equalizes your eustachian tubes and clears your ears. You might also have to yawn to fully clear them.    But, if it is because of sinus problems or even an ear infection, it either won't clear or it will soon plug back up. An antihistimine and ibuprofen would help.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Try using you right ear. You may be using too much volume which can lead to tinnitus which is a non stop ringing.|`|BNpIvD2Haa	probably tinitis.  try using your phone in the other ear and just generally avoid loud noises for a few days. it it carries on go to a doctor or somewhere they do hearing tests.|`|7d2ed527dde89c1fc1c143c96fcb64e7aa	It is called Tinnitus. It has lots of causes. Many of them not serious.  I used to get it after leaving clubs, concerts or when I had an upper respiratory infection.  You have over stimulated your eardrum. See an ENT to find out if there is an infection or something more serious.    Lower your cell phone volume.
b3JKcQXGaa	Yes, it is basically depression after giving birth, it's a hard thing because it's believed to be caused by hormones going wacko after pregnancy. During pregnancy, a woman's progesterone hormones are increased, and this maybe interfers with seratonin levels between synapses on Neurons, which is believed to cause depression. Sorry, that didn't make much sense! ha! But yeah, it's basically depression that randomly shows up after pregnancy, and it usually goes away within a few months to a year. Family doctors treat it a lot.|`|Xrvutzmdaa	YEA its when you just have a baby and are really sensative to EVERYTHING  my mom had it lol|`|sbMrAt96aa	right after having a baby......  the mother is having so many changes in her body,  some women cry others get sad & depressed & are all upset.....for others it's not a big deal......      the woman's body changes so much....... my wife went thru that,  with no problems at all, but her sister was a @itch!!!  & wrecked her marriage of 11 yrs.....      it's odd.  some women can deal with the changes, when others can't.
qnD5RfbPaa	Proteins are the main nutrition for muscle production.  This you obtain from peas, beans, grains, meats, fish and other sea foods, nut, seeds, milk and other dairy products.    However for proper metabolism of proteins as well as enhancing its absorption, other nutrients are needed. It follows then that eating other foods such as fresh raw fruits, vegetables (both cooked and uncooked, whereby most is eaten raw), complex carbohydrates such as yams, potatoes, dasheen, green banana, breadfruits, pumpkin and cassava are essential.    Water is also important for proper metabolism of protein - 8 - 10 eight ounce glasses per day is recommended.  Also water will help to make your cells plump.    If your cells are plump and you are producing muscles, then you will not be looking skinny.|`|55vTVIxnaa	you would have to eat more..most probably like eating bars..:) hope it helps! :) all the best!! hope you get your hopeful weight and size! =D  all the best!|`|l1BNyWjcaa	EAT EAT EAT healthy foods the carbs and protein are probably the best ???
sQu3LLqtaa	An athletic body means a muscular physique.  Lean but strong with plenty of muscles.
WXpdkbG8aa	Of course. Vomit contains stomach acid which eats away at your esophageal lining. It won't have any long term effects unless you throw up on a daily basis. People with bulimia can permanently destroy their esophagus but in your case, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just drink some milk to coat your throat and make the pain go away.|`|BMConIedaa	Yes.  Stomach bile is a corrosive chemical.  It can damage your esophagus.  It can wear down your teeth.  You don't want to make yourself through up unless you need to get something poisonous out of your stomach.|`|ASkz2SCDaa	Yes, throwing up (and whats contained) definitely can causes microscopic tears in your throat, and also includes bile (stomach acid) which eats away at your esophagus.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Absolutely.. vomit has stomach acid in it which is going up your throat to come out of your mouth. It will irritate the lining of your throat|`|55vTVIxnaa	yes, in fact, it would also lead to problems in the stomach..just like whenever you vomit unintentionally, your throat will feel dry..and also, try not to vomit..people might think you are bulimic :(    all the best!
0lCnu1g2aa	Go to nursing school for 2-4 yrs for RN and take a standardized test called NCLEX which is boards and pass to get your RN license. LPN school is about 1 yr and they also take a test, but make less money. Go for RN and 4yrs for a Bachelors, best way to go in my opinion|`|DJZ801yvaa	Learn to see naked people every day and not have a conscious about it.
oL0fEZCAaa	Absolutely NOT! Don't take the risk. Water in your laundry is very dirty and full of germs. They may stick on your case even you didn't open it. However, when you open it with your fingers, they will stick on your fingers. So get a new case is better|`|87eb684fab2ff098fb0b8c07acb6badcaa	Don't take the chance!  Just because the case was closed doesn't mean that the soap didn't get in there.  Plus, there may still be soap in the threads of the case.  Once the case is opened, the soap may end up in the solution.  If the soap does somehow get into your eyes, it will hurt like the dickins!  Why risk it.  If they are disposable, get rid of them.  If not, rinse several times in contact lens solution.
iqGaNZTtaa	Believe me, your endocrinologist knows what he's doing, and high metanephrines, VMA, etc have nothing to do with an infection.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	Have you talked to your family doctor? He can recommend you to a good specialized doctor that can help you figure this out! Good Luck! But yes an endo. could prob. help but most of them need referals from your doctor.
N3iaUGMaaa	Why is this in Men's health?|`|mJOLjVaTaa	$29.99 plus tax|`|5sSjx4GXaa	It is around $200.00, but your insurance will cover it. This is just the average though, it can be a little more or less.    http://www.costhelper.com/cost/child/ult...
deYDbVDSaa	If they had directly hit a nerve, you would have crapped yourself. It is not an unnoticed event. The feeling would be about the same as when you hit your funny bone (which is actually a nerve) really hard.
l9a8sFT7aa	It is perfectly normal. I was 5 ft 9 when I was 13 so I can relate. There is nothing wrong with being tall.|`|a59796a93e9118b10a4496b3195421eaaa	It depends on the person. But, you aren't too tall even if it is unusual. Strive to be different. Being average might be great in junior high school and senior high school, but being different is important once you enter the real world.    I was about 5'3" at 13 (as a boy). I topped out at 6'7" in my early 20s. Being tall is a good thing.|`|aCLqYRtEaa	well it is a bit tall|`|dXakOyjUaa	No, that is perfectly normal. I jumped from 5'2" to 5'6" in seventh grade, then hit 5'8" in eighth. I stopped growing in ninth, when I reached 5'9". I know a lot of girls who have had the same experience. One of my best friends (a girl) is 6'1"!|`|e2NnCljfaa	no its not weird cause i know this girl who was 6'2 when she was 13 its just you must have tall genes
u8CFwtyMaa	80% of adult men are between 5 and 6.5 inches, so you are already there, with a possible 2 years of growth left, so you don't need anything to help it grow.  Check out the website below.

Size doesn't really matter what is important is the you know what you are doing and width is also a factor.|`|VqJ9SUScaa	there isn't really any real way to increase your penis size. the average man is 5 inches long. it's not  all about the length b.c the avg woman is 5 inches deep. pretty cool huh? it's girth and moving the way you both enjoy it.

This helps you focus which fights the concussion.    2: When you get tired from your work take a nap. You need to be able to let your body heal the concussion, sleep as soon as you can for as long as you can.|`|hoDin3UYaa	You should not see a doctor tomorrow, you should see one right now.

Jswomud7aa	Your wisdom tooth will more than likely tilt forward at an angle instead of coming into perfect alignment where your other one used to be, unless you have braces to pull it forward properly.    If you have a root canal and crown you will more than likely get a good 10-20 years (depending on oral hygiene) out of that tooth. Sometimes longer if you have a really good dentist.    I never recommend extracting a tooth unless there is a monetary issue. It is ALWAYS better to keep the teeth you have if they are fixable. Once a tooth is pulled, it's gone forever.    Also, there is no guarantee your wisdom tooth will move forward anyways, it's just a guess. It might not, then you have a large space back there and trust me, that is annoying... try eating steak with a hole where a molar should be... not fun.    It's better to just fix the tooth if you have the cash. Once you start pulling teeth, it's all just down hill from there.|`|kgczgM3Raa	Teeth almost always move forward, toward the center; it's rare for them to move backwards.  So, it really shouldn't affect the teeth in front of it - however, the tooth that opposes it could erupt down into the hole that is left.
QXPVUxoDaa	I think all teenagers feel like that the majority of the time. just reminder that the other boys in your class probable feel the same way, and the girls probable feel worst. High-schooll is like a big popularity contest that you have to attend. But when your out of school, popularity means nothing. Just focus on your education, cause in 7 yrs you will look different, have different friends, so you should get the best out of school, an education the only thing that sticks.   I guess the best way to come out of your shell is to put it all out there. Be yourself, it is always good enough, and let everyone know who you are. Be true. express you opinions, show your personality and don't blend in, out shine.|`|XYz3EitWaa	I'm the same exact way. I'm really insecure about myself..Later on I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety, and got counseling..    Though if you participate in things, (like i joined band) people get to know you and like you.|`|0SEL8A0zaa	Well try and keep looking for a very nice person and just go for it! Surround yourself with trustworthy and nice people and make sure to smile at people! That should probably get you started. You will know what to do once you get started!|`|K8kmbxZVaa	What matters if your self is good enough for you. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks as long as you please yourself. No, not everyone thinking bad things about you.|`|XNMw2hpraa	You're fifteen. That's completely normal if you've had two girlfriends. I know normal people that didn't date until they were older than that. There's a lot of pressure on teens today, in all areas.  Sometimes low self esteem tends to be part of being a teenager (not that it doesn't suck).   It's okay to be introverted to an extent, but if you want to be more social, that's okay too. If you think it's something more since it's affected your social life, as you say, try going to http://psychcentral.com/ . They have assessments and you can look up information about different things. These cannot replace or even stand next to assessments done by professional counselors done in an in person session. They may just be what you need to decide whether you should or should not seek help. There are a lot of other great online resources about mental health too. Just don't feel like there is something wrong with you. You may be feeling the burn of cruel people. It's hard to fit in. It's hard to be yourself.  Just know that a lot of other people feel the same way you do, but may keep it to themselves. Find something to do that you enjoy, sing in choir, play an instrument in a band, a theater class, or a club that does fun community service work. You'll meet people who have the same interests as you.  Know that the teenage years are a hard time for mostly everyone whether they are willing to remember that or not, and you can make it through. Good luck. You don't have to be perfect, ever. Just try to be you.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	You have to realize other people are no better or worse than you. They are human with frailties even though they may act Superior. You give them too much credit because you are young. You should concentrate on learning because this will make you confident and happy in the future. Learn to ignore anyone who would put you down or disrupt your quest. You have only on time as a youth to learn.
iMryjx0Yaa	Well this really depends on the strenth of the Percocet. They come in varying strengths; 10/325, 10/650, 2.5/325, 5/325, 7.5/325 and 7.5/500. The first number is mg (miligrams) of oxycodone, which is the main ingredient for pain relief in Percocet (as well as OxyContin). The second number is acetaminophen a.k.a. APAP.    Typical recomended dosing can be anywhere from 2.5mg to 15mg. Dosing for recreational effects are typically 7.5mg to 40mg (NOTE: high doeses such as 40mg are only used by those who have tolerance to opiates and should not be attempted by the unexperienced)    So to answer your question, effects from Percocet, depending on dosage and tolerance can last from about 2 hours to 5 hours after initial effects. 2 hours would be a small or recomended dose, 5 hours could be a recreational dose.     11 Percocets as mentioned in the song could either be a relatively safe dose for a first time user, a relatively safe dose for an experienced user, an extremley dangerous dose for a first time user, or even an extremley dangerous dose for a well seasoned user.     If he took 11 2.5mg pills, thats 27.5mg, which could be considered safe. However if he took 11 10mg pills, thats probably enough to overdose and die.    Also, take into acount the amount of APAP in each pill. Doses of about 2,000mg at once can be considered toxic to the liver, and the FDA's maximun daily dose (mdd) is 4,00mg.    In Conclusion:  Standard dose: 2 hours  Medium dose: 2-3 hours  High dose: 3-5 hours|`|KKPya8Zzaa	about 8 houers tops

But if you want me to be nice to you I will. To get weed you need to know a person called a 'dealer' and you get it from him/her (sometimes you might have gain the dealer's trust). But knowing how pathetic you are you might just be retarded enough and pay $80 for a dime of ditch weed and a pipe made out of toilet paper rolls.|`|UmcMfBvjaa	Just go around and look 4 someone who looks like they smoke but you can never be sure because we all look different.

A nickel is 5$,a dime is 10$, a 20 is obviously 20$, and a quarter is 25$, and a oz could be from 60$ 2 300$ depending on quality.

t9Nw86Plaa	It depends on your lifestyle.     The pill is good if you are organised and can remember to take a pill at the same time each day. The shot is good if you only want to take a one-off dose every few months, and aren't shy about getting injections.     BOTH the pill and the shot have side effects (yes, including weight gain!) but side effects vary for different women; so even if your friends gain more weight on the shot than on the pill, it doesn't mean that you will (you may even not gain weight on either of them).     I recommend going with whatever you feel most comfortable with, and if, after a few months, you are experiencing unacceptable side effects, you are perfectly free to switch.|`|JV445FR9aa	they are alot more risk with the shot than the pills... i personally am on pills... and yes it can be hard to remember... so what i do is put a reminder on my phone that goes off at the same time each day... i carry them with me just in case i forget.... and i always right myself little notes on like my fridge that way i make sure not to forget... once you consantly start reminding yourself.. you are less likely to forget...     now... back to the risk... when you get the shot... it can take over a year for your period to go back to its normal track once you decide to stop taking it... it's bad for your bones... there's weight gain... irregular bleeding... and it's only 97% effective...    pills... it only takes a month or two to get back on track... their is possible weight gain... my pill actually helps maintain my weight... it's 99% effective... and irregular bleeding doesn't happen nearly as often as the depo.. it only normally happens like the first month!    hoped that helped!    : )|`|iyzQawWFaa	i'm on the shot, i heard you gain weight, i haven't noticed anything, everyone online says they hate it but me and my friends love it    and i never have periods anymore ;)|`|j6xDeydyaa	I have have been on the pill. and now i am on the shot.    With the pill.. I expierenced no weight gain. my face didnt clear up. and my period went crazy.    But i've been on the depo-provera shot for a year now. And i've read a lot of things of this shot. Its just as effective as tubal ligation (getting your tubes tied) so 97% effective is a complete lie.    I have only had 3 periods this year. and my face is clear.    I wont lie to you. I did gain 30 pounds after about 6 months. But if you eat right and exercise regularly you shouldnt have a problem.  The shot is effective for 10 months after you stop getting it. and your period will slowly go back to normal during that 10 months.    I prefer the shot. But read up on both and decide whats best for you.|`|sf97BiDLaa	The shot has a 50/50 chance of you bleeding the entire time you are on it or not bleeding...low and behold I bled the entire time  last year.Then we tried the pills which I think are great but they gave me extra high blood pressure! So I had to beeeeeeg the doctor for an IUD!Finally after 4 years they gave me one!YEAH!!! The thing is they usually don't do it unless you have 1child. Well I don't have those either so they only gave me a 1 year one:( but so far so good!!!

Its entirely your choice mate, its got nothing to do with your parents as its you that has to go out with them and as invisalign is almost invisable i'd prefer to wear them than permanent train tracks! It doesn't even have anything to with them if they're paying for them, ie: privately because you'd qualify to have them under the NHS! Invisalign is the new way with braces and have amazing success, the old train tracks are too out-dated by far! If your mum and dad want them let them wear them!!!|`|JGtwyi9Kaa	My orthodontist, one of the Premier invisalign orthos in the state of NY does not recommend them unless you are an adult.    They do not move your teeth as well, and your teeth have a higher ability to move out of place when you are done with your treatment.

Thoughts necessary or fashionable, those which refer to  our daily routine, for example: what is what I will put today to go to work?    Useless thoughts, those which do not have constructive utility. They are things of the past which one cannot change any more, as what one could have made if one had done this or that. Or of the thoughts about  the future, as what I one will do if These thoughts, even if they are not negative, empty us of our interior force and tire us.    Negative or destructive thoughts, they are most pernicious because they cause the loss of our peace and interior force. They are founded on irritability, desire, envy, etc.  They may be passed, present or future and they can become obsessives.     Positive thoughts, Are those which bring to us a benefit in all the situations. To think positively does not want to say that we are unaware of reality around us. That comprises to find solutions. They mean acceptance, not resignation.

It can be accomplished manually, which means using your own hand, or by the use of objects or tools. There are some people, particularly women, that can only achieve orgasm through masterbation and not through sexual intercourse. This is why you need to learn specific masterbating techniques that can be enjoyable and you can use often during sex or alone.    There are numerous masterbation techniques for men and women that will give you different feelings, or different orgasm outcomes. Male masterbation techniques range from the full fist grip to the more uncommon pole straddling masterbating technique. The full fist grip is the most basic and common masterbating technique that men use. All of the fingers and your thumb are wrapped around the penis and using an up and down motion you will eventually reach orgasm. Some vary this technique by using just the forefinger and thumb. This is particularly helpful if you have a sensitive penis area.    Here are some other techniques that men can try:    The Mushroom  when you hold your penis upright with one hand and gently rub the head with the other hand in a circular motion. Lubrication should be used.      The Campfire Method  Just think of rubbing a stick together to start a fire, and use that back and forth motion on your penis. Lubrication should be used.      The Backhanded masterbation  At first this may seem awkward, but you simply turn your hand around and use your index finger to stimulate parts you never knew you had.      The Interlocking Grip  Locking your hands together and move up and down to stimulate orgasm. Lubrication is recommended.      There are others that will be explained later, but those are four that you can start practicing with. Female masterbating techniques are a bit more varied and are quite numerous. They are influenced by a number of factors such as stroking or rubbing the clitoris, use of vibrators with the rubbing, and other objects or movements that can add additional excitement.    Here are some of the most popular female masterbation techniques:    Riding the Floor  Lie on the floor facing down, press your pubic bone to the floor, while rocking your body as if you are trying to crawl.      Making Up  Taking a makeup brush, making sure it is clean and dry, and then use the fine bristles to stimulate the clitoris and the inner lips. You can also use a medium size paint brush or feathers.      Deep Penetration  Insert a finger deep in the vagina and place your other hand directly on the back of the hand that is inside. Hold tight and press your finger in while using your thumb to stimulate your clitoris.      Simple and Multiple  Simply take your finger and in a soothing motion rub gently around the hood of your clitoris. It is sensual and leads to multiple orgasms.      The best masterbation techniques are the ones that make you feel the most comfortable and give you the most pleasure. You should be daring and try as many as you see because ultimately you may find one specific technique that blows your mind.|`|K4zsztkRaa	male 101    -Connor|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	sit on your hand. let it fall asleep. then go at it.    haha have fun!|`|TsFG4zLmaa	GET A GIRLFRIEND......OR BOYFRIEND?????|`|kZL1FSanaa	get a girlfriend|`|0oMiJGBNaa	dude if you dont have some1 to do it with its not worth doing|`|CdLXkCnVaa	sit on ur hand till it falls asleep and then pretend someone else is doing it :P

Alli     The rest are LIES Flat out LIES    They are allowed to lie thanks to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (Thanks Hippies! You screwed us all!)    Regulation:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Sup...  United States  In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994[2] (DSHEA) as a product that is intended to supplement the diet and contains any of the following dietary ingredients:    a vitamin   a mineral   an herb or other botanical (excluding tobacco)   an amino acid   a dietary substance for use by people to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or   a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the above   Furthermore, it must also conform to the following criteria:    intended for ingestion in pill, capsule, tablet, powder or liquid form not represented for use as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet labeled as a "dietary supplement"     The hormones DHEA (a steroid), pregnenolone (also a steroid) and the pineal hormone melatonin are marketed as dietary supplements in the US.[3][4]      Regulation  Pursuant to the DSHEA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements as foods, and not as drugs. While pharmaceutical companies are required to obtain FDA approval proving the safety or effectiveness of their products prior to their entry into the market, dietary supplements, like food, do not need to be pre-approved by FDA before they can enter the market.[5]    Dietary supplement manufacturers will, however, be required by June 2010 to ensure that all production of dietary supplements must comply with current good manufacturing practices, and be manufactured with "controls that result in a consistent product free of contamination, with accurate labeling."[6] In addition, the industry is now required to report to the FDA "all serious dietary supplement related adverse events."    The DSHEA, passed in 1994, was the subject of lobbying efforts by the manufacturers of dietary supplements.[7][8] At the time of its passage DSHEA received strong support from consumer grassroots organizations, and Members of Congress. In recognition of this, President Bill Clinton, on signing DSHEA into law, stated that "After several years of intense efforts, manufacturers, experts in nutrition, and legislators, acting in a conscientious alliance with consumers at the grassroots level, have moved successfully to bring common sense to the treatment of dietary supplements under regulation and law." He also noted that the passage of DSHEA "speaks to the diligence with which an unofficial army of nutritionally conscious people worked democratically to change the laws in an area deeply important to them" and that "In an era of greater consciousness among people about the impact of what they eat on how they live, indeed, how long they live, it is appropriate that we have finally reformed the way Government treats consumers and these supplements in a way that encourages good health."[9]    Popular support may have been based on a misunderstanding of the situation after the deregulation of the supplement industry. A large survey by the AARP, for example, found that 77% of respondents (including both users and non-users of supplements) believed that the federal government should review the safety of dietary supplements and approve them before they can be marketed to consumers.[10] In an October 2002 nationwide Harris poll, 59% of respondents believed that supplements had to be approved by a government agency before they could be marketed; 68% believed that supplements had to list potential side effects on their labels; and 55% believed that supplement labels could not make claims of safety without scientific evidence. All of these beliefs were incorrect as a result of provisions of the DSHEA.[11]    A 2001 study, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, found broad public support for greater governmental regulation of dietary supplements than was currently permitted by DSHEA. The researchers found that a majority of Americans supported pre-marketing approval by the FDA, increased oversight of harmful supplements, and greater scrutiny of the truthfulness of supplement label claims.[12]      Permissible claims  The claims that a dietary supplement makes are essential to its classification. If a dietary supplement claims to cure, mitigate, or treat a disease, it would be considered to be an unauthorized new drug and in violation of the applicable regulations and statutes. As the FDA states it in a response to this question in a FAQ:    Is it legal to market a dietary supplement product as a treatment or cure for a specific disease or condition?  No, a product sold as a dietary supplement and promoted on its label or in labeling* as a treatment, prevention or cure for a specific disease or condition would be considered an unapproved--and thus illegal--drug. To maintain the product's status as a dietary supplement, the label and labeling must be consistent with the provisions in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994.  *Labeling refers to the label as well as accompanying material that is used by a manufacturer to promote and market a specific product.    Dietary supplements are permitted to make structure/function claims. These are broad claims that the product can support the structure or function of the body (e.g., "glucosamine helps support healthy joints", "the hormone melatonin helps establish normal sleep patterns").

It won't really work all that well, you'd probably do just as well smoking cigarettes (and I'm not being facetious-- that really will work probably just as well!)  One method that I've used (in addition to exercise) is eating a little bit of food that has live cultures in it each time I eat a meal.

I lost 20 pounds, it clearly does work!
OLl4HEAzaa	theres a good chance that you could do that. If not the whole 20lbs a good portion of that could be obtainable. The key is to burn more calories than you take in. Find out how many calories you burn a day at weightwatchers.com then subtract the amount you take in. whatevers left is what your burning. A pound of fat has 3500 calories.|`|hPJzXNwYaa	No, you won't.  Sorry... but without protein, you're not going to lose the weight, and you're going to feel exhausted and moody.  Add healthy protein to this diet (maybe turkey, fish, or eggs), and you'll lose any weight you're supposed to lose (although doesn't really sound like you're overweight now...).  Also, don't let anybody fool you into thinking you're going to lose that much weight in 2-3 weeks!!  If you lose weight that fast, you'll instantly gain it back.  Be sure your eating and exercising habits are maintainable as a lifestyle, not an extreme crash diet!  Here's my advice: eat a good variety of real food (made from ingredients, not a box), in reasonable portions, and exercise a reasonable amount.  It's not an exciting, dramatic diet, but it'll work and you'll still look great when you're old!|`|5ae1beef8e47339abfbcd9e8002ffd45aa	honestly 110 is the perfect weight for 5'2    you might lose it. i've tried that similar diet and lost pounds so fast and then... gained it all back. it sucks    good luck though|`|DXJ6Ws8oaa	yeah you could lose it like that but thats really unhealthy.

At a friend's suggestion, I went to see a Dermatologist that deals specifically with people of color. This was the first doctor to diagnose me with Rosacea. After my diagnosis, I began to rely on a tube of Cortisone cream - not only did it calm the itchiness, but it cleared up the redness of my skin. I carry a tube in my purse, and leave a tube in my car - I never know when a flare up will occur.    I now pay attention to detergents and other things placed near my skin, and try to avoid drinking wine. I rarely see the tiny bumps appear, and my redness has almost disappeared. Try removing fragrances and harsh detergents/lotions from your regime - and try a tube of Cortisone to calm those outbreaks.

f10b86c5a98cadb4deecb61e3db7b3fbaa	you're doing great, just maybe up the exercise every week. for example now do running for 15 mins... next week or week after or whenever you're feeling like its getting easy do running for 20 mins... also maybe try taking some yoga classes, it makes you longer and leaner and helps you stand tall and build self-confidence.    also try doing swimming... it's a great way to burn calories (if you're worried about how you look in a bathing suit you can wear one that's much more covering until you feel comfortable again, and if you just do laps at the YMCA or something nobody's gonna see you except other people doing laps who really don't care how you look in a bikini anyway) and gives you nice, lean muscles.    your diet's great, but think in terms of small portions and eating little snacks throughout the day, that helps speed up your metabolism. for example, in a day you can have breakfast, a small snack, lunch, a small snack, dinner, and tea time like you're doing, and that would be great. just make sure everything is healthy like you're doing. congratulations for cutting out all the junk food =)    for the tea you drink, green tea speeds up your metabolism to help you burn calories faster.    don't worry, you will get to the place you want to be. set a goal for yourself and just keep doing what you're doing until you reach that goal. maybe talk to your doctor for more ideas. but don't go over the top with all this dieting. obsessing about your figure shouldn't take over your life. just stay healthy, exercise at least 3-4 times a week, and you'll look great for the beach this summer.|`|s03QBvp2aa	That sounds like a pretty sensible solution, exercise and eating healthy.  Before you start anything like a diet and exercise plan, you may want to check with your doctor first, in case you have any other health issues, and you may want to get his/her opinion on it as well.  They are educated in that area, and they can give some good guidelines on what type of diet/exercise is needed for your age/height.

It's great to get rid of the soda and the junk food but you want to be eating plenty of the good stuff to keep your metabolism high.    Exercise is essential, even as little as 10-15 minutes 3X/week will help, all the way up to an hour a day every single day, but i wouldn't do more than that. too much exercise is bad    Also don't be afraid to do a little strength training, it will tone your body making it look better. Also it burns calories and your muscles will burn even more calories recovering from your workout. I've heard that a good strength training session will burn like 500 calories and your muscles will burn another 500 just from recovery.
uHcGn3Yaaa	I understand what you mean about wanting there to be a legitimate reason for having the pain in your leg.  One that is some magical explanation.  But think about it....you were hit near the ankle by a varsity pitcher.  The ankle and that area is very bony, you may have a bruise on your bone.  While it's not something horrible, it is a good cause for the pain.  I'm not gonna say anything about you wanting more pain...but just think about the fact that it's basically just a bump or a bruise.|`|3jQ2nb6saa	maybe something is really wrong with it. You should go to the doctor anyway and check it out. Maybe you are hurt worse than you think. Believe me, you don't want it to have to be in a cast or surgery, because it could really mess your season up.

Jswomud7aa	Honestly, no, the night-guard in the store would be sufficient.

My hubby had the lab make a night-guard for me and it's so big and bulky I don't wear it. He gives me grief for it, but it's so distracting having this thing in my mouth i can't sleep! lol    Because your insurance doesn't cover the night-guard and you have to pay out of pocket for it don't be afraid to negotiate the price with your dentist.

The organism that causes yeast infection is found naturally the gyn tracts.  There is some association in hormone state and yeast infection, specifically some change in hormone state (ie. pregnancy, birth control pills, hormone replacements, etc.) can cause change in natural flora balance and allow for the over growth of the yeast.  Another common one is antibiotics usage which kills the bacterial part of the flora allowing the yeast to over grow.|`|WtQIg0UKaa	Pregnancy can cause yeast infection, thongs(and similar underwear), tight pants, not changing tampon/pad enough during the day, not cleaning properly, sex(condoms), certain medications, diet, and a change in hormones(so if you are young this is very likely).

IbhTQMWZaa	Duration is one of the great challenges for many young men.  I like to say that when we are young, the male is wound so tight he climaxes almost instantly; the female is so tight she takes for ever to relax enough to climax.  It's the way the two systems are built.  The average amount of time spent during sex will vary widely depending on who you believe, even among credible sources. Some research cites a length of time between 3 and 10 minutes, others are anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, and then there are those who claim the time frame is much lower, at around 2 minutes. The difficulty in getting consistent information is that the time interval is not always clearly defined (e.g. does foreplay count?), or that people have trouble remembering or being objective about just how long things took. Plus, a societal average may not necessarily mean that much in the end, even if it could be determined. Couples have different preferences that work for them, and moods and circumstances may allow for more or less time depending on the occasion. Although premature ejaculation is thought to affect up to a third of men under the age of 25, it usually goes away with time, experience, and achieving a level of comfort with sex and your partner. To help prolong sex try slowing down the pace, experimenting with different positions and taking deep, relaxed breaths. Then there are the exercises for the pelvic floor muscles that are mentioned in several answers: the same muscle you use to stop peeing can be exercised to give you greater control.  Focus on extending foreplay through kissing and massage, which can excite your partner without intercourse.  Contrary to persistent myths, masturbation is not a cause of premature ejaculation. In fact, its the other way around: masturbating a few hours before sex is a good way to prolong ejaculation later on. The real causes of premature ejaculation are often fear and anxiety about sexual performance. Ironically, this stems from the belief that says men should be able have sex endlessly. Pure feats of endurance have little to do with sex itself, and most women do not find such behavior alluring anyway. After all, thats why sport has given us the extreme marathon, the cricket match and televised golf.   For me the best thing I could do when I was young was the ladies first principle:  make sure my partner had a orgasm before I came usually by way of the second principle "ICS" or it's the Clitoris, Stupid.  In addition, if I really thought I was going to get lucky on a date, then I might masturbate before leaving so as to last la little longer that way.  Condoms also helped me last longer as well  as their other benefit:  I liked the natural lamb skin for feeling but they are expensive. I understand there are some desensitizing creams containing drugs like lidocaine but cannot vouch for their effectiveness:  this should be checked out with a doctor. Another factor is that most women (at least 60%) do not climax from vaginal intercourse at all especially when they are young but only from gentle manipulation of her clitoris.  At about thirty five more or less it seems the sexes meet:  the male can last long enough for the woman to climax and the woman can climax within a reasonable time.  As I have gotten older, I note I can out last the female.  That is, for the male duration increases with age.  One for the oldsters.  Hang in there, time and experience helps.|`|mJOLjVaTaa	keep being sexually excited.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Masturbate before you have sex, use a condom.

qoNBvzDzaa	I found these tips on a website. Don't worry I have them too :)    1) Change your lifestyle.    Do some research and find out the best way to eat. Cut down on the fat, sugar and all high calorie foods. You dont have to go on a starvation diet, just be aware of what youre eating. Love handles are made of fat. Excess calories in your body turn into to fat. See where I am going with this? Cut down on the fast foods and try to eat incorporate more fruit and vegetables into your daily diet. There are many ways to do this. Like I said, do some research and find an eating plan you can live with.    2) Work those abs.    Yes, you may have a super solid six pack already but youd never know. Why? Because it is hidden under the layers of gut fat!. Along with a good eating plan, sit ups and other strength training exercises will help by building muscle to replace that fat youll lose by eating right. Muscles themselves help to burn calories. Just keep that in mind.    3) Get sweaty.    Pull on some loose clothing and go for a 30 minute brisk walk. Or if youre fitter, go for a run. And if that is not your thing, try cycling, swimming, football or any activity which will raise the heart rate and get you sweating for 30 minutes 3  4 times every week. And if you can do more, even better. Just dont kill yourself.    4) Drink water    The easy one, but not many people drink enough water on a daily basis. Even if you dont like the taste, get used to it. By drinking at least 8 glasses of water every single day, will help to reduce bloating and water retention. This will help reduce the bulges and quell hunger. Its only water, but it will help shift those handles.
FI916ISFaa	Not true.

BPuyPpNkaa	Have you experienced any changes in your life recently that you're having trouble with the adjustment?  How long have you noticed this change that you just described?  If it has been going on continuously for two months or more, you very well could be suffering from depression.  In any case, you should see your doctor, explain the changes you've noticed to him and get him to recommend a good psychologist.  A good therapist in conjunction with the right medication, if needed, can be just the very thing to help restore any imbalances to the "old you".  Sometimes it only takes a few sessions of counseling to get the root of the problem to surface, but in more complex cases it could be months before any progress is made.  Most importantly you've noticed these changes within your behavior which has begun to effect your relationships with others.  Now, see your doctor to get to the cause.  You'll feel better faster !

The tenderness in your ribs might have been a form of indigestion. The pain in your back might result from this, too. I used to get similar feelings in my ribcage and back when I would eat too much spicy food. And, sitting down made it worse, because it would compress my stomach and push the food up to the top.    I found that an antacid was helpful (like Tums).|`|rWqrN7Apaa	Not sure but if you can definitely see a doctor.|`|EK4NGPJMaa	Well, I'm not sure for all of it, but sometimes my breasts get tender so I take Aleve.

Gas can cause internal pain like your describing. You may have eaten something that did not agree with you and thus the gas and diarrhea. Stay away from dairy products right now and drink lots of water, so that it will pass through your system quicker. If the symptoms worsen or you start to throw up or get a fever go to the hospital. You may have symptoms from a food allergy.

x6uCeQ5Aaa	My coach says that the best weigh to lose fat on your waist is to do some cardio and follow it with ab exercises. I would say try to do other cardio exercises (ride the bike, stairclimber, eliptical) for 30-40 minutes at least 4 days a week. Try to cut soda out of your diet and eat healthier with more whole grains and fruits and veggies. After you finish your cardio, work on core exercises, crunches (different types), situps, planks. You could even try pylometrics (dot drill, jumps from platforms etc). Good luck!|`|aJ40DPmdaa	your best bet is to watch your eating habits. and try to eat only 3 meals a day once a day.  also you should start running or biking to lose your stored energy. this will help you lose a lot of your fat because your using it. and if your stumic rumbles cuz your hungry grab a granola bar or fruit cup or something similer to get you to your next meal     basically eat healthy and hang with friends (outside)  hope this helps

If you are sexually active at 14 and you really want the pill, planned parenthood won't turn you away, since they are concerned about preventing unplanned pregnancy.

9Q1muFGXaa	You would be amazed how well parents can help with things if given the chance. counseling can help you feel better about yourself and work on building your self esteem. It can't hurt to try it. Sometimes it may take a couple of counselors to find the one you feel best to talk to. you should try it and when you are confident you can talk to this girl you like. You will never know if its impossible if you don't try. there are pretty girls out there that do look past how others look and look deeper in the person. there are plenty of fish in the sea so to speak. good luck.|`|qz8z8DC6aa	How can counselling not be an option? You must have a school counsellor right? If not, speak to someone you trust, even an adult. Your parents don't have to know.  Also, don't go thinking the worst right off the bat. There are millions of people who think like you do, it's normal. I was the same way and now I'm fine. It's merely a result of our society and the images the media portray as acceptable. Which, if you've ever paid attention constantly contradicts itself. I know it's cliche, but true beauty is within. Once you're older, you'll understand. No one but kids care what you look like, because real people care about people who are good people, not shallow pretty things. Go ask this girl out and if she rejects you cos of the way you look she doesn't deserve you. Please just grow up.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	I hate to tell you this but it does not matter what you look like. Fat, skinny, tall, short, your future is dependent on a good education. Why do you care what others think. You cannot know what they think anyway. If they and you thought you were perfect would it make you smarter or more successful? Your job is to learn and not to beautify your classmates. Would you ruin your life because you think you have to look a certain way?

They should be able to determine if you need to have orthodontic work done & have nothing to gain by saying that you need braces so your mom would probably believe them more. If they do say you need something, then you could meet w/ a few orthodontists until your mom found the one she trusted at the right price. Parents are blind when it comes to their kids teeth!|`|LV2AD77Baa	What has your dentist said, did he recommend a visit to the orthodontist?  That's how I decided to take my daughter when the dentist recommended for one tooth of hers that seemed "out of place".|`|ps3GTuO2aa	Okey well i think you might need them but only for the top.  And besides nobodys teeths are perfect.  And trust me YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET THEM!:  well i am telling you this because last year in 2008 in november i got mine, and like i had really been wanting them idk why but it was couriosity, and when i finally got them because i needed them omg  they hurt like really really bad, i couldnt eat for like a whole 2 months, it sucked because i went to school and saw everybody eating and i couldnt because my mouth was to sore and my teeth were in pain.    And now well they dont hurt as much only when they change the wire and color, but yeah its your choice if you want them youre gonna have to go through the pain like everybody else and trust me its not appealing.    And if you have Medicaid?: you can get them for free,  that is if you were born in the US ,  and if you were born here and dont have Medicaid then you can sign up and they might accept you,  thats what my mom did with me because she didnt want to pay so we got accepted :]    Hope i helped you and gave you good advice!,  And if you do end up getting them good luck and be prepared for the pain.    xoxoxo  Linan|`|fsC4SYGaaa	i got my braces in 8th  grade and i am now in 10th and i am still wearing them but i am getting them off very soon. My teeth werent very bad just a few gaps here and their and a slight over bite but i wanted them to be perfect!!  and i honestlyy WISHHH i got them sooner because i hate having them at this age! all my friends got them and 6th and had them off by highschool(so jealous)   So if you truly want them you realy should just beg your mom cause the sooner you get them the better.

4OKE5zAlaa	Well there is obviously something wrong with you and you should tell your parents. It might not be something serious and it might be easily curable and treatable, but losing 30 pounds in three months is drastic and should be raising some eyebrows.     If your parents won't take you to the doctor, I don't know what to tell you. If you really think it's serious, check yourself into the ER and tell them there's something wrong. It's your judgment.    I think you should go ahead and have an MRI. I think if you'd had a brain tumor OR stomach cancer for years you would be bedridden by now... so it's probably not that, and the doctors probably would have picked up on it by now if it WERE that. So maybe it's something else. The initial nausea may have been from other factors (stress or something), and the recent developments you  talked about during the last few months could be something new. Regardless, losing 30 pounds is definitely a sign that there's something wrong, especially if it was unintentional. Go to the doctor's again, and get a 2nd and 3rd opinion if they say the tests are inconclusive. If you're losing drastic weight and getting sicker and sicker, you need to get better so you can enjoy life, even if the cause of your sickness isn't very serious.    Good luck! I hope you get better.|`|M3maZgdyaa	Get checked for diverticulitis. I had this for 15 yrs before they found out what was wrong.

gVBifWq4aa	I get migranes regularly, extreme one to be honest.  Nohing worse.  Mine only last  a few hours a day and one heavy session for about3 hours.  I usually over medicate myslf.. dangerous but it works.  alternativly you can use soothing headache strips on your head.  dont watch tv and try to stand a lot as it restricts the blood flow to your head.  Migranes are cause by the swelling of the blood vessels in your head so restricting the blood flow to there will always help.  I have to stand upright in a dark room for hours when its at its worst. it helps

I didn't tell anybody about this either.  Then, one night, a friend  found me hyperventilating in bed and rushed me to the hospital.  Anyway, they told me it was a panic attack.  They gave me tranquilizers and the name of a therapist that I really liked.  He told me about this program:    http://TheBestListOnline.Com/cure-panic-...    He really shouldn't have because this program cured my attacks.      I kept my appointments with him anyway because I liked talking to him and he also noticed how much more relaxed I was since the panic attacks stopped.      Anyway, hope this helps.  Good luck,  Martha|`|1JSblCBsaa	You can't stop them when you're having one, you just have to try and breathe slowly and controlled, and remind yourself over and over you're okay until it passes. They don't last long.    Don't you mean "how do you prevent a panic attack"?   Thinking and worrying about panic attacks can make you more anxious and the more anxious you are, the more likely you are to have a panic attack. HOWEVER, you should try to forget about it, because no-one can predict panic attacks!!  So just know that it's not going to kill you, nowhere near that. So you have no logical reason to fear them. Just remind yourself that if it does happen, it will be over quickly and you will be back to normal.    There's really nothing else you can do.     DO NOT get medication if you have such a big fear of them. Medication can CAUSE panic attacks and can make them 10x worse. EG when you try to come off or if you miss a tablet or if you take too high a dose. If you are not having them like every day there's absolutely no reason for you to be even considering medication. Good luck|`|uzkrUZJkaa	You absolutely don't hear voices. You can feel like you're choking and your heart can race (palpitations). You can also feel like you're having a heart attack.

kdZcHLETaa	Shower and pee after sex, especially the pee part, even if you don't have to.  Men don't get UTI's nearly as easily as women because their tract is much longer from the end to the bladder so the bacteria have a hard time getting that far before they urinate again and wash it all out.  Women however have a much, much shorter distance for the bacteria to travel to get to the bladder where they can't be 'washed out' as easily. Since sex isn't the cleanest thing ever women tend to get UTI's from not peeing after sex!  that's how I got mine and now that I know that, I always pee and I've never gotten another one.        As a side note, you could include cranberry juice as a part of your regular diet, there's a chemical in the juice that keeps the bacteria from being able to cling to the tissue wall! Neat huh?|`|W5U0PyNeaa	Drink plenty of water,    cranberry juice,    wipe front to back(in the bathroom),    keep clean as possible while having sex(i.e. anal is bad idea),    pee after sex,

Don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion if you feel you need one.|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	It depends on what kind of tumour it was.|`|AA12066269	It depends on the size of the tumor, if there sufficient clear margins around the tumor  if it has spread to the lymphnodes and the type of cancer.  Many doctors these days expect their patients to take an active part in the decision making about treatment.  Some doctors might recommend a course of chemo before the lump is removed, others may recommend lumpectomy followed by chemo and possibly radiation.  Other times only surgery is required.    My sister only had surgery.  My friend had surgery and radiation.  I had surgery followed by chemo and radiation.  I could have gone with chemo first but it would have meant two surgical procedures and I don't like anesthsia so I had surgery first.
TNapLRcuaa	take a test|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Good luck, sweetie. I hope I'm wrong that you're not alone.|`|WtQIg0UKaa	It doesn't matter how long you were taking the pill before.  If you missed two days and have has sex you are no longer protected by the birth control.  The chance is very high that you are pregnant, especially since you are having an irregular period now.  The best thing would be to take a pregnancy test to confirm it.|`|hKZ5dRbSaa	Take a test, thats the only way you'll find out, and in the future, use condoms :)|`|qMhUhAALaa	Well it is definately risky to have sex unprotected off the pill, because when you go off  the pill it is uncertain when u ovulate. Probably the only way to know is to get a test from the drug store, maybe get one that has multiple testing kits in case it is too soon to show up. Gosh you poor thing. Good Luck with that|`|LMRaSXFeaa	i think you should take a test.|`|QIHTp2xDaa	get a home test at grocery store
84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	You need a new doctor that knows what he is doing.  First of all, the antibiotic killed your intestinal flora that helps you with your digestion and now you've killed that off.  (thank you doctor).  Constipation can be from several things, including taking antibiotics.  It definitely sounds like you are also having a reaction to the antibiotics and that most likely is due to the high toxic affect and your liver most likely has been overwhelmed by that.  Constipation can be due to an adrenal weakness brought on by the lack of hydration and a diet high in carbohydrates with little fat.  The adrenal glands are responsible for holding water in your intestines and if they are weak, you will get constipated.  The fact that your thyroid is weak is a strong indication that you have an endocrine issue and for the doctor to give you thyroid medication without finding out what the "root cause" of your endocrine issue is first, is not being responsible to you with good science.  He is right according to his "standard of care" most likely, but you are still the one that will suffer for that indiscretion, in my opinion.    You now are experiencing "Make Believe Health" that happens from taking drugs.  Have you ever know ANYONE that was deficient in drugs?      Did your doctor tell you that once you start taking the thyroid medication that it is a life sentence and that you will have to take it for the rest of your life?  Did he check your iodine levels?  Did he check to see if your hypothalamus gland or your pituitary gland was working properly?  Or did he just look at your TSH reading and decide on the life sentence?     I strongly suggest you see a Certified Nutritional Therapist that can evaluate you by testing you for nutritional deficiencies and not do a bunch of guess work based on a simple lab test that is not very accurate to begin with.  They can test each of your glands to see if you need any nutritional support and recommend a diet that will put you on the road to real health, not the "Make Believe Health" from some drug.      Constipation is typically due to a digestive issue and a low thyroid condition can contribute to that, but you need to know what is causing the low thyroid if that is a problem, not just throw some drugs at it.    Focus on being truly healthy, not the "Make Believe Health."    good luck to you|`|z7aUPU0Raa	It sounds like an allergic reaction to one of the medications that you were prescribed.     If it were me, I would go to the emergency room.|`|GzFkA3npaa	maybe your allegic to the medicine|`|QvrhmdAtaa	It sounds like you are going possibly through renal/kidney failure.It's ER time.Please,call an ambulance NOW!

8c3928ce39cd98e96b5b55afe6bfec47aa	Have it reassessed by the vet, then make Elizabethan collar which fits around the neck, which makes it difficult to lick at wounds etc. Or you can purchase these at the vet or some pet stores.    We had to do this with our cats when they were de-sexed, we kept on for about ten days, when the stitches were removed. I made mine using a thick plastic sheet, drew a circle (use a large plate), and make single cut into the centre then cut a smaller circle to fit around the cats neck, staple into place.|`|Mzjoeld4aa	bring it to a vet and see if it needs a cone, you dont want it leaving a scar|`|M5XjqI40aa	Take it ot the vet. Get it some stitches, antibiotics, and one of those funny cones things they wear around their head to keep them from licking themselves (although that may drive a cat insane).
JfO3PdFDaa	normal overbite is 2-3mm.|`|aCJWXkmFaa	if you have an overbite period they recommend you to get braces. i have one slightly crooked tooth and a huge overbite and i have braces. my friends overbite was so mild you didnt even notice and she also has braces|`|AA10858028	Honestly, almost anyone can be recommended for braces. Your tooth problem has a name, which makes it even more likely that they will recommend braces for you.
cp4FmZGyaa	Wisdom teeth suck! Not only are they hard to clean, and are thus more prone to cavities, but they hurt like a ***** growing in, because they're at the end of the jaw. Wisdom teeth are also useless. If 16 molars and premolars aren't enough to get the job done, stop eating f-ing rocks for dinner. And now I can't close my mouth properly.|`|Jswomud7aa	Sometimes you don't need to have them pulled at all. If you have room for them in your mouth, or if they never come out and don't cause any problems you shouldn't have them pulled.    Sometimes they don't have enough room to completely erupt, or come out of your gums. The go up and down which can be quite painful as well as cause infection to the gums back there.    Sometimes they squeeze through and crowd your other teeth forward, and for aesthetic reasons people have them pulled so they don't have crooked teeth.    Unless you have pain, infection or crowding there is no real reason to have them pulled, even if they're impacted.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Mine were really messed up and growing into my cheek and jaw, it was painful and was messing up the way teeth looked. They didn't pull mine, they put me under and then had to cut them out of my jaw. Plus because it's very hard to clean back there, they're more prone to cavities.|`|nvLs7jGBaa	For most people they grow inward and cause crowding; which pushes your teeth in a direction they aren't meant to be pushed.|`|2EEhZ9rCaa	they get infected easily because we normally don't brush all the way back there.also your gums can grow over them which results in getting them pulled later and life and hurts a whole lot more then getting them pulled when there through the surface.
TSc8OE4vaa	I wear mine for one month, but I wear a different type than you do.  When you start to notice a difference between the contacts and your glasses (clarity-wise) or they become uncomfortable it is time to change.    To be safe, do what your eye doctor tells you to do.|`|hAB7m8otaa	you are supposed to change them about every month but i wear mine until they start hurting my eyes.    mine last me about a month and a half.  i probably shouldn't wear them that long... oh well.

8e7e2fd391e28bb3b4818c8a3c3bee59aa	Did you actually have a seizure, which is a very specific medical diagnosis with specific laboratory findings, or did you just pass out?  If you just passed out at the sight of a needle, there is a thing call Vasovagal syncope (syncope is the medical term for passing out).  Its actually fairly common and most of time associated with a specific trigger (ie. needle).  There is a test for it call a Tilt Table test, where you are strapped on a tilt table and it tilts with your head down, and if you pass out, its a positive test.      More info: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasovag...|`|nAp688tZaa	What you are most likely experiencing is pseudo-seizures, meaning that they are psychological in origin, but are real!  Your body is responding to extreme stress, caused by the needles, and causing you to have seizure like symptoms, but your brain waves are not actually changing.  I have done lots of research on seizures this year because I was diagnosed as having them after a very bad car accident.  Mine have no rhyme or reason and can happen at any time, regardless of outside stresses.  Although you do not have epilepsy, what is happening to you is real and does need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist that is a specialist in this type of bodily reaction.  Seeing someone and talking to them about the problem will give you some coping mechanisms so that you can possibly treat the issue and it will not require medication.  If you were having seizures at other times I would say that you should see a neurologist, but since this is the only time that you experience the symptoms, you should see a psychiatrist.  Good luck
YwHl37Hgaa	For a quick fix you can place a warm wet tea bag over the area or a cotton ball dipped in lemon juice (don't use lemon juice if you have a sensitive skin). Check out http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/ for more info and home remedies.|`|lJYvGLKLaa	Putting a little toothpaste on it can help because it dries it out.|`|WXpdkbG8aa	I heard a dab of Neosporin, oddly enough. I rarely get pimples and don't try to make them heal immediately so I've never tried this but again, I've heard it works.|`|6yRyAA5Laa	pr0activ.  clean& clear...  gurl dats y dey made all diz...|`|Y5032C2laa	just wash it with soap alot|`|jazKtgENaa	Proactive face mask works really well|`|VSw6eN4Baa	Toothpaste. Yeah, I know, it's weird, but it works. Nothing else works overnight like toothpaste. If you wash it with soap too frequently, you'll dry out your skin, and as a result, your pores will produce even MORE oil than you had before (resulting in more pimples; not good).    Apply a tab to the pimple before you go to bed, and try to sleep on your back (otherwise the toothpaste will smear over all your pillows and stuff!). If it burns, it's working.    Just a warning if you plan to use toothpaste: pimples WILL be severely reduced and diminished, maybe even gone completely, but the skin around the pimple will be red (if the toothpaste is strong; you can tell by the degree of "stinginess").    Good luck :)|`|SyKr4Yjnaa	proactive refining mask.|`|0k2fkt4Yaa	proactive usually doesnt work.  Rubbing alchohol will dry it up pretty quick,.|`|tNLQQYcZaa	Neutragena Rapid Clear, been using it for pimples that surprise me for like 3 years and it always works overnight.    http://www.drugstore.com/qxp91232_333181...|`|0XkgNvO1aa	Cleanse your face with whatever you clean your face with.Put pressure on the pimple from both sides depending on where the pimple is located, and put pressure on it until the whitehead comes out. Sometimes this may also cause bleeding. Then put rubbing alcohol on it.
2feyvzj3aa	lol its bc ur stretching yourself and its working  sry i dun no how to explain it but dun wry it happens wen ur stretching too much ,,its not badd:P    
gdbeVf32aa	well i have the same problem and i try really hard not to eat it! same as you i geuss?! well im 13 and asked my mom to stop buying junk food and my friends help me out at school. ask the people you no...friends understand. as for exersize next time you go to gym or any sports pracs do your best and try even harder. work hader and try to do 100%x better than normal! it should work!     p.s. dont take this to heart all the way i started this a week ago and lost 2lbs. i dont no how long it will stick together but if you happen to trry this remember some 13 yr old girl is out there trying it too!       good luck!|`|0a4f640f3111457c74420d882ae4e76daa	join a sports team at school. If you can't make a varsity/JV team, try to find an intramural team.     Its hard to commit yourself to work out when its by yourself. If team sports aren't your thing, try to join a gym that has a lot of fun classes and pick out a few classes that you will take every week, so that you're taking a class at least 3 days a week.    -Also, eliminating all drinks other than water can help you drop an extra 5-10 lbs over the course of a few months which may not seem like a huge number but it makes a big difference. Half the time, when you think you're hungry, you're really just dehydrated.|`|dPrJ1MOUaa	Do a lot of reps when you lift weights. This is great for burning more calories and getting more cut. Make sure you lift weights lower body too, not just upper body! Also, more importantly, research interval cardio training. It works wonders and it only takes 20-25 minutes 3 times a week! It's very hard, but for that amount of time it's definetely worth it. I used to run long distances and the interval training is much more efficient. Most importantly, eat right. I know this is very hard for you, but you have to be strong and eat healthy for at least 3 days in a row. On the 4th Day, eat something you really like, like some candy, pizza, or ice cream. This will make staying on the plan more easy and rewarding. I don't know how much you weigh, but I'm guessing if you want to drop 35-40 pounds your a bit overweight. I promise if you do this plan, givin you work out hard and stick to mostly healthy eating, you will loose at least this weight. Good Luck! It's so worth it!|`|TyJ1L2IRaa	First of all, you MUST stop eating candy, it will go straight on the belly if you are not exercising enough to counter it. Also, start taking a healthy packed lunch to school, i know cafeteria food is tempting, but if yours is anything like mine used to be then its full of cheap crap loaded with fat and chemicals.     A fantastic way to NOT feel lazy is to exercise! Healthy people who exercise have far more energy than those who don't. Just get up and do it! dont think about reason not too, don't think about what on tv your missing, just do it! You will not regret it.    Start drinking LOTS of water, water is excellent for energy and keeping you healthy, drink ice cold water as well as it burns extra calories (im told by my instructor) when your body tries to heat it to room temperature.    You need to start jogging/running. No one loses weight by going for a peaceful walk in the evening, its about getting your heart going and keeping it pumping hard for a good half hour. This will give you results.    Find out your daily calorie requirement, and knock off a good 500 calories, this alone will slowly get rid of your excess fat.    That's about all you need to do. Also try joining a sports team at your school, maybe soccer or something else involving running. Its fun, helps you make new friends and will burn fat off very quickly.    Hope i helped :)
9CHjZ8sBaa	Some carbohydrates (bread, pasta) a while before, along with getting fully hydrated (i.e. your urine should be relatively clear), also make sure you get enough sleep.    You should be able to do more and more as time goes on and you get used to the routine (as long as it is on a regular basis)|`|OySU2oAkaa	First of all, good for you for taking action. It sucks to workout but sadly we have to do. I recently began and it's killing me but this is what I do:    fiber for breakfast, protein and some carbs for dinner, light salad for lunch.     I workout out in the morning three times a week. Something you could eat before is a fruit. That has fiber and will energize you!

2sycPf8Daa	Sorry to hear about your low self esteem, your feelings. Honestly, there is no quick fix for life, so you can't expect one. You need to take things slowly, and see how they end up working out. If not go see a counsellor for some help. You're not stuck...stuck is a choice that you've made so make the choice to get unstuck one step at a time but you need to begin to take responsibility for your own life and not blame others for where you are. Getting moving...the sooner you do the sooner you will have both feet unstuck.    Plan to follow your dream. Plan to "do" for the rest of your life, precisely that which you would just love doing almost all the time, in your spare time, when you're robbing time from other chores.   WHATEVER IT IS, YOU MUST BECOME the Best THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY BECOME AT IT. Life won't come to you. You have to go get it. You can decide that your stuck and live everyday with a miserable helplessness, or you can choose to make YOUR choices in YOUR life.    You sound like a great person who's losing themselves in their life. Find some defiance in you. After all, the world runs according to survival of the fittest. By not standing up and making your decisions, you're saying that you're not strong enough to deal with the challenges that thousands of people deal with every day. I'm sure this isn't true. Don't prove it to me or others, prove it to yourself.  Take care as always!

t2R3mEMoaa	I have been taking vitamin A for a few years now and it does nothing for facial problems. The amount you would need has to be prescribed from a doctor, sorry. In all the years I've had problems with acne, pimples and blackheads I have had success only with Oxy (over the counter). I never use soap on my face and always use a day and night cream. Now and again I have a break out and oxy clears it right up. Every one is different so this may not work for you, but you could give it a try. There is a home remedy that I have used as well with success. You beat an egg white til it froths and peaks, then put it on your face. Leave it on til you feel the tightening and then remove. No soap. Good luck|`|5LPWySQaaa	There is a cream called Magic Cream from Saudi Arabia. It has all of those beauty products cocktailed into one. Try it.|`|AMwKq6cVaa	i guess you can try but careful with supplements tho. vitamin A along with vitamin D, E, and K are fat soluble vitamins which means it'll stay in your body if you take too much which can cause harm,|`|KDst9z5Naa	Vitamin A can help but not cure acne. Vitamin A assist cell development and skin . Also , it is a great anti oxidant . Omega 3 and Omega 6  vitamins have been known to help the skin.Both vitamins that I mentioned can help you but not solve acne. Good luck on your skin treatment.
0KaadzHzaa	Absolutely! You just need to make a few changes to how you open the patient's airway. Instead of performing a "head-tilt chin-lift" maneuver. Instead perform what is called a "Modified jaw-thrust maneuver" It is most easily done by kneeling at the top of the patients head while when they are laying on their back. Next point your thumb, middle and index fingers out, with the rest folded in. When you do this, both your hands should look like "guns". Next put your thumbs on the cheek bones of the patient on each side. Then place your middle and index finger behind the angle of the patient's jaw. Again one hand on each side. Lastly apply pressure with your middle and index fingers forward. This should push the patient's jaw forward, opening the patient's airway, and allowing ventilation to be done. See the link below for a picture of what it should look like.     http://www.aic.cuhk.edu.hk/web8/Hi%20res...|`|ccd8b510f25c5c2defba386e56c3f9afaa	I try to weigh it out...   Can the person live with the injury? Yes.  Can the person live with out breathing? No    Unless you are really concerned about a possible spinal cord injury, than find a way to immobilize the head/neck area (find someone to stabilize the neck)  then perform CPR.|`|fAcVndo7aa	Absolutely.    When someone is not breathing and/or is pulseless, that's their number one problem.  Without circulation of oxygenated blood, the patient will die.  Needing CPR and/or rescue breathing trumps the possible spinal injury.    There is a modified way to open the airway of a person who has a suspected spinal injury.  Instead of tilting the head back and lifting the jaw, you can perform a jaw thrust.  However, if that doesn't succeed, or if it is impossible to open the airway with a jaw thrust alone, then your number one priority is getting the airway open so the person can breathe (or you can breathe for them).  It does the person no good to protect their neck and spine if they die from lack of oxygen.
sQu3LLqtaa	Dehydration and under eating are common causes of fatigue.  Most people don't drink enough water.    Your immune system is obviously very weak so you probably need a lot more vitamin C.  Fruit and vegetables are rich in antioxidants and enzymes that you need for good health and energy and that is also where your vitamin C comes from.    You seem to be suffering from a whole assortment of health problems and besides fatigue and digestion problems you are also suffering from memory problems and a few other health problems.    Perhaps you could ask your school nurse to contact your parents and explain to them that you really need to see a doctor.  Perhaps your school nurse can make an appointment for you if your mom won't cooperate.  There are probably as many problem parents as problem kids.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Call your doctor yourself and make appointment and explain that there are no adults willing to hear you out and tell them you are sick. Your symptoms sound awful.|`|AA11086634	If (after you have taken action on Suzan's advice) your problems persist, you need to learn something about your sugar metabolism.   Most people in Westernised societies are suffering from sugar poisoning.   Get two books (if you can) as available from the link below and if not just quit drinking pop (yes, even diet pop) and eating sweetened manufactured foods.  Eat only whole natural foods.  The sugars in fruit and honey are far superior to mass produced factory sugars.  Unfortunately one has to be careful to source real honey and unsweetened fruit, so be wary of all factory made foods.   Real foods are plentiful in the supermarket, if only we choose them over the convenience of manufactured foods.  Real honey is a bit harder to guarantee, but it is worth the effort.

0rpN2419aa	Yes, it is forgetting what some one told you just moments before.  Or asking a question you have asked before.  I do it frequently.  I have to work hard at staying more focused.  Do you have other health problems that might be making your your memory loss worse?  I do, so don't know if I can be the best help here so it's okay to thumbs me down.  If your short term memory loss, is only occasional, such as where did I put my cell phone or car keys, that is pretty normal.  Most people do that.

2SSD6BP9aa	No.  Cold weather by itself cannot cause anyone to get sick.  But it causes people to stay inside where they are more likely to pass germs and viruses back and forth.  People close up their houses and other buildings to keep them warm, and that prevents fresh air from getting in to clear out the old air people have been coughing and sneezing in.  Not getting as much sunshine means your skin isn't producing the same vitamins it does in sunnier times of the year when people are outside more.|`|s0TiTrd3aa	it is a minor factor as a cause of getting sick.   the reason most people get sick when the weather cools off is because more people stay inside; that allows germs to circulate more easily and, therefore, more people get the flu and colds in winter.|`|QxmPnDHGaa	yup..because we are more prone from those free radicals    and are body some times can't get rid of it>>    in fact there are more people who get in sick cauz of cold weather|`|nNbG5Vd5aa	Yes, the lowering of a person's body temperature lowers the immune system which makes a person more vulnerable to catching illnesses.

What makes the braces hurt is the wire that is pulling them into place not the brackets themselves. You also may experience some pain if you get cuts in your mouth. I would rate the pain on my top braces like 4 out of 10 not too bad... Good luck and listen to your ortho, if you want nice teeth

QXY34a7Laa	Small meals more often is always good, especially for your energy levels.  Your blood sugar will stay consistant that way.  Get good sleep, and drink water all day long, even when you don't feel thirsty.  Those are the 3 first and foremost rules of health.    Next, do weight training so that you can only do 6-8 repititions of a given exercise, add enough weight so that your 6th or 8th rep is all you can do.  Then rest 30 seconds between, and finish 3 full sets of 6 or 8 reps.  Do that for any exercise you can do with the weights you have...and always breath out while lifting (don't hold your breath while lifting), breath in while releasing.    You should eat lots of protein (meat, tuna or other fish especially--not fried though, and egg or 3 a day) a little dairy, very little sugar, lots of water, and fiber.  Fiber will help you not to "bind up" inside-if you know what i mean.  Peanut butter in very controlled small amounts is extremely healthy.  Walnuts are extremely healthy.  And remember, those "Rockstar" or "Monster" energy drinks have quite a bit of sugar and caffeine, neither of which are conducive to your apparent goals.  Energy, yes...but your muscle mass goals -no.  Try "B Complex" vitamins, available at any grocery store or pharmacy...they will give you untold energy all day long if you pop 2 or 3 a day for a few days...which is what you may need for a good workout program.    As always, consult a strength training book, don't simply trust some on Yahoo with your health.  But what I said is the gist of what the books will tell you.|`|RgcfIq0Haa	eat a lot and burn the calories for muscle. just do not takr Riods. be a healthy man|`|aJ40DPmdaa	i see your problem.  check out this site i found a wile ago.  http://www.hundredpushups.com/week1.html  it really works i used to not be able to do 5 push ups but its only been like a month and now i can do 28. this will get your back arms and chest.    eating: eat proteins, your red meats and what not will provide a good platform for muscle to grow  keep in mind the "food pyramid"  stay away from simple sugars they will kill your work out    and for your legs i suggest running
sq4BcGbIaa	yep its puberty. loads of guys your age will be having the same issues aswell...dont worry about it man, your voice will eventually settle on a note which will please the ladies.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Welcome to the world of puberty, Bubba!  Guess what?  The world is NOT coming to an end right now because your voice cracks.  You've got at least 8 more years left of puberty & all kinds of weird things will be happening within your body during that time.  And they are all called 'growth spurts'.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  Everything will happen in due time - and not before.|`|IuIp7Eevaa	puberty, it wont be over for  while, so get used to it|`|5sSjx4GXaa	Its puberty dude, it is normal and will pass with time. Let me know if you have any other questions,    numberkingsfan@yahoo.com|`|0x4MpgCNaa	gratz u hit puberty      its called ur voice cracking and it hapens through puberty ull sound high pitched for a second|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	aw. just puberty! don't worry about it. i'm sure it happens to your friends too. you just don't notice it as much.    :))|`|mJOLjVaTaa	your voice is changing. it sucks but it has to happen, but it will pass|`|7qEzqMyCaa	puberty dude.|`|04BxlijMaa	ur voice is changing, ur going from kid voice to teenage deep voice.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	That's puberty for you.  It'll settle down after a while, and you'll get other things to worry about, but when you get to the end, all will be OK.  Hope this helps.|`|2TSJ4RXeaa	It's probably a sign of puberty and changing of the voice, before you no it in a month or a few weeks you'll have a deep voice. Don't worry about it.|`|lgyPxg26aa	It's called puberty.  It's normal and it will stop at some point.    Some guy's voices hardly crack, they just wake up one morning with a lower voice.  Others last a long time.    There's no way to tell how long it will last for you, but one day it will stop cracking like that and you will have a deeper voice.|`|LHjvNlzDaa	that's called fagging out. it's not a big deal it happens to everyone once in a while. you're 13 so your voice is changing as you go through puberty, it happens worse to some boys. it will get better, probably happen to your friends too soon.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Most women that have back pain due to large breasts experience it in the upper back between the shoulder blades.  If you don't get a reduction, eventually, your bra straps will cut into your shoulders and I have known people to have indentations that go an inch or more deep and looks like it moves the bones in the shoulder.  The back pain will intensify over time until you are forced to have something done.      As to insurance, most companies will not pay for breast reduction unless your doctor refers you to a plastic surgeon on his recommendation that the surgery is necessary to help your back health.  If you can't get a doctor to recommend the surgery, the insurance company will consider it cosmetic and will not pay.      Right now wear very supportive bras that are wide in the back and with wide straps that cover a couple of inches of your shoulder tops to help keep them from cutting in.  I know they don't look cute but might help with the back strain.    hope this helps..
Hco3gULiaa	Yes, it happens to me too.|`|hAB7m8otaa	yeah it's normal, i think it's just the air that's trapped in the bottle and it just comes out like that or air caught in the contact case and it just forms bubbles...   :]
NuvKPl3naa	even though you might feel better your body still needs time to re energize itself. you body was fighting off illness and it can take a bit to get back to the same routine. try some vitamins to get you going again to replace what your body lost
MpVQE8tnaa	Ask him to use pediatric speculum.  I have Cerebral palsy and it's VERY painful to be stretched open.  He switched to the pediatric speculum-- it is smaller.      Switch to another doctor  You will stretch open--maybe doctor wasn't trying or he doesn't like your lifestyle|`|VpQ5ZmsMaa	Yeah I had the same problem. There are different sizes of Vagina Speculum and if needed they should of used a smaller one. I had to get a smaller one because the doctor had a hard time with a big one. I don't normally have alot of sex but it had to be done.   I would say use toys before going to the gyn or ask them to get a smaller speculum ;)|`|s1h5MDz0aa	well usually pap smears are for women who have sexual intercourse with penetration so i think your fine for now. i wouldn't tell you to do something thats uncomfortable or awkward.
z7aUPU0Raa	I use a facial cleaner to help with mine, you may also want to have your bra size checked. When I wear a bra that doesn't fit right I tend to get them as well.|`|0x4MpgCNaa	if they are actualy pimples theyll go away when ur done with puberty or maybe sooner|`|JKM7CEpnaa	too much sweat and oil could be getting in between them. Need to let the air out and use a hot wash rag and keep washing them and drying them off well.     Watch your diet too.
fAcVndo7aa	If the ER docs said you didn't break it, it's most likely that you didn't.  There is always a chance you may have a very small stress fracture that they missed, but those mistakes are fairly uncommon.  It may be sprained or very badly bruised.  Following up tomorrow is a great idea.    In the meantime, you can do a few things to help with the pain.  If they prescribed anything, be sure to take that medication as directed.  If not, you can take ibuprofen to help with the pain and inflammation.  Use an ice pack (wrapped in cloth - don't ever directly apply ice to your skin) to help with the swelling - 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off.  It might also help to keep the wrist elevated while you're icing it.|`|919ZzSUvaa	I know this sounds crazy but trust me, it works.    Take a small knife or pin and poke where the swelling is. If it bleeds profusely and the swelling goes down you have a broken bone and/or infection. If you just hit muscle and skin it is swelling.    Be sure to go deep enough, though.|`|2AsiyrOOaa	if you can bend/move it. No it's not broke. Even if it hurts like hell to move. If you can't move it at all then it is broke or sprained.     Good luck dood.|`|8opg5OSQaa	I broke my wrist a couple of months ago and I know the feeling and you most probably broke it so go to the wrist doctor but until then do the following:    ~ Ice your wrist every 20 minutes and take off for 10   ~Keep it above your heart   ~Wrap your wrist and do not go any wear with out your sling on  ~Press on your fingers once every 4 hours and see how long it takes for them to go from white to pink again if it takes more than 15 seconds GO TO THE ER    That is all I know from my break I hope you feel beter!!!
Jswomud7aa	You'd only need to have them pulled if:     1 there is no room and the impaction is causing pain   2 they are creating an infection   3 they are crowding your other teeth and shifting your bite    If you have enough room for them to be there then leave them there, especially if you don't have any problems or symptoms. You don't NEED to have them extracted.|`|NuvKPl3naa	i had mine out at 15 and what they do is usually knock you out so you wont feel a thing. you may be sore after ward but that only last for a couple of days. they will give you pain killers and you eat soft food for awhile. you will be fine. if they dont have you on the books you more than likely wont get them pulled on thursday|`|yL5qYog7aa	I just got mine done a few months ago (also 16, hi!) and I'm so happy I went through with the surgery. I had about a month of not being able to eat solid food (but I was using my jaw a little too much for it to feel better, I think), but since then the most problem I've had has been my jaw popping when I yawn or open my mouth too far. I was completely knocked out for my operation. The only thing I remember about the day was being nervous and sore about the IV, and then my mouth still being frozen for a few hours after I woke up.    Basically, if your dentist suggests it, do it!|`|K6UXmBDZaa	hey im goin to the dentist on thursday also...  well i never got my pulled so i cant really help.
Q4ggnG0waa	Why is he not in the hospital getting treated? Nobody KNOWS it's cancer till it's at least biopsied. How did he find out? I can answer your q after a little more info.    Maybe if you consider yourself "stuck" doing it, you shouldn't be doing it. What if it was your actual family member? Would you consider yourself stuck then? I'm sorry, it just sounds very selfish on your part. When I was diagnosed, I didn't leave the hospital till I had surgery to remove it and a treatment plan set up. My kids are in school or live away from home and my husband works full time, gone 12 hours a day. I'm not a burden on anyone in my family. If you feel the way your indicating here, I'm sure he picks up on it and would just as soon you not think you have to help him.|`|3YukdxCqaa	Hospice can help you immensely.  If he is terminal, they will come into his home and care for him.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Cottage Cheese and Flax Oil Cures Cancer!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSoddptWL...

Hco3gULiaa	You need a different prescription specifically for contacts.  It will contain numbers that have to do with the shape of your eye itself  and will look different than a glasses prescription.  Sorry, I know I would hate to go pay for another eye exam, too.  :)|`|QxE1OTq9aa	you most definitely need a new prescription because of the diameter of your eyes...|`|LDcp1Wgraa	I'm afraid not.  You eye doctor will need to do a "contact lens" exam.  They will determine the type of lens best suits you.  They will also show you how to insert and remove and care for the lenses.  Good Luck.|`|hAB7m8otaa	i'm pretty sure you can you the same one but you do need to go back to your doctor to get the right kind of contacts because you may have an astigmatism and that needs a special type of contacts
hQsvuxs3aa	if your a girl.....think of the summer and what boys will think    if you are a boy... Think of what the girls will think!|`|B12E4rYiaa	It will work better is you get a plan of healthy eating on a regular basis. A six pack is hard to get and you need a strict diet of low fat foods and drinks. That's how body builders do it they have very strict diets and work their abs hard like all the other muscles in the body.    It's all about discipline and self control. If you want it bad enough you have to make sacrifices and not eat what you want but what's best.
CNW6eAjoaa	Read the information in the three links attached.  You will find lots of information and more on foreskin stretches that really work.  The big thing is do not stretch until it hurts.  Pain is an indication you have gone too far.  Stop before you feel pain, otherwise, you could create micro tears in the opening which will heal over as non elastic scar tissue.  You do not want this as it makes retraction more difficult in the future.  You can also go to a doctor and ask for steroid cream that is made just for this purpose.  Do not let the doctor even hint at circumcision.  Tell them it is not an option.  There are many other things you can do without cutting off the most nerve enervated part of your body.|`|qMS7TbfKaa	you should stick ur juicy cock in my mouth and let me suck it and stretch it with my tongue...!!!!!|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Ask your daddy, Bubba!|`|0x4MpgCNaa	some people dumb asking if u circumsized...  haha if ur circumsized u dont have forskin  and uh go look at a circumsized penis on google or somethin.  when u pull the foreskin back it should look like that        no im not gay. just helpin out 0.o|`|mJOLjVaTaa	are you circumsized?|`|5sSjx4GXaa	Just pull it back over the head of your penis a few times a day. Do it as long as you need to in order to see results, everyone is different|`|Z0SiMz7daa	There should be no reason to stretch your foreskin.  The most important issues are to pull it back and clean it at least 2 times per day and after cleaning ensure that it is pulled forward over the head of your penis.  That should be all you need to do to maintain good foreskin health.
AA10858028	First of all, that sucks you have a permanent retainer. Why did they do that?     Second of all, you could do it, but its not as satisfying. I don'tknow if you are used to the feel of the retainer. If it feels like it is a part of your mouth now, you can do it (assuming your partner isn't into licking the roof of mouths... most people aren't), but if the retainer feels weird to you, you probably won't get aroused unless you really like the girl.|`|1NIp8eH7aa	like which part retainer bottom or top? and idk i dont think it bothers , just be like i have retainer? does it bother you?|`|uRGRsdsyaa	i have braces, let meet up and try it out ;) nah i'm taken, erm i have no idea :D|`|NXlQrKGHaa	don't do it! your mouth might taste bad from the retainer being in too long. that will be a big turn off for a guy!
K1UicE7kaa	I would say you are very low risk...it can be spread by droplets (like sneezing/coughing)...the pox or skin lesions are dry by a week (so no shedding of the virus that way) and you had the vaccine.  I wouldn't worry about it... nothing you can do at this point anyway. I think you will be fine!|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Chicken pox has a 10-14 day incubation period. Meaning, it takes 10-14 days for you to get it after you've been exposed to it. If you had the shot in 99 you should be ok. How old are you? And the person who currently has chicken pox is contagious as long as he has the actual pox sores. Once the sores are scabbed over and healing, not oozing anymore, he's no longer contagious. Good luck! Hope that helps!|`|AA11123061	if someone has it than its better to keep away for a while .even so ur cleared but it might come back . just let ur friend recover too .  use email, chat,phone as an alternative to face to face communication for now .    good luck
I83sYbARaa	You cannot get shingles by close contact... shingles comes up when the body gets tired and people already have the dormant virus in their body.... almost anyone can get that...  there isnt anything you can do , if you are going to get it, you will at this point...  Ithink you should talk to a doctor with your concerns...as you are going to....|`|AA12081690	Not if you were vaccinated. but close contact with somebody who does have Chicken Pox causes "shingles"|`|VpQ5ZmsMaa	No u will be fine :) I asked a nurse the same quiestion.  U can get the Shingles which is an adult form of chicken pox. But u can only get it if ur immune system is super weak. N no u can't get if if someone else gets the chicken pox. Also the shingles is NOT contagious. U wont give it to someone else.
2408eaad60a56be3a215cb53110a7beaaa	haha this is weird  i have actually done the exacpt same thing in the past  i am known for being an absolute lunatic when i drink and once i was like  'please just knock me out'  and ive tried throwing myself into things etc etc  it may have something to do with alcohol making oneself feeling depressed, worthless and out of control?  alcohol is fun but in a way it makes me feel like a horrible, dark person!!!!!!!!|`|2wTovkd9aa	It's because you were drunk. You had no self-control.|`|rOPp8qMxaa	Uhh..well drunk people say stupid things....|`|NTFd0OkKaa	you have a serious disease called hitmeosis. just kidding. no offense but i dont think anyone can answer that but yourself.|`|nRjY9J5Yaa	ur a drunk  sum ppl blow or have sex wen drunk  sum act stupid or gay (literally)  u just like ppl gettn violent with u|`|JWZEuuhTaa	IDK,  yes  you do have a problem.|`|6uga0JvQaa	You do strange things when your drunk. Don't worry, I know plenty of people that have done worse things while drunk than you.|`|Q7xc5Qmzaa	WUT U NEED IS SOME ROUGH SEX LOL|`|4OKE5zAlaa	You were drunk, that was probably why.|`|lJYvGLKLaa	Maybe your masochistic. Oh yeah.|`|APDvOr4naa	well duh u were drunk... lol  you probably didnt know what you were saying|`|hyo4tWv9aa	maybe it just cuz ur ????a Caucasian female|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Some people associate violence with sex. There are a lot of examples on the internet. Look up belly punching and you will find video's. I am not sure where the desire comes from of if it is normal sexual play. I would suggest you be careful as someone may take you up on it and not use restraint. This could break your neck.|`|QXPVUxoDaa	Keep in mind you were drunk.   I think your OK unless you have had an abusive relationship, or your parents did when you where a child and you witnessed it.  in that case, you may want to think about attending Domestic Violence  meeting, so you learn how to stay away from abuser, and learn how to deal with them when you run into them in the club, (you will be able to tell who they are) Another suggestion is maybe you felt hurt by the way he was treating you, you would rather it be physical then emotional because emotional pain hurt a lot more and for a longer period.   Hope you figure it out|`|NmRcLD4Qaa	Gee I don't know, you were DRUNK. lol.|`|JEOWwUELaa	um, not sure.  go see a doctor?|`|54be3c7eda2a6643c24f8ad882a635d7aa	You might be an attention seeker.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	We all do some pretty stupid things when we are drunk. I'm glad he not hit you.|`|uw2lRgmeaa	You're not smart, but nothing that a good wrap in the mouth couldn't cure. LMAO... Girl, you better stop drinking, I don't think it agrees with you or your brain. That's a fact, not everyone can hold the effects of liquor well.|`|HO47ZZ9gaa	alcohol does strange things my friends and no I've never been drunk but Im guessing that you were cuz well it says so in the post anyway I wouldn't worry about it if you were shall we say conscious and said it then I would be worried if you think you got problems hey go see a psychiatrist.|`|nXzt7bm6aa	This is a question to address with a therapist. By the way, the guy who wouldn't hit you deserves a round of applause - if he had done what you asked, he'd be facing charges. Oh, and avoid getting drunk again until you have resolved this question in therapy - the next guy might not be sensible enough to ignore your request!
KAyVeRezaa	Massage therapy doesn't make any sense for helping out a rotator cuff injury. Go see a joint specialist, and if you don't want to do that do some rotator cuff strengthening exercises. Thera-band can work wonders.|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	take a break from doing sports for a while, just until your shoulder starts to heal. its good you went to the doctor and now just be patient and wait, hopefully you will feel better soon.  i think you should rest your shoulder for a while, avoid any sport for the time being|`|zowIvMToaa	maybe you should take some time off of sports for a bit.  you should get your shoulder checked out again maybe though.|`|QJCmrUBqaa	You should get another doctor's opinion.  It would probably benefit you to begin an exercise program to strengthen your shoulders.      If you want to get strong shoulders you can get more information at       http://tinyurl.com/azfyxo
s03QBvp2aa	Girlfriend, it sounds like a yeast infection to me.  Yes you can buy Monistat or there are some other brands like it at the store. And if you have any itching or burning with it, try Vagisil.  I don't know if you wear tight pants a lot, but you might want to try wearing something a little looser for a while until it goes away.  Tight pants cut off the air "down there", and everything gets too hot and moist, that's what causes those infections.  If you wear nylon or synthetic panties, try switching to cotton for a while.  They will help that problem too, cotton breathes better than nylon. Keeps things cooler down there. Hope this helps.|`|j6xDeydyaa	Go to your doctor. They will either tell you what you can do.. or they will perscribe something for you.  This is completely Normal|`|tiWMepyZaa	there is no way it will stop. it might mean ur period is coming if u dont have it yet but it will come ur whole life|`|2iIQJSUfaa	For now, keep wearing pantie liners. Carry around some perfume or some deodorant in your purse for the smell. Otherwise, talk to a doctor. If you have a guy doctor, ask to see a girl doctor. They'll tell you what to use.    Good luck :)|`|42cQpxviaa	What you're experiencing is totally normal. I get it, all my friends get it - all girls who've gone through puberty get it. It's just called vaginal discharge- you were right on target.     And you don't need to wear panty liners your whole life. It'll happen all the time, no matter what. I go through the same exact thing, trust me it's perfectly normal. The odor is normal too, but if it actually smells bad, you could have an infection. You can get that checked out easily, just ask.    I don't wear panty liners, I just deal with it and it comes off in the wash.|`|7uy8iy7laa	It's totally normal so don't worry about that. I have the same problem. But I don't think there is anything you can do about it....besides wearing a pantyliner. :( I think it's just something you'll have to deal with, sad to say. :/   For the odor you can try some cleansing cloth.   Hope this helps! :D|`|o96oCRWhaa	ehh...it'll go away after a while, scented liners|`|JKM7CEpnaa	What kind of odor? Is the odor fishy if so get to the doctor. It could be a yeast infection. It could just be your natural body doing its thing. You need that to get rid of bacteria.     Sometimes you an over growth of bacteria.|`|zWt64FwAaa	yeah girl dont worry. every girl gets it. it is called discharge. yeah but the days its really bad wear a panty liner, but the other days just wear your regular undies cause your "downstairs" needs to be able to breathe. but dont sweat it girl. after awhile you get used to it and it becomes a daily occurence. dont worry (:|`|so2y2lqIaa	i have it too. it is just your vagina cleaning its self and you will have it all your life. it will have an odor because is comeing from your vagina. if it is yellow or green you should probably go see your doctor because it could be an STD or a yeast infection.|`|RgZ5n0b4aa	white discharge is normal in a girls body as long as its not chunky (yeah i know gross) and have a reallllly bad odor. most of the time whit discharge is just because you are about to ovulate (the most fertile time of your cycle) or because you are about to get your period if it is always there and never goes away i would definatly look in to going to see your gyno. You just have to remember its natural to get it every single girl walking around has it. =]|`|2R1H8B8taa	You should see a gynocologist. Usually, a whitish discharge is normal when you ovulate, but if this is happening all the time, it could be a yeast infection or something else.     If you don'thave a gynecologist, you should see your general practitioner or a clinic, or even planned parenthood. If it has been happening for the past  year, it seems more serious then just a yeast infection (which also will be a creamy discharge with smell)|`|zKP2tWBeaa	Well, discharge can be a lot of things.  In fact, some discharge is completely normal, and the amount and consistency can vary depending on where in your menstrual cycle you are.  Also, normal discharge is not completely odorless.  It doesn't have a huge, overpowering odor, but if you get your nose up close and personal with your vagina or your underwear, you can smell it.  Vaginal discharge is normal, and every woman has it.  It's a sign that your vagina is doing what it needs to be doing and is healthy!    However, some discharge is not normal, and can be a sign of an infection.  For example, if it looks like cottage cheese, it might be a sign of a yeast infection.  If the discharge is yellow or brown, or if it has a very unpleasant and strong odor, that may be a sign of another infection.    The best course of action if you think you are having abnormal discharge is to talk to your doctor.  If you don't have a regular doctor, you can go to a local Planned Parenthood or other health clinic.  Like I said, some discharge is normal, but a doctor (either a general practitioner or an OB/GYN) can tell you if you have an infection.    Good luck and stay healthy!  And remember - it's your body, and it's awesome, not gross :)|`|3izco6tXaa	From what I've read it sounds normal.  Every girl has some discharge.  Vaginas are often called self-cleaning ovens.  lol  The discharge is your body's way of cleaning out the bacteria.  As long as it's not itching and burning I think your fine.  I'm not sure how old you are but, if you're a teenager then the hormone changes may be causing it.  During different times of the month, women can experience more discharge then normal.  You may have to stick to the liners for a bit.     Check out this site.  It answers your question.    http://www.sexetc.org/faq/std/768    Hope this helps.  :-)|`|1CoVG4jNaa	omg same things happenin to me too n idk wht to do either|`|lWXFP6xqaa	well it depends how old you are and well the name is discharge and its completly normAal dont worry if it bothers you that much ask a doctor to see if they can prescribe somthing    good luck|`|CdTe8MO4aa	sounds like you have a yeast infection

Nz8KQfQTaa	you may have a stress fracture to your navicular bone or a sprain         In the autoa ancle and foot rules (these are rules to determine if you need an xray of your foot)    tenderness to palpation to navicular bone   is considered a valid reason for an xray          injuries to your foot could be the reason for the numbness in your toe.  numbness and tingling occur when blood flow is reduced in an area. wich could mean the injury is slowing the flow (it also explains why the numbness worsens when your leg is elevated the blood is rushing back up your leg do to gravaty)        squueze your toe you will notice the nail bed turns white it then returns red as you release the pressure and the blood comes back  if it turns back red in 2 seconds you have cap refill (good enough blood flow)   if it takes longer than 2 seconds you should go to a doctor      I hope you are able to go get an xray but if you can't afford it and have no insurance my best advice is to        1.  check for cap refill as explained above        2.   rest the foot and ice it for 20 min 3 times a day        3.   elevate the foot above the heart when you lie down(this will draw the blood by gravity away from the injury and help reduce any possible swelling)        4.   take tylenol   (avoid motrin,advil,asprin etc -- normally these medications would be best  but anti inflamatory meds slow healing of bones so we only take them for aches and pains not possible fractures         Again if it is fractured it's probably just a tiny stress fracture or more likely a sprain since you don't remember a major trauma.         I am not a doctor just a military medic who has treated a lot of injuries to the feet and ankle.  If you can afford it.  go to  a doctor and have him determine weather its a minor sprain or a fracture

I54KyS8Laa	It's great that you are getting a handle on your weight while you are young and can develop healthy habits that will serve you for the rest of your life as well as a new identity.   Exercise: How about crunches or sit-ups? Place a ball about the size of a soccer ball behind your back so as you come down you get extra extension of your back. Also you can do push-ups and maybe even pull ups. Start with the sit-ups or crunches with maybe ten of them and then add one every day until you reach 50. Do the same with the push-ups. Jumping jacks are great toostart with fifteen and add one a day until you reach 50 or 50. Pull-ups--start with one and work up to ten.  Food wise many have found the following to be quite useful:        Breakfast:  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great.   Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it.   Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to  http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...    Additionally I'd recommend reading a book to overcome self consciousness as most teenagers are self conscious. The best book is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz--hopefully your library has a copy of it. Most people read it at least once in their life time and the sooner the better.    Be healthy and well,    Richard K|`|CVsoh7lUaa	The best way to loose weight fast is by choosing the right foods.  FOOD is more powerful than any prescription weight loss pills, because the FOOD that you eat can either make you THIN or FAT. You don't get fat because of a lack of exercising, that's a myth. You get fat because you don't eat the right foods at the right intervals each day.    To optimize metabolism, energy, and mental and emotional positivity, set a goal to eat five or six small meals per day  do NOT skip meals. Sometimes you will feel like you dont have the time or the energy to put anything together, but this is critical to your success. Your body and your metabolism are designed to look for cues telling them when to burn and when to conserve. If you miss a meal your body does what it is programmed to do  stop burning. Ideally, the five meals include breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack and dinner. On occasion, you may also enjoy a healthy and delicious fat-burning dessert after dinner. This five meal ideal will keep your metabolism burning brightly, and your brain will enjoy a steady source of fuel, keeping you mentally sharp and safe from those challenging blood sugar drops that spur cravings for sub-par food choices.  So how much should you eat at each meal? Begin by keeping in mind that there is no one definition of a serving size. With both the Food Pyramid and Nutrition Facts labels, the serving size is simply a unit of measure and may not represent the amount you are really eating. For example, an English muffin represents two Food Pyramid servings of bread, despite the fact that the Nutrition Facts label on the package defines a serving as one muffin.|`|WROvNbBsaa	The article below provides a more philosophical approach to keeping weight off but it includes some insight about choosing safe methods for weight loss.      http://www.ehow.com/how_4715806_keep-wei...|`|I5BXiTzLaa	I have many weight loss tips in my blog:  http://rorysblogspot.blogspot.com/|`|A44CPgiAaa	Don't start a crash diet because your body thinks that there is a famine and will start to store fat.

The spacers are annoying, feels like there is something stuck in between your teeth which there is lol. As far as colors you should pick something for Valentine's day like pink white and red that would look nice. If you don't floss or have trouble doing so when the braces are on( it is more difficult) then a waterpik would be good to have. As far as toothbrushes electric or manual both work well as long as you spend time(more than 30sec). Good luck!

But even when I don't use the Clobetasol, I still use the Cetaphil, it's good and works well. The only thing I don't like about it is that it does tend to be a little oily. I've also tried Gold Bond Ultimate Healing lotion. The Gold Bond Ultimate has a huge line of different lotions and they work fairly well. They're all unscented.

I have this problem too when i have a cold and blow my nose. My nose will get really red and dry and sometimes it will peal from it being so dry. The way i solve this is by using better tissues and putting lotion on my nose and eventually it gets better.

nXzt7bm6aa	I strongly suggest that you call for help - a parent or friend of the family or just call 911 - then resign yourself to going in and talking to the teacher / professor who is giving the test - they are usually quite good about letting you retake the exam / reschedule / etc...    Don't worry about how it looks / what folks will say / etc. The best thing you can do is get your brother help.

PYl3GSQZaa	Honey be grateful that your brother is still alive, I would give anything to have my brother here to tell him that i love him and that i always did, especially when while he was alive he talked about killing himself. And yes, he eventually succeded. Your brother is not doing this to annoy you, he has a mental sickness where he is plagued with depressive feelings, its easy for us who are able to bounce back after a bout of depression to say that there is nothing wrong and that things will eventually get better. So once again, count your blessings and try to understand your brothers feelings or educate yourself upon the topic of suicide and how it affects people. Best of luck to you and i'll keep you and your brother in my thoughts.|`|bxxwhP04aa	Your brother is very ill, and needs all the support he can get.    You also need help, my dear.

You may need to find an adult advocate to help you - either a relative or friend of the family, maybe even someone at a local church or YMCA or school. Basically, you need to talk to some adult and have them help you to point out that your brother's problems are taking a toll on you. Maybe you need to live with another relative or friend for a while. Get help, consider what other options exist for you and discuss them with your parent[s].|`|k4NAnEYpaa	Ask why he is like that. When he tells you, just go with your parents and your brother to a therapist and explain what he said.|`|FZ6Z6eFKaa	Of course it's going to be hard.  It's no easier on one side than it is the other.  This will probably scar your life as much as it is him.  What ever you do DON'T tell your brother how hard it is on you.  He's dealing with the emotional part and nothing make it worse than knowing that other people's lives are being harmed while he can't control his feelings.  With his condition the best thing to do is give him the anti-depressants and never ever laugh/mock him.  Compliment him, be nice, he needs support.       You:  get out of the house.  Hang out with friends and what not.  Your parents are probably preoccupied with him, maybe they arnt giving you any attention and maybe theyre trying to give you attention, but not like your brother.  Babysit or mentor younger kids.  Little kids always look up to you when you're nice and you probably want some attention.  They'll make you feel good about yourself.

One study said that 50% of people are vitamin D deficient, especially in winter months--because you stay covered up all the time!    In terms of helping your cut, vitamin D won't help that. That's part of the body's nature immune system response...it swells up and fills up with blood, making it turn red. It does that so it can push white blood cells (immune system cells) and platelets to the area to fight off any infection that might try to take hold. So this is normal!
LDMV3WUTaa	Well, from an actual MAN, I have NEVER been that "mindful' about the appearance "down there". And if it works, then it's "ALL GOOD" to me!!!    But I will also tell YOU, the ONE thing that I do "mind" and is a relatively "BIG turn off", for ME anyways, is SMELL!!! If the smell is "overpowering" then it's hard to keep "focused" on what I'm there to do. So "looks" NOT so much, but smell, OH YEAH!!! And I"m NOT talking about the "normal smell" that is associated with women "down there", but the "overpowering rank smell" that some women have|`|0x4MpgCNaa	well  not too much  make sure its shaved and if its too loose thats not good either|`|Xrvutzmdaa	that shouldnt matter to you because you shouldnt have sex until your married|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I think if most guys are even lucky enough to get to see down there, they don't care what it looks like, just what it does.    best wishes..|`|gW2PJRONaa	as long as it doesnt look like a jungle down there.|`|qEYWZrsPaa	They shouldn't but some do. the way I see it they should be happy if they get to even see down there! like my boyfriend loves it shaved! but i myself wouldn't mind going a few days without shaving. it depends on the kind of guy you have.|`|dSKL3pONaa	Are there any serious answers out there?  I think not.      Of course guys care.  But does it really matter?  By the time a guy gets down there, he's probably ready for whatever he finds.  Does that mean he LIKES what he finds, not necessarily.  But he will probably SETTLE for what he finds.  Practically speaking, you can't ask what he likes because that's too forward.  And he can't ask what you have because that's to presumptuous.  You can't know what size he is and he can't know what you offer him, unless you meet an an orgy or something.      That's why people DATE!  There are true sexual incompatibilities out there and you shouldn't force a square peg in a round hole, pun intended.  If you don't find what you like, move on.  It's just that simple.  I asked a girl friend to shave once and she said she would if I would.  I loved it and never went back.  I like to give oral and shaved or neatly trimmed works well for me.  Others may like a full bush.  The world offers both.  Don't linger and get too committed with someone who doesn't meet your needs.  And don't pressure anyone to change just for you.  It won't last.|`|lWXFP6xqaa	not really but most guys preffer it smoth as in waxed or shaved and as long as you dont smell|`|YTnM6TZSaa	Guys really don't care about the appearance as long as you are trimmed and clean.|`|jh7q0ozkaa	I really woulnd't know, but as to what the person above me said, I think it is double standards, even a lil hypocritical!  Guys want us to shave it all off down there, but yet they don't!  Talk about hypocrits!  And then they're like well if you don't wanna shave then wax it off!  OUCH!!!!!!!!!!    Any other girls agree with me?|`|JKM7CEpnaa	Men don't care what you look like down there.     Being loose is not even right to say. Men's penis could be too small.     It doesn't matter what it looks like men are men they love having sex with females regardless of what your vagina looks like. Unless the man is gay.    Don't worry I'm sure every thing is just great down there.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	Not if they are horny.    As long as you are not going about to the point that they can't find the entrance then everyone has different preferences but it's none of their business how you "present" that area. Do what you want down there.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	No...  Not at all....    Its like boobs... While kids make a big deal about the big ones...  Real guys prefer a cups and less.      Ever see a Super Model with D cups ?    NEVER...   If you want to be a cow then fine, but if you want to look young then stop eating FAT and you can keep the A cup much longer.    Males want SEX....  What your thing looks like is not of any importance at all.   Its the last thing we care about.  If the boy is young he is less likely to know what normal is anyway.      We are after the girl that will have sex with us.  We simply do not care how this happens.  Its true.   We really don't... Many males are so concerned about their own penis size that they cannot even consider thinking you are not right.    Do not concern yourself with anything like that.    I'm Male...   I am after point by telling you the real truth...    Good luck...   If you like it they will...  Also  :  Be happy with yourself.   Improvement comes from acceptance.  I knew a girl that was flat like a board.  She ended up being the best girl I ever dated.  She even made fun of her own self.  That was just great.    Good luck..|`|G2LPhdTBaa	Most guys could care less what it looks like down there.    They are just happy to get some. Probably won't even look and won't care.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Yes.  If it looks old n' beat-up AND it's loose, I don't want it.|`|fia9gMHpaa	I put whipped cream on it first and maybe some strawberries.

For example, the non-sedating antihistamines would probably do nothing.  The older antihistamines like benadryl will usually cause drowsiness, and this may reduce anxiety in a similar way a glass of wine would.  But other that the overall sedating effect, there is no best 'anti-anxiety' antihistamine.  Other sedating antihistamines include dramamine, and hydroxyzine
oQrtjivsaa	I know how you feel...    when i tried to tell my parents.. they didn't take me seriously  they refuse to take me to a doctor, and they said i can't have depression meds.. even if we could afford the help i KNOW i need. they just think i'm like any other teen with "teen angst"    you need to somehow get their attention, and don't just tell them out of the blue; or you could basically ruin your chances of even getting any help    hope everything works out for you|`|ekEj2Mbiaa	If your mom cares and loves you enough, which I'm sure she does, she'll always be there to listen.  Just come out and say "Ma, I really am depressed."  she'll probably then just ask you why, and then you can tell her any reasons as to why you feel this way.  If your little brother had depression issues, she won't think you're weird or anything, and she mostly likely will know how to deal with your issues if she helped your brother.    It's best to just come out and say it. "I'm depressed."  That's all it takes.  Don't keep your emotions bottled up until they eat away at you. It's no way to live. Trust me, I've done that before and I was miserable.  Once you let it out, you'll feel so much better, it's always nice to have someone who loves/cares about you to listen.|`|PYl3GSQZaa	Honey, be honest with your mom, tell her exactly how you feel, if not your mom please tell someone else who will listen, BECAUSE SOMEONE WILL LISTEN, if anything please believe in that. If you are thinking about hurting yourself, please don't, because there are people who love you and care for you, I don't know you, but I'll tell you this, I care enough for you to want you to speak to somone and to please let them know how you are feeling. Suicide does not have to be your option. Honey you can get through this, there are resources and people who are willing to listen and just hold you if need be. I will keep you in my thoughts, please take care of yourself.

6NA2MXNPaa	Ya, it's acne. I have them too, or had them. I use those Dove Pillows to clean my face with when I'm in the shower in the morning. They go away as long as you keep your face clean. Just keep your fingers away from them, I know how easy it is to want to pick at them but don't, it just makes them worse. Just wash your face every day, twice a day if you can, and keep your hair off of your forehead as much as you can. You can always get some kind of astringent at the store, but more than likely that'll dry your skin out, then you'll have to use moisturizer, which will just add oil to your skin, which will cause more bumps, so you'll have to use more astringent, and so on and so on. Just wash your face.|`|7fZeoqOQaa	PIMPLES, or small/chicken pocks.   sucks for u|`|MRijAWJRaa	go to the doctor and check it out|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	ACNE free works i had same problem  but now my forehead is so clear....i know what bumps you are talking about its mostly caused from sweat going into your pores since you sweat mostly on your forehead(thats where UV rays hit).|`|o96oCRWhaa	makeup proactiv|`|su37vnIXaa	ew. that sounds gross. buy like a masque to dry up your face.|`|TofmqjUaaa	1.

Just keep washing  normally and pull your hair back. I know you don't want to but that's one of the best ways to get rid of them. Or just put apple cider vinegar on your face after you wash it, and leave on for ten minutes. Then rinse. I do this and my skin is great :D|`|4G6UT8Pkaa	rose buds.    soon you will be growing roses from your forehead, it will be like a garden.|`|U3SPuBq4aa	Try to wash your face every day and maybe it will help.

Get a throat culture and perhaps start an antibiotic if indicated especially if you have a fever.    Suck on an ice pop on your way to the urgent care.|`|tgjngdLSaa	those descriptions sound like streptococcus (strep throat.)  you should see the doctor to prescribe ammoxicillin for it, if not cured scarlet fever will more than likely occur. make sure to take for 10 days.|`|rTi88PZ6aa	Honestly I would go to the doctor, it sounds like strep to me but i'm not a doctor.

dDas43FZaa	It will tone you up. I was in the Army and did plenty. I suggest doing as many as you can several times a day. Don't stick to a number like 20 or 30.

60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	Try this. Sit on a chair, with your feet off the ground. Then plantar flex the foot that is hurting (this means point your toes down). Now, grab your toes and pull up on them, while resisting the pull at the same time. If this makes your foot hurt, you probably might have extensor tendinitis.

8e7e2fd391e28bb3b4818c8a3c3bee59aa	I am sorry to tell you, but you are going through full blown opioid withdraw symptoms.  And sadly the symptoms peaks at 2-3 days and takes 7-10 days to resolve.  You can try going to a methadone or buprenorphine treatment program.  Those are usually free, and buprenorphine can be given by non-specialized doctors.    To find them: http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/bwns_loc...     FYI: buprenorphine is a partial opioid, and allows for slow tapering of opioid thus preventing/minimizing withdrawn symptoms.|`|Z0SiMz7daa	This is a difficult issue.  You definitely are dependent upon the oxycontin.  I have some real issues with the prescribing physician starting you on this in the first place.  There are much better medications for what was probably musculoskeletal chest pain.  There are medications that you can be prescribed for the withdrawal symptoms, you will need to make a decision how to go about this.  The ER is an option, probably not the best one since the cost is going to be pretty high for a prescription.  I would suggest that you try to locate some other clinics or something.  Maybe your physician would work out a payment plan.  I would try calling the MD who prescribed the meds in the first place and see if he/she can offer you some assistance with the withdrawal.    The best thing I can offer is that this will go away in a couple of days so at the worst you may be able to "tough it out" until then.    I hope you will be able to continue this withdrawal and continue to not use the narcotics.  Be sure to avoid them in the future unless there are no other options for pain control  Be sure to let any physicians/dentists in the future know of your problems with the oxycontin.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	call an ambulance !|`|Wbo0PEZaaa	dang that must not be good. Oxycotin withdrawl sucks bad, if you cant do it cold turkey, find a place to get help. for that kind of stuff they could give you lower doses to wein you off that, until your addiction goes away|`|vn0DHMXWaa	Yes, do the skelaxin! Get a bag of weed and a bottle of vodka and a carton of cigarettes. Get stoned and drink some vodka while smoking cigarettes, and stay up until you are drunk and tired enough to sleep.

Good luck!|`|pfvxU7WJaa	you've been taking to much for two long to beat this without the help of trained personnel. that's my opinion. i was in your shoes along time ago, but still remember. now im an emt. we don't have the drugs your dealing with but i think the muscle relaxer is the wrong answer.|`|BcE2JWHWaa	you are definitly going through serious withdrawal symptoms right now.  my friend kicked cocaine cold turkey and she had your symptoms for about 7/8 days.  so, it is possible to get through this, but sometimes people can die from their withdrawal symptoms they are so severe.  i would recommend not being alone at least if you are not seeking the advice of a doctor, that way there is someone there to help you or call 911 in the case of an emergency.  i cant tell you what to do, because only you know how bad it is and based on the high dosage ur taking u ccud have these deadly withdrawal symtoms...but u are definitly kinda doing the right thing by not taking it anymore....its ust too bad u waited this long to kick  it and got hooked on such large amounts.|`|AA11296458	I know how you feel because I was addicted to painkillers for five years and I am currently on Suboxone.  You may want to find a doctor that prescribes Suboxone.  Go online the doctor will be registered at the website, that is how I found my doctor.  Suboxone has worked miracles for me.  My withdrawal symptoms were so bad that I faked pain at the ER just to get some paid meds that is how bad it was.  I wasn't using it to get the feeling because I had become tolerant, I just couldn't deal with the withdrawal.  If the withdrawal symptoms become severe enough it can be fatal.  If you get too sick get your but to the hospital ASAP especially if your blood pressure rises which is another withdrawal symptom.  Take a hot bath for the muscle soreness.  You could also do exercise that will help you feel better.  If you need to talk let me know!|`|iDVJi9alaa	Well I hate to tell you this but this can go on 3 weeks, two the worse of them. If you can get your hands on some Methadone, DO IT! and ONly 5mg's to start and see what happens,(First 24 hours) than you can increase to 10mg's but only for 4 days! Do not take more than 4 days!This is horrible and Contins are the worse!    Trust me, I weaned off 200mg's of Methadone and got off Contins and I know exactly what you are going through.    And if you go to the ER they will know you are withdrawing, pretend you hurt your back and get some damn pills, for now. Vodka, weed etc is just gonna make you worse! my adivise is not good advise but this is practical advise and anyone that says anything about what I am saying never felt it, all is they would need to do is feel 60 seconds of it. I encourage to get something till you can slow down, cold turkey is hell and it is unrelenting!    and the thing that sucks..........nothing is going to help you except a pain-pill and if you go into a methadone clinic, you will really be in a mess, you need to get some and get off this stuff ASAP! Suboxoe also, 4mg's a day reduced but use for just 4 days. Forget professional help write me!    And quitting cocaine, alcohol, marijuana is a joke next to this, you do not physically need cocaine, you need this drug now, you need it physically, this is the real deal.    ANd I seen people dying of cancer that looked better than a person in Oxy withdrawals.|`|mii8wiu4aa	Please get help...my boyfriend of two years just killed himself in January..he was 19 years old. I knew that he had dabbled a few times with some prescription pills in previous years. The entire time we were dating, I was under the impression that he had severe hypertension and angina with no cause. He made frequent doctor visits and told me he went to switch blood pressure medication and said that none of them seemed to work.     After he passed, I talked with his parents and they knew nothing of these chest pains. Then today, someone told me that he had come to him several days before his death and admitted his 2 year addiction to oxycontin, and that he wanted help and couldn't stop. The toxicology report came back and showed that he had the drug in his system and he had taken it so much that his liver was like that of a 30 year alcoholic...this drug, I have learned, was most likely the source of the chest pains.     He was the sweetest guy and treated me like pure gold. No one had any clue the entire time...he was a closet drug-addict.     Please, I never knew the entire time, and the guilt is almost unbearable...get help. My boyfriend was too ashamed to tell anyone about this...    TEll SOMEONE! ANYONE! YOU HAVE TO lET SOMEONE KNOW!  That is the first step to beating this, then get yourself some help! Don't worry about insurance, this will ruin your entire life! You have SO much ahead of you...I hate that you have to deal with this at such a young age, I don't want you to suffer in silence like he did...in the end it hurts everyone.
vZdXxrkOaa	DMT is found naturally in alot of grasses and plants that we wouldn't expect to look. If you are looking for the real DMT experience you are going to need mimosa hostilis bark, (which is rare to find in america). I know you can order it online but it comes from Brazil somewhere. In addition, if you are making the smokable form you are going to need a extracting tray full of harmful chemicals. You will probably need to order it, and http://www.erowid.org/ has many books and recipes on DMT.|`|exMPHWKHaa	I think some things as simple as some types of grass have DMT in it shouldn't be too hard to find check erowid.org|`|6gapssLfaa	Hmm I'm not sure if it's in your area but Ayahuasca is the most well known DMT containing plants.    Try these :     Mimosa hostilis  Diplopterys cabreana  Psychotria viridis    A close relative is psilocybin mushroos aka magic mushrooms. Hopes this helps, but be careful while tripping, this is some crazy stuff.

I want to shed pounds too, so lately I am really watching my diet. Nutrition is a huge part of getting abs (or basically loosing weight). Also, cardio.   I suggest you run, bike or any type of cardio for 30 minutes everyday. If you can't run, speed walk. Do crunches for your abs and soon you will be noticing major difference. It is important to do weights then you will have well defined muscles. Just don't use heavy weights.|`|dDas43FZaa	Go on a diet and exercise ( a lot of running). Easy as that.

So you can't get ab "muscles" per say.

When that gets easy, do 75 every other day, then every day once it gets easy.    So on and so forth
GxQyvrv4aa	I feel for you. I am 19 years old...my best friend pretty much talks about her relationship with her boyfriend all the time, I too have a job and go to school. I have always had a low self-esteem, and I have never had a boyfriend. I think i am too much of a perfectionist, and i myself don't meet up to my standards. Everything seems to bother me, but i try to keep it to myself so that others around me don't notice. I have pretty much given up hope, the only thing holding me back is my family, i don't want to break their hearts. I think i know what you're going through...I just started college and everyone just seems to be so materialistic, all caught up on their text messaging, or other trivial crap. It sucks to feel lonely when there are 6.5 billion people in this world. I truly hope things get better for you. As for advice, I think that if you have a good self image, then you should be able to handle anything, otherwise it all goes down hill. Try to read stuff, watch funny shows like family guy or america's funniest home videos. Do you qualify for medicaid or any other state help??

It's worth it though.|`|ParFJxnSaa	I agree with the first answer completely, but would have said cotton gloves, under the plastic, and look for a new job. Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment).     It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor.     (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see http://www.mercola.com/ SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, dont follow the typical normal reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that youre looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements.     (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).
f2vYj2Itaa	There are similarities, especially between visualization and hypnosis. Hypnosis includes some visualization techniques but it also has a lot more you can do with it.     Mediation increases your ability to focus and control of you body's responses.    All three are altered states, but each one has its own strengths and limitations.|`|KHIscvJFaa	if your meditating, your not thinking about anything. you are simply relaxed and thoughtless|`|rFd5E06baa	Hmm|`|47RviT2caa	The way I've always been taught to meditate has been to first tighten all the muscles in my body, then let them relax fully from the feet up. I think a technique unique to meditation is clearing your mind completely of all stress and worries. You can do this by imagining yourself inhaling calm and peacefulness as a bright light and exhaling all your thoughts and worries as a black cloud. It's basically just to become a part of your body without using your brain at all.

b3JKcQXGaa	She might be hearing a heart murmur. A heart murmur is just a funny little secondary thump after or before the main thump. It's nothing serious unless it's a big murmur. My wife has one and it doesn't affect her at all. It's something the doctor might keep an eye on for years to come, but it's nothing serious unless it's big. You can hear murmurs with a stethascope if you know what to look for (listen for I guess). I'm not saying that's what it is, but it definetely could be.

He'll probably want to try something similar though, something like Wellbutrin may produce less side effects.  You probably won't get a benzo yet, though.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.    One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and scream out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or an alfoil one: "I am Zeguxy, Overlord of the Andromeda galaxy. Bow before me, primitive Earthlings, or I shall vaporise your backward planet!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.    It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people.     Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|7m3zz6otaa	I have anxiety and also have been on zoloft and did not due well with it. You will need to contact your doctor to let him/her know what is going on.  I was put on fluoxentine and have been fine with that.  You may have to try a few kinds to find the right one for you.|`|hCLWEnNcaa	If you want something over the counter, you can try St. Johns Wart, in the vitamin section.  A common prescription medication for anxiety is Ativan, but only your doctor can decide what to give you for prescriptions.  St. Johns Wart has been found to be very effective though, and you don't need a prescription, and it's all natural, so give it a try.
XtDigWAlaa	I bet you are right handed. Two or three times won't help much unless you mean two or three more reps with the left arm on each set. Even at that the left arm will probably always feel a little weaker unless you work at being ambidextrous.

For example: If doing bicep curls, do it with a dumbell instead of a barbell. This will equalize them over time. But I would wager that you are right handed?

yiyMiDZDaa	Jump out your easternmost window. Run 4 km west until you hit a coffee chop called 'Ron's Caf'.  Wait outside for exactly 3 minutes and 32 seconds.  A large hooded man will confront you.  Tell him that you are there for the 'crazy show'.  He'll hand you an envelope.  Do not open this envelope!!  Take it with you into the caf.  Slowly walk to the back.  Make sure no one notices anything, and arouse no suspicion.  Take the third door from the right.  This will take you down a flight of stairs into a dark hallway.  Continue down the hallway until you are confronted by a man scantily dressed as a ninja.  Tell him you need a 'bandage'.  He'll give you a flask.  Do not open the flask!!  Continue down the hall.  Take a left, another left, two consecutive rights and another left.  You will then see a sleeping cougar.  Behind the cougar is a door.  Then, you can open the flask.  Drink its contents.  It is a potion of invisibility.  You will then slip by the cougar undetected.  Open the door and enter the next room.  In this room you will see yet another hooded man.  Hand him the envelope.  He will give you a piece of pumpkin pie.  Eat the pie.

Find out the histology of this malignancy from the pathology report - if your cousin's parents will release this private information to you.      There are many types of cancer that may involve the lungs in a five year old person.  This may not be a primary lung cancer but rather a malignancy that started elsewhere and spread to the lung.

Doctors said I had a better chance of winning the lottery AND being struck by lightening than I had getting a third cancer and yes, you guess it, I did. The first was at 36, 2nd at 37, & 3rd at 38.

For example, occupational exposure to diesel motor emissions, asbestos, and paint was found to be significantly correlated with an increased risk of lung cancer.

Even really fine facial hairs can become ingrown and they usually look like acne, except they don't "pop."    Hold a washcloth soaked in hot water on the spot for a while and that should help draw whatever's trapped under the skin toward the surface.  You might have to do that a few times before the bump is ready to release its contents.  If it's a pimple, it will drain the way zits normally drain.  If it's an ingrown hair, you'll probably be able to squeeze it the way you would a pimple and the fluid will look the same as that of a zit.  But squeezing will probably also expose the end of a hair and you should tweeze that very slowly.  Ingrown hairs can be very long and tightly coiled, so the slower you pull, the better your chances of removing the whole thing.    Sorry to be so graphic, but I can't think of a delicate way to put this matter.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|wJRHTS7Maa	I have learned that if u like sratch them and then wai a little or even get some tweesers there is usually something in those giant zits so just either tweese or sctach then squeese HARD!

WjSgHbf2aa	Diet Pills are horrible for your body.      They speed up your metabolism, ergo, causing a faster heart rate, which can cause heart attacks    The only weight you will lose is water weight, there is no magical "fat burner."  The only fat burner is bile, which smells nasty, is toxic, and is an acid.  It's found in your small intestine|`|I83sYbARaa	You dont necessarily want to reve up your metabolism....   you have to find out why you are over weight....  is it you are eating too much of the wrong food, and is that because of emotions, or is it a hormonal problem, like thyroid, a simple blood test would tell you that.....    Now, in our food supply almost everything has highfructose corn syrup that is well known to shut off the 'I'm full' response the stomach sends the brain when we have had enough to eat.....   Many people are outraged this is continually put in our food and are protesting this until changes are made.... like at www.change.gov the site for president Obama and a place to tell your story, etc...  So people are eating more and more by buying for health food stores, because the food there is healthier for us....  there is much to learn about nutrition and you could start at your local health food store, or take some classes....  In the mean time, if you would just cut out eating sugar, replace it with STEVIA, and products with sugar in them, high fructose corn syrup, and start eating a lot of fruits and veggies, and small meals during the day , say every two hours, you would start losing weight right away...  If you combine that with 30minutes of walking a day... which is practically nothing... you would lose more weight faster...  Oprah has a lot of info at her site, and Michael Thurmond has a site that has a way of testing for you specific body type, then tells you what kind of diet you can be on to eat all you want, and still loose weight... it doesnt have to miserable, or dangerous with dangerous pills.  If you get a good check up from a doctor yearly, that helps, and make sure you ask for a thyroid and hormone test...  Finally if you can engage the people around you, family , friends, or others, to get involved with this it goes faster... if they resist, then find support at your local gyms, YMCA, YWCA , health food stores, etc... as that is always helpful to meet new friends into staying healthy.  Finally, Bonjenmi tea, and lotus leaf tabs are weight loss tools the asians use, and if this all really starts to interest you, you could look into learning the healing techniques of asian medicine, because most if not all of our health begins and ends with what we put in our mouths.  I wish you well.  You could also go to www.emofree.com to learn an easy technique, that is free there to help you along... read there as it is self explanatory.....

Diet pills are naturally an unhealthy way to lose weight, like all drugs, they are simply quick fixes - one you stop using them, the weight goes right back on - try working out.    I hope this helps.|`|BHacM0GTaa	It depends on what kind of diet pills you are looking for.  I have tried the caffeine pills, and they left me paranoid and so jittery that I couldn't leave my house.  I recently starting taking a newer diet pill that I heard about in one of my magazines called, "The Fill Pill".  Its a diet pill with some sort of fiber, appetite suppressant similar to Hoodia, and vitamins.  The combination of the three is supposed to help reduce hunger and trigger fullness sooner when eating. I have been taking it for a few months now and have lost about 20 pounds.  I wouldn't say that I feel full when I take them, but it seems to take an edge off the hunger.  If i take it about 30 minutes before a meal, I have noticed that I am not able to eat even half of what I used to be able to eat, and felt full for a lot longer.     Hope this helps!|`|16ef60b9856bc2120804ffe4422df56faa	weight loss is 90% diet and 10% exercise.

xt677EEwaa	Pay no attention to misinformed, unproved snippets of information. All Vaccinations carry their rare risks, but the benefits do outweigh the rare risks. Unfortunately the HPV vaccine has almost turned into the whole MMR debate all over again,- where the media and anti-vaccination brigade have put a lot of incorrect unproven information into circulation. I can't tell you what to do, but I will give my opinion which is based on actual fact. I have researched this vaccine extensively.     The RARE negative side effects reported are just that, rare. There haven't been many severe reactions and of those that have occurred, there is no proven evidence to link the reaction to the actual vaccination. For example, that girl's paralysis could have been the result of something else.    Thousands of girls have had this vaccine and only a handful of girls have reported to have had severe reactions. The most common, mild and minor reactions experienced are redness and soreness at the injection site and fainting. (The fainting was likely the result of just having the injection rather than the actual vaccine being to blame.)    In the UK, cervical cancer is the 12th most common form of cancer in women, with around 2,800 cases and just over 1,000 deaths from cervical cancer each year and 270,000 worldwide. It is a silent cancer. Although smear testing has brought the number of cervical cancer cases down, no test is 100%.     The problem with cervical cancer is that by the time symptoms are noticed, it is sometimes too late and the disease has metastized, if you are young (like what has happened to Jade Goody for example), the disease will spread more quickly. Even if the cancer is caught in time, it will not prevent the mutilating surgery that has to be carried out in order to save your life. This includes removal of part of the bowel, ovaries and womb.     70-90% of cervical cancer cases are caused by the HPV (Human Papilloma Virus), the cervical cancer vaccines offers full protection against the types of HPV that have a direct link with Cervical cancer (types 16 and 18). If there is a chance that you can save yourself from the sheer misery cervical cancer would cause, I would take it.     With regards to long term side effects, this vaccine has undergone the same testing that other drugs go through before being licenced. The only long term uncertainty is whether or not we will need a booster vaccine in later life. If so, we will be given it.     By the time we all reach late adulthood, 70% of us will carry the HPV virus, it is not simply a case of "if I limit my partners I am not at risk" you only have to sleep with one partner to contract HPV. It is true that the majority of people who contract genital HPV will not have complcations from it, but one really cannot afford to take that risk    To summarise; the rare risk that you will have a severe reaction to the vaccine are by far outweighed by the protection it will offer you from a devastating form of cancer. ALL medication has it rare side effects, you can die from having the flu vaccine. Please also bear in mind, that of all the rare side effects reported, none have actually been conclusively proven to be a result of the vaccine.    I apologise for my long winded answer. I didn't know how to condense.|`|AA12199906	loads of questions are on here so not everyone read that question       big side effect of not getting the injection erm lets guess CERVICAL CANCER think yourself lucky to be offered it    As for side effect do you  know that nearly every injection and tablet you take has side effect it also does NOT mean they will happen its means you might get these you don't even get them all sometimes you don't even realise you got a side effect.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	carry on with it, they wouldnt give it to you if there were serious risks    xx|`|NiRSOC3yaa	My 3rd one is due soon!

h1m17rStaa	There was a very recent news article about a young man who was disabled, possibly even terminally ill, who was basically granted a wish to have sex.  Someone arranged for a prostitute for him.    Ultimately, he said that he wasn't really feeling like it was fulfilling for him, but "the lady was very pleasant".    To me, this is one of those things like medical marijuana.  You're right in that someone who is severely disabled or retarded is going to have a tough time finding a willing sexual partner.  But that shouldn't necessarily mean they have to go through life never experiencing sex, if they have a desire to try it.  But hiring the prostitute is illegal almost anywhere in the US.  In these cases, I believe exceptions should be allowed.  But, once that happens, every fat hairy nasty guy will claim they deserve that same right.    I actually believe prostitution should be regulated and tolerated under the law, like it's done in Australia and Netherlands.  It will NEVER stop, so we may as well tax and regulate it properly.    And of course, the story I mentioned did not take place in the US.    Here's the link:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jht...    Reading it again, this guy managed to get NUNS to set it up for him!!!!  God bless the church.  Seriously, those are real women with real minds and good hearts, to understand and accept this poor guy's wishes.  And looking at this guy's picture, even if he were able-bodied, he'd still have trouble getting a girl, so I'm personally glad to hear that he got the support needed to fulfill this wish.

1b342eaf206eb4edecb57c5dfad1a94baa	There are probably numerous reasons that could be causing a stiff neck...your doctor can probably isolate the cause most accurately or refer you to a chiropractor if needed, but here is some from my experience:    1) Ergonomics.  Check your neck position when you watch TV or are sitting at the computer terminal.  The top of the screen should be at your eye level, without you having to pitch your head up to look at the monitor.  Ideally, the monitor or TV should be low.    2) Pillow.   I used to sleep with a soft pillow.  But since I sleep on my side, I was instructed to get a more firm pillow.  The firmer pillow supported my neck so that I had a straight spine when sleeping sideways, yet it was not too firm that it caused my head to pitch up when sleeping on my back.  Find the pillow that matches your sleep pattern.    3) Spinal neck compression.  Over time, the weight of the head just sinks into your spine, causing the space between your vertebrae to compress.  There are various exercises to relieve this compression.  - Yoga : 'downward dog' or any inversion position.  The main thing is to get the weight of your head to hang so that your vertebrae can decompress.  - When lying flat on your back on the floor, have a partner hold your skull and apply a gentle pull pressure (pull head away from neck.)  I've seen some people use a counterweight on a door attached to a head brace to 'lift' the head off...kinda extreme but it seems effective.  - Those upside down chairs if you don't mind looking silly.    In general, once it's resolved, it will probably come back.  I would recommend picking up Yoga to strengthen your muscles and relieve the daily compressions to prevent such pain in the future.    Don't do anything extreme without the guidance of professionals.    Hope this helps|`|2AhS5fWYaa	I have had pain like that where I ended up in the ER with CT scans and everything--physical therapy is what ended up helping it.|`|DfWiIXRtaa	sounds like you have a case of stingesellious? you should see a chiropractor and get a massage|`|ypDppJnCaa	Too much viagra|`|uwk1kr4waa	i've had that in the past    and it was really annoying and irritating    i went to my doctor's and she recommended a good chiropractor    i went and they were brilliant    it eased up in no time    far more affective than using medication or stuff like deep heat

For scars, you can go with a scar cream like Mederma (I've used it, it works.) or vitamin E. If you're going to try vitamin E, don't buy an oil in a clear bottle, because light degrades E. You can buy the capsules in a dark bottle, poke the gel capsule with a pin, and put the liquid inside of it on the skin. That clears up a lot of discolorations.

Most people are embarrassed to talk about body odor because they don't want to admit they have it. Others don't want to admit they smell body odor on someone else. This article is designed so that you don't have to discuss your body odor, just read about ways to prevent it. There are several steps you can take to severely reduce or completely rid of your body odor problems.    Nutrition  You have probably heard it preached over and over again to drink 6-8 glasses of water. This not only improves your overall health, but also your body odor. The more water you drink, the more apocrine sweat is diluted. Aprocrine sweat is the stinky sweat. Aprocrine will always be produced to some extent. However, it is your goal to diminish and dilute that sweat. In order to diminish Aprocrine sweat you must cut down on caffeine intake. Caffeine stimulates the Aprocrine glands which then produces more stinky sweat. Try to steer clear of soda, coffee, tea, and chocolate. All have high amounts of caffeine.    Hygiene  Proper hygiene is essential in the prevention of body odor. You must shower at least once a day if you have a body odor issue. Showering gets rid of the bacteria that excretes the smell in body odor. Purchase an antibacterial soap to kill the bacteria and lather up in prime areas such as the arm pits.    Deodorants  A deodorant that has the right elements can greatly reduce body odor. Many people don't realize their deodorant isn't helping mask any smell excreted from their body. Try to find a deodorant that contains Zinc or aluminum. These are two elements that help to fight bacteria created by aprocrine sweat.    Extreme Measures  If you have an extreme case of body odor, the above measures may not be enough for you. In this case, you should seek medical advice. There is a procedure you could look into that temporarily seals off your sweat glands in certain areas. Be aware, however, most insurance companies do not cover this type of procedure. If you have any questions you should direct them to your physician and insurance company.    Body odor is a humiliating issue that most people wish never existed. Mild to moderate body odor can be treated by simply altering daily routines and products. More serious body odor problems can be fixed with medical treatment. Either way, you are not alone if you experience body odor, and there is always something you can do about it.

ZiYhx17Waa	To maintain a healthy lifestyle try this:    Try making small changes to your diet, if you really love a certain food that is ok, just cut down your portions, you don't need to deprive yourself to be healthy. I myself am a huge "grazer" I eat a lot of fruit & veggies as snacks, baby carrots, snap peas, grape tomatoes, grapes, berries, peaches. I also love the Flat Earth veggie & fruit chips, quaker ranch rice cakes, popcorn, whole grain crackers, dark chocolate, blue diamond nut thins & string cheese. These are all small snacks with low fat & low calories.    As for your overall diet try to cut down on your calories, eat lean protein, and whole grains - bread is not bad, so long as it is whole grain & high in fiber, also eat your veggies & drink lots of water. Also lean calcium products such as yogurt, low fat milk & cheese fill up up with low calories & high nutrition content. Cut out saturated & monosaturated fats & excess sugar    It is best to eat 1200-1500 calories per day, if you eat less than this your metabilism will slow down, making it harder to lose weight. NO fast food. don't drink empty calories, stick to water, low cal juices (I mix 100% juice w/25% water to lower calories) & low fat milk. no soft drinks (diet or regular)   no eating unless you are hungery.    That being said, never underestimate the power of a good workout routine. Lots of Cardio & weight training. do 30-45 minutes of strength training 3-4 times per week followed by 45-50 minutes of cardio 5-6 times per week. do your strength training 1st, it burns more calories. I also do loads of crunches prior to & after cardio. Also walk more during the day. Take a walk on your lunch break, walk to the store, aim for 10,000 steps per day a pedomiter is a great idea. The more active you are the more calories you will burn & the more weight you will lose.    To stay healthy & not get discouraged remember this:  It is not recommended that you lose more than 2-3 pounds per week. Rapid weight loss can be dangerous & is hard to maintain. losing weight is difficult because 1 lb is 3000 calories, so you must burn 3000 calories per pound you want to lose.     if you really want to lose the weight you are going to have to use dicipline & work hard. your health is worth it!|`|AA11988671	Diets don't work.

GOOD LUCK:)|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Goto http://health.discovery.com/tools/calcul...   This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.     Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum an d is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the   Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.    Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.     Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat(equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible)  . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what youre eating and how much youre eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it wont matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Raisin Granola Bar, Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle)    Step 5: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.     Step 6(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits   around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).     Step 7: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to give in to temptation.     Step 8: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness.

128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	next Saturday? slimming thighs isn't done overnight. i think big, curvy thighs are sexy (if that's the kind of thighs you have, if you got it, flaunt it) especially in a swimming suit. but you could try kickboxing or any exercise that focuses on the thighs. belly dancing is good, too, as well as fun. in the future, though, cut out the fast food! it all goes directly there!|`|wwzoqIvVaa	There's no miracle cures, sorry to say.  Here's what I do.  I lay on one side and lift the lower leg.  Then do the same in reverse.  I do three sets of twenty, at least.

qhIFSEKCaa	wow i dont want 2 help u lose anymore weight but eating healthy can help so heres a menu suggestion  BK- eggs, wheat toast, oatmeal, fruits  lunch- deli sandwhich, soups that arent creamy- more brothy, any meat, low or fat free milk, fish  dinner- u should really eat veggies so eat a ceaser salad or one w/ ham in it and soups hide veggies well or slide some in your sandwiches, whole grains- they fill you up  *no juices or sodas or gatorade or powerade their just sugar, have WATER or tea, coffee, flavored water|`|7w2kCTDJaa	Try cutting carbs & eating a lot of protein, something like the South Beach diet maybe?

(do one gentle exercise to warm up. Then stretch. Then exercise.) This is assuming that you don't have weights.

I beleive you need a total body workout if your working from home,  I suggest you do this workout 3 times a week and go through it 3 times.  1) Jumping Jacks- 60 reps  2) Spiderman Pushup- 10 reps per side  3)Walking Lunge- 15 reps per side  4)Spiderman Climb- 10 reps per side  5) Wall Squat Hold- 45 second hold  6)Plank Hold- 60 second hold  7) Burpees- 5 reps  8) Running High Knees- 25 reps per side    I can't seve you like my clients, but I suggest signing up for this newsletter to get more great tips.  Good luck and remember every great journey starts with that first step.|`|YUjVFkocaa	1) 20 straight minutes of ab work in a circuit, alternating these exercises: speed crunches, "the plank" aka elbows and toes, oblique crunches, 6" leg raise complex, pike sit-ups, sideways crunches (lay on ur side, get legs off of ground, and crunch up to each side till failure), sit-ups, etc.    2) Exercises that are LIKE lifting weights, but not quite, since there isn't much weight:    free squats  lunges  calf raise on stairs or edge of something (but be careful lol)  knee raises to chest     and the next day:    pushups  pullups (if you can)  handstand vertical pushups (with socks on and against wall, 4 balance)  dips    3) plyometrics (AS EXPLOSIVE AND FAST AND HARD AS U POSSIBLY CAN; BURNS FAT AND BUILDS FAST-TWITCH MUSCLES FOR QUICKNESS AND SPEED)    jump-lunges  jump-squats  box jumps  high knees  butt kicks  side shuffle  power-skips (aka super mario's)  kicking fast feet (works calf speed)    and the next day:    clap push-ups (if you dare)  speed pull-ups  punching the air (that's it.... not that many upperbody plyometrics)    4) If you have a treadmill (or if you're willing to go outside), then RUN, because it is extremely important.    Run a 2mile run, and 8 100m sprints    and then the next day:    run two 800m sprints and five 400m sprints    5) Yoga, Pilates, etc.|`|IKHpyoIAaa	There are several exercises that you can do in your room; in fact I prefer to exercise in my room rather than on a machine.     I would suggest that you do at least 5 minutes of stretching before you start with any major exercises.    If you have small arm weights, you can use those. I agree no sense in spending tons of money on gym equipment and memberships. I have a friend who has a Bowflex, and I have used it on occasion, but I really prefer to turn on some tunes in my room and exercise there, doing what I want.     ? Crunches  ? Knee lifts (in a standing up position, list knees to chest)  ? Arm wheels (rotate arms in circles, both clockwise &  counter clockwise)  ? Butt squeezes (this helps tone and lift your butt)  ? Walking in and around your house  ? Sit ups  ? Push ups|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Buy some weights, you should be able to do about 8kg on each arm on average, push ups, and squats where you lye on your back... bend your knees and reach for your knees making sure you feel the strain on your stomach|`|kUqTYPSkaa	There are lots of ways you can exercise with things you have around your room or house.

AlZPIAtmaa	Sounds like you're tired.  Get some sleep.|`|1SnI86BIaa	so you eat the same thing everyday?|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	turkey and chicken contain triptophan it makes you sleepy|`|TYetEnJ5aa	You need to go to sleep earlier. Start to exercise and that may give you a boost of energy. Try an energy drink and eat fruits. Oh and drink a lot of water.|`|xxSGhywoaa	You may be lacking Vitamin D. This caused by lack of sunlight.  Also known as CABIN FEVER (gives me chills just thinking of it).  I would go to the pharmacy and get some VIT D and Magnesium pills, but talk to pharmacist about taking them as you can overdose on VIT D, but I don't know how much you need to take to OD.  Besides the cost of the pills, talking to the pharmasist is free.|`|VjFCNozjaa	First you need to make sure you are getting 8 hours of sleep each night - teenagers have higher levels of melatonin and actually need MORE sleep than adults.    It also sounds as if you need more healthy protein and iron. You can get this from soy products, apples, red meat, etc.    You should be eating more fish (healthy fats that help with too many things to name including the health of your skin, hair, mood, energy, etc. Some things you can get this healthy fat from are nuts (almonds and cashews are great), salmon, tuna etc.    You also might try eating 6 small meals every day instead of 3 big ones. Too many "Lite" foods mean you are getting a lot of empty carbs. You need more whole grains, fruits, veggies, and healthy fats like Omega-3 and 6 containing foods.    Also make sure you aren't drinking much soda - even diet soda can lead to major energy crashes and wreaks havoc on your insulin levels. If you don't like plain water try the sparkling flavored waters (just make sure they don't contain sugar or artificial sweetener).    Avoid anything with High Fructose Corn Syrup or Sugar in it. The more processed a food is the worse it is for you. Snacking on nuts and raw fruits and veggies are great. Also make sure you are getting enough calcium from dark leafy greens, yogurt, cheese, etc.    You can also help yourself to have more energy by stepping outside for 15 minutes in the morning when you wake up so you are getting some Vitamin D from the sun - it will also signal your body that it's time to be awake and help get you on a good sleep schedule.    Please make sure you are not anemic by looking at the membranes on the inside of the skin under your eye - just pull it down gently - if it is pink or light pink you need more iron - try a supplement while you work on getting more in your diet. If it's more of a red color then iron is not the issue.    Make sure you are getting plenty of fiber and potassium to help you feel full and give you energy. You can get fiber from cereals like Raisin Bran, Grapenuts, Shredded Wheats (Frosted Mini-Wheats taste good and the little bit of sugar is ok since you have all that fiber to level out the insulin). Bananas are a great source of potassium and a lot of other vitamins - I eat an apple and a banana every day.    If you are feeling really tired all the time and this isn't just temporary you may want to see your doctor and ask about it.|`|1htWVUa9aa	It might be a result of poor grammar/lack of education... but I'm not sure.|`|Jpj77972aa	pregnant?|`|YLM9nkq0aa	Well if you go to bed at 1 you should wake up around 9.  If you wake up at like 7 you're not getting enough sleep.|`|uCA6YCKqaa	Are you anemic? You should try and include more calcium in your diet and more fruit and vegetables. You need your energy, or you will be too sick to even watch your neice and nephew! If this doesn't get better, you should got to the doctor, they might be able to find out whats wrong, or they could recommend a nutritionist. Hope you feel better! :)|`|e64131f8dff2e226d6f3c656a811cc6baa	A lot of weight in a short period of time could be a sign of diabetes.  It happened to me.  I found myself losing weight and really tired all the time.  I would go in and see a doctor to be sure.  It could also be Mono.  But I would definitely go see someone.|`|capqMpiCaa	you might need more nutrients. Do you take vitamins? You can get chewable vitamins that you take every day. Your diet sounds pretty good, you just might want to add more fruit and vegetables to it. And make sure your getting 8-9 hours of sleep each night. oh and drink lots of water, sleepyness can be a symptom of dehydration.|`|wDsvazAFaa	It isn't healthy to loose so much weight in such little time. Maybe you should go back to your normal eating habits but try and exercise more often. See if it makes a difference. If not, consult a doctor. You may be lacking some sort of vitamin or mineral in your blood.    Hope this helps!|`|NdrO7u79aa	Everything in your diet looks good besides the mysterious "friut" you speak of, so I would try to stop eating that ;).    All joking aside, your diet isn't really lacking in anything, but it's probably low on calories. If you exercise a lot, you may be running a caloric deficit for the day (burning more than you consume). This is how we lose weight, but it can result in feeling sleepy or lethargic.     What time do you get up in the morning? Maybe you're not getting enough sleep either, or you're waking up to your alarm in the middle of a deep sleep that makes it hard to wake up.  Try doing some jumping jacks or jog when you get up to get the blood flowing and help wake you up.|`|ra88U1z3aa	YOU NEED A DOCTOR GIRL!!!|`|WiNJieOlaa	Pray and ask God to help you get some rest|`|OuTlT8f6aa	you might not be getting enough calories as this can make you sleepy as you need food for energy.  you could also have a iron defiency because you're not eating red meat which contains iron - you can tell by pulling the bottom of your eye down and seeing if it's red - if it's not its because you have a lack of iron and should see your doctor who could prescribe a supplement|`|faHs7u1Baa	You need at least 8 or 9 hours of sleep a night you are still growing fast. Also, make sure you get 6 to 8 glasses of water a day. No soda or junk food. Take a good multivitamin. If that doesn't help, see your doc.|`|KWspVfaAaa	Have you had any blood work done or even talked to you Dr. I am like this most of the time but I have a thyroid condition and my hormones are always up and down and if I do not take my meds.

You go to bed at twelve, and wake up around - I'm assuming, 5: 30 or 6ish. since you are a 17 year old girl you need time to beautify yourself. So that gives you about 5 or 6 hours of sleep. With your diet, it looks as though you have very few carbs. Carbohydrates are processed by your body to make engergy. So combined with lack of sleep, stress from school, energy used with exercising and babysiting, and a low carb diet; your body is slowly shutting down on you. Go to bed earlier and eat more carbs. Fruits and vegitables will help, as well as water. Just be careful with your dieting, or you will get sick because your body is too tired to fight off disease.|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: For a 17 year old, that's an extreme diet :.    .: Eat more, your body is going on survival mode to save energy,  that's why you lack energy and feeling sleepy :.    .: Your body needs food to give you energy :.    .: If you want to maintain your weight,  you have to eat variety of healthy foods in small portions :.    .: Ask your Dr./Nutritionist for the best diet plan for your age :.

3meIiIsmaa	The only relationship between anxiety and kleptomania is that they are both mental disorders - not to say that her Dr. may be treating her for  both. I think you should talk to your parents - and that they should talk to your "guest" - If this is something she can not control - they may need to make other arrangements for her lodging.  Hey - I want to learn Italian - can I come stay at someone's house for a couple of months? Sounds like a good gig to me --|`|6eQXBGXVaa	This is a disorder as anxiety is a disorder, these 2 are very likely associated. Many times people who seek attention steel to get caught, if they are hiding well they usually don't want to get caught and their is an adrenaline rush much like the roller coaster upon getting away with this type of act. Keep your things locked away, and tell your mom, no one should have to hide things in there own home. You can test her if you feel you need to confront your mother proof. Based on the things she has taken you can figure out what she likes to take and set her up with something similar.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Kleptomania and Anxiety are two different things. You should talk to your parents about the stealing thing though.|`|VrjF986Aaa	IDK if there is any correlation, actually anxiety would get in the way of stealing if you were a klepto b/c you would be too nervous to get caught. I used to shop lift a lot and it was for the thrill of getting away with it (and i wanted the stuff). Maybe they have a drug problem? Lots of people abuse anxiety medication (xanax) and it's possible they are stealing for money for drugs. If it's just little stuff like hair clips tho then that isn't likely. Try talking to the person and your parents about it before more stuff goes missing. Good luck.|`|qCPnoKy2aa	Kleptomania and Anxiety are not normally directly related. Anxiety does not cause Kleptomania, but can contribute to the problem. Both are mental illnesses.|`|BnEnIxZSaa	Sounds like kleptomania to me.|`|2esGKO2Caa	The pills have nothing to do with stealing sorry.

CLivEtPdaa	Hello, I bought from www.sunclipies.com some weeks ago. They look and work perfect. They were exactly tailored for my own glasses.

DSSZZBTXaa	no there is no cure... Your friend is just messing with you. But there is a strain of HIV that the found out that this strain of HIV stays at a certain stage of the virus and doesn't progress to AIDS. They haven't found a cure for the disease yet because the virus keeps changing itself.|`|RCWDyzogaa	They have indeed found a cure for AIDS/HIV.  It has to do with the gay community and a specific percentage of people within the gay community who are immune to the virus.  Something in their DNA allows this.  How they do it from what I've heard and read, is that there is about 1% of people immune, and they take that person's bone marrow, transplant it to the AIDS/HIV recipient (painful process none the less) and after this is done in time they are cured.  Crazy eh?  Also, these people have the full blown virus not just a positive test.  Risky proceedure though.  The mortality rate is something like 30% and it's very very expensive.  It isn't a permanant "cure" because so few people have the immunity and so little can afford it.  Stem cells have also been in the process of testing.  Will be awhile before we find a cure that will be inexpensive and effective for sure.  One of the people who got the cure also died 2 months later from cancer, but was completely free of the virus.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	((sigh)) It is not that there is a "cure" per se...    It's just that some people who have tested positive before end up having such low levels later that tests come up negative.    It doesn't mean that the virus couldn't still be hiding in their bloodstream...it's just that the amounts are so low that they are not detectable by normal methods of testing.

In most states it is a felony to not disclose.  If you have been exposing this man to this deadly virus for the last three years, don't you think he should at least know he is at risk?  And what if there is another girl involved with him?  Don't you think she deserves to know that she is at risk?      HIV infections that are undetected only lead to more HIV infections.  As a carrier of the virus you have a responsibility to the rest of the population to stop the spread.  You need to make sure that this guy does get tested.  If you ensure that this guy gets tested and you also get tested, don't you think that would be a good time to tell him.  He would probably think that you just found out.  I don't condone you lying to this guy about your status but knowing how difficult it can be to disclose, I think that you should at least make sure he gets tested so that he can be aware of his HIV status before it turns into a full AIDS diagnosis.|`|GrnIjiMiaa	Wow, I'd say that the right time was 3 years ago.|`|6SWRA7TYaa	Yea I think you should tell him!

UZxeBrxQaa	Actually its not uncommon at all at your age.    The stomach is lined with a mucus membrane that protects you from the hydrochloric acid in your digestive system.    "Heartburn" can be a symptom of GERD, or acid reflux into the esophaugous, where it burns the lining of your lower throat.    The best diagnosis is with medical tests.  You can now buy simple acid blockers, like Cimeditine, across the counter.  The best medications are proton pump prohibiters available by prescription.  You can get one OTC called Pepcid.  More expensive than the others but works better and is a once a day pill.|`|0F33OS8Haa	When you eat sit up straight and do not recline until you have digested your food. Eliminate acid producing foods like coffee, chocolate, tomatoes and eggplant. Cut down on cheese and limit the amount of yogurt you eat until you feel better.

Or try searching for homeopathic remedies products that will help you to cure heartburn or acid reflux naturally.|`|kX8lqxo1aa	my brotherr gets heart burn when he drinks orange juice it could be because ur allergic to something it depends on what you eat or if u eat to fast|`|DfABElERaa	It's not as uncommon as you think, a lot of young people get it.

aiBOMU9kaa	The contact prescription is based on the glasses prescription, but is usually a slight different power, because of astigmatism, or high powers that have to be compensated for because of the lens distance from the eye.    The contact prescription will also have other important info though, such as the base curve and diameter and the brand of lenses that are prescribed for you.    It sucks, but in the US, the optometrists have a tight control on contact fittings , which only costs the consumers a lot more .|`|SAGnmOAKaa	nope theyre not da same.if your nearsided prescription for glasses and contacts are exactly da same up to minus 4,25 from there on the strenght of the contacts will be always weaker than glasses

This fear is called "Emetophobia".  There is a website all about this phobia.  Try to block your ears if she is throwing up.  Put on your headphones to block out the sound.  Stay over a friend's house if it will help you feel any better.  Once your sister gets whatever made her sick out of her stomach, she will not need to throw up anymore.  I also have this fear.  I understand how you feel.

eeoVL4PWaa	I am in recovery I have about 5 months clean now, my longest clean time in 5 years. I used to struggle a lot with cravings and thought that they were never going to go away, but they do. Here are some things that i had to do to help. Go to meetings, I understand if you may not want to but just keep an open mind to it. Because then you are surrounded by people who either have gone or who are going through the same things that you are. Listen to music, read, watch a movie. Do whatever you can to get your mind away from obsessing over alcohol even if its only for a little while, it helps. Everytime I would begin to get a bad craving I would make myself get up and do something so I wasn't just sitting there and obsessing over it. As time goes by the cravings become less and less. But I would really go check out a meeting if I were you, it really helps. I wish you the best of luck!
wxXCqVj4aa	Hello...Okay, pituitary tumors are actually pretty common. Most people who have them never have issues. Your OBGYN should have referred you to an endocrinologist.

BG8vMyZjaa	Some causes of lower back pain...    Gynaelogical conditions such as endometriosis, menstrual cramps, fibroid tumors, and pregnancy are sometimes the cause of lower back pain in women.   Stress to the muscles, nerves, or ligaments in the lower back.  Certain jobs such as those that require repetitive movements, sitting in chairs that are not ergonomically proper for your back, or standing for long periods of time often increase back stress and cause lower back pain  If you have lower back pain that is not helped by OTC products such as ibuprofen or naproxen, see your health care provider.|`|920ab1af1a197b4b2cf4d83fae015d41aa	you need to go to a doctor and get checked for a UTI.|`|DK8HijQQaa	go to doctor|`|T104hZzMaa	Well, you may be pregnant, even if the test came out negative.

I was on the same as you and i conceived twins so the tablets are not 100% safe for all. It could possibly be just a light period but like i said its better to know than to sit worrying over it. Your doctor could also confirm this by doing a test in a urine sample.    good luck!    :D|`|Mey0nS7Raa	Sounds like a period to me.

BG8vMyZjaa	A few suggestions    1. Eliminate junk foods from your house. If it is not there, it is much easier not to eat it, right?  2. Keep controlled portions on hand. You can do this by buying food and then dividing it up, freezing some in Tupperware, and placing some in plastic baggies.  3. Sit down. People overeat while standing because they eat on the go and dont realize how much they eat. As a rule, it is better to sit, but if you overeat while sitting, try to break the cycle by standing sometimes.  4. Slow down. If you are a quick eater (not a good thing for losing weight!) try to play some slow music, take smaller bites, and turn down the lights.  5. Keep great portion-controlled healthy snacks on hand. The best snacks are ones that are in portions, such as individually wrapped string cheese, small bags of nuts, little bags of mini carrots, or fruit.  Step  3: Changing Emotional Eating  Any emotion can lead to unhealthy eating. End this by coming up with a list of alternative activities to do.|`|O8XjkCjxaa	I would try and start eating healthier, why don't you try cutting out something you eat too much of?

TC21ao0Paa	A reading of 100.5, technically, is considered a low grade fever. When you take your temp., wait at least 15-20 mins. after having something hot or cold to eat or drink to check your temperature.  98.6 is considered normal. A temp above 101.5 or higher is a fever. Be certain to place the thermometer way in back of the mouth, under the tongue, keeping it directly on top on the skin surface under your tongue.  Some people can have a little lower than avg. temp of  98.6 or, some people can have a temp. slightly above. The reading of 95.9 is NOT an accurate reading. If you get such a reading then, you should recheck your temp. If you suspect that you have a fever, check it first before taking any Tylenol, as this medication can reduce a body fever. It's important to get an accurate reading.    I hope that this helps.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	It means you could be sick, but that is not a fever. That temp is pretty low for a person (you're probably pretty cold right now).

Drugs such as Vicodin aren't meant to be taken daily for long periods of time. It's detrimental to your health in the long run and can also cause serious addictions. It's best to find another way to deal with the migraines. People have them all the time, and they find medication that's safe and will work for them.
eJsR7BZvaa	Spicy foods definitely increase your metabolism. Try adding a little cayenne pepper to your food. Also, a couple of tablespoons of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar with water drank before and after you eat will rev up your metabolism. Another thing that helps is chewing gum a lot. The chewing makes your body start the metabolizing process. You can also try eating about 5-6 small meals a day about three hours apart from each other. Your body gets used to metabolizing faster.    Hope this helps!|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	water and excercise.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I ate 12 pieces of pizza a huge omlette from IHOP a hamburger and wings.

Take more than 1 unknown at a time, and you're just asking for trouble.    The other problem with the pills is that they don't work. The better ones will increase blood flow, and so should give you a stronger erection. But they won't give you a bigger penis.    To get bigger, you need to increase the amount of blood that the penis actually physically holds, and the only way to do this is through penis enlargement exercises. If you do these properly, over time the chambers inside the penis will expand, so they will be able to hold more blood. This way, you can really gain extra length and girth, and because it's a physical change, it's permanent as well.    There's a good site at http://www.biggerbetterman.com that covers all the different methods - well worth a look.
kUouKXEeaa	Nothing wrong with running after a list, I do it all the time. Best thing to do is not to work out your legs if you're going to run, otherwise you'll be regretting it every step.

Here's a link to Amazon where you could buy it and check out the songs:  http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dance-20...  The seventh song, Desire, is my absolute FAVORITE song to run to! In the middle of the song it just gets me so pumped that I sprint as fast as I can! It feels great, if anything you should get the cd just for that song. Also "The sun is shining" is a good one too.  Other good workout songs:  Britney Spears slave for you  Beyonce Baby Boy  Disturbed, many songs!  Limp Bizkit, Future Generation, My way or the highway  LInkin Park: Nobody's listening, a few other from that same cd, some on Regeneration as well  Ace of Base!!

CHiEKZrLaa	Before you start playing, definitely have your knee evaluated by a sports med doc.  If the ligament did not heal properly (increasing likelihood depending on the severity of the injury) playing before it's fully healed could mean permanent and irreparable damage to the knee...     And that could mean any career in football you may be hoping for (at any level, be it collegiate or professional) would be out of the question.    Not to mention life-long knee pain, potential limitations on non-sports-related careers, probable knee replacements at an early age (and since the "fake" knees wear out in about 15 years, potentially several knee replacement surgeries in your lifetime), etc.    If your knee is not fully healed, talk to an doc about PROLOTHERAPY.  This is a simple injection therapy that could be enough to get you playing again without a brace and prevent long-term knee problems.    Whatever you decide, make it an informed decision!!
f0NKGtfQaa	I don't think that 6 foot and 1.5 inches is so very tall.  Isn't the average American man about 6 feet tall?  So you're only a little bit taller than that.  Don't get discouraged.  I have a lot of tall female friends that feel the same way...that they'll never find a guy tall enough for them.  But you will.  There are lots of tall girls out there, you just haven't met them yet.  You didn't mention how old you are, but I assume you're still pretty young.  Just be patient and try to get comfortable with yourself and the rest will fall into place.  Girls like confident guys; guys who feel good about themselves.  Once you can feel good in your own skin, the girls will be attracted to your self assured nature.  Good Luck.|`|3YsvIXZ1aa	your not alone!!!!!!

My sister is 6'3'' and she does okay with friends and boys as well. It's okay to not like the way your body looks but just try to remember that you've only got one life to live and you shouldn't let how you look stop you. You might end up with a guy shorter than you (my sister has a couple of times) but that's okay. People will comment but don't take it as an insult, most girls would kill to be that tall.   Trust me, once you let yourself build some confidence in yourself anything that other people say will just roll off your back. Don't let your fear of what ignorant people think stop you from living your life, you're beautiful!|`|qSMF6QIYaa	My friend who's female is 6'2, and her fiance is 5'9.

Being tall is what makes you different and unique from others, don't hate yourself because of that. (Or for any other reason). When people say "Wow!

So think of it as a good thing!|`|bseGACNXaa	My husband says you must live in Japan if you think you are very tall!  He is exactly your height.

There is really nothing you can do about this unless you want to take like 5 or 6 showers a day. Just ignore the mean answers!!|`|MhfneF0xaa	Masturbation really has nothing to do with hygiene. At age 14, you are probably discovering that your body starts getting smellier over the course of the day than it used to.    Ouchh! I can't even imagine putting cologne down there.    Try a body powder, such as Mexsana or Gold Bond, this will help keep the area dry.    And moisture is really the problem here, that will give you what we used to call ECO (Elephant Crotch Odor)    If the problem persists, you might want to shower again in the afternoon, and put on fresh underwear.    You are obviously aware of soap and water, but I will raise one more point. If you are not circumcised, you need to be careful to retract your foreskin when you bathe, and clean carefully in there, or you could build up a substance called smegma, which is pretty stinky. Also, if you are not circumcised, you need to retract your foreskin ("skin it back") when you urinate, because even a small amount of urine trapped under there can cause odor.    And whether or not you are circumcised, pay special attention to getting the last few drops of urine out, for the same reason.    "No matter how you shake and dance, the last three drops go in your pants!"|`|xrq4qKRbaa	don't pee all over yourself.|`|NICEuXYgaa	Ok, so I know I'm not a man but hear me out.

After I get more in shape, I plan on upping my time to an hour a day. I haven't set a weight goal bc I'm more concerned with how I look than how much I weigh.

4BBjhHAnaa	It's from the rapid change in blood pressure.    When you are resting, your blood pressure is quite low.  If you suddenly get up and start moving a lot, your blood pressure is not yet high enough to promote proper circulation, and so the lack of oxygen causes you to get dizzy and even black out.    Try getting up slowly and not moving too fast if you've been sitting for a long time.    If the condition is really bad, your overall blood pressure may be too low and you should talk to your doctor.|`|1rMEP8HAaa	yes its usuaally normal because you will have gettin up 2 quick and i think it's because the blood rushes to or from the brain|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	happens to my alll the time.  the doctor says to just slow down and take a deep breathe,  theres nothing you can do.|`|QjoWA99Yaa	It could be low blood pressure.

5L3KPgo8aa	There is a technique that I found useful in regards to your first statement, "...I start having thoughts about what has happened and what I wish would happen, ...".    Often when something is or has been bothering me for an extended period of time I journal about it. Just the action of putting it down in writing seems to help get it out of my head. They are now teaching children in some places to do the same thing when they get angry or upset. You may be amazed by how much this can help.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to sleep better".|`|zzO6Qalsaa	You can try valerian root,it is a natural herb and can be purchased at wal-mart or any health food stores.

AA10685305	Hi    In Case of Using anti depression drugs , It will take at least 6-8 weeks for the drug to show action .    Before that time , Your sign and symptoms may get worse , but the important not is that You should not stop the drug . It will get better .    And the minimum time of using an Anti-depression drug is ( usually ) 6 months .     Anti-Depression Drugs are doing very good and I advise You to take them on time and regular . You will face a very very good result .    Yours .|`|Gc3gcE31aa	It depends on the antidepressant.  Some take only a couple of weeks and some up to 8 weeks.  You may also need an adjustment in the dosage before you actually feel results.  Keep taking them and see your Dr.  Don't make any changes without a Dr.s approval. Overdosage of Wellbutrin can cause seizures.( my son went through that recently)  Remember too that alcohol is a depressant, so avoid it if possible. Also, never go off meds cold turkey unless you have Drs approval.  It can be just as dangerous as overdosing.   God Bless|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Honestly, it is not  a quick fix to take medication.  Meds often work wonders on mood, but it takes a good several weeks, even a couple of months, for a dose to become fully effective.  I learned this when I started taking Luvox for OCD symptoms that had become overwhelming.  Slowly, fewer things will bother you so much, and one day, you'll notice that you are maybe a little more content.  And if the medicine is the right one for you, you will eventually begin to feel happier.  anti-depressants are not magic happy pills.  But when the right medication for an individual is taken, it can change the quality of their life by stabilizing their mood and helping curb incessant worries.  After that, well, being happy is up to you for the effort.|`|w0ZVqqESaa	about a month to 6 weeks   welburtron has to build up in your system|`|7bnQmXksaa	six to eight weeks.|`|il9PCkUtaa	could take up to a month|`|HgRYP3cJaa	about 2-3 weeks. you may need a higher dose or a different pill. Talk to your doctor.|`|tpvcJwfvaa	It should have kicked in about 2 weeks ago.  Talk to your doctor.  You may need to up the miligram, or change medication all together.|`|4KOuL7mZaa	about a month or 6 weeks.why|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	30-45 days for regular use|`|GrLIOUDgaa	Talk to your Dr. because it should have started working by now. I use to tale the same medicine and I had to change to effexor SR and I am much more satisfied with it.|`|1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	It all depends on the person some within a few days others within 3 weeks.  But keep taking them.  If in another week or so you do not see the difference then talk to your doctor because it maybe that medication needs to be switched.|`|QjoWA99Yaa	Anything from a few days to a few months. Stick with them. You've not even been on them a month yet.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	ya anywhere from 1-6 weeks should feel some sort of effect maybe even a side effect or feel of something new introduced into your system a couple hours after you take the pills.....|`|bcflMMJEaa	Usually about a month however the side-effects will kick in in the first week.  You might end up feeling absolutely miserable because of the side-effects but just remember to associate them with the medicine and remember that they will be over in a coupe of weeks. I always feel like I want to throw up constantly when I switch medicines but in the long run it's worth it.   If you're not feeling better by the end of the second month, talk to your doctor.  Also remember that yes you're going to feel better and you might feel "fake", but that's just because being depressed has a way of feeling way too real, horridly real. So just go with the "fake" feeling and after awhile you wont feel so fake anymore and you'll really like the feeling the medicine gives you.    I hope it works for you.      P.S.  NEVER quit wellbutrin without the help of the doctor, that stuff works GREAT but it's dangerous quitting without help, trust me I've done it and ended up in the hospital. This was before I realized that that "happy feeling" was actually a really good thing!|`|4l8GVJzIaa	4-6 weeks
7RQDM1HGaa	Yes it is a logical explanation for your shyness. A counselor could help.    And it does explain the lack of attractiveness of the African American women to you|`|xv3opX9Maa	what does her being  African-American have to do with anything ???|`|fTpk7ospaa	yeah things like that take a toll on 6 year old so i think it is highly possible that this is reason for all the things that you have described.  Making you should talk to someone professional about what happened and how you feel. how it made you feel. ect|`|9ZzwL4CXaa	It has the whole fact of his attraction to that ethnicity to do with.    It probably was mentally traumatizing and scarring, the general idea I believe is to come to terms with what happened and if that fails to see a therapist.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I don't know how your question could offend anyone. This was sexual assault that you experienced. It would be a good idea to get some therapy, it is very important that you do. This can cause many lifelong problems for you. It could be Post Traumatic Stress Disorder any number of issue you may have.  You first have to truly understand that you did nothing wrong. You were to young to have been able to make a reasonable decision. This is something that I hope you will deal with and see a professional. There is help and recovery from the problems this has caused for you.  Please take care.  I speak from experience as my 6 year old son was sexually assaulted and didn't speak up about it until he was 19 because he thought that he had done something wrong. He is in therapy and recovering
66a13bf9fc4f5831c5a727b2e71e3db9aa	Mullein is soothing, relaxing and anti-spasmodic. It works well as a tea. I've used it for coughs and know several people who've had success with it. I've read that Native Americans smoked it for clearing the lungs but I don't know anyone who has used it that way.    Catnip is anti-spasmodic and a nerve relaxer. It can cause sweating. I would be reluctant to smoke it because my herbals don't mention that.    If you do decide to try smoking herbs, I strongly suggest you start with tea and use only one herb. If you don't have a reaction, try smoking it by itself. If you want to add another herb, drink tea for a few days, then add it to your smoke mixture. This way if you have an adverse reaction you'll know which herb or method is the culprit. I would think that inhaling smoke, even soothing herbs, might be an irritant that diseased lungs won't put up with.    Another well-tested and proven herb for asthma is Ginkgo. It is an important remedy widely used in German medicine. It can be used as a tea or made into a spray that is used like an inhaler.
1oBilGHuaa	The appointment might last about an hour.  The counselor will want to know if you are having any problems.  He/she will ask about your family and how you get along with them.  The counselor may ask certain questions that they ask everyone for the first time.  For example, "Do you hear voices."  "Do you see or hear things that are not there?"  "Do you ever feel hopeless."  "Do you feel like hurting yourself or someone else?"  Try to be open and honest as possible.  After this appointment someone else will get in touch with you to start therapy with you.  I wish you the best of luck.
jfM61TUpaa	I have had a few of my baby teeth pulled before, and I must say that getting the shot of Novocaine can be very painful! After that your mouth gets really numb and then the tooth is pulled out. All you feel is a lot of pressure from the dentist pulling at the tooth. You can also hear the cracking of the roots breaking. :O  Since he is so young they might put him to sleep.|`|0327892e5703b50d1cc717eb45253a48aa	he wont feel anything, trust me ;-)|`|LvnEbqxAaa	If he is six, I'm pretty sure they will knock him out for the surgery. I had a tooth pulled when I was young and they put me to sleep. I wouldn't worry, doctors are careful when dealing with young children.|`|LkKbiQ2Maa	If they put him to sleep then no but if they numb it then it will kinda hurt because i had to two front teeth pulled out when i was about his age and they just put the nova cane on me it didn't hurt that much but it did still hurt. But i bet they will put him to sleep. :-)
GXiCrhVYaa	There are so many scams when it comes to buying acai berry online, so it's good you want to buy it locally. I have no financial ties to Sambazon, but that company is very reputable and provides the highest quality of acai I have ever found.    Your best bet is to try to find Sambazon acai in a health food or vitamin store. I have not seen it in Walmart or similar stores. If you really have trouble finding it locally, I am sure you can trust ordering it from sambazon.com. They are not a scam company. They are very trustworthy. I hope this helps.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	Whole Foods Market    I've found the powder locally before the publicity at Vitamin's Plus in Lafayette, LA.    /Jerome

dALX1qQdaa	if you love him, your family will just have to start accepting it!  congrats on getting engaged! ( :|`|838VJJGvaa	He is your man.  Your family needs to learn to accept.|`|0pBAcZCGaa	People might hate him because they think he does not treat you well around them. Behind closed doors a lot of people act different than in public and friends are the first to tell you this. If your close friends say he treats you good and they know him better and he knows them well maybe its just that he is uncomfortable around new people and they all need to get closer. As for your brothers that are FD some firefighters and police men have a rivalry against each other but you say you have a cop bro too so not sure on that but maybe you could ask your brothers separately why they do not like him. If they have a la-git reason maybe it should be looked into but if it is something they will definitely not ever drop then it will create tension and down the road will compromise family functions and you need to ask yourself if its worth it.My ex-wife did not get along with my family members and ultimately i missed the last reunion with my grandparents and we do not have reunions anymore. Sorry if I didn't help much but that is a difficult situation you are in and that's one of the problems I had. Your family will always be beside you but sometimes they will stand a little farther away if they don't like who your with. Finally if there is something bothering you personally for any reason WHAT SO EVER ( just emphasis not yelling) do not get married or put it off till things are resolved or put to rest in your mind. It cost me $3000 to get devorced and ruined my credit and we agreed on everything. Good luck.
5TM9P8tsaa	*I have had broken arm, broken toe and fingers and it was always a 10+.

It looked horrible but i actually didn't feel any pain until the doctor told me that it was a pretty nasty break. I think my brain suppresed the pain up until that point or something.  So 1 until mentalness then 8 (then 1 again when the painkillers kicked in)|`|AA10744471	While pain is pain and pain is relative, I would say it was a 10 when I fractured my left ankle.

auwG3d2yaa	Your immune system is suffering.  Exercise, eat right, sleep well.  There are many things you can do to improve your immune system.|`|YxCRA5N7aa	I agree with Danny G|`|djBMmP3Taa	Focus on today. You may think, that you'll never stick to being healthy, but if you focus on today, not tomorrow or next week or next month, you can do it.  Incorporate a little Coconut Oil into your diet by purchasing a jar at a healthfood store. Lauric acid is a medium chain fatty acid which is abundant in coconut oil and is considered responsible for many of its health benefits. Coconut oil is about 50 percent lauric acid. The only other abundant source found in nature is in human breast milk. Coconut oil can help you achieve a healthy body weight level just by cooking with it a few times per week.[citation needed]  Eat between 3 and 5 meals a day. Stick to portions and you will be hungry when your body is ready for the next meal. Remember: Food = Fuel. Too much Fuel = Fat. Not enough Fuel = Empty tank + Fat (because when your tank is empty, your body is tricked into thinking that because you're not putting any more fuel in, it's time to store up as much fuel as possible to save for later, hence creating more fat).  Don't overdo Carbs! Try eating heavy carbs one night and see how much you'll be starving for more the next morning. Carbs are turned into insulin, and if not burned off will tell your body to store fat.  Get your air as clean as possible. The military, midwesterners, Indians, and probably several people you know, all have 3 things in common about being naturally healthy. They spend a lot of time outdoors, sleep with the windows open, and eat vegetables at least once a day. While a certain reporting magazine says that air filters are only decent at best with the motor on high, there are now university reports of air purifiers that kill surface bacteria including Staph and MSRA, and eliminate air contaminants as well as airborne particulates. These are machines that are made to be kept on LOW! Ever notice how astronauts don't get sick like they used to? Remember- Hospital odors are chemicals they use to clean everything. Studies show many people get sicker the longer they stay in one. The EPA has long been quoted saying that over 50% of all illnesses can be attributed to the air you breathe in your home. So- Get a good nights sleep with clean air, it's when your body regenerates.  Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. If you do not have a gym or karate membership and can afford one, get one! If you can't afford it, just go for a jog or bike ride. If you have a bad back, a reclined bike may be best.  Nutrition is key. Anything "fast-food" is probably too fast to contain anything good for your body, anyway. Also avoid other cholesterol-rich foods. Take the time to prepare your meals and include plenty of vitamin rich vegetables in every meal. Not doing this robs your body of essential elements that keep you healthy and sickness-free. You need to eat a lot more fruit and vegetables.  If you're taking vitamins, know that there are good, and there are great. Don't expect great vitamins in giant cut-rate chain stores. Ask a health food store or Google "best vitamin forum". You'll find people who are bragging or complaining. You'll be amazed at just what some companies have for you. ADHD? Diabetic? Safe Sleep-aid? Short memory? Energy? They're out there.  When choosing soft drinks or sweets, DON'T go with diet or sugar-free options. Sucralose and aspartame, the two most common artificial sweeteners are FDA-approved and while they say they are completely safe there are non-industry funded studies that show different results. There is Stevia, but it's hard to find, there's not a lot of studies yet, but we know our bodies can break it down naturally. All the artificial sweeteners, unlike natural sugars, have almost zero calories but put stress on our liver. Its your livers job to distinguish between the nutrients you need to absorb and the dangerous or unnecessary substances that must be filtered out of your bloodstream. When the liver is clogged and overwhelmed with toxins, like artificial sweeteners, it cant do a very effective job of processing nutrients and fats. If your liver can not process the nutrients and fats that your body needs, this may cause weight gain, cravings and poor health.[citation needed]  Diet soft drinks? Many doctors are now telling us to stay away from ALL sodas, period. Need the pick-me-up? Try vitamins and water, or an apple.  Lifestyle is a huge factor, too. If you do not have access to at least an hour of sunlight, every day, you can become deficient in vitamin D which can lay the tracks for common types of cancers. There's even a popular doctor advising his clients and readers to get 15 minutes of full nude sunlight at around noon every day. Or take extra vitamin D supplement.  Come up with a time table for your plan. It is not only easy for you to control, manage the time, but also to push down the presser on your work. It makes you feel better and no depression in work. You are happy, of course, you will healthier.  Take enzymes!!! We don't always produce enough enzy|`|Kk6wAZDtaa	What kind of sick are you getting? If your sick to your stomach then maybe you should try healthy foods and lots of Gatorade and water. Healthy foods don't always have to be carrots and apples lol. I enjoy chocolate protein shakes, peanut butter milkshakes, apples and peanut butter, PB&J, yummy chewy bars, and things like that... That just made me hungry lol. You could be getting dehydrated, so DRINK UP! Drinking water and natural fluids can boost your immune system dramatically. Try an Airborne if that doesn't work. They're desinged to boost your immune system on planes and stuff like that, but who said you have to be on a plane to have a healthy immune system?? Well if you happen to be sneezing, coughing, ETC. then you may be getting a cold or the flu. Bundle up when you feeled chilled or cool your body off with cold air and ice water when your warm. A hot and relaxing bath could help too.    Speaking of relaxing... If you happen to feel stressed about something take the time to go into your backyard or at a local fitness structure and relax. Relaxing replenishes both mind and body and could help your body recover from illness or stress. Meditating, yoga, and pilates is a great way to relax. Just let go of all of your stress. If you happen to be getting headaches, do what I do... Take a squishy icepack and place it over your head. Close the windows, turn on the tv, and take a peaceful nap. Hope that helped a little bit!|`|u7MiA7E3aa	Well, if you have any allergy's at a particular time during the year then I recommend that you stay indoors because, The trees, weeds etc give off pathogens which when you inhale, Cling to the Hemoglobin which then enter your Pharynx and through your Larynx & Trachea and into your lungs where the B cell produces antibodies which fight  off the pathogens in the immune system while other virus particles will be engulfed and broken up by macrophages. Around the time this is all happening, you are already sick.    Also, the Hemoglobin can enter your cardiovascular system and into the plasma which can affect the RBC's.    That's just one way, but another way in which you may already know is that some pathogens are spread by direct person-to-person contact. So avoid touching contaminated objects or coming in contact with someone infected with some sort of illness.     Good Luck!

97hpKoemaa	Your ideal weight is probably between about 115 and 135 depending upon your frame.  (your frame is the natural density of your body--people who are "big boned" have naturally larger frames)  Right now your BMI is 30.7, which puts you in the very overweight category.  But no worries!  You are young and you can work on this get down to an ideal weight for your body.    Start with a small goal (think 10 pounds).  If you can, find a nutritionist or other dietary professional and see if you can't set up an eating plan that will work for you.  If you don't have access to one of these people, aim to eat about 1200-1400 calories a day and get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise 4 times a week.

You'll be fine! It does hurt, I won't lie, but the pain goes away after a couple of days and from then on it only gets better. After a year with braces it never hurt to get them tightened.

TuOp3hNPaa	jogging is still very good even if ur trying to bulk up. u can jus do it after ur workout. this will get the blood goin an is good for u. remember less reps (6 or 7) lota weight for bulk|`|TjPwxbuJaa	You should never ignore your cardio, even when trying to bulk up. If you ignore cardio, you will build muscle mass, but you won't be able to see it under the fat and it'll be embarrassing when you can't run a mile.  You don't have to jog. Any cardio exercise that gets your heart rate up and stays up for at least 20 minutes is what you need. In a gym, elliptical, rowing, stair-steppers all do. As well as exercise bikes. Switch it up so you don't get bored.  I used to jog or use a treadmill all of the time. Unfortunately, as I am fairly large and muscular (220 pounds at 6'2") I developed plantar fasciitis in my foot. It was extremely painful. I was told to stop running so much. So I usually cycle or use an elliptical machine.  Good luck. I used to be skinny too and worked hard to bulk up.
0rpN2419aa	Heathyn had a very good answer and I have heard it works.   Drink more water, lighten up on the salt, eat a balanced diet fruit, veggies, protein , cut out the white stuff we like te most. (sugars, white carbs, bread, pasta) instead choose fiber rich foods which will fill you up and make you feel full longer.  If you choose to use less water, your body has a tendency to hold on to the water in your system.  I am dieting too, and this is the program I am going to use after research.  Thumbs up to H.  You could also eat a light protein snack in between meals.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	http://www.weightlossforall.com/losing-w...|`|NPCDWy88aa	water pills. they make u pee like crazy|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Drink water, watch sodium and carb intake, exercise, don't overeat in general.|`|RCWDyzogaa	Ok, what I'm about to suggest isn't the safest way to go about things, but it's very effective.  I've done it numerous times and you can lose massive amounts of water weight fast.    Suggestion 1-you can buy a sauna suit (you can get this at your local Walmart for 8 bucks for the top and bottom) and you can either run in it or you can sit in the sauna with it on and it makes you sweat like crazy!  I lose about 3 pounds a night when I do this.  Be sure to drink water so you don't dehydrate yourself too much and overheat because this can cause serious injury.  And if you get uncomfortable leave the sauna for like 10 minutes and cool your body down.  You will see results I assure you, not recommended by health professionals, but it does work if you know how to do it right.  Also, drinking too much water will make this water weight come right back.  You also lose some weight while you sleep.  Half a pound at most, most i've lose while asleep is a pound.    Suggestion 2- Drink less water, it's hard if you are used to drinking a lot, but it does help. Some say replacing water helps you lose weight.  True in a way, because it flushes your system, but if you don't have time to go to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes I wouldn't suggest drinking more water to replace the water.  Just makes you body realize it doesn't need water so you shed some water weight.    Suggestion 3-Skittles!!!!  Yes I said skittles.  You can put them in your mouth, do not chew on them though.  Let them dissolve in your mouth and spit the contents into a bottle.  If you do this for a majority of the day you can lose about a pound/ pound and a half.  Makes you really thirsty though.  This should be more than 5 or 6 in skittles in your mouth at once.  A handful and split them up evenly in your cheeks so they are by your salivary glands.  Try not to have them on your tongue.        Suggestion 4- Do the sauna routine with sauna suit and skittles at the same time.  This is what I did to lose 10 pounds water weight in about 4 days.    Again these are not the safest ways, but it does get your body to shed water weight.  Best way to lose water is to sweat it out and the sauna suit makes you sweat like crazy.  If you do this, be mindful and be very safe and conservative about it.  Good luck with the marathon.    Sodium retains water, cut down on salt.  Eat lean meats (fish, chicken) and lighten up on the carbs.  When I shed my water weight I worked out at the same time to burn calories and I ate a very healthy diet so I didn't endanger my health.|`|SzsrajV4aa	Water weight is a necessity to lose body fat. It is not something you should be worrying about.    Every time you sweat and urinate you will lose water weight. But you won't be able to get through a marathon without it!    That's why we drink water in the first place!|`|81sucrAEaa	stop drinking water|`|ctsLb3Xhaa	Pee alot.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	dont listen to any of them. dont take pills dont stop drinking water. dont pee alot... its SWEAT!! you just gotta exercise with a lot of clothes on and sweat a lot!!!!|`|4mwVxvLOaa	replace the water with new water|`|ZXxS1WLoaa	sweat!|`|66UMlUISaa	The pattern for losing those excess pounds is not difficult - eat less and move more often - the difficulties arise when we actually try to put that into practice! There are plenty of stumbling blocks in the real world aren't there?! The only thing which definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off 20 pounds, it definitely does produce results!

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Ovulation can be painful for some women. It's known as Mittelschmerz (German for 'middle pain') The pain is caused by a small amount of blood with the egg releasing into the peritoneum. Unfortunately there is not much that can be done about it. Usually it isn't a persistent pain, more like a 'stab' pain, on and off. It shouldn't last more than 3 days at most    It isn't abnormal to experience ovulation pain- up to 20% of women experience Mittelschmerz. There isn't really anything wrong, however a persistent pain that is very painful could be an indication of cysts- see your Dr if this is becoming a real problem.    Unless contradicted, take Ibuprofen 4 times daily on the days you have this pain.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	If you are having pain that bad all the time you should talk to your doctor!!!  you could have some serious problems.    I have a friend whose period was irregular and would cause her a lot of pain . . . so much so that she would get physically ill!!

In the mean time, take a lot of Ibuprofen, I find that's best for cramps.|`|dlxl8y5qaa	You may  be experiencing contractions in ur womb...just like when you are in labour. I had this problem.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Mary,    PLEASE IGNORE THE ANSWER FROM THE C. That is a very cruel trick to tell you to insert the string end and is not funny at all. We alll had to learn and it doesn't help when some joker tells the exact opposite of what should be done!    Everyone else has given you good advice. the only thing i would add is that you don't push it in at an upright angle. You need to push it in at a slight angle   as though you are aiming for the small of your back,     Good luck.    Love Mel.X|`|T104hZzMaa	Open the package, and pull out the tampon. Make sure your hands are clean before you handle the tampon.   Stand with your knees slightly bent and push the larger side of the tube into your vagina until the end of the larger piece is flush with the outside of your vagina. Then, holding the tube in place with one hand, use a finger from the other hand and push the smaller tube in until it's all the way inside the large tube. You may want to push a bit further than that because sometimes they slip a little and are really irritating.   Pull the empty tube out and flush it or toss it, depending on whether it's cardboard or plastic.     Hope that helps! By the way, if you're new at this, wear a pantyliner in your panties in case you have a leak while you're learning your tampon-changing schedule. Leaks are inconvenient and embarrassing. You should change them every 2-4 hours, depending on your flow. Never leave one in more than eight hours except when you're sleeping. Insert a clean one before bed, and change it when you wake up. Take it out before you shower so you can clean up, and put a new one in when you get out.|`|g6u9rrz5aa	haha sammee. im 12, got it like last month..... im waitign for answers/|`|8I24u0BIaa	push the end with the string toward the top with the tip inserted.|`|fl8jzGkxaa	put one foot on your toilet on one on the floor when u r standing.....then just stick the tampon in gently upward.|`|7aqysN5saa	PERFECT VIDEO!  hERE IS THE LINK :]  sorry about the caps.  ahaha  http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/goods_tam...  on this site, read it, and then click on the "click here." it is a step by step demonstration.  it really helped me :]]
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Sheby,    Try using a cosmetic bag to keep your pads in and keep it in your school bag. If you tend to have to go and change your pad during lessons where it would look odd if you took your school bag with you, try the typical female hiding trick..    Keep a spare one tucked down your bra or inside the tummy bit of your tights. That way you will be able to have a fresh pad with you and nobody else will ever know.    Hope this helps.

BjDJb3jZaa	im copying and pasting this from another question asked a few mins ago... im not about to re type it again. so here you go:  junior year i had this male teacher for english. he was young around 28/29 you know just out of college. he was cute and and i really liked having him he was a great teacher. im usually outspoken in class and very lively and talkative. well i had the class first thing in the morning and one morning i came in and i started feeling really bad.i told my friend next to me i felt i was starting my period. she was like go to the bathroom. so i asked if i could. he let me go. i got in the stall and found blood all over my freaking underware and some on my jeans. i knew i had to go back to class and ask someone for a tampon/pad. so i went back and asked like three girls around me and none of them had one. i was trying to be quiet and discreet about it but the girls a few rows over were loud and like "what??? oh you need a TAMPON???" my teacher i as his desk grading and was hearing all of this. so then i had to get up and ask to go to the bathroom AGAIN. i could tell he was like knowing what was going on beucase he was like kind of awkwardly smiling and crap. then i came back from the bathroom and was starting to get insane cramps so i put my head down on my desk. this guy next to me who flirts alot was like 'whats wrong, and messing with me" my teacher said "leave her along she is having a rough day" ugh i could have died. seriously. THEN after class he pulled me aside on my way out the door and was like "if you ever just want to go to the nurse for the rest of the class, don't hesitate to ask" ahhhhhh i can't stand htat e knew what was going on with my effing period and whanot. he was so hot and it was SO embarassing.|`|pIhqD8JOaa	I used to masturbate in public when i was little...lol|`|rwJyxowNaa	^--- epic win|`|dALX1qQdaa	my friend (lol its not me. my mom's dad is dead and my dad doesnt talk to his dad or see his dad) walked in her grandparents getting it on!
4BBjhHAnaa	Don't worry about it.  One of my friends didn't get her period until she was 15, and some girls don't get it until they are 16 or even older!!!    You don't need to go to the gynecologist until you are sexually active or around 20 years old.    The first time I tried to use a tampon it hurt, and then I learned I was doing it wrong!  It may be a little awkward or uncomfortable the first time you try to use one, but you get used to it really quickly and I find them really convenient.  If you are uncomfortable or intimidated by tampons, you can just use pads.  Many women prefer them and they definitely have their advantages (you can see when they are full!)|`|7aqysN5saa	No probs!  Girls getting their period usually ranges from ages 9-17! It just depends on when your mom got hers! You will get yours usually close to the time that she got hers!  And if you insert tampons the right way, they don't hurt at all :]  you can even feel them!|`|tCq1xpqraa	tampons dont hurt unless u insert them incorrectly. most ppl start between age 11-15, but really u  cud be 10-18 b4 u get ur period. its nothing to worry about. and be happy u dont have it yet =]|`|HdEnrf0gaa	Don't worry it's all tight because periods usually start for girls between the ages of 12-16. if you don't get it by the end of your 16th year, go see a gyno  visit: http://www.gurl.com/ for help|`|AA11318156	Don't worry hon, every woman is different and starting your cycle anytime between now and 21 would be perfectly normal. Unless you are or are going to be sexually active, then you don't need to go to the gynecologist yet. If you decide to become sexually active then you should make an appointment, at the very least to discuss STDs and birth control. Tampons do not normally hurt. They can be uncomfortable, especially if not placed correctly inside of you. You need to relax your muscles as much as possible when sliding one in. But don't worry, you're perfectly normal not starting your period yet.|`|WQK42mRsaa	I only recommend tampons for sporting events, but that is just because I don't like them.

tBF9VfPqaa	They can be anywhere from 3-6,000 depending on how much work needs done.    Here are some things that they do not tell you about Invisalign:    1. They do not help completely correct if you have a deep over/under bite.    2. Sometimes to add more "tension" on a tooth they bond a little glob of glue on the front of the tooth to help lock the tray into place and put extra pressure onto a tooth.    3. If you have any type of crowding, what they do is sand in between some of your teeth to make them fit.    They seem like 'a miracle' worker, but for the cost I would go with regular braces. You are more likely to not need more treatment down the road.     Good luck to you!|`|Nd8kf0h8aa	up 2 5,000 its expensive
aFVzMM5laa	I have experienced sleep paralysis multiple times in my life.  Every time it happened, I was under extreme stress in my life at the time and having sleeping problems.     I don't remember the gasping for air part. But it is totally freaking scary when you wake up, and your mind is awake, you can hear what's going on around you, and you are conscious, but your body will not move, your eyes won't open.  First few times it happened were probably some of the scariest experiences I've ever had.|`|O9QP6AoYaa	o wow im sorri u went through that.
bcflMMJEaa	Hey, I'm sorry for the answer above this.  :/  You should of told her, sometimes we don't have the ideal person to be able to tell such as the perfect mother or the perfect totally understanding friend, we don't live in a perfect world. One thing you could do rather than just waiting to see if she does tell your mother who will beat you perhaps there is an adult that you could trust enough to talk to?  Your mother would still find out however someone with knowledge on the subject could explain it to her and they might also see about getting you some free counseling through your county or just find some ways to help you cope with the feelings. Don't loose heart and not trust anyone just because your immediate group of family/friends don't understand. Someone out there will and will help you get the help you need to learn to cope with your feelings.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	hun it sounded like you needed to tell someone, that is a first step, you dont know that she told anyone, and if she does maybe they will help you get help! You need to tell a professional... hun get help with it.. I was a cutter and a picker.... I got through the cutting years ago but not the skin picking :( but have control on it.. It is an addiction without the substance,you do it for the high (feel).  Im sure your mom will freak out but hey you need a professional, if you are old enough go on your own talk to someone about it, they cant say a dam thing if they did you would be rich, all they can do it help and listen... someone to talk to open ,honest and what ever you need to get out!|`|dLMYFytiaa	it's good that you told a friend but you just didn't seem to tell the right friend. I know its hard to hear but this person is clearly not a good friend. A friend would try to help. Is there some one you can really REALLY trust like a cousin, another friend or a family member?? do tell them. If your mum has beaten you before i would wait to tell her (i'm sorry if she has beaten you). but that kind of information can affect people different ways. When i told my mum i got the feeling that she was ashamed which made it worse for me. There are many sites on the internet that can help just type in something like "   Self Harm Help   ". Btw if u really dont wan't your mum to find out don't tell your school. I did and the nurse went behind my back to my parents :( Good luck and hope it gets better :)|`|eWk2AMsVaa	I am a cutter. I cut because the emotional pain is worse than the physical and will go away. At least for a little a bit my mind is on something else. I am old as well. I am 45. I stil have the urges. It has been 11 months.  Not everyone understands and it is hard to find someone who does, but you can't keep in. If your mom is very religious maybe she can help. Talk with the pastor, or priest. Whatever religion you are. Moms may freak out but they also want to help. Don't worry, you are for sure your friend said anything. Maybe she is just thinking about what you said. Some don't know how to react. Or how to help. You are on the right track, you let someone know.   Good luck. See if you can find a therapist, or if you are in school, talk to your counslor or school nurse.|`|WVne90MIaa	Yes I think u should tell someone rather than keep it inside , I hope your friend tells someone that could help u deal with this situation. I hope you can find an adult or someone like your doctor who can hep u to deal with your problems in another constructive way instead of such a destructive one. I hope u find the help u need. Good luck.|`|uXjb9yMYaa	ask your friend if he/she is ok with you cutting yourself and if he/she isnt they either want to help you or you should just move on and maybe you could find someone who understands you.

Its a herbal remedy called "St Johns Wort"     Scientists have found it is just as effective as Prozac at treating depression.     Having saying that, its usually used for mild to moderate cases of depression and many people find it effective after about 3 months taking it.     Keeping in mind that depression can be a chemical imbalance in the brain, St Johns Wort contains plant extracts called hypericum perforatum which helps lift depression and its effects.    It is relatively cheap and available without prescription, so really is worth looking into, and is a safer and natural remedy for treating depression, rather than stronger acid based medicineses|`|blhIjLr8aa	I feel the same way,  Depression can get worse if untreated so i suggest seeing a doctor.    **Edit**  Oh i'm sorry i didnt see the part where you said you couldn't afford.

iAv9P3HTaa	here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions. You do not need to do all the exercises; simply select those that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.|`|gERaZGZeaa	If you're 13, wait until you're done puberty.  Your body is going to change so much - don't be worried about it.  If you try to diet down to get a six pack, you run the risk of depriving your body of nutrients that it needs to grow - which you will be doing very quickly, very soon.|`|qHUcyrytaa	crunches with your feet elevated. You can lay on the ground and put your feet on the couch with your knees slightly bent and do crunches. It puts a lot of stress on your abdominal muscles and really burns. As far as how long it depends on your condition now but nothing it overnight. If you are trim, flat stomach now, you are probably looking at a month if you work hard and may see some good signs earlier than that if you work really hard.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	pull ups and sit ups. takes a while you wont see results in about a month. and you cant slack on your work out if you do its just going to hurt you. do 100 reps of sit ups per 2 hrs. 10 pulls up per 30 mins|`|4mwVxvLOaa	crunches & ab lounge are good ways the best is using a weight on an ab lounge and crunches|`|TBuWclsjaa	Firstly, you are much to young to worry about your body. Your body is still developing and over working it and starving it can cause some serious damage.    Secondly, pretty much everyone has the six pack muscles but unless you have like 6 percent body fat it's not going to show. 6 percent body fat is slightly extreme and not something you should be aiming for. At your age concentrate on jogging and avoid weight lifting or any kind of serious strain.

97hpKoemaa	Ok, the first answer that said 9000 is completely wrong.  Perhaps it's a typo, but that's impossible.    Jogging for ten minutes at your weight, I'd say you burn somewhere between 60 and 100 calories.|`|WqI4rCrhaa	This really depends on how fast you jog and if you're running on a machine/incline.  You might burn 50 cal on a steep incline in 10min if you run fast|`|YbxmNKVPaa	over 9000!    it really depends on your body fat %, intensity of the jog, and your genetics. not a lot i can say though|`|bhyVC2mtaa	probably about 100 calories for your weight.|`|m2T75uOYaa	Use this as your convertion rate: 100 calories per 1 mile. So if you run 3 miles a day, you burn 300 calories.
W1tx1p2iaa	yes, you need to go on medication.  You are contagious to people who have not had chicken pox.|`|wi4UwVVSaa	You should go to the doctor, because he can prescribe anti virals that would lessen the effects of shingles and shorten the course of the disease. You cannot give shingles to another person, it is the chicken pox virus that the person themselves has in their system from having chickenpox, and it surfaces when your immune system is down. You can however give chicken pox to someone who has not had it.|`|83fa704b39514e2e2dbba9e3fd6ef4eeaa	Are you positive it's Shingles? I recently had them and went to dr and they gave me valtrex. It is not contagious unless someone actually rubbed it or you had open blisters and someone got it on their mouth, eyes, etc. (Yes that's gross). They can be very painful so I would go to the doctor. Good Luck!
gHR4vlcDaa	Depression?

Don't lose hope though, just keep getting out there and trying, keep giving people chances because people are sadly a dime a dozen and it takes a long time to find that person who is going to make you feel loved no matter what.  Find someone who likes to listen more than talk and find someone who enjoys quiet things so you can really enjoy the time you spend with them.    But trust me, I'm sure you're beautiful in ways you don't realize yet. Take it from a girl with a serious disability, beauty can be made by finding it from within and just standing up proud and not letting anyone tell you otherwise. You can build confidence in yourself even before you find the love.  Just keep telling yourself "I am worth it, I am pretty in my own way".|`|QjoWA99Yaa	You have to love yourself before anyone else can love you. I know that sounds impossible but do something that will make you feel like an amazing person (not that you aren't already). Is there a cause or charity you feel passionate about? Maybe you could go and volunteer and help fundraise or something like that. The fact you have done something so positive off your own back will make you feel wonderful and who knows, you might meet other like-minded people? Good luck!
QK4r41Hqaa	okay, you need to eat BEFORE 3pm.    Bananas are low cal. and they help give a boost to your matabolism. You'll burn calories better if you eat them in the morning, as a snack, and before you go to bed.    I would sugest um... Chicken and LOTS of fruits.  You need some meat, and fruits (or veggies) wwould be good after not eathing anything for so long..    If you eat before you exersise you'll be able to burn off more, beanut butter sandwhiches as good to eat before a work out.  Not really close to when you'll start, but like 20 mins before maybe..    and 600cals isn't that much. I would try working out longer, you'll need to build up though, so take it a bit more at a time.  Again, do not NOT eat. thats a bad idea.|`|MJt1xeQ7aa	well since u exercised , ur metabolism will continue to burn calories throughout the day. so u can eat healthily without worrying. go have some chicken with some salad.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You need to eat!!  Eating less than you burn means eating less than you burn OVERALL.  The average person burns 1800-2200 calories, so if you want to lose weight, you could eat 2000 calories and exercise still (of course this is average, to check how much YOU need, go to http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie... and put your stats in).|`|hIe7qLN5aa	oh no u have it soo wrong    u can eat    without doing any exercise you burn 2000 calories just by living...Now you have burned 2600 calories....so if you eat lets say 1200 calories then you are 1400 calories up for the day.....    they say if you want to loose 1lb a week that you should be 500 calories up for the day....to you are doing tripple good!!!!    everyone should eat at least 1200 calories a day...otherwise you body attacks your muscle rather than your fat    eat good calories.|`|9iXGakohaa	No, you need to eat more than you burn. By eating when you are hungry, you are helping to speed up your metabolism even more and by giving your body the nutrients it needs this helps it to burn more fat, and add muscle. If you don't eat enough your body won't burn the fat as fast because it feels starved and tries to hold on to everything it can. So try to eat approx a 1,500 cal a day diet. (varies by person)
D0JsiC0Paa	I have read the DSM-IV, The Diagnostic Manual for the diagnosis of mental disorders, which if you have worked in the mental health field, you will be aware of - and if she were to deliniate those symptoms to a practitioner and they were to take it straight from the book -    She fits perfectly into the category for 'Schizophrenia' -     The presence of core symptoms such as 'the voices'; as coming from an external source and not an 'internal' source such as in the head - one that is the source of thought insertion, or 'two' talking to each other - and hallucinations together with - one's actions or emotions being influenced by these third parties - the voices anger = her anger.    It's a terrible thing to suffer from, but I'm sure you know where to get her the appropriate help - if you're in the UK, you need to start with the bottom up and take it to a GP who will get her on the referal ladder.     As for your referall to occults and dark practices, I'm not saying I'm adverse or partial to them - I've dabbled in them myself and they've given me nightmares since; but I would not use it as a basis as I've come to believe that devout belief in such things can lead to these kind of experiences; even if they are all in the mind, but then we're dealing with a sketchy cause and effect relationship - where she may have been drawn to such practices by these experiences and delusions in the first place.    Good Luck|`|gHR4vlcDaa	I dont even need to comment Shan has got it pegged, that what I was going to say! :)|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Schizophrenia does begin with hearing voices, and the other symptoms come later, I am pretty sure, as the disease spreads thru the brain and damages other parts. (People with schizophreania have the hearing centers of the brain damaged by the disease first, so they really do hear the voices!)  She should see a psychiatrist immediately. If it is some other form of pschosis, like from depression or bipolar, the clinician will hopefully catch that.|`|kpKBwOcnaa	her mental health does not sound very healthy, maybe your girlfriend could consider seeing a GP or a mental health professional but also maybe she could consider keeping a journal to log her episodes to see if they are happening around stress or when the room is quiet or at times she feels under pressure, look for rational explanations though, not supernatural imaginative ones, she may just be having some mental disturbance but if she starts to take care of her mental health now, could maybe see a vast improvement in her symptoms?
T104hZzMaa	You can break your hymen doing a number of things, from bike-riding to tampon insertion. So you may have broken it, even if there was no blood. (Not all women bleed when their hymen is ruptured.) But there is no need to worry, as it will not affect whether or not you're considered a virgin and won't make much of a difference when it comes to sex.|`|qEy34ueZaa	It definitely is. The experience varies among women. Unless the stretching of the hymen is done very gradually and with proper lubrication, the pain factor is always there, along with some degree of bleeding. Again, that will vary among women, from female interviews I have read. Your doctor will be able to answer your question, so why not ask him/her in your next visit?|`|qPd5G3dSaa	if you didnt bleed most likely not... this was probbably caused by whatever you pushed in was not lubricated enough|`|4BBjhHAnaa	You probably tore it at least a little.  Using a tampon or even horse back riding can cause your hymen to tear!    When you break your hymen completely the first time you have sex there is a little bit of blood afterwords.  If there was no bleeding then your hymen is probably still mostly intact.|`|CTUaoyhXaa	If there was blood coming with the pain then I guess you have.

2facaa92a7738bf74922d878ba7e3647aa	Almost everyone knows that loosing weight is about changing your eating habits to a considerable extent. What many people don't realize is that this cannot just be done overnight! If you try to make drastic changes in your diet too quickly, chances are that you will only be frustrated and disappointed with your loosing that belly fat.     Also, there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise. In this article I will give two great Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat.     1. Avoid self-sabotaging train of thoughts: Self-sabotaging thoughts will do you more harm than think. Just imagine, if you always think that you cannot do the things you need to do in order to lose weight, how can you ever loose that belly fat? If you think that you cannot do sit-ups and push-ups, you are probably jumping to conclusions and being too overly self-criticalal even before you have tried any exercises! If you think that doing thirty push-ups is too much for you, then start small. Start with 10-15 push-ups, and thank yourself once you have done it successfully! Then try to add one or two extra push-ups every day to your routine until you reach your target of thirty. You see, when you start small, it becomes much easier to reach your goals!    Instead of thinking too much about it, just take action and DO it! The amount of time you spend on thinking and criticizing yourself, you may as well as spend it on some exercise. While the former will do you no good, the latter will help you burn fat and loose that belly fat fast!     2. Get help & support: Proper support is important in order to keep you on point and motivated. Without support, you won't be able to lose weight successfully. That is why it is essential that you enlist the support of your friends and family who understand you and support your goals. It is also essential that you choose a weight loss program which offers support to its members in the form of a support group or forum. In a forum, you will get support and tips from your peers and experts alike!   Surround yourself with supportive people and stay away from the negative people who can only find faults with you!   If you follow these Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat there is no reason why you won't be able to lose that belly fat! Remember that you can achieve whatever you believe or think in your mind. If you believe you can loose belly fat fast, then you WILL! I know that this sounds very much like The Secret and The Law of Attraction but it is very true!|`|IAqNJQtnaa	the ideal answer is don't eat so much- i mean like amount wise. When u eat doesn't eat in big portions for example say u are have a sandwich for lunch and  are still hungry don't have another sandwich have a yogurt  like fat free.

Dkk5HwbEaa	Age, weight can help narrow down your symptoms, but they're not descriptive enough.    Make sure you are hydrated, get plenty of exercise etc.    Have you been screened for lupus or Lyme disease?    Maybe growing pains, or a degenerative disease.
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

But if you feel that you are having a heart attack - go ahead and cough. Take a deep breath each time before you cough. Cough hard and often. The coughing action stimulates the heart.

"Cough CPR" may well work but the research is not quite nailed down yet.    This is one area where prevention is DEFINITELY better than treatment. Try hard not to have a heart attack!
H0aiDO9Paa	Inclined sit-ups. Stretching is easy to learn. But there is a right way and a wrong way to stretch. The right way is a relaxed, sustained stretch with your attention focused on the muscles being stretched. The stretches should be slow and easy, not unlike a long yawn and stretch done upon awakening. The wrong way (unfortunately practiced by many people), is to bounce up and down, or to stretch to the point of pain. These methods can actually do more harm than good. And good luck.|`|SaGyNwqHaa	If she stretches normally, she might have pulled a muscle, it happens to me all the time.

While 155 is by no means fat, you may feel uncomfortable because you never weighed this much before, people carry their weight differently, not everybody looks the same at the same weight. If you feel you need to loose, try to get back to your normal 135, it's all about what makes you feel good, good luck.|`|eJsR7BZvaa	Ok since you have kids I'm assuming it's probably hard for you to find time to exercise (I know because my mom has that problem) so something quick and easy involving your diet would probably be ideal for you right now. Try taking two tablespoons of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar in a glass of distilled water before and after you eat. Also, try to cut out soft drinks and increase your water intake, about 75-80 oz a day would be the right amount according to your body weight. If you already drink that much, then drink probably 16-20 oz more but make sure you spread it out; in other words don't drink it all in one sitting! And, if you can, eat less carbs, more lean protein, and as many veggies as possible.   Hope this helps!   Good luck!

Be sure you read the directions!! It can be harmful to you, but really only if you use it right after you shave. Also be sure to apply it at night and then wear a regular deodorant in the morning. But this works wonders. I don't sweat period under my arms anymore.

I had it for most of my life and went through all the usual treatments, including anticholinergics, botox, drysol, and surgery. Eventually it would always return. I had seen many specialists for other symptoms as well, such as chills, headaches, muscle spasms, brief sensory blackouts, and chemical food intolerances. My blood sugar would also drop to hypoglycemic level. Hair/urine mineral tests showed traces of heavy metals and several mineral deficiencies.    Years later I saw a naturopathic doctor and did plenty of reading and experimenting. To put it simply, hyperhidrosis the body's reaction to a foreign toxin, allergen, or chemical intolerance.    The solution was detoxification of heavy metals, elimination of food allergens (gluten/casein from wheat/dairy, preservatives, colors, dyes, GMOs), switching to organic/vegetarian diet, and supplements (minerals, probiotics, B vitamins), and removal of metallic dental fillings.

kA0xb0MVaa	Odd smells often are a precursor for several neurological  diseases.  Epilepsy is one of them.  Are there any other symptoms that you know of, even if it seems unimportant to you.    With no other symptoms of any neurological variances and you are otherwise in good health, this likely just a glitch in your system.  I would get checked out by your doctor at your earliest convenience, just to be safe.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	It is either phantosmia or parosmia.    Phantosmia is when you smell smells that aren't there at all and can be caused by brain damage or temporal lobe seizures.  These are seizures that only affect a small part of the brain and you will normally remain conscious during them.    Parosmia is when there is a smell present, but your brain is interpreting it wrong.  This can be caused by a cold or damage to the olfactory system.      So . . . if you've had a cold recently or hit your nose, I'd wait a few weeks and see if it goes away.  If not, you might want to see a doctor once you have insurance.  But, make sure you don't let on that this is a pre-existing condition!!  Then if you need medication you won't be covered!!!    Of course, it could always be due to pregnancy.  If you say that's impossible, then I guess we have to believe you, don't we.|`|GLJkGgloaa	Hi Carrie,  I had that last week a week before my period.  It was freaking me out also.

Im also 4 months pregnant but ive seen my consultant today and asked him very clearly about it and he says that it wouldnt be down to my hormones or anything so i know its not to do with the baby.    i hope you clear things up cos it does make you feel like youre losing the plot sometime!    good luck! :D|`|3hkArqvbaa	You don't have epilepsy, do you? That can cause that. I'm guessing you probably don't if you're posting this question. Let's see. That's pretty weird. I would say it probably has something to do with your sinuses, like your mother-in-law said. There actually are such things as smell disorders, often triggered by an illness or injury (commonly head injury or upper respiratory illness). While doing some research, I came across this sentence.  "Still other people may perceive a smell that isn't present at all." This sounds like you, and this is one smell disorder, so I would probably get it checked out by a doctor once you get your insurance figured out. I attached the smell disorder page for you- Maybe it will help you to read it and get more information about it. Hope this helps?
T104hZzMaa	You're all right. The pill releases hormones into your body and when you abruptly stop taking it your body goes into withdrawal. You can have mood swings, yeast infections, and irregular spotting. These should clear up soon on their own (except the yeast infection, get an OTC medication for that) and then your body will be back to normal.   Talk to your doctor about switching birth control pills. It may help.   If the symptoms don't clear up or you become worried, go see your doctor. He or she can reassure you and provide treatment if necessary.|`|Xh3Q8jqXaa	The spotting that you're experiencing is called withdrawal bleeding and it is normal after discontinueing a birth control pill.     Now, are you positive you have a yeast infection or is it just increased cervical mucus? (white or clear vaginal discharge)  because increased cervical mucus after stopping the pill is normal also. While you are on birth control, the pill helps to thicken cervical mucus for the purpose of stopping sperm from entering, therefore it's decreased. So stopping the pill will cause you to have an increase.|`|AEAS7A9naa	Your bodies getting used to not being on the pill. Its normal. If it gets worse talk to a doctor OK?  Robin

It is created to remove Moles, Warts & Skin Tags naturally, without the pain and hassle of surgery.    I was a little skeptical before I actually purchased the product, but it does come with a 100% guarantee so that helped ease my fear. I ended up buying from www.mole-wartremoval.com it is a web store by amazon.com, so that also took my skepticism away.    Since insurance covering your surgery won't be an option, this way just might help you.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	Insurance does not cover the removal of skin tags, no matter where they are.  Shaving under your arm pits is your choice, it is not a must, not everyone does it, it is not a health hazzard. I realize that to you it is very important, but insurance companies are cutting down on everything.  They certainly will not cover anything that is considered something that is not a MUST.  Maybe you can find a doctor who will do it for not a lot of money, or write it up another way if it is someone you are close with.  But don't have them put it in as a removal of a skin tag.|`|GeUAhqXpaa	yeah i have one on my right armpit. but i dont really shave there to often i guess    you can go to the germatolgistic(not spelled correctly)    they can zap it off sorta and it will fall off

(You right)  Baby that's what's up|`|4mwVxvLOaa	don't worry it's not that fat|`|UxdjYFJaaa	I'm not an expert.    But I am going thru the same thing and have successfully dropped pounds before (I went from like 137lbs to 129lbs and maintained it doing a few simple things).     First I would advise to not drink soda ever.   For me that is probably the single biggest calorie-laden thing I consume that I can cut from my diet. For you, maybe its something else.   Whatever it may be, pick something fatty/sugary you eat that contributes to an unhealthy diet and stop consuming it.     Eat slightly smaller portions. Don't starve yourself, but try eating smaller portions. Become in tuned with your body and stop eating when you are no longer hungry. Its hard for me personally because my parents were always the type to make me finish "everything on my plate" and tell me not to "waste food", but stopping yourself before you feel stuffed is a good idea too.    I am NOT saying to starve yourself. Eat meals. Eat stuff you like, providing its healthy and you don't eat too much.    Finally, what I do when I want to drop weight successfully is physical activity for an hour a day. Some people can get away with 1/2 hour a day but I find I need an hour because I don't have that much weight to lose and I'm fond of eating things like pizza.     For physical activity I have a treadmill and I use it every day religiously. Only for an hour though, and I don't work myself to death.  For others, maybe walking to work, or walking the dog, or walking/jogging with a friend may be a good way to get more physical activity in your life.    Now for me, it usually takes a month before I notice results. I don't weigh myself because I find its discouraging, but I stick with my excersize and I eat smaller portions & avoid soda. I also don't obsess over what I eat, but I do excersize every day. It's key.   This regimen didn't make me buff either, but I did drop from a size 7 to a size 5 (American size) so I was pretty happy. :)  I also felt a lot healthier too and found I had more energy.     Best of luck~ :)|`|1aXaXUYUaa	work out at a gym and everyday go to the cardio classes. Also, make salads and make ur own sause with a table spoon of olive oil and a table spoon of vinegar. this dressing is healthy and will decrease ur craving for sugary foods. also go for walks everyday. walking is great exersise!!! Take stairs instead of elevator, every chance u get to walk or move, take it! also go to www.prevention.com, there are vids of workouts u can do! ALSO stretchig is good. just put 100% effort and ull get results...good luck hun!|`|BVwDoV81aa	Get that radio and boogie those inches off, it should be fun, stick with cutting out the sugary foods it does work stick with it gal....!

They are easy and you don't have to get changed because they won't make you sweat.|`|w9iLU1zsaa	Eat every 3 hours, something like:  7am - breakfast (boiled egg with brown bread, or/and small bowl of oatmeal)  10am: 2 fruit (or 1 fruit and 1 yoghurt or juice (cranberry)  1pm: dinner: chicken/fish/meat with 2 veg (one green, one other)  4pm: 2 fruit  7pm: Supper  10pm: yoghurt    The more you eat earlier in the day the better (more energy, you wont be hungry late etc.)- eat less at night. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst      ok, if ur craving sugar you couldve pinworms - you can ask the chemist about them, they can give u a tablet but NB seek doctors advice, it will supress the intense craving/appetite for sugar    fish will help you lose weight, as it speeds up ur metabolism, it burns fat, so the fat u have on you now will be used as energy    NB eat starch with fish    NB when u speed up ur metabolism, it also affects ur mind - so u dont want to speed it up too much - keep a balance    green veg. - help ur brain relax, also stop u going crazy, always eat some greens daily    peas are good for energy    eggs also have selenium, which speeds metabolism - eggs are good for memory, carrots have the same      eat brown bread instead of white    if u are craving sugar - oranges are good - vitamin c is also another fat burner. Craving sugar - eat a banana, strawberries, a fruit youghurt, apple, orange juice, cranberry juice|`|EL9jpUosaa	When I go to track I'll run two miles and I always end up losing at least one pound when I get back home and if you don't want to run then you can also walk I just walk 10000 steps yesterday and lost two pounds and right after you eat make sure you do some exercises you can find really great ones at aol.com the have a whole variety of work out diet stuff. =]

IF you quit Pills mid cycle you will have a period. It's normal|`|OCHhJWpHaa	go back to ur gyno|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Your body is probably trying to regulate your hormones after being suddenly taken off the pill.  It may take a few cycles to get back to normal.  When you go in to see your gynecologist, tell her about it.  She may know something else about it and, if you are pregnant, you don't want to start taking birth control again!
Kk6wAZDtaa	Haha, I know how you feel. Yoga is a very ornate process and during this process people tend to think about what they have to do tommorrow... the next day... and so on. While meditating, make sure you THINK of... ready for this? NOTHING! Stressing out while meditating can put you in risk of feeling even more stressed out.    Back on topic.. I think the best place to look for an online yoga session can be on Youtube. If you must take it on the computer, then go ahead, but I suggest reading into the poses first (google) and then taking a little field trip into your back yard with your yoga mat right at sunrise. That's the most peaceful time to do so. Have fun with it! Don't stress about doing everything perfect when it comes to meditating... As long as you relax...

bcflMMJEaa	We all find our own ways that work best to manage our depression. I've suffered with it for my entire life (I'm 27 now) and only in the last 5 years have I learned ways that for me have helped me to recover from my depression. I am 90% better than I ever was before.  I linked down below one website that offers chat rooms and forums.    One piece of advice that I can give you is don't spend too much time talking about and thinking about and constantly reliving the past, look at today only and the future because you only make yourself worse by living in the past and you can't change it.     If you want more ideas go to the second link later tonight and look for Rain, we can talk further, if I'm not in there yet just wait and I'll be on eventually.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	take meds, Lexapro is great, was on it for three years and then slowly took myself off, depression usually does not go away, need counseling and script

Exv4AjqCaa	Just lower the amount of calories you eat and stay active.    DO keep using your whey protein, you should actually keep a good amount of protein in your diet so that your body stops (or atleast limits) the breakdown of muscle that takes place during a diet.    Its all about calories though, if you burn/use more calories in a day than you eat...you'll lose weight. The more you burn compared to the amount you eat...the faster you'll lose weight (to a point).|`|AYO33FC0aa	Well Protein really gonna help you out right now man, U need to stop tring to build if ur trying to cut. U need to dedicate most of your gym time to cardio, which ur not gonna need any more protein than u get in ur daily diet, that is as long as ur eating right which you should be if your serious about loosing the flab. Hold off on the powder till u think ur at a decent body fat % the start building.

Make sure you have good medical insurance.|`|MhfneF0xaa	No benefits to quitting masturbation, it's a healthy outlet for your sexual drive.    I do recommend you not watch porn. It only cheapens and degrades sex, and you don't want a cheapened and degraded outlook on sex when you marry.    Read what follows, and I wish you and your future wife much happiness!    Unless masturbation interferes with other activities, there is no such thing as too much. Many teen and pre-teen boys masturbate once or twice a day, and this pattern can continue into adulthood and middle age. More than this or less than this is also quite common.    If you masturbate often, you would want to watch your technique, so as not to chafe the skin on your penis. Other than this, no worries.    It will not interfere with your hormone (testosterone) production, it will not interfere with your growth and development, it will not cause acne, it will not affect your vision, it will not cause hair to grow in your palms, and it won't show. It is also not addictive. Masturbation will not contribute to baldness later in life.    Masturbation will absolutely not affect your future sex life. You will be able to "get off" just fine by other means in the future. It will not cause premature ejaculation (c**mming too fast). You cannot "run out" of sperm or semen, as these are replaced by your body on a continual basis. If you masturbate a good deal, or close together in time, you could notice a temporary reduction in semen, but it will build back up again.    There are some studies showing that regular ejaculation early in life can reduce the incidence of prostate cancer later on.|`|fCS6oecCaa	there are no benefits ,,,,,,,, just frustration.|`|5bknapOQaa	There aren't any.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	None.

f5R5BPTDaa	Welcome to drug addiction. Just because drugs aren't purchased on the black market doesn't mean they aren't addictive and harmful.  Adderall causes many serious health implications including but not limited to high blood pressure, liver and kidney damage, dependency, weight loss. Adderall is pharmaceutical speed. Doctors get paid for by the companies that make the drugs NO MATTER WHO they harm or in worst case scenarios KILL.  I am so sorry that no one in your family has been able to have your best interest in mind.  It is not your fault they put you on this drug when you were very young.  Drugs are bad but in this case, this is one of THE MOST harmful, most addictive drugs out there. You are going to have to kick this addiction or you will wish that your only problem was your loss of time/grades in doing so.  I know this is very difficult and I am so sorry for your pain.  It truly is wrong to put our children on drugs of this caliber in the name of "helping" them, it is complete nonsense.|`|gsfNJ00Jaa	If the medicine wasn't causing it, maybe u need to see about getting a different type of that medicine along with a blood pressure medicine. Do you think u need the adderall any more? Talk to your doctor. Maybe she can prescribe you something different.
D0JsiC0Paa	You know I've suffered from it regularly for 6 years, at least a couple of nights a week - which is highly unusual but harmless I'm told - and I see some horrible things like possessed relatives or the angel of death, and thought I was completely alone and possibly needed an exorcism at one point - but it also shocks me that people's experiences can be so familiar, with the leering shadows and figures, and the old hag.     Some people don't see anything though but I imagine that the experience is still quite disquieting, especially if it happens on a regular basis.     The only suggestion I've been able to come up with, as to why there is such uniformity of experience is either some evolutionary subconscious fear of being over-powered or killed by someone when you cannot move - and the rest I believe, at least the different manifestations of these figures are rooted in society and culture and our interpretation of these threats - our vulnerabilities in the face of these threats and the human fear of our own mortality.     In Japan its often described as being experienced as a feeling of being 'bound in metal' - which would tie in quite well with cultural fears of the conventional forms of opression.     The experiences of moving or floating may also simulate what has become our universal interpretation of a near-death experience and so we associate such figures as ghosts, wraiths and angels of death with the moment.     The old hag - being a witch - who puts curses on people and causes them to be haunted by these ghouls.    P.S. - among all these frightfully lucid episodes that I've had - I admit, one was incredibly funny - and involved little green men hitting me with their ray guns while I lay in bed unable to move - they sounded like they had had too much helium.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i just had one similar incident few weeks ago, scare the heck out of me.

If you have health insurance you pay your copay each visit.  A lot of specialty doctor co pays are $30...could be more or less.  Without insurance, Youre looking at about $125 per session (no joke).  If you cannot afford it, check with your local social services department and a lot of times they will counsel you based on income.  It can cost anywhere from nothing to $10 or $20.  Good luck, and take care.    EDIT:  Let me add that there are a lot of jerks on here that don't know what the hell they are talking about.  Drugs and happy movies are NOT going to help depression.  I know...I've been there.  I actually tried a couple of different doctors...but it really wasn't for me.  Each person is different, though.  I changed what was going on in my life and it helped.  I had been in a depressive fog for a while with ups and downs.  Now I feel I am rid of my depression, ever since getting my life in order.  But this isn't always the case.  My Dad appeared to have his life in order on the outside...but took his life December 2007.  I wish he'd have sought help.  It doesn't have to be that way, there is always a way out, and the fact that you're simply asking about the cost of a doctor is a good sign that you are aware you need guidance mentally.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	This is a very complicated question. It totally depends on the type of treatment you need and where you live. If you need therapy then that can run from $25/hour if you are very poor and you live in a city with a low cost clinic and you're willing to see an intern and your case is not that severe, to $200/hour if you have a severe case or you don't live in a larger city or you are wealthy. If you need medication then you have the cost of the psychiatrist, probably around $250 for a consultation and $200 for check ups (or a co-pay if you have insurance) plus the cost of the medication which could be as low as a $10 co-pay if you have insurance and you need medication that is available in generic form up to $350 per month or more if you need medication that is new and under patent. Or you could only need group therapy which would be around $100 per week, or maybe light therapy for seasonal depression which would cost you around $1200 for a light box. See... it all depends on what kind of depression you have and what treatment you need. Call your local department of health to get a good referral.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	It depends what type of treatment. Ask your doctor. But it is expected to cost $6000 to $10000, depending on how many treatments a patient needs. If you're depressed, I suggest you don't take medications. If you read the pill bottle labels, many of them state that doctor's are not entirely sure what causes depression nor if the medications will cure it. The pills give you a couple of side affects. Some patients have reported that their symptoms get worse and may cause you to become suicidal. Speak to a psychiatrist for other treament options.|`|gPrNqkVWaa	It depends on what meds you're going to take, how many meds you're going to take, if insurance covers it... there's a lot of factors involved so i'd speak with your doctor.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	nothing, its free, its in your mind...|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	If you have a free clinic you can go there.

9160437e7056f50bcacc2d31ad52d906aa	STOP popping the spots, also known as pimples and zits. This may make the pimple look worse due to inflammation and irritation. Popping a zit can spread infection under the skin and produce even more pimples than before. If you do pop a spot then immediately clean it with soap and water or rubbing alcohol in order to prevent infection. If a pimple erupts in a particularly bothersome place, learn how to target a single pimple. And if you're determined to pop, learn how to pop a pimple safely and properly.   Remove any make-up you have on. Wearing make-up can clog pores, making them dirty and causing pimples.   Use a mild soap for sensitive skin but it doesn't matter exactly what type of soap you use. It can be designed for acne-prone skin or not, but you will want to treat your skin gently. Harsh antibacterial soap may actually make your acne worse by irritating skin.   Remove dead skin cells regularly by exfoliating. Use a gentle scrub with natural defoliants like ground walnut shells, or use an over-the-counter chemical defoliant like salicylic acid or glycolic acid. Adding ground walnut shell to a thick moisturizer like cocoa butter can be effective too. Take caution, because over-exfoliating can actually increase the likelihood of acne by irritating the skin. Pat dry, rather than rubbing, since rubbing can cause irritation to the fresh skin you've just revealed.   Use a good toner. Spray onto face or wipe on with a cotton ball and wipe off with a clean, dry cotton ball. This gets rid of excess cleanser and tightens pores. Good, inexpensive choices include plain witch hazel for normal to dry skin, lemon juice, or 3% hydrogen peroxide for oily skin. 70% ethyl rubbing alcohol can also be used for severe oiliness, but it can really dry out your skin and irritate it more. Some toners are medicated, and this stage is the best for using a medicated product if you're only going to use one medication.   Bacteria in pores is one cause of spots. Reduce the amount of bacteria by using toners containing anti-bacterial agents like alcohol, peroxide and benzalkonium chloride, and by using creams that contain benzoyl peroxide (ask your doctor about benzaclin, with moisturizer if you have dry skin, as it works better than just plain benzoyl because benzoyl takes up to 8 weeks before improvement is seen) which kill bacteria as well as cause the skin to regenerate faster.   Maintain a routine. Most acne treatments take time to work. It usually takes between two and eight weeks before you see any significant improvement, so you are going to have to be patient. Once you've gotten your acne cleared up, it's important to continue with the treatment that's working so it does not return.   If all else fails, contact a doctor. Mild antibiotics that are available only by prescription can help reduce acne. Keep in mind though, that the widespread overuse (taking antibiotics when you really don't need them or for something they don't treat) and misuse (not taking medication for the specified amount of time) of antibiotics has led to the development of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria. That means that the antibiotics won't work for the things they used to (including your acne).   Keep hair off of your face if at all possible. If you want to keep your bangs, then consider taking showers regularly or keeping your forehead clean with oil-dabbing cloths / clean tissues / etc.   Get good sleep. Stress increases your skin's oiliness, which, combined with sweat and dirt, can clog pores and cause pimples. (Change your pillowcase frequently.)   Acne medications may cause your skin to initially break out worse than before because all FDA-approved acne medications (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur) are causing your skin to regenerate faster. This brings existing acne pimples already under your skin (but not visible yet) to the surface, which in turn causes a massive but fortunately temporary break out. Give the medications time to work -- about one to two weeks -- and you will notice a big difference in the quality of your skin.   See a dermatologist if over the counter remedies do not work. They specialize in skin care and can prescribe you medicines that help you improve it.   Drink plenty of water. Staying well hydrated can help your condition improve, because the "waste management" control system in your body requires a lot of water to do its job. Without enough water, the body has difficulty removing some waste products efficiently.   Look for face washes which contain the active ingredient benzoyl peroxide. This is the key ingredient in some of the best face washes. use a 5-10% benzoyl peroxide of mild to moderate acne and 10% for severe.   Try smashing one tablet of aspirin in a small bowl, then adding lemon juice to the mixture. Aspirin is acetesalicylic acid, chemically related to salicylic acid. Apply to the affected areas overnight. It boosts the healing process while reducing redness.   Try putting toothpaste (past|`|MT9lqcJQaa	vitamin c,a and b help reduce acne significantly and use a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide medicine if that doesn't help go to a dermatologist|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Watch your diet.

AA10719818	If you have mono, an antibiotic will not help you.  Mono is a virus, only something like steroids will help you to feel better,  but nothing will cure it. It has to go away on its own.    You should gargle with some warm salt water as often as you can.  Put warm compresses on your neck if your glands are swollen.      A doctor will presecribe prednisone to help you.  It is a steroid and will calm any inflammation.  You should consider asking your doc about that, because if your tonsils or glands are swollen, and causing you to spit more, prednisone will help.

WXpdkbG8aa	It's possible to get your period through pregnancy and generally you will only get false negatives toward the beginning when the hCG is low in your urine. The further you get in your pregnancy, the more effective a pregnancy test is because the hCG in your body increases. It seems as though if you were pregnant, it would be clear by this point.

Just because your doctor can't find it, doesn't mean it's not there. I suggest finding another doctor that will look at all your symptoms together and find out whats wrong!! Pain in the left leg is commonly seen in connection with the heart, or pulmonary system. Blood clots, heart problems ect...The fact that your leg "gives" says that something neurological may be wrong......And brusies that won't go away for months at a time can be many things. So I would say, don't stop looking for an answer, and find another doctor....Good Luck hon!!!|`|gsfNJ00Jaa	U might want to go to the ER. They can do more tests than a doctor can. Make sure you have ur appendix tested if u still have them. Excrutiating cramps can be many things from stress, weight, or something wrong with your ovaries and uterus. Explain to the ER doctor very well. Keep a record of your pain and take it with you. Scale your pain on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain ever. Also, take a pic of the bruises. Please-make sure to explain clearly and keeping a journal will let the doc know what exactly may be going on. He can order CT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, bloodwork, urine tests and a pelvic exam.

hr3r5Vpoaa	I have been in a group therapy setting before. My interview at the beginning was only about an hour; I'm not sure why yours is so long. They asked me questions about my expectations, and general things about the group to see if it was a good option for me.     I thought that the group was helpful for treating anxiety. It helped me realize that there are other people around me who have the same issues with anxiety. In fact, some of the people had the same experiences as me. It's nice to get to interact with them to see their methods of coping... if they have any at the time. I'm doing individual therapy at the same time. I think this combination is really helping me, because I have things in my past that really bother me. Overall, it's a good move to be in group. If you don't find it beneficial to you, there are always other options!
VPlKbDplaa	Hi Carr...    Apart from what Doctor J as suggested as that is a possibility (selenium toxicity), it is possible you have been exposed to some other chemical that could have caused this, such as tellurium. In addition to having a garlic odour it can cause malaise. It is thus possible that exposure to some chemical such selenium or tellurium be the cause of your feeling unwell. Selenium is a vital element for health but over-exposure can cause harm. You are less likely to come into contact with tellurium but there are documented cases of tellurium exposure and toxicity and it is harmful.  I suggest you visit your doctor asap and explain your symptoms and ask if its possible you could be displaying signs of toxicity to something from your environment and get him/her to arrange necessary blood tests to rule this out unless your doctor can come up with some other viable explanation.     I have also read that fresh garlic buds contain relatively large  amounts of volatile tellurium compounds, and it has been  suggested this accounts for the characteristic odour of  garlic:  http://www.stda.net/publications/B1996-3...    Perhaps there are other plant/herb sources that you may have ingested that can act similarly with respect to giving a garlic odour. Nothing springs to mind though. Anyway, get to your doctor please asap to rule out toxicity.     Best wishes for a speedy recovery.  Take care.|`|AA10481903	Excessive intake of Selenium can lead to a garlic odor on the breath.

PAvYZJK2aa	yes.. and also the inner skin|`|rllnRDNmaa	wrong section|`|VTZpfTcaaa	Whats this got to do with mental health?|`|q1YDp1y3aa	you're partially correct. The penis is actually made of two different types of skin. The head and the inner foreskin are made of mucous membrane- like the inside of your mouth, or eyelids. The shaft is normal skin. mucous membrane is naturally a different color than skin. When you were circumcised, the mucous membranes where exposed. They dried out and toughen up, but may still have a slightly different color than the surrounding, natural skin. So the spot where it changes colors is likely the place of your scar if you have one. not all people do scar, but the point of the change is likely where the incision was made. -Neb|`|4arnbpUCaa	The scar and discoloration is a result of your circumcision.

Do like 10. Then next week, 12 or something. Slowly push your limitations. Then with dumbbells, put your hands in front. Then hands straight out beside you. Up, down. Up,down. Eat protein. Stretch before you work out. However boring stretching is, it is VERY important. It makes sure you do not injure your muscles and disable yourself forever. Try to push those too. An hour or 30 minutes of these workouts a day in total will make you REALLY strong. The burn makes you feel great, knowing you get stronger with every push-up, every lift.

Good luck!|`|aCCUQQu4aa	I wear a loose sports bra at night.

The larger your breasts the more support you will need to both prevent drooping and to make you comfortable however wearing one 24/7 is certainly not necessary.    Wearing underwired bras constantly, especially when you are still young, can cause the tissue at the bottom of the breast to stretch and deform causing premature drooping of the breasts. If you want to wear a bra all the time then wear a soft cup bra or crop-top type bra when you are at home and through the night.|`|5ciDai7Paa	um how old are you? Your age could be a factor, however I believe you must just be stressing out to much. I wear a bra almost all the time except when I sleep, and my breast are just as perky as before. It could be your chest is just getting larger so it needs more space. However if you're really stressed about this you should probably talk to your guardian about it.|`|MG7CLjtjaa	Yes except for when I go to sleep.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	i do breast enhancing exercises that seem to work very well for me. my breasts are perky (at least that's what my brother's friends tell me. )  i know that the day is coming (not too soon i hope)  when they will need a little help. i do buy my bras at victoria's secret  and love the way they fit but nothing is like them bouncing up and down and hearing the boys immature whistling and other stupid sounds they make|`|7pG8TA1Maa	all the time for the most part... sometimes i go without at night if it get on my nerves or either i put on a sports bra. but for the most part yea|`|eGlWY9KXaa	Yah. i wear a bra all the time. i  ncluding when i sleep.  Im a 34c  and 15 years old and i dont want them to sag.

I wear padded tanks, or sport bras at home cause I just can't seem to find a totally comfortable bra yet =/    any brands for those of you who wear them all the time?     but i would definitely wear them throughout my day. It really does prevent them from sagging in the long run.|`|WhTaGJ5Daa	i wear mine all the time! i dont want them to sag! most of the time i sleep with it on too|`|AA12020853	All day except when sleeping. You should too especially if you wear loose shirts and are very active. They will sag!! They should naturally sag over time but you might experience extreme sagging otherwise. Its okay not to wear one once in a while, around the house or with a low cut dress but everyday will definitely result in sagging over time.|`|RBVq4SZLaa	i usually wear mine all the time, or at least i used to for quite a while. Lately i've been sleeping in some of my boyfriends clothes and tshirts, and so i havn't slept in it as often, but i still usually wear it 24/7|`|QK5oaL4oaa	I have huge boobs, 36DD, and I hate bras! I wear them when I go out and take them off as soon as I get home. Urgh, they're annoying. It doesn't make sense to wear them as you sleep, they're not going to get saggy if you lie down (gravity makes them sag... when you're lying down gravity isn't working against you). I don't think there is any real correlation between breast sagginess and amount of time spent wearing a bra, if you're boobs are big, they will sag as you age no matter what, if they're small, they probably won't. I've also heard wearing a bra can restrict the growth of your breasts, although I don't buy into that either. By the way, my boobs aren't saggy (although I am only 20). If it's uncomfortable, don't wear them. If you feel uncomfortable not wearing a bra, wear it.|`|e9bd9T1Taa	I wear mine all the time even when I'm going to bed.

I take the time to really check the fit of my bras, making sure there there are no bulges, pinching, binding, or poking, and that the cups fit comfortably and give me adequate support.  When I am at home or just running errands, I tend to wear light weight sports bras, the kind you can get inexpensively at places like Walmart.  This way, I am not jiggling all over the place, I have some support, and I can save wear and tear on my real bras.  How much your breasts will start to sag depend on a lot of different factors such as breast size, weight loss and gain, child bearing and nursing, and heredity, as much as on how often you wear a bra.    A suggestion; Get yourself properly fitted for a bra.  Most quality lingerie stores and high end department stores, Nieman Marcus comes to mind, have a fitter.  I remember Oprah did a show with the stars of the British version of "What Not To Wear", and I believe it was something like 3 out of 5 women were wearing the wrong size or style of bra.  You'll be surprised on how much of difference that will make.  You don't have to purchase a lot of expensive bras, but do buy one the fitter helps you pick out, and use it to judge the fit of other bras you may purchase.    Here's a good article:  http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Buy_a_Bra|`|lMK6kwzsaa	i always wear it but when i go to sleep i take it off...my boobs need to breathe haha|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	i wear it all day but take it off when i sleep to let them breathe|`|3bsvBa8taa	i dont think they sag more when you dont wear one..  but i wear mine all day, then take it off when i sleep  if you wear one when you sleep, it tends so smush them a lso|`|juBJxzasaa	NEVER EVER just let them hang
JxDE5C85aa	i think you should see a doctor or you can  Try this get warm/hot ( not extremeley hot water) water, get a paper towel and wet it using the water and keep it on your eyelid until it gets cold. What this does is drain out the liquid that has made your eyes puffy. When your eyes start to water, just let it drain. You can blink if  you want.
HdEnrf0gaa	if you're tense then it will hurt. Relax and let your muscles relax. Pee right after you have sex, if you don't you might get an urinary tract infection. i haven't had it popped but go visit http://www.gurl.com/|`|838VJJGvaa	That is what I hear from most people.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Yes, but not a lot or for long. Also, you will probably bleed a little bit, but you might not even notice until you go to pee the next morning (I didn't).  And if you and your partner are doing it right, it is definitely worth it!!    Just make sure you are ready, it is with someone you really care about and who cares about you, and ALWAYS use protection!|`|qcS20U9eaa	I broke my hymen with a tampon & it didn't hurt.

DptJXo7Caa	obviously it depends a lot on the kid, their friends, their school, their surroundings, their parents, etc. but most kids will start smoking in junior high/early high school generally speaking.     of course not all kids are like this. a good friend of mine and i are both "potheads" but he has been smoking since he was 11 or 12 whereas i didnt start until the summer before my senior year in high school. now im not using the averages between us to determine my answer but perhaps these are extremes.    dont expect a large percentage of 12, 13, or 14 year olds to smoke, but dont expect anything less of them. and NO, none of your kids are "too good, too smart, too well raised" to smoke.|`|qrZOrElUaa	It depends what kind of back round they have or what type of parents they have.

I started smoking weed at 16.  The best thing to do is to talk to your kids and TELL THE TRUTH (if you know it).  Kids get plenty of lies and scare tactics out of cops, tv, and school.  Tell them the truth for once.  Might earn you some respect points.|`|c3M0E2tpaa	once we are in high school, it mostly depends on when someone introduces it in the environment the kid lives in.  i know many people that started in grade 7 and 8, but in my school we didn't really have much to do with it until we moved to high school.|`|QVfOsrO4aa	around like when they are in 6th - 7th grade.|`|EgHTYGH2aa	uhhh idk, but they never should!|`|d2tUoLHNaa	6th ,,,7th or 8th........than they usually kip doin it....|`|UReU5V9Faa	i started in summer of 8th grade|`|SXYtLoeoaa	I didn't start until I was a sophomore, but most people I know started before freshman year.|`|7XyIyNSnaa	12 is when most people I know started smoking it.|`|QWEq5ms0aa	around age 15-16  or @ least thats wen me and my friends just started.  legalize itttt|`|aXnVFFUkaa	usually before they grow up

9l0GdKbbaa	Minor episodes of aggressive behavior are common in some patients with epilepsy. The confusion that follows seizures can lead to aggressive behavior. Rarely, the seizure itself may lead to directed aggression.   Although post-ictal psychotic aggression is usually not severe, when it is driven by prominent delusions and hallucinations, it can result in self-destructive acts or serious violence.     Not sure how the weight gain comes into play, unless the seizures caused an increase in appetite resulting in weight gain.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Those go hand-in-hand w/ bi-polar disorder or hypomania.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Jessica,    This is perfectly normal sweetheart. The knots you describe are swollen glands    and you will sometimes when you get older have such painful breasts that you will have to sleep in a bra just for the support.     You may find that your breasts swell near  you period time as well this is also normal. Some girls have to wear a larger size bra when this happens.    Love Mel.X
0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	The muscle is strengthened by any motion that folds your arm, with your hand being pulled to your shoulder. To maximize this movement, keep your elbows directly at your sides, and don't move them. Then lift objects upwards toward your shoulders without rocking your body back and forth or removing your elbows from your sides. Spread your feet shoulder width apart, bend knees just a tad, back straight and lift weight toward your shoulder. Also, try to look forward and not down, so as not to strain your neck. If you want to see yourself working out, then face a mirror, but try not to look down. You don't need to reach your shoulder with the weights, but try to at least bend your arm so that it's slightly more than halfway there.    If you don't have barbell weights, you can lift paint buckets, buckets of water, milk cartons, juice cartons, backpack with books in it. Anything with a handle that you can comfortably grip.    Try to keep your wrists nice and straight. If you have to bend them to lift objects, then you're lifting too much weight. Keep in mind, you don't need a lot of weight with this exercise. It's the repitition of doing it consecutively that will really work the muscle out. Aim to have enough weight so that you can do 12-20 reps. Try to do at least 3 sets of 20 reps. Taking a moment to recover in between sets. Aim to feel the muscle "burn" by the 12th rep. If you don't feel a burn, then add a little more weight until you can feel a burn by the 12th rep. The "burn" is GOOD. The burn is what lets you know you're working your muscle out. The burn is what makes the muscle grow. Don't stop when you feel the burn. It may be torture, but always try to squeeze out 6-8 more reps after you start to feel the burn.    Ok then! Peace!!!|`|8GIPhJqwaa	Hi - Physiotherapist here - push-ups actually don't strengthen your biceps, they are primarily for your chest and triceps.  Pull-ups (I'm assuming you mean from a high bar) do work your biceps but this is actually a multi-muscle group exercise which won't target your biceps specifically.  So, best bicep specific exercise - bicep curls, either in sitting or standing (or if you have a weight bench - especially one that inclines or declines, then in lying). With elbow(s) braced so they don't move around during the exercise, holding a weight in each hand or using a curl bar, extend your elbow(s), make sure you don't hyper-extend them, and then bend your elbows fully, also make sure you keep your wrists strong.  You can vary curls depending on the angle of your body to your arm, and the path the weight takes as you curl, it should be easy enough to find some basic moves, then some more advanced ones on-line, try a fitness/sports magazine website - they should have good illustrations. Be careful, remember to stretch and don't overdue the weight at first - you can damage your biceps - good luck!|`|vHrWBD0Baa	bicep curls with dumbells. more reps are encouraged for a better result.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	I know it sounds like the end of the world, but just ignore it - someone else will do something that will take the attention off of you soon enough.  Unfortunately, leaving class will just add fuel to the fire - it's hard, but stick it out as best as you can.  If you feel you have to say something, say something like  "damn - it's pretty pathetic that you're still talking about that",  "glad I could give you something to talk about - obviously you're bored" or something along those lines.   It's high school - there's always going to be drama, and you just happen to be the target of the week.

Are you a junior this year or a senior?   Look into possibly completing your degree online (many states now have online high schools) or look into transferring to your local community college to get both H.S. and college credits at the same time.   Look for alternatives, I didn't know they were out there and I sure wish I had.      Now, I'm about 5 years out of H.S. and I'm totally over everything and trust me I know how tough it is, so don't give up hope.  Look for alternatives and talk to your counselor about alternatives and don't give up on them even.

Know that you're better than that. Focus on your work, get good grades and know that you're gonna make something real special out of yourself one day.    2) Kick his ***
Y4ogWjHOaa	Oh Cameron kids can be so cruel.    The best way I know to deal with something like that is to actually agree with them and then they have no argument. What can they have left to say if you are agreeing? Plus it is really annoying and they will soon stop..    It means swallowing your pride but it does work.    For example:    Bully:   You're a sissy, you let Jason beat you.    You:     I know, you're right, I did.    Bully:   Don't you even care that I just called you a sissy?    You:    No, why should I you're probably right! But there's not much i can do about that is there.    What then is left for them to say? You are beating them at their own game and they will get so bored if you keep it up.    Remember you are 17 and haven't got to be mixing with these people for much longer. You have so many new people to meet and make friends with in your future and these people will become a distant memory. I know that doesn't help you right now, but if you can get through this (which will not last for long)by just showing that you are totally indifferent to them they will stop. What will be the point of continuing if they get no reaction from you?    I do wish you well darling,    lots of love.  Mel.X|`|xxT7YGcMaa	It will pass, takes alittle time though, and you have to be the bigger man about the situation.  Don't give them the reaction they are looking for.

Many teen and pre-teen boys masturbate once or twice a day, and this pattern can continue into adulthood and middle age. More than this or less than this is also quite common.    If you masturbate often, you would want to watch your technique, so as not to chafe the skin on your penis. Other than this, no worries.    It will not interfere with your hormone (testosterone) production, it will not interfere with your growth and development, it will not cause acne, it will not affect your vision, it will not cause hair to grow in your palms, and it won't show. It is also not addictive. Masturbation will not contribute to baldness later in life.    Masturbation will absolutely not affect your future sex life. You will be able to "get off" just fine by other means in the future. It will not cause premature ejaculation (c**mming too fast). You cannot "run out" of sperm or semen, as these are replaced by your body on a continual basis. If you masturbate a good deal, or close together in time, you could notice a temporary reduction in semen, but it will build back up again.    There are some studies showing that regular ejaculation early in life can reduce the incidence of prostate cancer later on.|`|gKgSapaRaa	thats at the age where every male starts to do it.....i started at 13.....alot of guys start there......its normal|`|vUETXZUhaa	defitnetly ok it also feel awsome|`|ga2i6C5aaa	Perfectly normal.

AA10685305	Hi    There is certainly something in Your home ( specially bed ) or some substance in Your work area which makes the allergy .     Try washing Your every part of bed and check for any allergen in Your work area . You can take drugs like anti histamine or loratadine tablets to lower the itching and Use a Betamethasone or hydrocortisone ointment on Your skin .     Does the scar remains or it will disappear after a while ?     Yours .|`|tOmdPRziaa	its not dust mites maybe for sneezing but either its from the sudden climate change you know? like u used to live in the philippines where in the us its not as cold so your skin might be getting used to all the cold weather here in the us u can put lotion on it or put your hand on it and avoid itching as much as possible  heh im only 14|`|uA7rNGQkaa	www.morgellons.org...hope its not your answer...but check it out
VM6XG5c3aa	Hypothyroidism is a condition resulting from a thyroid disorder.. there are several that can cause you to be hypothyroid - when your thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient hormone for your body to be able to function in a healthy manner.    It would be FAR better for you to get the hypo condtion PROPERLY treated so that your body is able to function well and be able to get back to a healthy weight.    The first step would be to have proper labs run. By proper I mean to have the thyroid hormone levels checked, not just the TSH (which is a pituitary hormone). Once you have those labs you'll need to have them checked by someone that understands how to read them. Your doc may not be that person, I've run across far too many instances where even IF the doc runs the correct tests, they have no clue as to how to interpret the results.     In a nut shell, to have labs 'in normal range' is NOT good enough.. it's akin to driving around on a low tire and saying that as long as it's not actually flat that it's 'good enough'. You'll just shell out the money to pay for the extra gas and repairs to the car that result from driving around on that low tire.    For us.. it's dealing with the symptoms and, for too many, taking masking drugs to mask the symptoms that they are dealing with cuz their body does not have enough thyroid hormone to be able to LIVE...|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It most certainly is.|`|Tba8m2Ubaa	Yes it is a disease. The Thyroid is not producing hormones properly and basically is under-active or slow.
AA11091233	If the pain is especially on the soles and arch of the feet you most likely have something called 'plantar fascia'.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fas...    It is a condition that is HELL if not treated!!! I had it and I could barely take one step.    All you have to do is see a Pedontist (not a Podatrist). They take a bunch of tests and then they make special sole inserts that go in  your runners. They can also diagnose you. Getting cheap insoles from a drug store is not going to correct this problem    For now...put ice packs (wrap the ice pack around your feet with ace bandages to keep them in place). Also when you are lying down, bring your feet towards your chest. I mean, stretch your feet towards your body and then away from your body. You can also get a tennis ball and roll gently on the soles and arch of the feet. Stay off your feet as much as possible and stick to walking, not running until you are diagnosed. If every step ends up killing you, you will know for sure you have this condition...as walking is just as bad as running until it is treated.    If you do have plantar fascia...it will take about a month for the special inserts to work, so you will have to go easy for awhile.    They say the best runners for people with this problem are New Balance runners.    This plantar problem is usually caused from excessive walking, running etc. It got so bad for me every step felt like I was walking on nails...so don't let it go too long.  You don't need a doctor to recommend you...a Pedontist is someone who only works with feet and diagnosing the problem and getting the proper inserts made especially for you by putting your feet in a plaster cast sort of thing. In Canada it was $400.    Take care.|`|EgHTYGH2aa	make sure your shoes have good arch support.

And many people become "addicted" to it, and have repeated surgeries until they look like FREAKS!

tDaU7eYXaa	Just make sure to eat around 1500 calories and try to stay away from junk. Then burn more than that. Take a jog or a walk to you're favorite store or walk around the mall. But don't hold out on your comfort foods. We don't want you to have a sudden outburst of eating junk. Pack your meals with vegetables and try to stay away from the sugary fruits packed with too much natural sugar. You WILL lose weight if you are devoted. That diet does NOT work. You will flush out crap, but it will leave you weak, frail, and dizzy. You will become dependant because you are too weak to wor out. You will lose and gain tremendous amounts of weight. You must stay fit and healthy. And no one wants bones and skin. Just make sure NOT to starve yourself or else you will become frail and weak. Have a jog and buy a couple light weights. You could even jog WITH the weights. You CAN do it...    ; )|`|m2T75uOYaa	In "Eat more, weigh less." by Dr. Dean Ornish, it's not how much you eat, but rather what you eat. With that said, I suggest you don't restrict calories, but you cut out fat, oils, sugars, and all forms of salt alltogether. That's what will make the pounds drop very quickly. And, as for exercise, take it slow and long instead of quick and heavy. That, also, will make you lose the weight. Happy losing! :]|`|FR1P3B08aa	yes, very easy. just burn more fat than u consume, its really simple. just do alotttttt of cardio. 1 hour a day would easily get you on track to loosing 2-3lbs a week|`|BVIPL2Tiaa	the healthy amount of a calorie intake is about 1200 calories a day, plus alot of water. and you shud try to burn off more than half of your calorie intake to see significat results, good luck.

Being a skinny type though can make it a bit hard if your diet is not right because you have a very different metabolism than other people if you are naturally skinny.

D0JsiC0Paa	Now a thesis statement is a bit steep and would put most people here out of their depth, but I've done a lot of work on Schizophrenia so let me see if I can add some pointers or at least some guidance in terms of core symptoms, possible causes hypotheses, current treatments and break-through studies; nothing profound or definitive because it's a short notice improvisation but I'll see how I can help.     Now Schizophrenia is very hard to define as a disorder, and there's still a great deal of controversy regarding its classification as it is believed to belong to a broad range of disorders and so their is little uniformity of experience between sufferers and this posed a continuous problem up into the 1980s when trying to diagnose patients.      When symptoms are quite clear-cut, such as delusions, hallucinations and 'hearing voices' - which is quite typical, but not exclusive to Schizophrenia that's generally a good indication of its presence.     According to my sketchy recall of the DSM-IV-TR, one of the main manuals used to diagnose the condition - a brief synopsis of the symptom set required, though I suggest for the purpose of a thesis you look into the intricacies of what the manual actually says - diagnosis is passed roughly along these lines -->    The presence of core symptoms such as 'the voices'; as coming from an external source and not an 'internal' source such as in the head - one that is the source of thought insertion, or 'two' talking to each other - and hallucinations together with - one's actions or emotions being influenced by these third parties.     The break-through in classification came with the work of Shallice and Crowe - two cognitive psychologists - between 1988 and 1996, I think, but don't quote me on the date who seperated the symptoms of schizophrenia into 'positive' and 'negative' ones.    The positive symptoms were identified by their 'presence' - so say, the main ones are 'hallucinations', 'delusions of control/lack of control' and 'voices' - those can be 'present' in suffers so they are the positive symptoms.    Then the negative ones are identified by their absence - which include -->    Social Withdrawal - so an absence of being there in a social context.    Poverty of Speech - not talking much, talking very little, not really being very articulate or just generally showing lingual retardation that cannot be explained any other way.    and    The flattening of affect - which refers to a loss of 'expression', in the voice and face.    ______________________________________...    Now, I imagine a thesis would be a concentrated piece of work and so would only really take into account a single approach to the disease, which it is considered as, and so you would either take a social, biomedical or cognitive approach to it, or possibly a psychodynamic/freduian one - but they explain the disorder to different degrees and some are favoured over others - but I'll see if I can give a brief overview of all of them and the origins of their explanations, their basis and subsequent treatment in line with those explanations.  _____________________________________    The easiest, or should I say, most scientific approach you can take is the biomedical approach which of course, attempts to explain the symptoms in terms of biological discord and dysfunction and so correct it and treat it on that same premise.     It has its root in observation as the biomedical approach to mental illness centres mostly around the inferred role of neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline and their imbalances in brain to explain the symptoms of mental disorders - but because these levels can't directly be tested as it would require extraction from live brains, which is invasive and so impossible, it has to be inferred by 'observing' effects and generalizing and so many discoveries in the field of mental health have been serendipitous.     Researchers observed that the use of amphetamines, and an overdose led to amphetamine psychosis - which mimiced many of the symptoms of schizophrenia and patients thought to be suffering from schizophrenia were made worse by the effects of amphetamines - and so from this they inferred that because amphetamines raise dopamine levels in the brain - schizophrenia must thus be the result of an excess of dopamine and this theory is known as the Dopamine Hypothesis.     So, based on that theory Schizophrenia is thought to be almost entirely a biological condition, with high heredity and so 'antipsychotics' are used, as they are believed to lower the levels of dopamine in the brain and have shown great success. Well, that's an exaggeration, they only work for a 1/3 of sufferers, have some serious side effects - but these are being continually improved with successive drug developments - and work partially for another third and not at all for the rest - so it's no great solution.     Modern brain imaging technology has also shown that patients suffering from Schizophrenia have a lower brain mass and enlarged ventricles, but this does not continue to deteriorate so it is not thought to be a degenerative condition - but changes in brain structure have been linked to the development of schizophrenia or these structures have been linked to a predisposition to schizophrenia but as the majority of patients only come for treatment after they begin experiencing symptoms, it is hard to determine the structure of the brain before the emergence of symptoms.  ____________________________________     Coming to the cognitive basis, the cognitive approach does not seek to explain the disease holistically, but instead to explain certain symptoms in terms of cognitive processes, but this borders on metaphor and the metaphysical and if these structures which cognitive psychologists use to try and model Sc
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|xOqhA1Unaa	maybe you sprained , broke , pulled a legament , or stretched a muscle!|`|G3TEO6C7aa	Get an ultrasound. Possibly a clot.
ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	A vascular surgeon will evaluate the situation to see how much tissue has been killed from the infection.  If the infection is still localized, the doc will remove dead or infected tissues and patch things up by reconstruction using tissues from some other parts of the body.  Since you were referred to a vascular surgeon, the doc is probably thinking that you will need reconstruction - this is good because the alternative is worse.     You may be awake for tests an imaging, but definitely under anesthesia for any surgical procedures.  Vascular reconstruction is time-consuming and very tedious work, so you will be under anesthesia.  Reconstruction sometimes involves several incremental surgeries.     If the infection has killed extensive parts of the bone or surrounding tissues, the treatment goal may be focused on making sure that the problem doesn't advance from beyond the areas that are already infected - under this scenario, you could lose part of a leg or foot.     Tests may or may not be needed, depending on what imaging and tests you have already had.  If tests are performed, they might include a bone biopsy or MRI.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	I'm sorry I can't help you Linde, but I will be thinking of you.|`|ziVtTtObaa	You need to go to osteomylitis.com I worked with Dr Cierney a few years ago.

I strongly suggest that if your injury occurred due to medical malpractice, or neglect that you contact a medical malpractice attorney. Thank goodness your going to see the vasc guy!

He of course will look at and examine the infected/injured area, it may be uncomfortable, but he needs to do the exam in order to make a proper diagnosis!! It will all be ok, just calm down and know that someone is finally going to fix this. And, no, you will not be awake during a surgical procedure!! Good Luck!!

In the USA around 15% of men are uncircumcised and 85% are circumcised.  Worldwide about 25-30% are circumcised and 70-75% are uncircumcised, although this figure is changing as more men learn of the protective effects of circumcision and get it done for themselves and their sons.    Medical research has shown that circumcision reduces by up to 60% the risk of catching each of several STIs including thrush, HPV, chlamydia and HIV/AIDS.  Circumcised men are also totally protected against phimosis, paraphimosis, frenulum breve and balanoposthitis.    You must, however, be able to fully, freely and painlessly retract your foreskin so as to expose the whole glans (head) and the coronal sulcus (groove) behind it.  If you cannot do this when flaccid then you cannot keep yourself completely clean and run a high risk of infection under the foreskin.    If you cannot fully retract after erection then you risk having the foreskin tear during sex as it can get forced over the rim of the glans during intercourse.  If it tears it will be very painful, will bleed profusely and be extremely embarrassing.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Not at all bad. Circumcision is an American trend (aside from medical or religious reasons).

Although you were around her very close to the most normal contagious time (just before symptoms and approximately 24-48 hours after the first symptoms), getting the influenza vaccine after exposure to the influenza virus will not help you much, if at all....It takes up to 14-days AFTER the "flu-shot" for your immune system to get the full benefits from it.  The good news is you'll have protection against this strain of the flu for about a year!  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me and or check out the link below.  www.immunize.org/vis/2flu.pdf
G3TEO6C7aa	Yes I am currently on it. Originally it was 50mg, worked for a week or so but I guess my body is tolerating it more now.  So then my psychiatrist switched me to 100mg and it works perfectly, I'm unbelieveably tired within an hour or so. And it keeps me asleep for 8 hours..|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	I used to take 50mg of trazodone as a sedative. When I took this drug it would make me tired, but extremely restless so I couldn't get to sleep. When morning came I would be so tired and run down that I wouldn't be able to get out of bed. In retrospect this drug didn't help me at all including the other sleeping drugs I've tried. I take an anti psychotic which has a sedative effect which works better than trazodone.|`|bcflMMJEaa	First, everyone reacts differently to every medicine so you wont know your own reactions until you try it so don't let whatever anyone says here scare you.    I took 100mg and it pretty much made me into a walking zombie during the day but I still didn't sleep very restful at night, I woke up 800 times but then just in time for morning I felt like I couldn't even open up my eyes.
Xh3Q8jqXaa	They do not do a blood and urine test at a checkup. (Unless your blood pressure is not normal, which it will be fine because you're young)    They'll shine a light in your eyes to make sure they're fine. They'll tap your knees to check reflexes, check inside your ear canal, weigh you, check your temperature with a thermometer in your mouth, check your throat (hold your tongue out and say ah), and they will check your blood pressure (band around your arm).  It won't be bad at all.|`|ReGhCqgVaa	The post by Lady D is correct.    Edit-(Actually all the other posts are completely wrong except for the post by Lady D..unless you're going for a "Physical".  What you should do is go and ask your mom if you are getting just a normal check up or a physical.)    A Check up and a Physical are two completely different things    FOR CHECK UPS -  The normal things they do -  -Flash a light into your ears and nose.  -Check your weight  -Check blood pressure (That thing they put around your upper arm)  -Check your temperature  -Check your throat (make you open your mouth and say "Ahhh" haha    It's all just simple painless stuff. Nothing to worry about.      In a Physical they check your spine and make you walk in a straight line and all that other stuff these guys are talking about.    Another edit -  If you ARE getting a physical..it would be very smart to ask for a female doctor. If you don't it's going to be very uncomfortable for you. In a physical they normally make you take off almost all of your clothes (except for bra and underwear). TRUST ME, you want a doctor of the same sex for this.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	ears, throat, weight, temperature, blood pressure, blood and urine test|`|XXf4JHd5aa	I just got a check-up. They check eyesight, hearing, blood pressure, height and weight. They might have you do some simple things (like walk in a straight line) bend over to check for scoliosis, etc. They give you like 6 shots. That's the worst part. but you don't have to pee in a cup or anything-so good news!|`|LvnEbqxAaa	For a physical they usually check your throat, temperature, blood pressure, eyes, ears, height, weight and usually check your spine. They might feel your abdomen for tenderness or anything else that might be wrong.|`|0jDuZRGfaa	Oh my jesus christ, when i was in middle school, they made me do ALOT of things. First they usually meassure ur height and weight. Then, the doc comes in ( of course lol). he usually tells you how ur apitite is, and if you are overweight, or purfect weight. Then he usually checks u for signs of puberty ( i should know, ima girl) He lifts up ur shirt to check for breast tissue. Then, if u havnt already had it yet, he asks you if you have had ur period. Then if you havnt, he will tell you when you will, and signs of before you are going to have your period. Then they check ur throught, and ur ears. If he says ur ears have alot of wax, he will clean them out. dont worry, it doesnt hurt.He will also check ur lungs, and ur eyes. ( he will not make u pee in a cup usually).  Then, comes, the shots. You will probably get a hepititus A shot ( if you havnt gotten one already) a hepititus B shot ( same as before) and a hepititus C shot ( same same). He will also probably give you a meningitus, and a flu shot ( if u already  havnt gotten one). Then comes the embarressing shot to tlk about. He will ask your mom if you want Gardicile ( a cervical cancer protection shot) ur mom might say yes, so, lol. These shots have a side affect of sweeling of the aria, and bruising. If you feel pain in ur arms or legs ( wherever they give you the shot) dont worry, thats a natural sideaffect. if the pain dosnt subside within 4 days, you need to go back to the doctor.

dZxjXHA2aa	Sort of.  It's not necessarily "bad" as in bad FOR you but....without support your breasts will begin to droop and sag from being pulled down and flying about when you exercise.  Firmly holding them in place with a sports bra keeps that skin at the top of the breast from stretching and allowing that sag to begin/exist.  Also if they are heavy you could pull a muscle from the additional weight and you could become winded much easier cutting into your work out efforts if you are more than a small cup size.|`|O6iLrLZgaa	lol of course it's not good!  it feels very uncomfortable.. don't you think? lol|`|mH5jEhbHaa	Will if want people to think your crazy go ahead.It just makes your boobs flop up and down.|`|wjS3GtOYaa	yes its bad  do u WANT saggy boobs?!|`|VajGm9fpaa	It's all good.

If you want to keep them looking young and to adjust to your weight loss, consider finding a bra you are comfortable with.    Do jumping jacks in the try on room. Just make sure it fits how you want it to. It doesn't have to smother you just keep them supported.    I know its a pain in the *** know, but you'll be kicking yourself if you end up 25 with sagging breasts
97hpKoemaa	I'd recommend fasting for a day or two to cleanse your system, and then you can start over in a sense in regards to what you put into your body.  I do these cleanses periodically (once or twice a month) and I usually lose between 3 and 5 pounds.  I get Magnesium Citrate from the grocery store.  This is a laxative--it will clear you out completely!  The only thing with this is, if you want it to work, you shouldn't eat anything for a day.  I drink the MC in the morning and then drink TONS of water and clear fluids (crystal light) throughout the day.  You'll be going to the bathroom a whole lot, but you should feel a lot better and you're sure to lose some weight--this could be a kick start to your weight loss program.    Good luck!|`|lMWrKo8Qaa	very interesting i didn't eat at night for a few weeks and lost alot of weight it works you can see the difference

Eat as much healthy (fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean meats, lower fat dairy products, lots of water) food as you like.  Exercise is great, if you love it and you don't overdo it.  Personally, I would avoid the "Energy" drinks, and just eat good, whole foods:  they have all the nutrients your brain, blood, bones and body needs to form and grow properly.  NRG drinks are full of sugar and weird chemicals, dude!    Good Luck!|`|yNvA3Wreaa	Taking a day off once a week can be helpful in allowing your muscles to heal.  It sounds like you may be over-exercising, which can be counter-productive because it doesn't allow your muscles to strengthen as they heal and wears you down so your immune system is weakened.      I'm concerned that you're following your diet that closely.  It doesn't sound balanced (little protein, no fruits and vegetables) or like you consumed enough calories.  While it's not extremely common for guys to become anorexic, it does happen, and often goes along with over-exercising.  Talk to your parents about your exercising and diet and make sure that what you're doing is healthy for you.|`|AA10913583	Taking a day off will be good for your body.. it will allow your body to rejuvenate and rebuild your muscles|`|AA11557192	As long it does not disrupt your routine.

PVe6jK78aa	You also have to realize the THC content of the marijuana. Ex one puff of mids could get you buzzed but one puff of Haze can get you ripped. It also depends on the persons weight and tolerance to marijuana (as in how much they smoke regularly)|`|2BmGwbvYaa	Drugs are drugs. Not matter how they are taken. One puff can get someone addicted, it's like candy. The less you have the more you want.

5I7Ifrmraa	Water temperature should be tepid -- hot water takes more oils away than cool water.     The length of water contact should be short -- no long, hot showers if your skin is dry.     Unless you have mud and grime on you, you really don't have to use soap everywhere on your body.     If you need soap, use one of the recommended soaps for dry skin that contain emollients and actually replace the skin's natural oils.     Using antibacterial gels for hand-washing does not cause the skin to dry out because the alcohol does not bind to the skin's oils  .   When drying off, pat the skin dry with a towel until the skin is not dripping - do not rub the skin vigorously.     Use a good moisturizer on the skin immediately after any contact with water

9dd5430826419465f11ba0f539a0c282aa	The season plays a big role in nose bleeds.  The drier it is, the drier your nasal membranes/passages are.  Plus the fact that your membranes  are already injured doesn't help.  1.  Stop blowing for a while and let nature start healing things up.  2.  Use Vaseline or something similar to help keep nasal membranes softened up.  3.  When you do get another bad nose bleed, keep it pinched and don't peek.  Applying an ice pack to the back of your neck or the bridge of your nose will also help slow things down.  If the problem continues, see your doctor for possible cauterizing.  The clot came from you not swallowing or letting the pooled blood run down the back of your throat that collected in the back of your sinus cavity.|`|ziVtTtObaa	Stop blowing!!!

AA10458296	It depends on your height. Check your BMI.  Why do you want to be anorexic? Do you mean, the lifestyle or just be very underweight? I understand that thin guys are really "in" right now for middle school/high schoolers. But really, You won't be happy at all socially or mentally if you adopt anorexic tendencies. (Yes, that means say goodbye to friends and any healthy relationships with your family.) Far easier to lose the weight by understanding you don't HAVE to starve!

Once you start with the eating disorders it's very hard to become back to a normal healthy eater again. I know from experience and I'm still trying to recover from my past eating habits.     The BEST way to lose weight is to start getting information and knowledge about nutrition and what really is in the food you are eating now. Once you start eating fresh unprocessed foods,exercising or going to the gym, and even incorporating green tea and water in your diet, you start creating a positive body image for yourself naturally.     A good site that also helped me a lot is http://caloriecount.about.com  it gives grades for all the foods in the search engine and at the end of the day you get a grade for how well you ate.

0gONjiSzaa	There's no way to know for sure, but that looks like about a 2 gauge tunnel. As for piercing and stretching, you can start at 18/16 g, but you can also get pierced at larger sizes so you don't have to go through that many stretches. You should contact a good/reputable piercer and discuss a long-term plan for your stretching. if you do get pierced, it's important to wait long enough before stretching to allow the piercing to fully heal. Also, when you're stretching make sure that your ears are ready to accommodate the next size up. You should never have to force anything through your ears and they should never hurt or bleed. Try the Body Art Forms forums for a lot of great information.|`|eLR3G2uCaa	cant see the picture

At different times of the month I crave different things... and when I'm having my period I usually just give in :P  Keep yourself busy and stick to a roughly scheldued time for eating each meal, healthy snacks are good!|`|mH5jEhbHaa	You could be pregnant.|`|0c640c3ef6ce2168b544e6cf0642a91aaa	You say you didnt eat at all for a day or two? You see that's what is probably screwing up your metabolism, going from eating a lot to eating nothing.    If you just phrased it wrong and have actually been eating, then I'll give you a different answer. Until you eliminate all the toxins from the food you've ate over the weekend they will still be in your body causing you to crave them. A simple wayt o stop craving fatty foods is to start making yourself eat healthier, basically forcing, and you'll start craving healthier foods.     Remember, once you ingest something such as a chocolate bar for example, you have to be prepared to have cravings for sugar and the otehr chemicals in the candy for the next day or two until it has passed through you.
njCyVnKjaa	Yep, she has "came". Women don't ejaculate. The "liquid" you're talking about is for lubrication.|`|yCgytwdvaa	Women don't ejaculate.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Women always have some vaginal mucus which maintains their health by protecting against bacteria, etc.  During arousal it is common (and helpful) for a woman's body to increase production of lubricant.  Some women are naturally drier than others and the normal amount and consistency of lube will change with her cycle.  Some things can even cause vaginal dryness (horribly uncomfortable).    As for female ejaculation.  This is not terribly common, in fact some people believe it is a myth.  Do not worry if your girlfriend doesn't ejaculate or have any sort of flooding of vaginal fluids. It doesn't mean she is faking it, or lying to you.|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	if there's contraction, she'd come    it doesn't always end up as liquid.     If you want liquid:  http://www.redtube.com/15878    is a good technique|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	if she has she will be positive about it..like yes i came!..from a females point of view,if she isn't wet,it aint happened|`|10zaYXqGaa	This is going to be a bit awkward, but here it goes:   The vagina is a hole, right? And although the girl might segregate when reaching the orgasm, it might not "pop out" imediatly, and instead it lays inside. Don't worry, it's perfectly normal.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	I can only say that I have had many dates with many women, and only very few of them could do that. Also I was told by one of them that this is in their control and often prevent doing so because they are not sure how their males would react.    So the answer seems to be that not all can and those who can will often prevent doing so.    All you can do is tell them to relax and be themselves.  It may be that they are doing so and just not as much to notice.  One girl I went with could flood the bed.  Others only a little, and some not at all.  Knowing it can be prevented was something I did not understand.  They claim it feels like pee, and thus normal to try to prevent.    I mean ok.. Pee is sterile, but what guy would allow his pee on a nice girl.  They must feel the same and shut it down.    Your best answer.|`|ILYEAa9laa	my last gf used to produce liqiud but my current gf doesnt i dunno!!!|`|BRsly0x0aa	Yep she definately has :)|`|5VdB8njTaa	Not to sound like a chauvinistic pig or anything, but don't worry about it.   Not all women ejaculate and the some that do (1 in 4 I think I read) produce a very tiny amount. As long as she's enjoying herself don't worry mate.   If you start asking them did you ***? did you ***? then it's gonna upset her and make her so self conscious that she'll probably never will again. Drop all those sort of thoughts and just do it ;)|`|8G8ZbNLQaa	I thought female ejaculation was some fake thing in porn. It has never happened to me. I didn't realise we had the body parts to do it. As far as I know the only tube that contains liquid is the urethra from the bladder. When a woman feels aroused she usually gets more lubication in the vagina and then the orgasm involves contraction of the muscles.|`|8jBGhsWPaa	to everyone who thinks woman cannot ejaculate your all bloody stupid!  Of course we can.. woman dont always produce liquids but that doesnt mean they havent reached orgasm.. Woman become wet after 30 seconds of being arroused. When woman produce alot of liquid this is ejaculation the liquids build up in a womans vagina and sometimes spray out when it becomes to full. This causes much pleasure for the woman.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	well if she said she come she is the person who would know but from what you are saying it certainly sounds like it not all women are the same some do not produce a lot of Liquid others produce a gallon|`|GqRNBTV9aa	if she seems happy all is good, the female body is very complicated and not everything happens according to a specific plan.
ZUnYM2iIaa	I had a similar problem where I was constantly aware of how hard (or slow) my heart was beating and was always checking my pulse. It would keep me awake at night and often times the more I was aware of it the more anxious I would become. I'm a 21 year old male and as far as I know am completely healthy. At one point I went so far as to wear a heart monitoring device for a 24-hour period (as directed by my doctor). I've always been a bit of a hypochondriac, so when the results revealed no problems, I wasn't too surprised.    I've since overcome the problem and have attributed it strictly to anxiety - that is, I think it was all in my head (psycho-somatic, or whatever the term is). I had a pretty general anxiety problem that was affecting all areas of my life. I'm opposed to using medications so it came down to letting myself go, so to speak, and through a somewhat difficult process I've overcome my anxiety and proud of it. I would say the biggest factor was exercising. When I was concerned about my heart it would keep me from doing many physical activities because I was afraid my heart was going to stop. I literally ran through this problem by making myself continue even when I was fearful for my life. A somewhat unnerving process at times, it really helped me get to where I am today.    Based on what you said you could be having anxiety caused by your friend's heart-related death. I won't presume to say you are, or ever have been, a high-anxiety person, because something as difficult as a death of someone close to you could undoubtedly cause short-term problems like grief, stress, anxiety, etc. If you can eliminate the possibility of any actual physical ailments I think you should take steps to prevent this from becoming a long-term issue like the one I've been through. I also think your willingness to talk about the problem is a good start and you just need to be willing to face the problem head-on. As to your rib pain - there were usually multiple other "symptoms" I'd think I was experiencing that were related to my heart but were not in any way. If you know what's causing the rib pain and it's not related to your heart you simply need to let the concern go.    Maybe hearing my similar problem will help, maybe not. Either way I wish you luck and hope you can figure this out!|`|0b1a38ddb028d9a6c669ad7b4e4f3db8aa	when you focus on your heart...the first thing you realise is that at times it does all sorts of strange things...If you focus on your eyes..you'll also notice odd things like black spots or the occasional blurry moment. When you focus on your hearing, you 'll notice that sometimes your ears whistle or make strange noises... the point is, our body does all sorts of strange things that are perfectly normal. I use to focus on my heart whenever I'd been smoking something I shouldn't have been. I actually got quite paranoid and frightened by it...     If it really bothers you that much, go and see your doctor and ask him to check it out and tell him/her why. Your doctor will be very understanding...and you'll get some peace of mind.|`|ezMoS0mqaa	Firstly if you have a heart attack your pulse will not necessarily change so checking it will not give you an indication so now you know that, you know your behaviour is irrational and actually won't help you..  Secondly, if you are having a 'heart attack' you will have crushing central chest pain that doesn't go away and will look a strange grey colour. The pain you are describing is typical of anxiety attacks- you are getting worked up and without realising, your breathing gets too fast so muscles in your chest will hurt a little.  When you feel anxious and feel like checking your pulse, take a deep breath and hold it for three seconds before you let it go.Then count to three and breathe in again. Repeat several times until the urge passes.  If you can't get on top of this yourself you may need to see your doctor aas this is obsessive compulsive and you may benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy.  Good luck|`|AA12266052	You need not worry till you reach menopause. Control diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cholesterol (LDL, triglyceride & serum cholesterol), smoking. Exercise daily.|`|VM6XG5c3aa	This may not help you one bit... but....     The more that you fret over something that you have no control over.. the more you will be affected by thinking negatively about it.    Worrying about what the result will be when you take your pulse can actually increase your heart rate... so the more you worry about it the less accurate your results will be anyway.    A suggestion?    Next time you catch yourself reaching to take your pulse... stop.... think of something that you REALLY REALLY love.... a flower, your pet, a book, a poem.. and share that with yourself. Change the habit that is bothering you into something else that might make you feel more positive about things.    There is so much more to life than just dwelling on the negative. Kick up your heals and give LIFE a whirl....     Life can be pretty cool.
mWBD1Mgyaa	Yes, it sounds like your period.  It will be off and on for a while...don't be alarmed if you see, pink, red or brown blood - Your body cycles itself.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Yes.

Welcome to womanhood, congratulations!|`|yFzZ3uvPaa	Its your period congrats|`|tCq1xpqraa	yea. is it ur first period?|`|WQK42mRsaa	You most likely started your period.

Ask your mum or someone for advice.  Good luck and welcome to womanhood :D
AA11091233	You don't need any more excuses or lies...you already are sick. Just tell them the truth. Take your temperature too. Sore eyes can be fever related or perhaps you have sinus infection as well. If that still doesn't' cut it...say you feel like throwing up. You need to stay home if you are sick anyway...so not sure why you need more excuses.    Feel better....or not. lol    School will still be there unfortunately........ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|`|jPJaSIXPaa	faker!!!!!|`|Ezn8CPZYaa	Just say you really don't feel well and you don't want to go to school. If you're just trying to fake, say your stomach really hurts and your throat is sore, because that can't be checked. Start telling them you don't feel well now so it's no surprise in the morning when you roll over and say you aren't going..|`|nG9znIxYaa	often having sore eyes indicates a temperature. so if you have a sore throat, stuffy nose along with eyes hurting then you more than likely have a fever. if that is the case then you should stay off school.    Just tell your parents you feel awful and really dizzy and tired.|`|mHCuQceKaa	I take soluble paracetamol when I have a sore throat as it goes directly onto your tonsils and acts like a pain killer. Eyes hurting does normally go with a general cold and the best thing for colds is rest.     How old are you that you have to fake being too ill to attend school?|`|IdNRyzXlaa	Well, if u already dont have a feer go in the b-room and lock the door. Blow dry ur fore head so it will seem real warm(not too warm so she doesnt think she needs to take u to the doctor-ur mom i mean) and then early in the morning go in there and make it sound like your puking(pick closest b-room to parents). Take an abject and drop it in the toilet so it sounds like it. Then spray some of ur moms hairspray(u'll know why soon). Then if u were loud enough u might have woke up the rents. If they ask why it smells good respond, "I dont want anyone to smell it." So it seems obvious. Someother ideas are like putting some blush on- i know u dont want on make-up but if ur that desperate- on your cheeks and fore head. Not to much that she can tell. Make sure your hands are warm- so blow dry them too. Ur hands r another warm thing that'll be warm if ur sick. Hope i was good help. ;-}|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Go into the bathroom with a big cup of water. Make a throw up noise then pour a quarter of the water into the toilet. Repeat until cup is empty. It will really sound like you're puking. Make sure someone will hear it. Lol.

HgdQMWuDaa	depends upon your genetics and how far along you are in puberty.... i was the same heighth at fifteen now im 21 and 5 9.  Some people have mulitple growth spurts even after high school and some don't like me.  I'd say anywhere between 5 7 and 6 3.  Just look at your uncles, aunts, parents, brothers and sisters and you'll get an idea.|`|DjtNLFHsaa	wow your tall. youll be 6 feet tall|`|RvWqhZ8baa	Depends how tall your parents are.|`|AA12123428	You'll be about three times the size you were when you were two.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	Well that depends on a lot of things. It is likely you will keep growing for a while yet so you should be a pretty decent height. I dont think you will be really really tall though.|`|HUlyRTrraa	As long as you don't smoke you will probably get to 6ft.  Men generally are fully grown by 21.
zQbvVtgsaa	im not sure..if you are truly happy with the person you are with, then you would not be feeling anxious about this. you should know that they are with you because of you, not your sex, although sex can be a big part of relationships, unless your horrible at it it won't bring you apart. ask ur lover what she/he thinks of you in bed..and take it from there.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Nope. It's very common, so don't worry. Just get to know the girl (or boy, for that matter) a bit better, and things will soon, errm, perk up.|`|GG9j70R5aa	Don't take any medicine before sex.  Especially not calming types of medicine because that might calm your anxiety, but worsen your "performance".  If you love each other and it's your first time or something don't worry, your partner will be patient and caring.  Just do all those things you know they like, the kissing, caressing, fondling and have fun!

gkqmrIAGaa	You can go to nami.org that is the National Association for the Mentally Ill. They have any information that you could possibly want. But your mother in law needs to know that antidepressants take 3 to 4 weeks to work and only work if she takes them every day as prescribed. There is no such thing as taking one when you feel down and think that it will help you. She is needlessly suffering with her depression without her medications.  The antidepressant has to always be in her system at the level her doctor prescribed.  I hope you can get this through to her and that she will begin taking it as prescribed.  Also some antidepressants will work for some and not for others. If after the 3 to 4 weeks it doesn't work for her it is time to try another one.

NrOg2hrZaa	If the landlord will not continue to try and repair the problem, call the city you live in and describe your concern.  If it is a possible health issue, I'm sure the city will send an inspector out to document the complaint and make sure the problem is repaired, if they find one.    Mold needs moisture and a food source to continue to grow.  The food source could be the material the cabinet is made from.  Where is the moisture coming from?    There are various tests that can be performed for the presence of mold.  Obviously, you should not have to pay for these tests as a tenant.  You would have to get the city involved to force the landlord into having testing done and pay for the tests, plus whatever repairs may be necesarry.    Mold,  a. May give off toxic gases.  b. May create an odor.  c. May cause health related issues in anyone. Especially persons that have allergies, immune problems, or health issues already.  d. Molds have many color variations.  e. Mold needs moisture and a food source to grow.  f.  There is mold fungi spores in the air at all times.      Whether it is harmful or not is decided by the quantity of the mold       spores and the effect it has on individuals.      Everyone reacts differently to mold.    It's hard to determine from your question, whether it's mold or not with out actually viewing the cabinet.  There are products out there that you can "paint" on that will encapsulate the mold growth and stop it at that point.  (Regular paint does not do this)  I recommend eliminating the mold spore growth or removing the mold growth altogether, if it is a mold issue, rather than encapsulation.    First thing if it is Mold, where is the water (moisture) coming from to feed it's growth? This needs addressed first.    Additional..   Yes, Florida in general has a big problem with mold growth in homes. I don't believe I can list my affiliates down in florida on this site. (Site regulations)  I'm in Chicago.  Go to www.IAQA.com to find a certified inspector in your area .    Also, check out www.nzmold.com and www.nzymsys.com for help with an all natural way to combat mold.
GlxynGn8aa	Hey!  I'm about to start using it. I just talked to my Doc about it today! She said her patients are happy with it, and my friends that use it love it. One of them says that their husband can feel it during sex, but it didn't deter him or anything. (not much can, eh.) My doctor also said that if your partner can feel it during sex, you can take it out for up to three hours and reinsert it.   I chose it because I don't want to deal with taking the pill every day.   The website has a coupon for a free month of it. You just have to go get a prescription.    I hope you can find something that works for you!

No ointment, lotions or potions.  The white skin is a blister which is full of plasma to keep out infection and provide a cushion over the wound. Do not remove.  Cover with a clean, lint free, loose dressing. (Handkerchief) or cling film to keep clean.  Get medical advise.

C02lxopxaa	my advice is talk to your boyfriend about getting the boy some type of help.  without help the situation will get worse. the sooner he gets help for the son the better. and your right you should be worried  about moving in with him  living with a child diagnosed as Reactive attachement disorder is very difficult and also dangerous.|`|YUjVFkocaa	Honestly, I'd tell the guy to teach the kid a lesson.  "Spare the rod, spoil the child."  I KNOW that some people say that you should be nice to the kid, and not spank or beat him or physically.  But they're wrong, ESPECIALLY in this case.    I don't care if they call it a disorder, he's still normal.  He just hasn't yet learned that if you hit somebody, YOU- WILL- GET- HIT- BACK!  He hits because he knows people are "nice" and "sensitive" to him and his condition.  This both empowers him, and further agitates him, for the same reason- his "special treatment"!    If he starts to feel like a normal kid who can't get away with sh*t, especially like that, he will stop hitting other people.    ==================    Explain to your husband that every time he is violent to you, your son, him, OR anybody else... for your husband to SWIFTLY and IMMEDIATELY take him over his knee and beat his butt hard about 5-15 times, depending on the severity.    Yes, the child may scream and cry and wail and get angry.  But he will understand, and start to make a connection.  He will learn that violence=bad, and that he is NOT all-powerful and invincible!  He will learn that pain HURTS, and he will KNOW why he shouldn't inflict it on other people!    ===================    Your boyfriend sounds like a really nice guy, but he sounds like a WEAK parent who doesn't punish his child enough.    He should know the drill by now- DON'T get angry or attack the child in a fit of rage, or have a mean face.    He should quickly and CALMLY and sadly take the child over his knee, or make him bend over, and beat his butt a few times with his hand.  He should explain to him that:   "this hurts me more than it hurts you, but I have to spank you because A) this is punishment for what you've done, and B) you need to understand that pain is bad, and if you don't like it, then why do you cause other people pain all the time?  that is wrong, son.  You know better... or you'll learn real quick, 1 of the 2."

In the mean time drink plenty of water and cranberry juice if you can get some. The fluids will help flush out any nasty bacteria in your system.|`|mWBD1Mgyaa	It sounds like it could be a UTI.  I would go see a doctor and have them test your urine...It's better to get it checked before it becomes unbearable.  Some people get UTI's every month - so once a year...isn't that bad!!

SltEwVX7aa	no you haven't damaged any nerves.  Probably just some callous action going on.  Sure, it feels Ok with the other hand.  But remember this:  you're not gripping or rubbing the exact same spots when you use the other hand.      If nothing else, put some hand lotion on the head and penis shaft everyday.  It's skin, too, and needs the same attention as the rest of your body.|`|zNPGaZRHaa	The reason for this is that your left hand is warmer then your right hand.

Rk46lIBwaa	It would perhaps have been useful if you had also included your cycle length. In a woman with a 28 day cycle, ovulation usually occurs on or about day 14.    Ovulation thermometers can be used to pinpoint ovulation, but they can be difficult to use as the temperature rise with ovulation is only a fraction of a degree. Chemical tests which check the condition of the cervical mucous are easier to manage.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Ok, day one of your cycle is the first day of your period. You ovulate approximately two weeks from day one- so day 14 approximately. Ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle and can be up to a week out in some women. In theory you could ovulate anywhere between day 10-19.    The only way to know for sure it to buy an ovulation testing kit or monitor your temperature. If if your last period started on the 22nd of January then you will ovulate on the 4th (approx)- which is this Wednesday.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	you ovulate about two weeks BEFORE your period. and it lasts around 4 days.
K8qMighsaa	this isnt a sex problem. youre just not ready to have sex b/c youre too young and too emotionally immature, or you wouldnt be here asking us how to protect yourself! usually, girls (and boys) old enough and mature enough to engage in sexual activity, already know how to protect themselves. they teach you this stuff in grade school, after all. my advice, youre much too young, youre not emotionally ready. dont do it. but for future reference, there are all kinds of ways to protect yourself from becoming pregnant, but you also need to protect yourself from contracting a sexually transmitted disease, which is FAR SCARIER that being a mommy.    birth control options:  -> rhythm method (only have sex on safe days during your cycle, NOT when youre ovulating!) women ovulate 14 days after the first day of their last period.  -> condoms (both for men and women): practice putting one on and taking it off, dont let it get stuck inside you, dont spill its contents afterwards, and make sure the expiration date is still good, and there are no punctures in the condom or the package. if it breaks, youre in trouble!  -> sponge: practice putting it in  -> spermicides: messy  -> pulling out: the man needs to have a lot of control in order for this to work, but it doesnt REALLY work b/c PRE-*** can make you pregnant too, theres enough semen in pre-*** to do the job, and your bf wont know he came inside you anyway, so dont do it this way!  -> birth control pill: you need to take one every day like clock work, same time, same everything, but it doesnt kick in right away, youll need to take it regularly for a while before it becomes affective, yet it wont protect you from deadly STDS  -> abstinance: 100% results all the time!!!!!  -> day after pill/emergency contraceptives: i dont recommend having unprotected sex, so this wouldnt be an issue, but if you ever get raped (gawd forbid) you might need it!    check out this site for more info>>>>>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracepti...|`|e3cEZ03oaa	Well go for it you wont enjoy but it gets better, He will trust me and when you hear him snort like a pig in your ear hole that's normal, don't worry about it, as for protection if there's nothing to hand a crisp packet or tesco carrier bag will do it.

If you don't think you're ready just tell him you want to wait a little bit, theres nothing wrong with waiting. If you feel like you're ready for other things try and do that instead but if you're not ready for sex then your first time will be horrible.
4GJmZSKAaa	if you've tried almost all over the counter products, then i don't think home remedies will help that much.          so your best bet is to go to the dermatologist. i started going to the dermatologist three years ago, and my skin is in great condition. it takes time though, the dermo perscribes medication by looking at your skin but many times it won't work and you'll have to go back. I've tried MANY perscriptions from the dermo but i finally found creams that work for me. and i'm now using differin and benzaclin (perscriptions) for like the past year or so and i'll be finished using them in a couple months. then i'll go back to regular face washing.     and just remember it takes time. also make sure you aren't using oil based products on your skin and don't touch it.     so really, just go to the expert rather than waste time at home trying to work a miracle! good luck :)|`|dlTJQL5Laa	It really helped me to avoid fast food.  Eat a healthy, low-fat diet.  Also, pay attention to where you're getting your acne.  If it's on your face, make sure you change your pillow cases a lot and check yourself to see if you're sleeping on your hand at night (I do this sometimes in my sleep).  It probably fluctuates with your hormones too--not much you can do about that =(|`|Q8JeA1eNaa	I think at first you should go a doctor then you can use home remedies.    My solution is for you :  2 sp.apple vinager   2-3 dropped lemons   A little water     Then this home lines mixed up in the small bowl and apply with a cotton to your face.This solution will dry and invisible your acnes.
Rk46lIBwaa	Your depot injection will have worn off after 14 or 15 weeks at most. However it is obvious that for some reason your normal cycle has not yet become re-established. This does not mean that you are definitely not ovulating, so pregnancy is still possible.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Are you saying the last time you had the contraceptive injection was in April 2008? You haven't had one since? If you had unprotected sex last night then there is a chance that you are pregnant. It can take awhile for your cycle to re-establish itself after stopping progestogen contraceptives- particularly the injection, however you can still get pregnant even if you are not having regular periods.    If you are not planning to get pregnant, I suggest you go and get the morning after pill.

I know you think it's a lot but that's what your body NEEDS to function.    After you have started eating healthier you can try to burn 2-3,000 calories a day to burn fat.

GBKaftrJaa	Certainly I will pray for your boyfriend and his dad and you.    1. Go to www.WebMD.com and look up pancreatic cancer.  There will be a topic overview, symptoms, treatment, home treatment, just keep clicking on all the pages for it and you'll have a very good understanding of it.  And it's a very reputable site.    2. Be a good listener.  Be able to be calm and quiet around him and don't try to cheer him up if he doesn't want that.  It's hard to be around people acting cheery when you are hurting.    Also some of the normal natural stages of grief that can come in any order are denial, anger, blame, etc so however he feels at any given point, it's normal and ok for him to feel that way. It's a stage. And he could go through those stages for many years after his dad's death. The final stage of grief is just acceptance.    And take your cues from him, if he wants to talk about it he will, if he doesn't don't press the issue.  Sorry you are dealing with this.|`|8UQ7GupHaa	Ok !   This will help u ! . . . .

And pray with your boyfriend. Talking about cancer is very hard to do, especially for the families of cancer patients. And yes there will definitely be times when your bf will be depressed and distant. You might want to say something like this,"Honey  I am truly sorry about your dad being so sick.

First of all, try not to bother too much with statistics; pancreatic cancer, sadly, is a very vicious cancer which usually spreads, and that is never a good thing.  Giving out statistics may upset your boyfriend more.  Please try not to talk too much about it to him.    Try not to mention his dad too much, but be sensitive of his situation and offer to be there whenever he needs you.  The best thing you can do, is try to gently talk about normal things, but not too often.  And sometimes, just holding somebody is good enough.  It's nice to see that you're so concerned, I'm sure you're doing a great job.|`|bfhsP4GFaa	My boyfriends father died from lung cancer when we were in the eighth grade. If his dad isn't in too rough of shape, ask if it would be okay to hang out with him with your boyfriend, that way you're showing interest in his father and he gets to spend more time with him while he can. If his dad's in the hospital, bring balloons, or board games - things for you to do. Get to know his father - It will be harder for you if he passes, but you and your boyfriend can grieve together. It's a lot easier to grieve in front of someone when they are upset as well. If he's at home, come over and help cook dinner for everyone. Watch movies together, have "family" nights. I can't stress enough how important it is that he spend time with his father, but make sure you let him spend time alone with you as well, so he doesn't feel like you're pushing him too hard.    If his father does end up passing (or even if he survives), offer to run/walk/bike a marathon or raise money for cancer research in some way. It may not save his father, but it will save others from suffering the same loss or having to deal with this horrible disease.  This is really hard, you'll be in my thoughts.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Firstly I'm truly sorry to hear about your boyfriends Dad , any form of cancer is terrible cause it's so unpredictable , you sound a great girlfriend and he's going to need you by his side a lot during this time , try and get his Dad to try taking Flor - Essence this stuff has been amazing to people with cancer , Zeolite is another , cancer is not always bad news people do beat it , in a space of 2 years I had my Dad and best friend both pass on in my arms cause of this terrible illness , I will Pray that he recovers in the meantime make sure your boyfriend tells his Dad how much he loves him , lol .|`|acf2c4c647ac5cade01d5fbace174430aa	That is a hard thing to deal with.

That's exactly why you should not smoke.  He also went through therapy and had several operations.  He went back and fourth to the hospital, and my grandma had to make sure everything was okay.  My other grandpa was moving in the beginning of last summer, and he was lifting something up when he fell over.  My grandma took him to the hospital.  He was not doing well at all.  He then started feeling better and worse, up and down.  Then, he caught pneumonia, probably from the hospital.  He'd had it years before, when he was in the army or something...He died by the end of the summer, and it was one of the first major deaths I ever experienced.  My other grandpa, the one with cancer, is luckily doing fine now.  I would just try to comfort him and listen if he wants to talk about how it feels.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	First and foremost, I am very sorry to hear this and know what you are going through. The most important thing you need to remember is do NOT treat your boyfriend's father like he is dying. Its always in the back of your head but always keep positive.    My mother has been diagnosed with cancer 4 times in the past 10 years. It started in her right breast and went to her lungs and bones, then new breast cancer developed in her left breast this past summer. She started immediate chemo and intense radiation for 5 days straight. We are anxiously waiting for bone scan results, after an abnormally high blood test came back, to see if it has spread once again.     Cancer can be devastating but it is not a death sentence. Starting chemo right away is definitely good and can mean he has a better chance at a longer life.     Put yourself in your boyfriend and his father's shoes and imagine how you would want to be treated....just like a normal person. He may get sick and feel tired a lot but make him as comfortable as you can. Things can always get better, but we always tend to think they'll get worse.  Good luck and you're in my prayers.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	How much time you want me to pray ,you tell me ,I am ready to pray,i have sufficient time but I think praying is useless.My father had severe constipation and used to pray a lot with god but why  god will help-we should follow health rules -he never got cure since he did  not follow health rules-  -You can write e mails to me by clicking my profile here

The only thing you should really stay away from is apples and corn on the cob.  Since you have to bite into those, you can break brackets easily.    Also, if you eat things like rice make sure to get it out of your braces before talking to anyone (though it won't actually harm the braces)!|`|ntVUlSozaa	Braces are incredible annoying, especially at first. It's hard to eat or drink practically anything at first from cold soda to hard candy ( because it might knock against your gums or braces because your gums are so raw.  You basically can't eat anything that's too sticky (like laffy taffy, carmel, honey,) might get really stuck in your braces, or anything close to as hard as an apple. Anything you can't bite through without  barely any force is basically a no no unless you do it very slow.  It will probably still hurt though, depending or maybe not depending how new the braces are.|`|fNiX1W3raa	You can't eat gum, gooey foods like caramels and gummy bears. You also can't eat popcorn which stinks because of the kernels in the popcorn. No big chips, break big chips into littler pieces before consuming.    If you have a lot of questions you should ask an orthodontist or a dentist.    Good luck with braces!|`|JvBVpHMpaa	I'd stay away from caramels, jolly ranchers and things you have to bite into.  Most important is cleaning your teeth and gums after you are finished eating.  An ortho brush and the platypus flosser will help keep your teeth and gums healthy while you are wearing braces.
AA10725882	Teenagers can get hit by lightning too - but not commonly.  The National Weather Service has recorded 3,239 deaths and 9,818 injuries from lightning strikes between 1959 and 1994 in the U.S.    Some of these people must have been teens.    The youngest case of breast cancer I have seen reported was 22, but I'm sure it is possible for a teenage woman to develop a breast carcinoma.  It is just very uncommon - probably less common than being hit by lightning.    Of course any suspicious lump should be assessed by an experienced doctor, but there is little need for all the panic there seems to be among teens.  This question comes up on Yahoo Answers about once a week if not more often.    I would like to have a link to a case report that anyone may know about regarding a documented breast carcinoma in a teen age woman.  People - as above - often answer this question by saying it can definitely happen.  I'm sure it could happen.  I just would like to see the case documentation.  It must be very rare.  Breast cancers usually take years to develop and are far more likely in older women.    NCI data : http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/facts...  A woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer is:  - from age 30 through age 39  "1 in 233"  - from age 40 through age 49  "1 in 69"  - from age 50 through age 59  "1 in 38"  - from age 60 through age 69  "1 in 27"    And from : http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/sta...

vVfH8yBYaa	Ovarian cancer can move throughout the body, sometimes entering the plural (lung) cavity. A common symptom of this is a buildup of fluid in around the lungs. It can be drained using a procedure called a thoracentesis, but often returns. They will probably do pathology on the fluid if they drain it, to see if it possesses cancerous cells.    ...actually, I'm guessing they have already done pathology on the fluid, since they've decided to resume her chemo treatments.    I wish you both well. Sorry to hear your news.|`|AA10725882	"Danielle" is correct.  The oncologist would not have started the chemotherapy treatments again unless he or she had evidence that the pleural fluid in the lungs was related to spread of the ovarian cancer.    What surprises me is that you went into the office with your mom and are not sure what this means.  This should have been explained to your mom when the repeat chemotherapy decision was made.  Though sometimes people are in shock and don't hear everything that the doctors and the oncology nurses explain.  Be sure to go with you mom for her office visits and listen to the explanations.  If your mom does not understand the situation, you and she may need to ask more questions of the medical care team.  The doctors and nurses managing her cancer care know all the details of the case that we on the internet do not have..

Look...I am male, and I can tell you that I had a date that was 26 years old and she could not fill her A cup.    This was the best date I have ever had.  She even made fun of her mosquito bites as she called them.  Guys look at big boobs all the time but we take the little ones home with us.    Small indicates youth.  We don't date cows we date girls.  This is something many girls do not really get.  Mostly because kids in school tease you or the media puts so much importance on them.  They do nothing for us.    If you have big utters then they are all FAT, and if you like that then you will get that in  other places too.   I would date an A cup before I would date a B or C any day.   Also I would never date anyone bigger than C.    While in males a bigger penis might be desired and benefitial. the opposite is true in breast size.  Right now you just don't understand this, but as you indicated.. You are young, and yes you will be flat when you are that age.  Do not worry about it at all.  If you made A cup you are there already, and that is far enough.    Guys don't want cows... We want girls...   Always remember that. Try not to let the size or shape or color of a tit to make you feel badly about yourself.  Learn to laugh about you being flat.  Don't worry...  While kids will measure you up.  No real guy would ever refuse you on this, and the older the male the more important it is to have smaller ones.      As I stated...  As soon as the cup goes beyond C, I look elsewhere.  If a girl tells me she can't fill an A cup.  Then I found the right girl.  On the other hand, if she gets fake ones she is done for.  Likewise if she smokes.  Both of them will end a date in seconds.    But A or less and you are doing fine cause they will be able to see your ribs and you will in most cases not be over 120 pounds.  They will be able to lift you over the threshold.  8-)    Do not wish to be a cow...  Its not what males want.  Kids are different.  They tease you cause they can...  Don't let it worry you. If you have A's already at your age... You are doing just fine.    Begin by loving the fact that they are small, and by hoping they stay that way.  The smaller the better.  Really... Later in life you will understand this.  I know you can't see it just yet.  Imagine loosing a possible date cause you're a cow...     Golf balls are better then basketballs.  If a kid tells you you're flat.. Tell him he has a small you know what.      Hope this helps you.  Cause its true....|`|7yM2doGlaa	Well, you're only 15 and have a good 8-9 years of growing left in you.  Breasts are basically just fat, so gaining weight naturally might help speed up the process, but just give it time. You'll fill out most likely|`|NBf5q2f5aa	probably or u might hav ur g-mas genes i hav my moms shes a DD and im 14 and a C|`|tBQDHGwmaa	Everyone grows at their own pace.  I know what you mean by hating your boobs....  But mine is the other way around. :(  Mine are super big. In a couple of months I will be 15.   But it could be just a faze.  You can get a padded bra with a lot of push up. That will make them look fuller. Never tried one (since I'm the opposite) but you could look at water bras.  I know a few girls that are 15 and 16 and are still A's.  Don't worry about it.   They can get bigger, and they may not.  But whatever happens, just be you. :)    Kendra |`|hFgXi9cSaa	wow dis is akward y am i here DX....?!    well things always work them selves out i cant  assure u they will  get huge but they  wont stay "pointy" but they'll grow into them  selves|`|m33lHLZJaa	Even though you aren't a preteen kid anymore, you are still developing. Be patient with yourself. In the meantime, if it makes you more comfortable, buy padded bras with extra support at the base of the cup. This will even out their odd shape.     Hope this helps!|`|I0Hjx0ahaa	Look at it this way, even if you are never a regular Pamela Anderson, you will never have super saggy old lady boobs either. Rejoice in the fact that you are thin and healthy and all the guys I know would rather have a slender, less endowed girl than a chunkier girl with bigger boobs.     Good luck. :)
qm6jJjoOaa	It is perfectly normal to be curious.    This usually happens during teenage years, when hormone levels increase.    I think many females are turned on by lesbian porn, and the majority of females that watch porn enjoy lesbian and sometimes prefer this category.     You seem to be a little curious right now, but as you say, you are still attracted to your boyfriend, i wouldn't think about it too much.     You may well be Bisexual, but it will take a while to figure it out as life can be confusing at times.     And in the future, if you are sexually attracted to other females, you should really explore your curiosity and find what really makes you happy.|`|tpG1KBj4aa	thats a tuff question! you might be bisexual b/c you have a bf or you might just be a little confused. Maybe lesbians do it better..idk i havent really seen it b4 lol but who knows just keep doing whatever youre doing    hope this helped:)|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	Hi linzy.i think your bi curious.not gay not bi but curious|`|ioBUzPVraa	what is wrong with people today? you are in a good relationship.  stop watching Mtv, get a mind of your own and think for yourself. Don't worry about being gay, just dont ever be.|`|H1hrU1X7aa	well that isn't that bad. i' sure it's nothing. just like some guys aren't gay but are interested in the way some guys look. i'm sure ur fine.    hope i helped|`|bLahP9Ivaa	A lot of people have fantasies they would new act opon. Actually I have seen a lot of similar questions from straight guys that love their girlfriends but get off in gay porn. Society tells you it's wrong but of it works for you who cares.|`|VTZpfTcaaa	Whats this got to do with mental health?|`|St7z8yyyaa	i like mustard too.    and i'd say your bi [:|`|yql9cGBtaa	maybe ur bisexual  meaning u like your sex and the opposite|`|24biipOpaa	I think you're straight. Some things just turn us on and if it works for you then just go for it. I myself am a girl with a boyfriend and I'm positive I'm straight but when I watch porn I have to hear girls moaning and I like to watch the lesbian stuff, I don't know why and I was embarrassed about it for the longest time but eventually I figured out that it was actually pretty normal and even then I shouldn't be embarrassed. We each kind of get off to our own stuff. Girl porn for a girl, not that bad.|`|fWyHpeRiaa	Why did you capitalize the beginning of every word?  Maybe you're bi, who knows. Maybe you need some experimentation in your life, huh? ha ha, go for it girl...|`|H2h5nZLjaa	your straight.... ur just naturally turned on by a beautiful image but your 100% straight.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Well maybe it has something to do with the perversion level that gets you going .. or you could be bi???|`|djhCah5Maa	Men dominate women in those movies and they are ugly. Maybe you just like the women in those movies, because they are more gentle with each other.  If you aren't attracted to women you see in public, then I wouldn't worry about it.|`|vGC9hk7Zaa	I like mustard.|`|n7eC02ZNaa	thats cuz balls are ugly|`|6PNuFgTJaa	Try not to think about it. Everyone's thought about it every once in a while and it isn't strange. Maybe you're bisexual.|`|pmNGmqNCaa	You should should see a counselor and then if you continue to be lesbian or bi you should talk to your bf about. Threesome...|`|PYraGxKraa	i once read i think in cosmo thats its normal for straight girls to get turned on by other girls ex watching lesbian porn but maybe you could be bi-sexual nothing wrong with that|`|t3kcoyi1aa	DUMASSS DO ITT DON WATCH IT|`|2QSPkrakaa	That's common for boys, some straight boys watch gay porn to get turned on and im sher it can work both ways :)  (4yi, i don't apply because i AM gay)
XiZIY585aa	OMG, don't use baby oil!!! It can cause UTI's and yeast infections. If KY isn't doing the job, try Extra Virgin Olive Oil (make sure it's EVOO). It won't irritate and shouldn't get sticky at all. Actually my wife and I use it often, not just for intercourse but for shaving as well (shaving down there of course).    I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|VpQ5ZmsMaa	KY is the best. But I also like Astroglide. It kinda feels like ur own lubricant ;).|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Try Replens.  Our doctors swear by it for women.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Actually I think KY is about the best out there.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of baby oil, but if you use condoms it can break them down.|`|cUYunFvHaa	well, maybe ur using the ky warming, it always dries up and gets so ticky that it actually counter acts what its made for,     but for the real truth about it........ RE-APPLY, duh, any lube when doing it long enough just goes away, maybe not silicone, but  give one aspect for the other.....it taste terrible, and why not just re-apply when changing into a new position, have fun with sex, enjoy it...........    flavroed, baby, kuz mid -F ck u might  want to eat it, all of it, and the other stuff tatse nasty, so yeah i like flavored lube, and berry and apple are my fav's, kuz i cant stop, cant stop, cant stop eating................pleasin.............. u believe in................me!!!!|`|svg71dazaa	I use Les Femina intimate lubricant gel which works well as it is an anti-bacterial too.|`|koAaPXKQaa	I really like Liquid Silk.
eGNMkdJBaa	i believe you have to go see a doctor first, just go to a walk in and they'll make a recommendation for you and book the appointment. much easier then trying to randomly search for an obgyn. :)

hl9nqKQ2aa	I had a similar problem, i use to wake up at 4am on the dot all the time - it eventually went.  From the research I did at the time i know that the nocturnal fall in plasma adrenaline in your body occurs at that sort of time, hence why most asthma attacks occur at that sort of time, are you asthmatic? Im not but i deduced it had something to do with that, otherwise no idea sorry!|`|bxlYleZkaa	Switch off you alarm clock or set a different time on it!|`|djhCah5Maa	Are you drinking?  It can make you have problems with sleeping.
HwxBL1B1aa	natures alarm clock  something is triggering your brain to wake up that time|`|UtYOwE4Laa	well, it's probably not the time. i don't know why, but i kept waking up between 4:30 and 4:46 for a couple weeks. i think it's just something in your brains chemicals that are making it happen, and it'll probably go away soon.

Stuttering Foundation on Facebook    Contact The Stuttering Foundation of America as that is where our family got help. Their book "Self Therapy for the Stutterer" worked wonders after working through it step by step.  The book can be found here http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.as...     Some medications that other stutterers have tried include lorazepam, citalopram, celexa, and buspar.  Ask your doctor about trying an anti-anxiety medication while you are working on your stuttering.  Be aware that your stuttering may be better than the side-effects of the medication, though.    Each stutterer is different, and a therapist who specializes in treating stuttering will be able to determine what will help you the most as they work with you.    The Stuttering Foundation has information on this page http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.as... about getting insurance coverage for therapy.|`|k4NAnEYpaa	speak slowly, don't rush and build your way up.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	go to speech therapy, insurance might cover it

ufgv7oTjaa	Yeah, I've tried Horny Goat Weed a few times and it really lives up to it's name. Personally, I prefer just taking it in a capsule form... it's much easier to use that way, in my opinion, as compared to brewing a tea or chewing on dry herbs. I hope I helped!|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	No I haven't heard it. I don't usually listen to weeds, they lie too much.|`|WN6tWLdYaa	STUPID!|`|rHNQFVMvaa	Horny Goat Weed is called "Yin Yang Huo" in China and has been used there for over a thousand years for--among other things--enhancing libido, especially in older or aging men (it is considered a yang tonic).  It is traditionally decocted in water, usually with other herbs.
1oBilGHuaa	Two milligrams is a rather high dose to take so early in the morning.  Talk to your doctor about your feeling tired.  He/she might cut down the dose of the Klonazepam. There are also other medications that can help calm you besides Klonazepam.  I hope you and your doctor will find what works best for you.  Best Wishes.|`|a0v3q3J4aa	You might want to consider moving the Klonopin to at night.  That's when I take mine. I wake up just fine and I'm still pretty chill the next day.    Other than drinking a lot of caffeine, there really isn't much you can do to counteract the effects.    I highly would recommend against the caffeine idea though because then you are mixing a stimulant with a depressant in your blood stream and can put a lot of stress on your heart that way.
ToILKl6waa	I dealt with the same thing throughout high school with my anxiety attacks, and it of course negatively conflicted with my grades.     It's certainly unfair nowadays that teachers don't consider students' psychological difficulties, but then again - their job is merely to teach and be fair to the class as a whole. It is your responsibility to pull together the stress and depression for the benefit of your studies. When this happened to me, I didn't depend on anyone but myself. I woke up one day and just stopped caring. I stopped caring about failure, what people think, and the outcome of my anxiety - it was only pressure that I didn't need at all. This in turn boosted my confidence and allowed me to be more relaxed during class and concentrate on the select concepts instead of my anxiety. Remember - you are in control. Not the depression/anxiety. BE in control and do not give up no matter what obstacles come towards you. With each success story comes failure somewhere along the way.|`|HwxBL1B1aa	o yah but i deal wif it  it is my fault  my depression caused me to do this   now how can i fix this?  take my time and do the same crappy work i would do if i was depressed rushing doing the same crappy work.  but hey i work best when i am under pressure.  so to anyone who doubts my methods bite me coz i gets tha job done!  lmao|`|8VIi1LP5aa	I had depression/anxiety in highschool.  I could hardly concentrate and failed alot of subjects.  I also got C's and D's in practically every other subject.  It sort of does feel a little unfair to be graded the same since you can hardly concentrate with those types of conditions but once I realized that highschool sucks period for everyone in some shape or form and got put on medication I found it easier to get interested and stay focused.  Depression/Anxiety in school is so common.  Once I graduated from school it literally disappeared.  I realized that I had my whole life ahead of me and school was just some place I legally had to be.  It will get better.  Try focusing on subjects you really enjoy and just try to do the best you can with the others.|`|vE5yNphwaa	i deal with my anxiety and depression using Vilift, i am more relax and i am more productive. all feelings of depression are gone in an instant.
9OqSl1Jlaa	Take an over the counter diuretic.|`|b6QzfsMUaa	Pee. :]|`|dTdLrjFNaa	This sounds like it won't work, but you need to drink more to flush it out. You don't get enough water, so your body retains it.
AeeX1Wnkaa	No problem with taking both of those.
ikbHM3tUaa	Your spleen is basically used to filter blood supply, and is generally not necessary. However, one important thing it does is to help remove dangerous bacterial pathogens circulating in the blood, such as Strep. So people who have their spleen removed are at higher risk of infection. This is also why people with spleens removed have a different immunization record than the normal schedule.|`|eIVy7xkXaa	The spleen functions as an antigen presentation center and a remover of old erythrocytes, if I remember correctly.  The loss of the spleen would have consequences on the quality of your red blood cell population as well as your body's ability to mount an adaptive immunity defense.|`|lXJbuz2Yaa	What does the spleen do?     Your spleen, located in the upper left side of your abdomen, helps your body resist infection. Sometimes, the spleen stops working properly as a result of an accident or other health problems. In certain cases, a person's spleen has to be taken out. This procedure is called a splenectomy.    What are the risks if my spleen has to be taken out?  If your spleen has to be taken out, you are more at risk of getting severe infections. Your risk of infection is highest in the first 2 years after you have a splenectomy. Your risk will also depend in part on your age and whether you have other diseases.    My Mom had her spleen removed due to Hodgkin's Disease.  She got continuous infections including Bronchitis & Pneumonia even though she was extremely careful.  She would also get fevers of unknown origin.
SkuJYv5xaa	I smell a troll|`|2aK9IJbiaa	go to the nearest hospital quickly you have serious damage to your penis and this is no laughing matter sounds like pieces of glass have damage your urethra left un treated any longer will cause severe damage in which could not  be able to fix|`|ce30c8b63dbb0508aa3d812bbd31c63faa	What do you think you should do, ask Tom, Dick, Harry and Suzie OR ask a doctor??|`|fdbIEzJmaa	what are you that drunk that u start doing beer bottles?|`|zNPGaZRHaa	ER, go now. also avoid putting penis in a bottle next time.|`|zBpj9jCfaa	holy god, go to a hospital!|`|qX0KdYUjaa	Were you fuc**** a bottle?|`|yqsqKh3Daa	HAWT|`|W2z5dCrmaa	I'm not sure what kind of a party you were at over the weekend, I would stay clear of that group for sure. You need to go to a doctor and get the glass removed and checked to see if there are any other symptoms of anything that can wreck your gear or even you health.    Never let yourself get into a drunken or stoned condition where you are at the mercy of what others decide to do with your body, and even your private Dude parts. Stoned or drunk people have no sense of good judgment or even common sense. Any crazy idea takes over.     If someone happened to take notice your jeans bulge, or your gear in your clothing while your passed out, no guessing the outcome!     strange as it might sound, jealousy or even a male competitive notion with a stoned Dude could lead to strange and unexpected actions toward another Dude who can't defend himself or even realize what is going on.     Me! :- )
EN32vSsCaa	A documented side effect of Prilosec (omeprazole) is elevated blood pressure.|`|la3Y0QHiaa	call a local pharmacy ask your pharmacist. Dont take either drug within two hours of any blood pressure medications.  When the bottom numberof  b/p rises this indicates that your heart is meeting more pumping resistance when blood flows thru the veins back to the heart. Try exercise to decrease the bottom number. If ok with the doctor.
2c8MZxS4aa	If you grab any box of hookah tobacco they will all say generally the same thing on the side:  http://www.hookah-shisha.com/store/pc/vi...  Tobacco, (one or more of: Molasses, Glycerin, Honey), natural Flavors.    If it's Herbal like Hydro or Soex. Replace tobacco with Sugar Cane Bagasse.    Common Sense says cigarettes are worse, don't you think?|`|7IBJZrWjaa	no, most hookah mixes are different tobaccos and herbs but cigerettes are tobacco with toxic addatives such as nicotine and cionide... so its still bad for your lungs and can lead to cancer with certan blends but its not as potent or bad as cigs... marijuana slows tumer growth and has no link to cancer... smoke bud if you wanna be safe!

mlh58PTNaa	Not sure why you would want to, but just make a plan and stick with it.  Pot is psychologically addictive (its all in your mind).  I have read that the supplement, choline, can help.|`|uC75y83Taa	Pot is not addictive like, say, cigarettes or heroin!  So you are NOT physically addicted. Hopefully that bit of knowledge will help you a lot.  To answer your question, just stop!  Bless you and congrats!  A natural high is so much better!  :)|`|MLOTRHhsaa	Stop hanging around the people that smoke it. Stop buying it. Stop lighting it up. Really not that hard.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	Marijuana doesn't contain anything to make it chemically addictive...so essentially, just quit.
AA10404097	The penis will change size with temperature as I am sure you know. It always returns to its normal size. Should it for some reason not then you need to get it looked at. There is just the smallest chance that you might have injured the blood supply but I am really doubting that. However, if several days go by or you start having pain then get seen at once.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	well like you stated,  your penis shriveled up because of the cold water and it will return to normal size.    /jerome|`|dI1umvklaa	I'll be happy to supply you a case of blue balls instead|`|hBmafVYoaa	It will at some point.

wMx9Z2gTaa	Growing teens have much higher caloric needs than adults. That means they need to eat a much larger amount than most grown ups. If she is not gaining weight, just make sure she gets plent of protein (meat, fish, cheese, milk, eggs) and fresh fruits and vegetables.     Feeding a teenager is not cheap. You did not say why she is living with you, but if she has been neglected or underfed in the past, her body may be trying to catch up nutritionally. Also, if she has been underfed, she may over-eat when plentiful food is available. You may want to talk to the school nurse or a nutritionist about what a normal amount of food is for a girl her age and size.|`|3tnistZQaa	It's a growing age so of course they eat a lot. Just stop bringing in the junk food or cut down on it.|`|AA10458296	She is a growing girl. Don't buy crap foods and she won't gain weight. Fix her a meal instead of letting her graze on it and let her eat all she wants, she will not be hungry after that.    I understand the feeling of being incredibly hungry always and try to fill up on low calorie foods, or I would easily break 2,000 cals a day and grow fat!|`|qX0KdYUjaa	Lock her in a cage. And feed her only with bread and water.,|`|ckpVwS5Uaa	tell her to chill out shell get fat.|`|fmeuE91Paa	Teenagers eat a lot of food becuase they NEED to. Teenagers are growing just as much as a baby is growing so they need lots of nutrients and rest. Maybe buy more filling foods or just start buying more food. If your worrying about your teenager gaining wieght then make sure your not buying junk food or foods containing a lot of fats or sugars. Maybe you could also just simply ask your teenager to try not to eat as much, they'll probably try to the best of their ability lol.
9If6UnCZaa	shut up! your soo skinny and you want to GAIN weight?    im wishing i was you right now.|`|uAy7Y6HPaa	eat a little more.|`|dlgQCSocaa	Sorry, cannot really add inches to your bust - your bust in manily fat cells; exercises for the chest just tone the muscles,and help support your breasts and decline the amount they sag.  To add to your hips, you can try some strength training exercises: seated leg press, hip adduction, hip abduction, squats, lunges, etc.  This will only add, if you are lacking muscle there already.  You should be happy with what you have, 1 inch off isn't bad!

d1DlU0ydaa	You are still in a fast from your sleep, it is important to break this fast by  eating when you wake up otherwise you won't be hungry. Your body fasts when you sleep so that you don't wake up hungry|`|8YGjd0icaa	maybe you're a bit sick eh|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	If you dont eat you dont get hungry for a long while.

8jBGhsWPaa	for someone who has never tried anal sex before its going to be really painful just like having sex for the first time its something she needs to get used to. Some woman are not comfortable having anal sex so make sure she is happy your doing it. Anal sex can be very painful so bare in mind she might not be to keen on the idea of anal sex.  Make sure you use plenty of lube!! to help things slide in more smoothlu and feel more comfortable for your fiance.|`|lYr1zmQeaa	repetition and practice|`|7yM2doGlaa	haha I hope you're joking about the pornstar thing.

qm6jJjoOaa	It means you are not cutting your self, but you are clearly trying to hurt yourself in some way.    Sounds as though you have a mental issue, which is causing you to do such a thing in the first place.     You really need to think why you are doing this and get to the root of the problem, by talking to some one you trust about whats bothering you|`|hYohgOcAaa	get a life dont do that **** ur only gona kill urself like that or have scares, dont ruin ur life if u have problems take care of them and move on with ur life have fun kid dont do that to ur self|`|e1LCIzvzaa	Still means you are injuring yourself,therefore it is self-injury.|`|rllnRDNmaa	you didnt cut deep     i dont like it when it bleeds  ppl can see it more then|`|9QL9Wpo8aa	whether it bleeds or not if its still meant to cause pain or hurt you it isn't good.|`|rsYbDHWRaa	id say that falls more under the category of scratching..   but either way (as others have said) its still considered self injury and thats really not good hun. i can promise you if you dont stop it now, itll get worse. thats how i started out.   id suggest talking to someone :)
ikbHM3tUaa	Thats absolutely not healthly. Would you characterize the bowel movements as being liquidy? or are they normal in consistency. Usually someone having 15 BM's a day is in a diarrheic episode brought on by infection or some type of bowel disease (IBD,IBS etc.). The way you phrase it makes it sound like the stools are normal, its just that you are having many a day. This is fairly unusual, I do remember that multiple bowel movements can be a sign of various hyper-metabolic disorders, such as hyperthyroidism, this is definitely something that should be evaluated by a physician.|`|zgBelCROaa	You should not be pooping 15 times a day. That is totally not healthy. If by bowel movements you are trying to say urinating also (which is not a bowel movement) then you are normal.|`|YUjVFkocaa	nahh, sometimes that happens.  i had it today too.  i was in the DC area, if that means anything.      what its caused by is simply eating the wrong foods, eating alot, etc|`|eIVy7xkXaa	That's higher than anything I've personally experienced.  Sounds like you have major diarrhea.  Keep replacing whatever fluids that you've lost.  If you are feeling dehydrated even when you're drinking as much as possible, then you should probably call the doc.  Cholera kills people because it makes them lose fluids faster than they can replenish with water, etc.  I doubt you have that, but I thought you might want to know the worst case scenario.  You would get cholera in places with bad sanitation, like current Zimbabwe, but I doubt that it's cholera if you're in a pretty developed country.|`|XBmGdMdWaa	Thats very very not good.

XT9LqOp1aa	Since he already took the molding and xrays and the insurance company has been called... my answer is maybe. It depends on if you need an expander or spacers before they place the braces on you. If you don't need anything other than straight braces I say yes you will have them.|`|4G64NEtxaa	You will probably get spaces, then you will go back and they will put the braces on.

4arnbpUCaa	The scar and discoloration is a result of your circumcision.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	It's a circumcision scar -- it's normal.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	it is the circumcision scar|`|Yatf7VIoaa	yeah i got one too its normal. cuz when ur born your uncircumsized and when they cut that skin that protects the glands or head, it either darker or lighter then the outside|`|3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	The foreskin is not a single layer of skin, unlike that in most other parts of the body, but is a double layer rather like the cuff of a shirt.    The inner layer is of a different type of material (called mucosa) from the outer layer which is continuous with the shaft skin.  The mucosa layer is a lighter colour then the outer layer.    During most infant or childhood circumcisions the inner and outer layers are cut through together in such a way as to place the line of the cut about an inch (25 cm) behind the rim of the glans.  The two layers are then stitched together or simply allowed to join naturally at this point.    The result is a distinct colour change where the outer layer meets the former inner layer.  There may also be a brown circular scar line between the two layers, but this is often now particularly noticeable and only the colour difference confirms one's circumcision.
LPtUJ5p5aa	First of all, congrats on stopping the harm.    Counseling sessions are not about stopping, they are about treating the reason why you STARTED in the first place.    As a counselor will tell you, the unsresolved issues still remain, and if they aren't worked out, things have a way of repeating themselves.    EVERYONE can benifit from counseling, I went for a period of time, just becuase I thought it would help work out some everyday life stress and frustrations that we face from day to day, and it really did.    Couselors will most likely ask you about your past, childhood, parents, growing up to find the underlying reason why would started self harming. Its a step by step process, but trust me there is nothign to be scared of. I bet after your first session, you will walk out of there with a whole new sense of hope.    Take the time to go, you will thank yourself for it, I did!|`|39x9tNJzaa	There is nothing healthy or normal about self harm.  If you're doing this then you need to get into counseling RIGHT NOW.  There are deep, underlying problems that make you feel the need to do these things and they need to be dealt with.    As for whether or not it's helpful, I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Without counseling and medication my doctor would have had me intsitutionalized or I would be dead by now.    As for what they ask you the first time they see you, well, that depends on your counselor.  Some of them cut to the chase, some of them just talk with you so you get comfortable being around them and talking to them.  If you're like me, you have no problem telling them what's going on in your head.  It's confidential, they can't tell anybody without your permission or a court order.  They'll probably ask you a series of questions, chat with you about your interests, depression, and life, and generally try to get a good feel for what's going on with you.  Basically, from the get go, they'll be trying to diagnose you.  A diagnosis is good.  A proper diagnosis means they can start treating you.|`|vizw0lataa	the best suggestion i have is when you have the urge, just do something that physically hurts, but isn't bad. For example, try doing push ups until it hurts, or run until it hurts. Plus, after doing that, you will be too tired to do much else.|`|siTibEIGaa	It will be helpful because they will help you stop harming altogether. They will help you understand the cause of your harming. Please go and talk to them. Just because you stopped for 1 month doesn't mean you can't slip up and get into trouble and you may start harming more than ever before. It might take a year or two, or just a couple of months, but it will happen again and will get progressively worse as you get older unless you seek help. Now is the time to get help because you are younger and you even say yourself it isn't out of control yet.|`|rllnRDNmaa	therapist made me sadder  but made my friend happier    could help|`|GgcBzuplaa	Hi.  I have also been dealing with self harm so i know from experience that you need professional help to get over the addiction.  Cutting is an addiction just like drinking and drugs can be.  A therapist can show you ways to deal with whatever is bothering you.  I know that my therapist has really helped me so i only cut once in a blue moon.      Also there are some support sites online such as my site (http://selfhelp.yuku.com) and a site i used to go to (www.recoveryourlife.com).    In the mean time these are some useful tips:  -Read  -Run or walk  -write in a journal  -write poetry  -use your five senses to get in the moment (5 things you see, 5 things you hear, 5 things you taste, etc)  -play video games  -watch tv  -draw  -if you have a pet play and pet it  -exercise  -watch a movie  - call a friend  -call a family member|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Self harming is an addiction that requires professional help. When you hurt yourself it releases hormones called Endorphins which are feel good hormones. This release only last for a short while. It is extremely dangerous as you can as others have done cause lifelong serious damage to your body.  With therapy you will learn good and healthy skills to help you deal with the anxiety and anger that causes you to self harm. Don't think that because you stopped for a month that you don't have a problem. You do and your friend is very helpful and caring and you need to follow up with her help and advise to see a doctor and then therapy.  Take care of yourself please.

Sorry, it's just so weird that places in America can be so hard-core religious about sex. It's a strange concept in Europe and the UK.    Burning is very common but I couldn't say what causes it in your case without knowing more details; go ask your doctor and I'm sure he or she will advise you; you might need treatment for a minor infection but more likely it's dryness caused by an allergic reaction to something.    http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/adv...|`|Xmr76hGJaa	You need to wait until your married to be having sex.  Period    Second, protected intercourse is a condom,     there is not a man alive who truly respects a woman  if he has sex with her before marriage,  A woman who does that is nothing more than an unpaid whore.    50 years ago in society people who had sex before marriage were called whores, and they got paid for it.  He does not respect you,  You are not respecting yourself.  Now, GO Get married.

All guys worry about having an erection in the locker room. If it happens, it doesn't mean anything, it's only a reflex. And chances are, it won't happen.    I've been in a lot of locker rooms since grade 7. I was a varsity athlete in HS and college, and a professional lifeguard, and a lot of locker rooms since then, and it's very, very rare. And on the extremely rare occasions when it did, nobody made fun of anyone.    You need to understand that all the other guys around you are worrying about the same thing, because at your age, all the hormones are raging, and most guys get frequent erections anyway.    Heck, at your age, I could have gotten aroused by the sight of a brick wall!! But its rare for it to happen in a locker room.    No, no one will make fun of you because you are not circumcised. And if they did (extremely unlikely) you just look them straight in the eye and ask, "Why are you interested?" Guaranteed, *that* will shut them up! (Same comment about erections.)    Or a variation, "Why are you looking?" Trust me, this *will* shut them up!|`|hFgXi9cSaa	theres a bathroom in there right? change there....|`|Yatf7VIoaa	well you dont need to be completly naked when changing. change fast and get out the door and dont think about it .  think of a joke or talk to one of your friend while your changing. and if you do got a hard on. go to the bathroom and try to pee . because when you pee your body is forced to halt the process for getting ready for sex. thats why you get a  hard on in the first place is so you can do it or the body is testing itself. when i got changed i never really thought of that cuz  i would be talking to my friends and making small talk about school stuff. and if someone thats makes fun of people asks if you are circumsized or not. just say why do u like talking about di.ck.s. if not just answer and end it at that. if they laugh just say your not the only person with an uncircumsized pen is .

Don't feel bad that you're not circumcised.  That's the way a penis was made to be.  If someone makes fun of that, you can explain to them that they had parts of their penises cut off when they were newborns.  That's why they call uncut penises "intact".

d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	everyone has a six pack but its the diet that gives us low body fat and with low body fat the six pack will show|`|k4NAnEYpaa	Option  1.     Lie on the floor (with or without a mat) and cross your arms in front of your chest. Bend your knees up as far as they go. (Do not place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative is to cross your arms in front of your chest and lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat.    Option  2    Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it.    option  3    Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and your whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non weight bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long as possible.    Option  4  Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a 90 degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar.|`|pckuIRhsaa	Get your lazy butt off of the computer and exercise instead.|`|sGa0dahuaa	sit ups|`|n8Xylq4Oaa	you can do sit ups and other core exercises at home, easily. i recommend doing situps and planks just to start off, then if you can get an exercise ball(not expensive) you will be able to do more core exercise.|`|31Y5vbnIaa	You need to start working on your diet start eating a lot more healthier    stay away from carbs and get some proteins but eat lean meat very lean meat  eat a lot more vegetables and fruit and stay away from the unhealthy snacks  the healthier snacks are some times cheaper then the unhealthy ones and they will be a lot more beneficial  and you can easily do cit ups and crunches and v ups and many more in the comfort of your own home for free

AA10238113	I had the same problem when I first started using tampons too. I use tampax now, but I wouldn't recommend those if you're starting ( i only use them because the cardboard is bio-degradable).    Try using Playtex Gentle Glide (Regular -- not Super)!  They are slim and plastic, so they're easy to go up and since they're not cardboard there will be less friction and it will be more comfortable.    Try to lay on your back or spread your legs apart with your back straight and put the tampon in. Make sure you breathe and relax the area -- don't strain, it will only make it harder to put in all the way.     Also, don't be afraid to put it in far enough. If you barely push it in, it will hurt when you walk, sit or pretty much do anything because it will be pushing itself out. That was my mistake when I first started using them, if you do it right you won't even be able to tell it's in there!   Make sure you push it in at least an inch in you before you begin to push the tampon out of the applicator. There's enough room in there!    Best of Luck!|`|bL0G6EGNaa	i have no idea.. read a pamphlet.|`|CKTbXiBYaa	The tampons u use must suck.....try using playtex sport....they are so comfy and have 360 degree protection so they cant fall out|`|NBf5q2f5aa	slightly angled up just relax its easy|`|fusIwst4aa	The instructions,|`|XXf4JHd5aa	Ohh...well you just angle it very slightly and relax your shoulders, and take a deep breath...if it hurts then stop!

You should also squat, sit, or elevate one leg. Relax, and a good idea would be to use tampons that are plastic for easier insertion.  Good luck!|`|M3pRAe7Vaa	A great tip is to insert it while you are sitting on the toilet.  This position allows you to angle it at a natural angle, and allows for full insertion.    Best of luck.|`|AA11878029	You have to insert it all the way otherwise your muscles will push it out !!|`|jVHvm3akaa	it gives like reallyyyy detailed instructions on the package with diagrams and stuff!|`|40xNl5gnaa	Yikes..  Umm, make sure it is ALL the way in.  Also, if its going to fall out yuu're going to   have to use a bigger size.|`|m33lHLZJaa	Weeeelll, you might wanna read the little instructions for start. ;) that might help.    You want to insert it more facing upwards, as opposed to straight in or down. And you usually stop inserting it after your fingers have reached your actual groin. Ones that are used for sports might also help.|`|qbbNtGVcaa	ok i had the same problem as you. i never figured out how to put them in haha    1. take the tampon and put the whole thing up (yes even the little applicator thing) haha that's where i went wrong. i always thought that you have to just put that at the opening and not actually in  2. put the tampon in and then pull out the applicator thing. let the string hang down.     and its that easy haha. make sure you get plastic tampons. they're easier to use. the cardboard just doesn't fit in right. also that angle should be a little bit back. it goes right in when you get the hang of it    hope this helps :) good luck!|`|YJRCC0vbaa	It hurts because it's not in far enough. Applicator tampons are easier to use so start off with them but if you want to use non-applicators then you just have to push it up as high as it will go with your finger. It can't get lost in your body as it will only hit the cervix, so don't worry about that. It needs to be inserted at a slight angle, pointing towards your lower back, and it may be easier for you to put one leg up on the toilet seat and squat slightly. It takes a while to get the hang of it.
CSlw9Snbaa	One thing you can do is wear a pad also... just in case you get a leak.... also try changing it a little more often.|`|lYr1zmQeaa	use a bigger size the first few days of your period when it is heavier(first 3-4 days for me) and wear a liner in your underwear as backup so it doesnt happen again, i always wear a pad with it just to avoid that. but tss isnt a problem as long as you dont leave it in for more than 7-8 hours. but either change it sooner or upgrade to super, maybe both you'll just have to try it to find out. and if that does happen again try to pay attention to how it feels and make a break for the bathroom asap and change it.|`|YJRCC0vbaa	You can either change it more often or buy the bigger size.  You're only at risk for TSS if you use a higher size than needed, i.e. if you could get away with wearing a regular but are using a super size. You may only need the bigger size for a day or two until your flow gets lighter, then you can switch to the regular.   In time you will learn how long you need before you have to change your tampon.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	What I do is wear a pad with the tampon so I don't have to worry about leaks.|`|DNBYSdoVaa	well, just because you use a bigger absorbancy doesnt mean youll get TSS. its actually very rare. it happens alot if theyre left in TOO LONG. now, when blood kind of, well, you know, it could put you at risk for some things. hope this helps=]|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	From personal experience tampons are better than pads for heavy flow, it's good to change every 4 hours because of the discharge in there. It takes a while to get used to, pick any size that is comfortable for you, you may not be used to it yet.

HoZm5jadaa	The brain knows what muscle is being put to stress. Thru this function of the brain. The body develops accordingly. When you do not exert any workload your body adopts to that condition too. But , that only happens if the condition is not temporary.  "  If you give a certain muscle part stress in two or three consecutive days and take a rest for a day. the muscle relaxes but the brain is getting it ready to develop that muscle to be able to keep its activity. That is the reason why we say the phrase "til you get used to it". If you don't work that muscle anew, the brain would think that the past stress is only due to a temporary activity and it will stop the process of developing but would shift to the process of healing. Therefore, you need to repeat the same activity after the rest period. Don't keep your rest period too long as it is sending message to your brain that your activities are temporary and your development would enter a plateau(stagnation).|`|31Y5vbnIaa	Every other day    you want to give your muscles a break so they can recover
dIlMs2C9aa	Well, you are actually prolonging the sore area by exfoliating. As you noticed, the constant rubbing from blowing your nose has agitated your skin. I would not recommend trying to scrub any skin off--that's essentially what you did by blowing your nose so many times as a result of your cold. Instead, buy Vaseline or Neosporin and apply it to the dry skin as often as possible. Do it every night as well, and if you are worried it might come off on your sheets or pillow, then put the Vaseline/Neosporin cream on a band aid and place the band aid over your dry skin before going to bed. You can take it off in the morning and no one will know.    Basically, you want to help your skin heal itself. Don't rub or scratch it--soothe it with creams. Neosporin is more costly, but it works miracles. Go for the Neosporin.    If the dry area starts to scab or darken, this is a good sign that your skin is regenerating. It might not look great in terms of appearances, but it will peel off on its own in time. Just tell people you got the scar doing some gnarly jump on your snowboard or skateboard during the winter season ;-D
AA12141879	Hi Lozza, I used to write stuff like this when I was a teenager, the emotions building up inside me were so powerful and overwhelming that I was either pouring it out in words like you have here, or cutting my arms and legs with a razor.  Taking drugs and drinking and partying all night long, putting yourself at risk with these older guys, its all an escape from the internal hell.  I understand what you are going through, you remind me so much of my younger self.      I'm now in my late 20's and still suffering, though not nearly to the extent I was in my teens, or like you are now.  I know its difficult to ask for help, but my biggest regret is that I let it all go on for years and years when I could have asked for help and had a much better time during these years.      Carry on writing, its a great escape and one day, when you are well and happy, you will be able to look back on what you wrote and be thankful that it was in the past. Please, no matter how crazy and out of control you feel, be aware that there is help out there and it can make your life a hell of a lot easier.  Go to your GP, or speak to someone close, or call MIND or Breathing Space... I know its probably the last thing you feel like doing, but once you get the ball rolling you'll be glad you did.    You are obviously a passionate and talented creative person, so learn to channel your passion rather than turn it all in on yourself and suffer.    Best wishes x|`|Bj75uPyTaa	It's not crazy.

FicyC2TXaa	Nobody knows what causes  cancer, though many people - usually  those who have never had, studied or been close to cancer -  have their pet theories, usually based on hearsay or fear.    Smoking has been linked to lung and some other cancers, and excessive sun exposure to skin cancers. The sexually-transmitted HPV virus is linked to cervical cancer.     Other than that, we're still pretty much in the dark as to what cause cancer. It's rarely hereditary - fewer than 10% of all cases are hereditary.    There's no scientific evidence that any particular foods or diets cause or prevent cancer, or affect its progress in any way.     Different types of cancer have their own recognised risk factors - but risk factors are not causes. The difference? Well. insurance companies count 'being male' as a risk factor for having a car crash - but being male doesn't actually cause car crashes. 'Being male' is also a risk factor for heat attacks - but being male doesn't cause heart attacks. A risk factor is something about us or our lives that increases our chances of something bad happening to us. Having no children is a risk factor for breast cancer; but having no children doesn't cause breast cancer. Most women who have no children don't develop breast cancer.    If the causes of cancer were known, then we would understand how to prevent, treat and cure cancer.|`|AA10481903	Researchers estimate that 1/3 of all cancers are caused by Tobacco.

Unisom or melatonin are a great help if you want to go with supplements.  If not try to focus on something like a blank tv in your head or scuba diving, like you are going deeper and deeper.  That has worked a couple of times for me.  But like I said, I have struggled with it my whole life.  I would suggest melatonin.  It's a natural and I don't believe it's habit forming.|`|tBQDHGwmaa	Reading will help the mind focus on only one thing, instead of racing about the day's activities. Read something calming rather than an exciting thriller novel. Fairy tales or nonfiction would be good choices.  (Reading makes me sleepy)    Try a deep breathing exercise. For example, lie on your back in bed and breathe in deeply for four counts, watching your stomach rise, and then breathe out for four counts. Your goal is to breath in and out about six times per minute. Do this for about ten minutes (60 breaths) and then switch so you're lying on your right, and repeat the breathing process. Another way to go about doing it is this:      Take a deep breath using one nostril closed,   Now exhale with the nostril that is closed, during this exhalation, close the other.   Repeat these steps using the other nostril. Do this 60 times (at least 10 minutes) and you will feel very dizzy/relaxed.   Imagine yourself sinking into the mattress, Starting from the very tips of your toes. When you loosen all your muscles, it gives the effect that you're sinking in. In your mind, begin to "acknowledge" everything around you that all your senses are experiencing. For example: Say to yourself (not out loud), "I hear the clock ticking. I smell the lotion I just applied to my hands. I feel my legs' weight on the bed. I hear my spouse/partner breathing. I see different shades of black. I hear the dog barking in the distance. I hear myself in my own mind talking.", etc. This should help to clear your mind by slowly acknowledging everything and subsequently dismissing it. Stay on your back, sunk into the mattress until you feel it is time to roll into your desired position.   Pray or meditate. Whatever is on your mind is probably there for a reason. When you pray, do it the way you are supposed to. Keep your focus on the one you pray to. Dismiss whatever it is racing through your mind, and forget about the situation. If meditating, visualize yourself addressing your thoughts and resolving them. Or, meditate on a calming word or phrase. As you do so, it helps you to lower your heart rate and relax your muscles, making it easier for you to lay down and fall asleep. Many times this will work because you no longer have that burden on your mind and you can relax enough to fall asleep.   Give your brain an exercise. Count as high as you can. This makes your mind focus on one easy thing. Also, try doing mathematical calculations in your mind, for example, think of two or three digit numbers and add them up in your mind. Try counting backwards by threes or fours: 100, 97, 94... You may find you're asleep before you get to 0. If you're still awake try a bigger number and count slower.   Think of something very calming. Picture a waterfall. It is very calming and you will fall asleep quickly. This makes you calm. This also gets your mind away from distractions of life. But, if you're one of the people who associate waterfalls with urinating, be sure to use the toilet before doing this! You may also have a good dream. Pretend that you are floating on a river. Look up and see the blue sky and feel the water below you. Picture your ideal fantasy and try to play it out in your head. Also, try imagine that you are in a perfect room. What would it look like? What color is it? What's in it? Imagine yourself lying in it. Why is it so relaxing to you? Imagining yourself in this perfect room focuses your mind on relaxation.     Get into a comfortable position, relax your eyes, and breathe. Then begin exploring and walking in a familiar and calming place in your mind and pay attention to every small detail. Be sure to block out any other thoughts. Focus only on walking. If something pops up in your head, ignore it. Eventually you will drift off into sleep.    Tell yourself you're tired this may not work for some people but for others it is very effective. Convince yourself that you are really tired and your brain will follow these signals and actually make you tired.          I personally meditate a lot!   Ive done this to- If you want to remember your dreams, say out loud "I will remember my dreams tonight"  about 5 times focusing on the words and imagening yourself sleeping peacefully in your bed. Then say it 10 times in your head.  Same with a mental alarm clock. Repeat over and over out loud and in your head that you will wake up at a specific time. It really works for me.  But I've been meditating for about a year... so I've gotton a little better at it. You'll probably need to practice every night.    Try googling meditations and visualigations. :)      Kendra |`|5L3KPgo8aa	Lots of good answers given already. I can add: stay away from caffeine and chocolate late at night.

prqrQcd1aa	I do believe that yes he could. Here is why.  He will still "get" the measles, but his body will already be immune to it, so the white blood cells will attack and destroy the virus, he will still carry the virus though for the time that it is contagious for.   So yes, it is possible to spread it to those who have not been vaccinated.|`|hsEo77F9aa	I agree with Amber's conclusion, but not with her reasoning.    A vaccine does not usually provide 100% protection from measles. If the measles vaccine is given to early (    Even then, a vaccine works in tandem with "group immunity". If there are enough people vaccinated in a community (ideally >95%) then even though they may only be 80% effective in some people, the likelihood of them coming into contact with someone with measles is reduced. Which is why it is important to everyone (public health) that everyone be vaccinated.    So, it is possible for someone who has received a measles vaccine to end up later (usually years later, if it occurs at all) infected with measles and able to transmit.    To essentially spread measles a person would have to have an active infection, so someone that is immunized and protected would not be able to acquire measles or transmit it. If a person was vaccinated but not fully protected, they can acquire measles and spread it.    If you are worried, check with your doctor about what vaccines you may require (or booster shots) at your age.

But i digress... get a checkup|`|2F9EcT7Haa	hmmm no .|`|fngngRV3aa	Yeah I get that sometimes too, or a quick headrush|`|u5ZjG99Kaa	im 16 too idk thats happened to me before idk what it is though dont worry about it|`|TxSgCzcUaa	yeah. it means theres way to  much stress on your mind  seriously  you should go to a spa or something|`|OaxhMKr5aa	Oh yea :(|`|I1RxOVrxaa	You should go to your doctor and ask him. he might give you some pills or some ways to stop them from happening|`|Gqr63jT5aa	your going to die...|`|f7PlvV4Baa	sounds like youre going to die any day|`|yD0lxr1Caa	i've had it happen to me it was just neck pain.

Also just wear under armor shorts under your tennis shorts.       -Connor|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Just get underarmor underwear.

They'd prefer if you looked away, at the posters on the ceiling or at the walls or something.  Don't worry, who cares, you're only in the chair for a few minutes and when you get them off you'll never see them again|`|FDQFrP5haa	Yes, I look into the glasses too, so I can see my mouth...then I stop and wonder if he notices me staring at him lol! But I'm pretty sure he's focused on my teeth, not my eyes.
zddIYf9vaa	it happens to everyone when they workout a group of muscles that they never worked out    your muscles have repaired thats why you cant feel no pain anymore|`|31Y5vbnIaa	yes this happens to me all the time it is just happens when you work out    Muscle soreness after working out is caused by micro-trauma to the muscle fibers.  This micro trauma (caused by working hard) causes calcium molecule leakage from these muscle fibers as well as an accumulation of histamines, potassium, prostaglandins, and local edema.  The painful sensation come from pressure placed on the muscles due to fluid retention in the muscle area.  The localized edema (fluid retention) puts pressure on the muscles nerve endings, causing a sore sensation.  The soreness is not caused by damage to the muscle itself (except, perhaps, if your muscles are not sore, but in extreme pain).|`|exf4OhPkaa	yea this happens to me alot cuz i'm a dancer and so almost everytime i dance i'm working a new muscle group so the next day i feel like i need crutches but then the next day i'm fine. My dance teachers say that after a day usually your muscles become less painful or you stretch out the sore muscles without even knowing it!!  Its a good thing that you were sore because that ment you built muscle so keep it up!!!
uqmkFPcDaa	maybe try looking in blue cross website or call them.
AA12400635	Oh I so sympathize as I have had FP before and it is awful!    Drink lots of fluids so you don't get dehydrated and I would stay away from anything sour or acidic (like citrus fruit or coffee, or milk) and try to stay on the more bland foods that have a baser PH which shouldn't be as upsetting to your stomach. I would try a few crackers or maybe some toast or oatmeal. Avoid anything that will give you gas or make you burp (like green peppers or cucumbers). The ginger ale is helpful too if you make sure to stir out the bubbles as ginger has a calming effect on the stomach.    Take it easy and get plenty of rest and if you continue to throw up or have diarrhea for more than just today or if you notice anything even more unpleasant (like blood in stool or vomit) go see a doctor. FP usually passes fairly quickly but can be more serious depending on what virus/bacteria has caused it so just keep an eye on yourself and go see a doctor if you start feeling worse or notice anything unusual.    I sure hope you feel better soon.|`|elUCyhzFaa	just dont eat raw mean..make sure everythings cooked..what made u get food poisnoning?..dont eat that certain food. then u shud b fine.

TL1Jkqunaa	You may need something but certainly not psychoanalysis.  The whole idea of psychoanalysis was discredited even before it become popular, especially in the USA.    THe tendency to like or dislike people as groups tends to disappear when you get to know individuals of the group.  You learn to hate or like them one by one.  You grew up a bit.  No reason to look for something more dramatic or profound.|`|1JSblCBsaa	maybe since Obama became president you are starting to notice how wrong and stupid racism is.    You don't need psychoanalysed. This question is a waste of my time, you are racist and it is probably because your parents were too, and now you're either rebelling, which you would know, and thats what I think it is. Or you saw a cute boy and need to get over your disgusting racism.|`|qm6jJjoOaa	Maybe you are attracted to the person he is?     You shouldn't let his race, or color judge weather or not you should like him. If you like him you like him.    Maybe give him a chance.. see how it goes.

We would all like to think that we have a certain taste or preference but this changes throughout time just like our taste for food changes . Attraction is a feeling that over rides logic, therefore the belief you once held has been took over by the feeling of attraction ! there is no harm in two people getting together who are attracted where is the harm in that ?  good luck and try not to worry so much race doesnt really matter hun x x xx x x|`|39x9tNJzaa	Part of it is that you're lonely and seeking a relationship.  Part of it is that you're young and still able to easily change your habits and whatnot.  It's not a really dramatic change, just a change in personal preference.  It sounds to me like it's just something you've never actually sat down and analyzed before.  You had your opinion and thoughts on the matter, but now that you're experiencing it you're changing your mind, at least for this one person.  If he's so interesting to you then there's no problem.    A big change of habits and preferences would be binge drinking, or getting heavily into drugs, or smoking when you've never done these things regularly before.  Or making a big 180 in your political preferences.  A big change of habits includes changes in interests, core fundamentals, morals and ethics.  If you're still worried, though, it can't hurt to talk to your doctor about it.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Things can happen as we grow and change. But you need to know that the 18 year old is legally and adult and you are legally a child. This is against the law and he could end up in a lot of trouble like jail or prison. An 18 year old has no business or healthy interest in a 16 year old child. The best thing you can do for him and yourself is to stay away.

oE77lovwaa	Same thing happened to me years ago. I never really asked because it never bothered me. However, if you'd like to know I'm sure he/she would be willing to tell you.    I actually had braces put on twice. Once with both the bottom and top put on simultaneously, and the second the top went on first. All I know is that the pain of having only the top put on alone was a HUGE benefit and a lot less painful than that of both of them on together the same day.|`|4ZJBzrK3aa	I have to get braces. They are going to just put the top ones on first. They said something about when the top teeth fix, the bottom might fix along with the top, with no braces on them. So, you might go a few months with just the top braces!|`|JOqcCkrKaa	maybe all your bottom teeth aren't done falling out or sometimes you just need to fix the top a little before you do both i had braces on my two front teeth only for a month or so
plxV97hxaa	The eye colour doesn't change, but the amount of light hitting the eye and the moisture on the eyeball makes the colour look different.

346683d356126a2c7bdb62721d918419aa	I get cold sores occasionally, and for years have taken L-lysine tablets as soon as I feel one coming on. I continue to take several tablets a day for a few days until all signs of a cold sore are gone. It works like a charm! Lysine is a body's tissue and cell supporter and it attacks where ever the infection [cold sore] is.    Tried and true home remedies for chapped lips:    Put some honey on your lips let it dry for a few seconds.     Without moving your lips, apply some Vaseline on top of the lips.     Leave the honey and Vaseline on your lips for 10-15 minutes.     Finally, dip a Q-tip dip in hot water and use it to remove the honey and Vaseline in two strokes.     Do this once a day for about 2-5 days to get rid of chapped lips.       Hope I helped you.

Big tip:  if you use the ointment in a pot, wash your hands before and after applying, and don't put a finger back in the pot after touching your lips.  If you use the liquid in a squeeze tube, use your finger to apply instead of running the applicator on your lips.  Again, wash your  hands and don't use the same finger.  If you still are getting cold sores, talk to your doctor about other treatment options.

qm6jJjoOaa	It sounds as though you have grown a strong bond with him.     This isn't a bad thing, you just have put most of your trust in him and seem to focus only on your relationship with him.     He probably knows you more than any other of your friends, and you just feel comfortable with him.      Its only bad if your other friends have  a problem with this. And if you want to expand your circle of close trustworthy friends you need to put trust in others|`|M3pRAe7Vaa	You have centered your entire life around your boyfriend.  This can become very dangerous, as you need a strong social network of multiple people.  It is wonderful that you and your man are so close, but all strong relationships need time away as well; that is why you need other relationships with your girlfriends, and he with his guy friends.    If your relationship were to not work out, your lack of communication with others puts you in a bad position.  You have no support network of friends to lean on or hang out with, which is SO important.    Please try to make time for friends as well as your boyfriend.  It may not seem important, but experience has shown me this is so important, and I'd like to pass it along to you.|`|pkUGWcevaa	because you have someone and don't need to talk and try and get someone anymore|`|aO5uVFwIaa	When you spend so much time with one person (especially someone you like) you sort of become attached and don't care much about spending time with anyone else!|`|zblFCh7Paa	Is their some of abuse going on?|`|9fmvSG4Jaa	You are use to being & talking with the same person.

That's why there is no " best " toric lenses, a brand that is best for one person could be the worst for the next person.    The only recommendation that can be made is to return and continue the trials until the right one is found.|`|TR2MYeLUaa	I have astigmatism and terrible vision.  I use Softlens one month disposables

Its the little horizontal bar that connects the two lenses together in the middle (in between your eyes).    The measurement they're giving is basically how wide that bar is, or the space from one side of your nose to the other? Like if you got one with too small a measurement the glasses might not fit over your nose, and if the measurement was too big they would slip down your nose all the time or something. I don't know how to measure for that though sorry.|`|cQL31oJaaa	Its the little horizontal bar that connects the two lenses together!

Being sore is going to be perfectly normal as you are exersizing muscles that you dont usually strain. However, weights and exersize is only half of the cycle to becoming fitter and stronger.    The other 50% is about making sure you are eating healthy food with all the vitamins and protein required to repair your muscles properly, and ensuring your muscles have chance to REST.    100 push ups is a considerable amount to start on... if you have to do 8-10 at a time, you may be over doing it a little.    Dont run before you can walk, but do keep pushing yourself.
Q5eUUbB4aa	Push ups will not help that much, in order to maintain your muscle mass, you will have to continue doing the workout you were doing before or a better one, you need to get a membership to ur local gym and keep up the lifting or you will lose some muscle, sry bud.

QJqBGT0uaa	I also believe Salvia is completly harmless,and should remain legal.     I would not frown upon a friend for smoking Salvia. I don't even care when my friends smoke pot.     But if they did other, serious, dangerous, and addictive drugs like coke, meth, heroin,ect. I would care.     Maybe, have her try it once. Don't force it on her, just tell her that it's harmless, and legal. It's even a natural anti-depressant. Other than the one time I threw up because my throat was irritated by the smoke after eating a bunch of nachos with my cousin, all of my Salvia experiences have been nice.    I've never really tripped out, but I felt so good, light, almost as if somebody took all the bad out of my body.

ziVtTtObaa	Unfortunatly you can't make your parents get help. All you can do is encourage them to get help. Where are they getting pills, If it is from a MD give that MD a call. Explain your concerns to them. They only see the side you parents show them in the office. The MD may not be aware. Do you have other adult support. Can you turn to them for help. How about a pastor or priest. Even a school counsuler may be able to guide. Good luck. Drug addiction does effect every on in the home.

That's the simple truth. Help that you, and your father, can't provide. This is something that's only going to get worse in time, and it's your duty to help her. It's making her, yours, and your fathers life bad. Take control. If your mother won't get help, you need to get help for her. I know it's awkward, but you should try calling a drug hotline or just her doctor. Good luck, stay strong |`|AA10744471	Since your Mom is addicted to pain pills, the only way to help her is for your family to urge her to join a Healing Group on that particular addiction so that she could get cured. Since this is a chemical addiction, it is necessary for her to enter into this facility and be helped by other similarly addicted peer group with the help of doctors. Act on it. Good luck to you.|`|AeeX1Wnkaa	There are support groups out there for family member affected by drug abuse. I would suggest you join one and maybe they can provide some guidance.  Secondly, you may consider speaking with the doctor that keeps prescribing these pills for your mom. He can't share any of her medical info with you because of legal issues, but he may be completely unaware of her problem and you mentioning it will bring it to his attention. Then he can speak with your mom about it and possibly help her recover.

unpMO1bVaa	Sure, it could possibly be a UTI, but that would be very unlikely if you have a discharge of some sort. Pain with urination also can be confused from a UTI and a STD. If you have had unprotected sex, and your sketchy about the whole thing, tell someone close to you and just go get checked at the doctors of Family Planning. Its not worth the time if you do have something. Good luck.

DSSZZBTXaa	your doctor shouldn't be sending a letter out like that. It is against HIPAA regulations and they can get in big trouble for it you can legally take them to court. Like what if that letter got into the wrong persons hands? But back to your question you have to schedule an appointment with your doctor and he or she will explain what they are going to do. I found out last Wednesday that I had gotten HPV from my boyfriend. The gardasil doesn't always work I had gotten that shot and I still got HPV. There are about 30 different strains of the HPV and they can't test you to find out which one that there is. But they can determine if it's cancerous precancerous or if you just have regular HPV. There  is no cure for it either. Your doctor may do a colposcopy to take a closer look and get a biopsy of your cervic.

And yes your boyfriend could of gotten it from you...my boyfriends HPV stayed dormat our whole relationship up until maybe 5 months ago.

HPV does cause genital warts, but the strains that cause abnormal cells on the cervix do not generally cause visible warts.  Your doctor wants to do a procedure to examine your cervix and see where the lesion is and how large it is.  After this is done your doctor may want to do another procedure to remove the lesion.  This should solve the problem, although you should continue to have yearly Pap smears because you could catch a different strain of HPV, and some studies suggest HPV lesions can reoccur after removal.      HPV is an extremely common sexually transmitted virus.  Odds are your boyfriend has had the virus already, and possibly was the one to transmit it to you.  Fortunately HPV is not as likely to cause problems in men, and only rarely can be a cause of penile cancer (this is most common in promiscuous men with repeated exposure to multiple strains of HPV).  HPV infections are typically transient, so if you boyfriend had this strain of HPV his body may have already fought it off.      There is a new vaccine, Gardasil, that protects against several cancer-causing strains of HPV.  However, this vaccine is most effective when used before becoming sexually active.  It may not be appropriate for you, but you can ask your doctor about it when you go in for your visit.|`|K8qMighsaa	hpv is a virus that can cause cancer (cervical) but there are like a hundred different strands of hpv, and not all cause cancer. the doctor has to run a test to determine which strand you have and then shesll be able to tell you whether its cancerous. theres NO cure for HPV or cancer, but dont feel too bad, practically everyone whos ever had sex has some sort of hpv. some are more serious than others. and yes, you should stop having sex w/ your bf, and tell him what the dr has told you so far. he needs to know. then when you get more info, give him the low down and have your bf go see a doctor and get tested for hpv, b/c he might have infected you w/ it. you might have warts, do you see any or feel any on your clit? if theyre on the inside, you wont see them w/ the naked eyes, obviously. but if youre like me *sigh* then youll see small itty bitty clusters on your clitoris. they dont go away, but they could become smaller if you allow enough time to pass. sometimes the virus runs its course and does go away, but mosty, youll experience some burning, itching, discharge, resembles a yeast infection in a way. if the warts are external and your self conscious of them, you can have them surgically removed. theres no cure but there is treatment, if youre good, it wont trouble you too much, but you cant go around having sex (unprotected sex) while youre having an outbreak. in fact you should never have unprotected sex untill youre ready to be a mommy, and if you DO have hpv or DO get cancer, youll have to talk to your obgyn about that, but that wont be for a while. get the colposcopy, determine what kind of hpv you have, and go from there. youll be fine. its not something you should be proud of, but in most cases, its just warts, and just plain embarrassing. but from now on, youll have to tell your partners you have it, especially when you find out more about it. its only fair they know. and if they lose interest in you, then thats the chance you have to take. thats called being responsible. had you been responsible and not had sex (or at least had PROTECTED sex) this might not have happened. had your bf been honest w/ you and responsible, he might not have given it to you (provided you contracted it from him). whatever it is, thats what it is, and worrying wont solve anything. stress less, its better for your overall health, and from now on, do the right thing. take care girly :-)

Nobody has a crystal ball to know your mother's specific future, but the cause of death in most people is still heart disease, even in those people who have other diseases.|`|TqBpKMbcaa	I am so happy that they have found it in an early stage. That is so important! Your mom will probably live a long life once they remove the growth. Check out www.knowthecause.com for a lot of really good information regarding cancer. Help your mom to change her diet to help make a bad environment for cancer to grow. I will say a prayer for her.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	Sorry about your mom.  Depending on what treatments she opts for, yes, it can shorten her life.  The good news is that they caught it early.|`|EoawVhBTaa	Yes, it can. I hope all goes well for her.

When muscles grow, they get bigger. Why would anyone think that would make their stomach go back in?     But if you really do just have health in mind, just remember to keep it regimented and consistent, but also remember to mix it up. Muscle confusion is the best way to really increase muscular capability. Don't just crank out monotonous sets every night like it's a chore.|`|8YGjd0icaa	this erin guy above me is a bullshitter. don't listen to him. hit the gym, you're already pretty skinny though. actually quite skinny.|`|UZKg2odzaa	working out your ab muscles won't get rid of the fat thats covering them. if you want to slim down then try just cutting the fat out of your diet. fatty foots, sugar, sweets, stuff like that.. if you do that and start to work out your whole body, then you will notice a difference :)|`|d1DlU0ydaa	You need to do more than just sit ups, search ab exercises and do three sets of each exercise with 25 reps. (I do curl ups, crunches, oblique twists and the bicycle) Have a day off then if you aren't sore the following day do it again. never work sore muscles it won't make a difference. Good Luck you can do it... even though it may take a little longer than 2 weeks =]|`|ROAS5EGLaa	stiups alone wont give you a flat tummy. You must diet as well. There is no number, just do as many as you can. Abs heal very quicy kly so you can work them everyday as long as your not using any weights.

eIVy7xkXaa	HPV has no therapeutic effects.  HPV infects the basal cells at the border between the squamous and epithelial tissues at the border of the cervix and vagina.  The result is an increased risk of cervical cancer.|`|5I7Ifrmraa	Therapeutic effects of a virus? There are not any at all.  Side effects, increased cancer risk.
2mKwr0xAaa	Same thing for me.   I'm 15, I'm 5'4, I weigh about 140 lbs and my cup size is about 36c.  I think its normal because some of my friends are the same way.  And everyone tells me that I'm not too big for my age.  Although they DO say that my breasts are too big for my age.  My sisters 19 and mines are bigger than hers.  I know thats off topic but I thought I'd share that with you.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	You are overweight and breast tissue is mostly fat.    Ask mom to not buy pizza nor McDonalds .    Join a local gym before your weight starts to really get out of control.

Cut out most carbs, all sugar, eat a minimal amount of calories but enough so you are not starving and start doing some cardio.    Also, keep a food journal and set goals.    Good luck!! :)|`|QCTy1iaEaa	Most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles. Also, you can have the strongest gluts in the world, but if they're hidden under a layer of fat (and cellulite), nobody will see them. So you need to get rid of fat too (which takes care of cellulite as well).    Cellulite is fat. Women typically have cellulite because as they gain weight, their fat cells swell but their connective tissue stays the same, causing a dimpling or cottage cheese look that we all hate!    Since cellulite is fat, the key to ridding yourself of it lies in reducing the size of your fat cells. This is best accomplished with a combination - a specific diet and effective exercise program. And, in case you didnt already know, body wraps, toning lotions, electrical muscle stimulation, herbal remedies and other quick fix solutions you see on TV and in magazines DO NOT WORK! Any effects are temporary, so save your money. Look for specific butt workout programs such as http://www.firmbuttexercises.com/workout... and others.
FU3n5CSBaa	Unless you are unlucky and have a genetic problem then the solution is easy:-    1) The first, and BIGGEST, is exercise. Not many people like this but running (slowly to start with) is really good. Start with, say, 1/4 mile and work up, at your own speed, to 3 or 4 miles. Once you can do this easlily increase the speed at which you run.    2) EAT SMALL and EAT HEALTHY. Cut right down on fatty food and refuse ALL carbonated drinks.    If you use 5000 calories a day and eat 2000 you WILL lose weight.    Good luck............keep running.|`|tFW5nLdpaa	get a seventeen magazine and use there work outs and dieting tips cuz it doesn't require much Equipment|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	There are tons of diets and exercise regimens that promise that perfect body, but in reality what I keep reading is that the way to get toned is simply by strength training.  Squats, lunges, push ups, crunches, pull ups are all examples of strength training exercises that will build muscle w/out weights.      Also, you also need cardio too.  As far as food is concerned you have to watch your portions.  I eat 4-5 meal everyday and each meal is around 400 calories.      Eat lean meats such as turkey and chicken and limit your red meat.  Eat foods with fiber which generally havw fewer calories, but leave you feeling full for longer.  Drink water at every meal it has no calories.      Also, never never never skip breakfast.|`|mKIfUL8naa	its gonna be tuff but all u have to do is eat healthy, meaning no chips or fast food, and even pasta! and just start light exercising every day, or more if u want faster/better results|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Well, losing weight is not that easy, however is not that hard too, if you guys are really serious do hard work. Some people have expressed reluctance to engage in sports, precisely because there is a requirement to run a number of miles for a while, but otherwise will not be any good. It is not true. You just need to become much more active in your daily life. It is much more realistic, more feasible and therefore more effective. But is it? To begin with - yes. Further increases in physical activity will depend on the speed of metabolic processes in your body and how much fat you need to lose. The gradual increase in workload is quite available, so let's stop for some councils, which should begin.|`|TpJbtJCfaa	You want a body like those girls?    Keep dreaming... it's their jobs to look good, you can't compare yourself to them...    no man expects a woman with a body like that, of course it would be very nice; but it's like winning the lottery.     Just keep dieting and carry a picture of your fat around, every time u want to eat something unhealthy just show yourself the picture.     There is no "magical" cure and there never will be. It's going to take focus and hard work.    Good luck.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	You have to work with your genetics, but it's doable. The first thing to do is get up off your butt from the Y!A  and find a personal trainer to help you set up a fitness to pursue and motivate you as needed. Also, make a 45 minute hour appointment with a nutritionist to set you up with a diet plan. Pursue your plans regularly. You'll be on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens in no time!|`|siTibEIGaa	I didn't look at the pics you posted, but if you want to help tone your body, try bodyweight exercises, pilates, or even yoga if you can find an instructor or check out youtube. Also, read up on pranayama, it helps tone the midsection. It is a yogic breathing technique. Tried and true, just take it easy if you are prone to hyperventilation or are asthmatic. Also, try to make a change in your diet, eat smaller meals, more snacks and try to eat whole grains and fresh fruit and veggies. Stay away from anything frozen or in a can or in a box. Hope I this helps.|`|e1GCbGrXaa	Start by making life changes. Change the way you work around things.   Step one develop a taste for nice food. Eat fruit ontop of what you eat. Drink more water and go out and have fun outside.   After you get into the mood find something to motivate you that isn't impending doom or a hate of your body. I find the carrot works better then the stick. If you put your mind to it you can enjoy the task you do.   Ask around the house to get your family to help out.  Go to the gym after that. plug into your ipod and keep occupied. Try get into a sport that will get you out and keep up consistancy. if you feel motivation then GO for it if not start SMALL and i mean small even if its too easy and keep a chart.  Make sure you build your confidence while you're fat or you'll have a lack of self esteem for your life if you start gaining again.|`|rxx9ub7haa	well you could go on a juice fast that's what i heard celebrity's do or you could listen to my three tips:  1 Whenever you feel hungry have a glass of water first because some people find it hard to define hunger from thirst- if u still feel hungry than eat.  2 Stop looking at your scale because believe me it will get you too stressed about how much you're losing or gaining.  3 Try replace tasty snakc such as, crisps, chocolates etc with healthy alternatives|`|51DrQZyeaa	okay listen here,   there is no such thing as fat people its just people like those people in the pictures make us feel so bad about our selfs.  okay,  i honestly talk to kids about how everybody is beautiful, and how you dont have to be skinnny,wear tons of make up, and have to dress a certian way...  i am sorry to say,  but everybody has something about them selves that they dont like.....  but maybe if you feel this way,  maybe you should try eattin very healthy foods, ans excersing...  i am over weight too,  but i dont let that put me down...  i feel like that my weigh makes me stand out more,  and nobody minds an extra bit of attention...  but if you feel this way,  maybe you should try eattin heathly,   excersing more, and stop spending lots of time on the computer and get up and do something...  say your watching tv,  then a commercial comes on,  stand up and start doing for jumping jacks...  i know that when i have soe free time, i turn on some good music and dance... not saying my dancing is good,   but its still has an impack on beging healthy1     HOPE THAT YOU TAKE THIS TO YOUR HEART,   dont forget   you dont have to fit these little tiny body images...  your perfect the way you are....      xoxox-   amanda!|`|au9MvNQDaa	join a gym and talk to a personal trainer - no one on here will no anything!|`|c6GZxVepaa	:)|`|0Snb72lvaa	ill but hey if you like that pop a couple pills stick your finger down your throat a couple times and workout everyday for 4 hours I dont like stick girls|`|JHPxHRoFaa	actually weights will build muscle and muscle actually weighs more than fat so i don't recommend using wights unless you wanna be BUFF     but simple exercise such as LIGHT jogging or even going for a walk can help   and i was  really big for a while now im 136 i was 172    all i did was eat healthy  and i started jogging =D|`|UrUpWmA7aa	I do the poor man's workout, which works great.  Run - a lot  pushups, situps, pullups.    Lay flat on your back, keep your legs straight and lift them off the ground    stretch too    Do not eat food that is frozen, from a can, or has a long shelf life.  Real food comes from nature, and has a short shelf life. fruits and veggis mostly.    No fast food|`|Mq2TICVmaa	Your inner thighs will always touch unless you walk like an ostrich lol. Models are posing so it looks like they don't touch, but if they were walking like a normal person then they'd touch.    Whatever you do, don't stop eating. That will make you bloated and it'll take much longer to lose weight, as well as making you sick. Drink lots of water, because that helps a lot. Try drinking low fat milk, eat lots of fruit and veg, and instead of having something sweet for a snack try a bit of fruit, or maybe some dry biscuits with cheese and tomato or something on it.    Don't let anyone tell you that you're fat or ugly, because its not true. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.     Don't try to look like the girls in the pictures because they are fake. They are photoshopped. Trust me, I did a course in photography and made myself look like that for fun. Its not real. You're better than them because you are real. Keep smiling and best of luck.|`|a4jg2r6Daa	Your not fat...people like you make me mad. No offense. I mean if you just stay on the right path and make little changes you will be fine.

gkqmrIAGaa	It sounds as if you have serious anxiety problems and you definitely need professional help. There are numbers that you can call for advise about your anxiety and they may be able to recommend what you can do about the court date. One is 1-800-273-talk and another is 1-800-833-5948.  If I were you I would go to the emergency room they are equipped to help you and possibly an anti anxiety medication. You have to do this. You can then call the court if you are unable to get out of the door to attend your hearing and explain your situation. Whatever you do don't ignore it because if you don't appear and have not called with an explanation there will be a warrant.  This is affecting your whole life not just this court date you have to get help. you don't deserve and don't have to live with this anxiety.  There are plenty of safe medications that can help you.|`|39x9tNJzaa	Get your tags updated then call local police or sherrif's department, depending on which one it was that pulled you over, and talk to them.  What he gave you, basically, was a fix-it ticket.  Get it fixed within two weeks and you're not in trouble.  Expired tags, no proof of insurance, expired or missing driver's license, and broken tail lights are often dealt with in this manner.    If you aren't seeing one already I suggest finding a therapist to help with your social anxiety.

Once you've stayed in position for a while then that's all you can do, the semen will always come out afterwards.

Often, those policies don't match the CDC's recommendations (which list only a small number of situations where an annual test is necessary), but if that's your school's policy, you have little choice.

go8QFRtXaa	The thyroid is located in your neck just below the "adams apple" (in men).    It is a "gland" which produces thyroid hormones. These hormones control metabolism, among other things, which is how the body burns energy. This is the reason it can affect your weight if it is not working properly.    The thyroid is one of many glands in your body, and just happens to be in your neck. Glands are organs which produce substances like hormones and other things (eg, mammary glands produce breast milk) for release in your body.|`|mSHxDFcJaa	Because it's evil! :P|`|bjqjkDMHaa	It's because the thyroid controls levels of hormones, and too much of one hormone or not enough could trigger weight gain.

When a tower breaks, things start to get hectic and the body is trying to do cleanup crew work in additon to maintaining homeoastasis withiout the aid of the hormone's produced.|`|OeEaooidaa	I have a thyroid problem too  I don't think where it it matters  If you have a small thyroid, You have less metabolism, which makes you less active. You have less energy to do sports ETC. Which causes weight gain. But I am just the kind of person who is very active, so i don't let it bother me.

50cc0cc3ef2f94280ceddd99f3cbd1e9aa	I'm no expert, but I don't think what you're describing is right.  I have been wearing glasses for years, and I have never had any blurring that was not corrected.  There are several reasons why this isn't right.  First, your doc may have misread things when he was testing you or he may have misunderstood you telling him which sample was clearer.  Second, the lab where the lenses were ground may have got it wrong.  I've had both things happen to me, as well as having the lenses reversed in the frames.  You should take them back and have them re-checked.  You should not have to put up with this situation.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Your eyes may not have the amount of defect. Like mine, my right eye need strong lens. Sometime the optician just prescribe you both eye the same lens' power, therefore one eye can see right while the other cannot, together they compromise, you can see. Sometime they give you both lens the same, because they don't have the other lens, hoping you don't realise it.

The advisory panel voted 14-12 to recommend withdrawing Darvon, first approved in 1957. Earlier Friday, the agency said it was reviewing the drug after critics charged it provided little relief and posed a risk for overdose and suicide, the Associated Press reported. The full FDA usually follows the recommendations of its expert panels, but isn't bound to do so.    Darvon, which includes a dose of acetaminophen, is among the top prescribed medications. More than 20 million prescriptions were written in 2007, the wire service said. Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals and Qualitest/Vintage Pharmaceuticals, two firms that market Darvocet, called the medication safe and effective when used as directed.    But critics complained that the government review was too long in coming. "[The drug] has unique risks and no unique advantages," Dr. Sidney Wolfe, a drug safety expert with the consumer group Public Citizen, told the AP. "It has been a big drug of abuse for quite a long time." Public Citizen first sought a ban on Darvon in the 1970s, and the United Kingdom banned its version in 2005, the AP said.    Besides an outright ban, the FDA's other options include requiring stiffer warnings, additional studies or education efforts to alert doctors and patients of potential misuses, the AP reported.     Could be why they changed your pills?
1H2GN6aAaa	It sounds like you have a urinary tract infection (UTI).  Make an appointment with a doctor, they'll give you antibiotics to make it go away.  Until you can get to the doctor, go to a drug store and pick up Azo pills in the blue box.  They help take the pain away and the urgency.  Also, drink lots of cranberry juice, cranberries are good for your urinary tract.  Drink plenty of water as well!|`|yq7BwO9qaa	maybe a bladder infection, or a urinary tract infection. see a doc.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	your bladder is probably infected.

9nDhR7xWaa	try and slow down your eating habits... and possibly take a glass of water before you eat your meal.    You have to remember that your body takes a while after the food enters your stomach for it to tell your brain it is full.    Therefore, if you keep eating until your stomach says its full... its already bloated.    Try and stop eating just when you dont feel hungry any more. Theres nothing wrong with leaving a little bit of food on the plate.

OUbNSXjJaa	The doctor who prescribed the medicine will be able  to tell better.|`|8pLZr9mXaa	Hello, I am really glad that you are asking this question because it shows you truly care!    When I was prescribed Concerta (A Ritalin based ADHD medication, very similar to Focalin XR) I lost my appetite, became agitated easily, and had trouble sleeping. I turned the wrong way on a one way street and often caught myself not paying enough attention while I was driving! Since the properties of the medication I took and Focalin XR are nearly the same, from my side effects and as a young adult with ADHD my advice would be to wait two more weeks. Ask her how she is feeling. She may be very anxious. She may be experiencing other problems at school (socially or academically or both) that are not even related to her medication. Two weeks is plenty of time (assuming she has already been on it for at least two already?) to have the drug balanced in her system. If it is not benefiting her, I would try something new.    The best medication my parents gave me was called patience. :)|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Maybe it's not the best thing for her.    If she seems less happy, then that's a problem.

kA0xb0MVaa	1:  Thiazides can't be given to two different groups that I know of, patients with cirrohosis, and patients with certain kinds of vasculitis.  2:  Low serum proteins also relate to liver?    3:  Blood thinners.  Heparin, Cumidin, or Lovenox.    I think we are studying the same thing today.    1.  If you already have low amounts of sodium, potassium and calcium in your blood you should not take thiazide diuretics as they can also cause your body to lose these minerals. People with Addisons disease should also not take thiazide diuretics.    If you have kidney or liver problems you will need to be carefully monitored when taking these medications and if you have severe problems you may not be able to take them at all.    If you are pregnant or breastfeeding you may need to take care when taking a thiazide diuretic called indapamide.    If you have gout or lupus you may need to take care with these medicines as they may make your condition worse.    2:  Low serum protein are indicators of several conditions to include:       Malnutrition and malabsorption        Liver disease        Diarrhea        Severe burns        Loss through the urine in severe kidney disease   3:  Coumidin, Heparin, and or Lovenox.
PVe6jK78aa	-Nothing (there is not legal age to smoke only to buy)  -No ( it takes about a pack to become addicted)  -Probably a light or ultra light Marlboro  -No (it han't been shown to reduce weight)  -it will affect it minimally but that depends on how much you smoke  -Yea  -No    Hope that helps|`|8b56nyfkaa	1 its possible.  2. idk i dont smoke  3. no. it is a myth  4.

If you wanna get high, use a hookah.|`|rRFiSOxuaa	In many states you can lose your driver's license, or the chance to get one when you are 16 if you are caught smoking.  As far as I know, (and I live in Texas), the laws aren't quite as strict here, but that's no excuse to start.  No, you won't get addicted on the first one, but it's amazing how fast it will become a part of your life and how you will wind up planning your day around smoking.  It's not just a physical, but an emotional addiction.    Smoking one cigarette a week probably wouldn't cause harm, but you'll smoke more than that.  Most people who started smoking in the first place thought they could limit it, only do it at parties, etc.  All of the ones I know became addicted.  Tobacco is more addictive than heroine.  Don't start.  It's really hard to quit and even if you've heard it a thousand times, it's still a nasty habit.|`|VRQxlJ9Vaa	Look I can give you some horror stories that you would not believe, I started smoking at aged 13, I thought it was cool and all my friends did it. At such a young age no one ever looks at the long term effects of smoking. I didn't either. I smoked for 35 years, I enjoyed smoking. I looked forward to my morning cigarette, Then as time went on I was getting sick I was getting bronchitis 2 or 3 times a year. Very severe sometimes having to be hospitalized for days and pumped with antibiotics, Still i wouldn't quit, I lost my parets at a young age my mother was 58 ny dada was 60 when they died, My mom smoked for 340 years she was a big woman at one time weighing over 250 lbs,   She got lung cancer and died 6 months later she weight only 68 pounds and was on qxygen 24 hours a day she had one lung removed and had only half of the other. Dad had many heart attacks due to heart disease, He died on Christams day. I now have severe COPD, I need oxygen daily. I used tio be a Boy Scout leader and go camping and hiking all of the time. Now i cannot even walk to the bathroom with getting short of breath I have to use oxygen to sleep at night,   PLEASE,PLEASE, PLEASE QUIT NOW!!!!!!! I know right now of an 18 year old boy who is going to the same doctor i am. He smoked for only two years He has throat cancer and they cannot operate, HE WILL DIE BEFORE HE IS 19!!!. Sure there are some who are real old and smoke. But why tempt fate. I wish i had never started... thank god i quit.|`|yqDUI9RNaa	Smoke weed please and thank you. It does something other than kill your lungs, looking at the written portion of this question I am not worried about you getting any dumber. There is no healthy ciggarrette there pointless and unhealthy. It's a nasty habit that makes me wanna hurl my lunch when I do it. If your little 13 year old mind tells you to smoke go grab a cigar. You don't inhale it and you are much more less likely to get cancer. Also cigars taste good. As for the smoking at 13 in texas I think nothing happens. It's illegal for you to buy them in MA but legally I can smoke all the tabacco and salvia I want. So in conclusion, smoke weed ("Herb is the healing of the nation" - Bob Marley) smoke cigars and stay away from cigarettes. BTDubs your a tool.

You let her drink in the house and treat the substance with the respect it deserves. The only reasons teens abuse alcohol like they do is because its like a forbidden fruit to them. As a reference point I would like to point out Europe has much less alcoholics there and there lifestyle exposes kids to alcohol much earlier than ares. As for smoking, if your talking about weed encourage it. It opened my mind to things in a way like none other. If your talking about cigarettes make her smoke a carton by herself if you catch her. She'll be done after that.|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	You can't, really.  You can tell her all the bad things about them, until you're blue in the face, and some people will still think those things seem glamorous.    Go ahead and tell her the truth about them, and tell your parents why you're worried about her.  However, she will have to decide for herself, and live with the consequences of her decision.

I clicked on your Avatar to see if you had any open ?'s.  So, I'm sorry I don't actually have a "good" answer for this "?" except, the doctor's have all the answers to your concerns with this. MY DAUGHTER had HBP which was quite serious, for both her and my grand daughter, but it was closely monitored and all ended up fine.  You HAVE to put your faith in your Dr.  That's what you pay him for. Make'em EARN IT !    Now I have a suggestion for a baby of mix race name. It only kinda applies to Hispanic tho, so ignore me if it is any thing other then. I also don't know if it's a girl and this only applies for a girl.    You choose a first name that ends w/ an "I" an "EE" or a "Y" then you have her middle name "Anna", When you say the 1st & middle together in flow, it will have a Hispanic tone.   example:(not suggestion or maybe it is?)  Daisy Anna.....Sounds all American, right?  Daisyanna.......Now sounds Hispanic, right?    I hope I was helpful w/ @ least 1 of your Questions.    Good Luck ! Best of Health to you.

If you want to make your zits less noticeable, try this: run hot water on to your towel, or face towel. Take the steaming hot towel and place it your zits. Itll make the zits smaller, but be careful when you are handling the hot towel. You dont want to burn your face!

Look...I am male, and I can tell you that I had a date that was 26 years old and she could not fill her A cup.    This was the best date I have ever had. She even made fun of her mosquito bites as she called them. Guys look at big boobs all the time but we take the little ones home with us.    Small indicates youth. We don't date cows we date girls. This is something many girls do not really get. Mostly because kids in school tease you or the media puts so much importance on them. They do nothing for us.    If you have big utters then they are all FAT, and if you like that then you will get that in other places too. I would date an A cup before I would date a B or C any day. Also I would never date anyone bigger than C.    While in males a bigger penis might be desired and beneficial. the opposite is true in breast size. Right now you just don't understand this... You are young, and yes you will be flat when you are young.  Do not worry about it at all.  If you made A cup you are there already, and that is far enough.  Super Models have A cups and some far less. Be a Super Model not a cow.    Guys don't want cows... We want girls... Always remember that. Try not to let the size or shape or color of a tit to make you feel badly about yourself. Learn to laugh about you being flat. Don't worry... While kids will measure you up. No real guy would ever refuse you on this, and the older the male the more important it is to have smaller ones.    As I stated... As soon as the cup goes beyond C, I look elsewhere. If a girl tells me she can't fill an A cup. Then I found the right girl. On the other hand, if she gets fake ones she is done for. Likewise if she smokes. Both of them will end a date in seconds.    But A or less and you are doing fine cause they will be able to see your ribs and you will in most cases not be over 120 pounds. They will be able to lift you over the threshold. 8-)    Do not wish to be a cow... Its not what males want. Kids are different. They tease you cause they can... Don't let it worry you. If you have A's already at your age... You are doing just fine.    Begin by loving the fact that they are small, and by hoping they stay that way. The smaller the better. Really... Later in life you will understand this. I know you can't see it just yet. Imagine loosing a possible date cause you're a cow...    Golf balls are better then basketballs. If a kid tells you you're flat.. Tell him he has a small you know what.    Hope this helps you. Cause its true....  When was the last Super Model you saw wearing a D cup ?|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Maybe you filled out sooner than they did. Why are you trying to get ahead of everyone?

yT3ZNEROaa	If your saying the upper right side of your stomach, just below you right nipple and rib cage that is where your gallbladder is located.  You can develop gallstones which are very painful.  If the pain gets worse and doesn't stop you will need to go to the ER because it could be a blocked duct, or infected gallbladder.  If the pain eases off, you can make an appt. for a dr. and they will do an ultrasound of your abdomen which will show if something is going on with your gallbladder.  Feel free to email me with anymore questions.  Take care-Lisa|`|AA12032374	go to the doctor. Could be gallbladder issues.

or6A1Indaa	Yup, even though i am only 15 and im answering a 23 yr old's question, I can say that im on the drug called Roaccutane. And its the best drug for acne. Its a four month course and what it does is sheds the skin and stops the oils in your body from producing. Ask your dermatologist and i will promise you now.

SuGFYsnBaa	we talked about this in health,    intitatlly most diets work out but   soon after sometimes you dont supply your body with what it needs(nutrients) and it can produce a negative affect as it refuses to let go of the fat.    veggie diets are good, but they leave out other essential nutrients      im not sure if ur including these things but undereating or veggie diets are abit cliche for losing weight    u also might be exercising abit too much|`|rxx9ub7haa	If u obsess about your scale you'll be too stressed about your weight and you'll end up gaining it. It psychology.|`|IeOeYOJ3aa	Well the weight you gained could be muscle? If it was then it wouldn't make a difference in body fat.  To lose weight first you have to find out how many calories you need to intake a day, that's your BMR. Once you know that subtract 500 calories from that and you'll lose a pound a week (3500 calories in a pound = 500 calories reduced * 7 days a week).|`|eBUYwjXCaa	you gained muscle, probably.|`|fmeuE91Paa	You probably gained muscle weight, not fat. Muscle weighs a lot more than fat, so when you gain more muscle from exercising you'll end up gaining weight. The more excercising you do the more fat you'll burn and eventually loose inches around your gut. So just keep doing what your doing and you'll get the results you want eventually.|`|DD8tez5Xaa	you gained muscle weight probably|`|4CsGde1qaa	Okay, just so you know, diet will get you slow, slow results. If you need to lose weight, lower your caloric maintenance intake by no more than 300 calories. Any lower than that and you will crash, gain weight in the form of fat development(the body tends to create it's own unique form of fat to replace the ones you refused to consume in the first place), and lose water weight at times. It is best to create a 300 calorie deficit, eat what you normally eat for breakfast and throughout the day, and RESTRICT all kinds of sweets in the form of bakery, ice cream, etc. Only consume sweets like cereal, beverages or fruits, but no candy sweets, you know what I mean. You will DEFINITELY see results then, if not then something is wrong with your body and you need to go to the doctor to discuss this issue, but then again I am a doctor myself. If you need any more information, please feel free to contact me. I hope this helped you.|`|hpadhXUiaa	First check out what is your blood group and what diet is good for your health .

rDly6CVOaa	woman! you eat super healthy... I am no health expert, but i'd suggest eating lighter, less popcorn, but keep eating little bits all day.  If youre not hungry by supper time, maybe for for a jog before dinner... or eat very low calorie meals all day, then your body will be looking for calories later... either way, i'd say you're doing just fine dear.
1nIeHzofaa	It's simple..do push ups, chin ups, pull ups, and sit ups to tone up.  However, losing weight and toning involve something much more difficult..healthy eating habits.  Not dieting!  That's short term.  Stick to low fat foods with almost no saturated fat, whole grains, a lot of fruits and vegetables, low fat protein (fish, beans, soy).  This is why most people may go to the gym everyday but can't tone up.  Your BMI must be within the range for your height and weight.|`|23FAzDnHaa	find something u like to do n turn it into an exercise like if u like singing pretend ur preforming, if u like dancing make ur own dance routines, or even if u like writing  u can write a story n see how fast u can write it n remember, 2 lose weight u also hav  2 eat healthy good luck n if u need any more suggestions e-mail me at: doggycutie91@yahoo.com    =)|`|AA10648678	Squats, sit-ups, push-ups, jumping jacks, running in place, dancing|`|52bgCRpjaa	You can do abb workouts, crunches, sit-ups, etc. That is about all i can think of with out running, or working out with weights.|`|zxFaqnQ4aa	Eating healthy is the first step. If you need exercise (everyone does!) then a good way to do it is push ups, jumping jacks, squats, running in place, sit ups, 6 inches, and chin ups.   P.S.         Meditating can definitely help to train your body!

AeeX1Wnkaa	From what I've seen, melanomas usually are very dark colored, almost black, like burned skin. Looking at your mole, it does appear slightly asymmetrical and does seem to have a different color in the center than around the border. It doesn't look like melanoma, but it does look "suspicious" to me, meaning, it should be removed just to be sure it doesn't cause problems later. However, a dermatologist may decide differently. Make sure you have it examined.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Crappy photo....send me a clearer picture.    I would say no.....but it could be in precancerous.     Have them do a punch biopsy just to get rid of it and a little of the tissue underneath it.      Don't bother self diagnosing yourself....nobody will know even the doctor until he/she gets the results.
OUbNSXjJaa	Trace the reasons for unhappiness. Darkness will vanish if you put the light  on. Similarly, unhappiness will vanish if you allow happiness to occupy your ins and outs.    Be self confident. Be bold. If you are morally disciplined, no force on earth can interfere in your affairs. Nourish good habits. Keep your things well organized. Be systematic. Be punctual to your commitments. Be regular in your right pursuits.  Have challenging assignments. Have positive outlook. Have good company. Associate with likeminded or well meaning people. Compare yourself with highest achievers in life. Identify yourself with some  great and noble people you respect a lot. Emulate their example. Try to add  more and more values to your life day by day. Give a meaning to your life.  Have proper direction. Let your vision be bright and right. Channelize all  your time, energy, moral, intellectual and spiritual resources for achieving your noble ideals. Mold your personality by giving a proper shape to your character. Character can be obtained by nurturing good habits and  building strong moral behavior. Develop strong will power to resist any temptations. Increase your good-will and decrease your ill-will.    See how fast you are able to change your life, once you adopt the above qualities. This is not at all sufficient. You may be able to locate more and more such useful things once you enter this Royal Court.    Happiness is our natural state when we are in the absence of unhappiness. After our most basic needs are met, (food, water, shelter and companionship) unhappiness is caused by unwillingness to accept things as they are.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

Some people make themselves think happy thoughts, go outside and do things they enjoy doing, things like that.  Maintaining a healthy diet goes a long way toward treating and preventing depression.  Regular exercise is also a very, very good mood lifter.    If you want to talk to somebody, your doctor is a good place to start.  He can refer you to a counselor, or you can look one up yourself.  If you're depressed, talking can really help a lot.  Talking to a professional can help more, as they can help you figure out WHY you're depressed and what works for you to help treat your depression.    Everybody gets depressed.  Everybody feels blue at times.  When it's a constant thing, though, and you feel like you can't escape it, that's when it's gone beyond something normal and healthy.  That's when you need to talk to a doctor about it.  You don't have to continue to live this way.  You can, and deserve to, feel better and be happy.|`|fQX3MURpaa	First of all, you should never compare yourself to anyone else.  All that will ever do is make you feel terrible, and I'm speaking from experience.      I'm sorry you feel sad all the time, and I hope I can help you just a little at least.      I'm not sure what your religious beliefs are, but I've been through a lot in my life, and my relationship with God has been what has saved me.  If you don't have one, just try praying....even if it's just in your head.     Try reading from psalms in the Bible.  Or reach out to a church in your community.  If you don't have any clue where to start, try the website moreaboutjesus.com      maybe it will help.  i hope so.  good luck.
qm6jJjoOaa	It sounds as though you have some insecurities with the new guy you are with.      Maybe you feel you shouldn't fall too bad in case its not real love, which explains the constant thoughts of your ex boyfriends and the "what if" question.     Its a common occurrence in people to behave like this, as its often form of self defense, because you don't want to get hurt when people seem to think and worry about things being "too good to be true"     So you try hard to think of reasons why it shouldn't work out rather than why it should, bringing up ex crushes, and remembering them, usually because you think you are more comfortable with them (or at least was once upon a time)     You need to learn to trust again with your new partner, and good things sometimes will happen to you :)|`|5lH1ZPPdaa	Your probably fine, but I think it's because it seems like from what you say, for the first time you know that you have found your match.

If you never had thoughts of not wanting to listen to someone else, to not dream of how it will be when you live on your own, its ok to dream those dreams. They are almost necessary to get your brain to start seeing the realities in life. Theres not a job for you at this age out there, theres not an apt house that can rent to you. Anyone hiding you out will be arrested when its discovered. Get busy with something. Get something that is totally yours that noone can take away. Start painting, or writting a journal, not one of eveil and hatred, one of dreams and ambitions. If you like to draw clothing design wardrobes. If you love poetry write.

D0JsiC0Paa	It's not stupid, its called nerves.    Generally, at first - the idea is to look confident even when you're not - the confidence comes later by pretending to be confident, its like the saying goes - being 'brave' - is being the only one who knows your scared.      Second, these things such as presentation skills, talking to and infront of people are called skills because they need to be developed and we all know developing skills requires practice, so you do a few - and as many as you can at every given opportunity, so what if you screw up a few times, write down what you did wrong that time and don't do it the next time and you will have less and less things wrong with future presentations - you can't expect to be born a perfect presenter and it will come with practice, you have a presentation and so does everyone after you - they're not going to make fun of you, because their turn is just around the corner, its all in good fun at this stage.     Also, while thinking on the spot is very important for a good presenter, this comes with practice, and for now and always it pays to be extremely prepared so stand infront of the mirror, and do your presentation - give it to yourself, to your family, to a sibling, to a friend you trust or even your pet - and do it over and over again until you feel you've got it right - that's practice.     When you get there and its the real deal, do it like you rehersed, just forget everyone's there.     Things you can do to calm yourself down are breathing exercises, deep breathing, make sure you don't have an empty stomach so you can concentrate but not too full so you don't become sluggish, get a good night's sleep the night before so you look and feel sharp and don't forget things or stumble.     If you're in school, take this as the opportunity now - to develop these skills because when things get serious in the future, that's when you need to worry about screwing up.    Make sure you're hydrated before the presentation and keep a glass of water with you to sip occassionally - that is acceptable.
kp0QYdb9aa	it depends on your body, but yes you can, it would not be as affective as smoking yourself though|`|WxbPOmrFaa	It could because it is second hand smoke and you are breathing it in, almost same as actually smoking, but you are not enhaling in as much.

hNfg7oXeaa	Firstly, i think you're being very smart about this situation. Just make sure you stay with your opinions and don't let him pressure you.  If you don't think it's a good idea, and it's not worth the risks, then just don't do it. Trust me, four month relationships at 13 years old is nothing.  I think you would regret it if you did end up having sex with him.  In my opinion, you should wait untill you're older, and in love.    Good luck with your situation. :]|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	if ur NOT ready leave him  do what u think is right & NOT what will make him happy|`|Tzf6YxOjaa	OK First i do have to say congrats for realizing that you are young.. It is a hard decision to make.. however 1) you are obviously debating how committed to you he really is you stated that in your question so do you want to lose your virginity to someone you have questions on their feeling for you. 2) You have only been together for 4 months and yes you are right it is a long time for a middle school relationship however you are only in middle school and if he is truly committed to you he will wait far in to high school or grad if he has to. 3) None of my friends were thirteen when the lost their virginity they all have ranged between 14-19 and all but one of them regret who their first time was with and when it happened.. im not saying weather or not you should because it is a personal decision but do be safe about it. Use condoms and try to get on the pill i know in Canada you don't need a parent to even know your on it.. and there are lots of reason you can take the pill.. cramps during your cycle, zits... ext... but make sure you tell your dr what you are planning... GOOD LUCK!!|`|7aOzSaAAaa	your a little young and if all he cares about is sex then he is not right for you. just let things play out and if he gets mad at you for it...he isnt the right guy.|`|seJxUXHCaa	I am 13 also and I lost my virginity back in September to my boyfriend; we are still sexually active. We have been on & off since August. Sex definitley made us closer, but now I realize that my virginity is something I cannot take back and I kinda regret it, because obviously your not in love with your soul mate at age 13, no matter how much you think you are (I thought I was, we have still been on & off and are at our ending point right now). Don't you want to save your virginity for someone special who you will meet when your older and will make you feel even more better than you do with this current kid? It's all up to you, but just remember, the decision you make will be with you for the rest of your life & the guilt or whatever will stick by your side and you won't be able to give this virginity to the person you wanna spend your life with when your older. Good luck.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	DO NOT have sex!  You are both much too young.  If he needs to get his jollies, he can masturbate.  And if you get horny, you can, too.    Do not let him pressure you into it.    Not only are you too young, but 4 months isn't a very long relationship and, especially at your age (but for people of all ages, really), is not a very good indicator of commitment.    You should wait until you are AT LEAST 16 or 17, or whatever the age of consent is in your state.  And it is best if you wait until you are an adult.    When you DO choose to have sex, make sure you do it with someone you love and trust, and who respects you.  And USE A CONDOM!  I cannot stress enough how important it is to be responsible when having sex.|`|tMPv4V6Iaa	dump him.  that's all he wants. you wont believe me now, but trust me once you give in that's all he will want.  brake up with him, because he is not going to stop bothering you about having sex.  and in middle school, 4 months is long, but not long enough to start having sex at your age, i think if you have sex you will regret it.|`|iPcO4kmKaa	NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if he keeps asking DUMP HIM hes not good enuf 4 u then|`|CI5qOBcDaa	i would tell him to wait longer. I know that you want to please him, but especially in middle school relationships are generally kept by physical attractions, so make sure that he does truly like you for you, not just what he can get out of you. But there are other steps you can take before actually having sex....|`|dTdLrjFNaa	Girl, don't give away something so precious at thirteen. I mean, what if he just dumps you when it's over?    Do you really think he's interested in you enough to stay with you through high school? If not, why waste it on him?    As soon as you do, he'll tell some friends, and you might get marked as easy. You definitely don't want that. Especially before High School.|`|lZLtEyodaa	If you're not ready, dont do it!  Don't give up your virginity just because you want to please him.  Virginity is something that you can't get back.  And if he says that he's commited to you, then he shouldn't care about having sex with you right now if you don't want to.  Being commited means that you stay with someone no matter what.  But, im really glad that you know that you're too young and not ready.  It's really mature of you :)  Good luck!|`|qbbNtGVcaa	since your not ready...you shouldn't have sex. i think you should stay with your boyfriend just not have sex yet. maybe in high school...with someone else if your not still with him. you can still talk about sex stuff and things like that..what boy wouldn't want to talk about sex haha. thats totally normal. and guys usually say they're ready and stuff but they also don't have to worry about getting pregnant and having it hurt! you will be ready in a few years :)    make the right decision! and good luck|`|CFU77qCbaa	Dude, your 13 don't. All he cares about is that. Anyways, where would you do it?|`|qX0KdYUjaa	go with oral or anal sex,you can't get pregnant that way|`|lYr1zmQeaa	try stuff other than sex but having sex as a teenager is not something to give in on. if you cant support a child or get married then you have no business having sex. and i personally think you should be in a relationship for a few years before you even THINK about having sex, 4 months is no time at all, even if it is middle school. at least wait till one of you can drive or have a car(at least over 16)|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	OF COURSE he's ready, but as a girl your emotions are typically different. If you believe you are too young or are not comfortable with it than you shouldn't be pressured into it. If you do it, make sure you are comfortable with it so that you won't regret it later. Remember to use protection a.k.a condoms :]|`|ru4wtKFsaa	You shouldn't let him do that.   Tell him your no is a serious no, and if he just keeps asking, obviously...he doesn't understand.     Don't lose your virginity, you'll regret it later on on life. And when you get your True Husband, he'll appreciate you even more when you tell him he's going to be the first one in your life.|`|af43e8f6af5feac294cdbceeba67f982aa	Do not do it until you are ready. Having sex can change a relationship.  Plus you are too young to be thinking about sex.  Tell him that you are not ready (neither is your body) to have sex; and if he really wants to be with you then you want to stay together but if he just wants sex tell him no!  Boys think that if they have sex then that means something, but things can go wrong.   And if you do decided to do it, which I tell you please don't, either talk to your parent about birth control or get condoms.  Condoms are like two dollars and you can get them anywhere.  Also, if he wants to have sex and you are comfortable, do some research on sex and how to use the protection right; if he can't do that. Then kick him to the curb.  DON"T SLEEP WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0WOvEw2Daa	you answered your own question in the first sentence of your paragraph. good job. your too young to do this, and its only been 4 months.. wait till your older.|`|ec47492e9a6a75455ec561b4a7a5a751aa	You said so yourself..you're young and not ready. I'd go with NO on this one. 4 months isn't a long time at all.    or you could go for it. and then regret it later on. your choice. just don't let him push you into it. he's a 13 year old guy... of course he wants sex. doesn't mean you have to give in.|`|TryTZykqaa	IF YOU DO IT WITH HIM MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR A LOSER....    IF YOU DON'T - WHICH YOU SHOULD- YOU ARE AME ZEZ ZINGLY SMARTER THAN HIM    THAT'S NOT A PEOPLE PLEASER THAT'S A SLUT    OKAY IF HE ASKS AGAIN SAY : GO STICK UR PENIS IN A WHOLE YOU FREAK AND SLAP HIM UR 13 AN TOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOUNG     IM 13 TOO|`|Zf18VjlCaa	You are just plain stoopid. No 13 year old "commits" them self. You don't even have the capacity to think beyond like a few weeks. You have proved this by saying 4 month which is a pretty long relationship in middle school.  He's not fully committed to you.  Trust me... he only "committed" to you cos he wants sex and you are going along with it. If you decide to have sex with him, that's all you guys will do. He will be using you for sex.     MY GOD.|`|d2WGgGulaa	I'm not going to tell you don't do it.  I will say I don't recommend it.    Having sex is a personal choice, and when you're ready, and in a stable relationship, do it.  But if you're not ready, or just a little bit unsure, don't do it until you are.  You may regret it for the rest of your life, and I promise you, you will think about it if it wasn't the right time.    As for your relationship with your boyfriend, if you're not ready, tell him so.  If he understands and is willing to wait, he really cares, but if he threatens to break up or get it somewhere else, then let him. A Jr. high relationship is not worth regretting for the rest of your life.    So, again, I'm not saying don't do it, just make sure you're ready when you do.  And if he really cares about you, and thinks you're worth it he'll wait.  If not, then wait for someone who will, cause I promise someone will. And also, boys have a lot of pressure from their friends to "do it." A lot of times they will put pressure on their girlfriends.  There may be a good chance that he's not ready either.|`|afsanqjPaa	I wouldn't if I were you. You should wait, guys that young have only sex in their mind, Don't give up, keep yourself strong, you have so many years in front of you to get to know the people better, and you may hv more boyfriends in your life, just play hard, you never know when you will meet the special one, and you wish he was your first.. Believe me, guys find the girls that keep themselves above the ground, more attractive!|`|Q27cXlGbaa	if your 13, your not in a commited relationship. and you guys will break up. and in a couple years you will look back and think that it wasnt that serious and you will be glad you didnt have sex with him. ive been through that. nothing at your age can be taken as a serious relationship. im sorry but its true. your still a kid and kids shouldnt be having sex.|`|brvOa9QYaa	"dunno if he's fully committed, but i know i am"  you shouldnt have sex with a guy until you know he is fully committed. I know u might feel ready and everything, but what if you did it, then he went and told people at school? You would be embarassed and feel crap.   Ive been with my bf 7 months and he is committed, but sex isnt really important.  Im not saying dump him cos u sound happy about ur relartionship, but dont rush into sex.   If he keeps pressuring u, and u make him wait, he'll have more respect for you too .  If you do have sex, just remember u must use a condom!!!  theres no rush though!|`|qesIBFcHaa	No honey! Don't do it.    4 months is NOT a stable relationship.     Let me tell you. You can not know someone in 4 months. You see I thought I did, (mind you I was older than you at the time) and I had sex lost my virginity to him, and I never heard from him again, and he was also sleeping with 2 other girls as well.    You are young, and are you ready to take on the responsibilities for instance, if you become pregnant? At 13, you are not ready to ruin your life and freedom. How can you support a another life when you cant even support yourself. And this guy, does he have a job, can he pay you child support?    This guy... trust me all he wants is sex and he doesn't need you, he just wants to have his dick played with and will not be with you in the end. Love is out of the question because your too young to know what that Truly is.    Take my advice like a big sister,  be responsible please. If you do end up having sex... use a condom.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	4 months nay be long for a 'middle school' relationship but its not long for a life relationship, like you said, what if you got pregnant...he might leave right then or stick around for a year or 2 but the odds are against the relatonship lasting that long even if you had a baby. Your definitely smarter than a lot of middle schoolers/high schoolers b/c you actually stood up to him and told him you aren't ready, plus its not even legal at 13 and is considered statutory rape on both parts, so if your parents caught you or you got pregnant, both could go on trial for rape. In my state you have to be 16 for it to be legal. If he doesn't respect your wishes to not have sex, then he doesn't respect you, so just keep telling him no, and hopefully he'll keep listening.    I would recommend seeing if the relationship lasts till you're the age that's at least legal in your state. It might, and might not, but please, if he ever breaks up with you and says b/c you won't have sex with him, please please don't give in at that point b/c you're trying to save the relationship, it will leave you hurt. *not saying that it will happen, just i had some friends in hs that gave in, the relationships didn't last much past that point....and one got pregnant|`|kVybkdOsaa	What ever you decide, is your choice.  Even if you decide to give in too easily, that would also be your choice.    Yes, guys will ask you about sex.  Some may even pressure you.  Maybe he won't like you anymore if you don't have sex.  Well, if that happens, you can be sure he didn't like you enough to wait for you to grow up a little.    This may be the guy for you.  How he behaves now, when you have expressed your concerns, will give you some indication of whether he is indeed a keeper.    P.S.  Of all the people I know that had sex at a young age, none of them still think that it was a good idea.  Each of them would take a do-over.|`|fv7uOe3kaa	i am 15 had more offers than ive had hot showers and my advice is not to have long term relationship before you have an independent life.I believe wat my wise pop said,'How can a human know and love one another until they know and love themselves',love of course not being of the visual or egotistical kind.but all that remains after. I find it near impossible to be adored by males,they cant get past it.And pleas dont call urself a people pleaser because that is not how anyone should be we should be equal without thought,naturally. it is wrong for a person to enjoy more without pleasing less.And how can u please correctly without knowing the true spirit of receiving?also know i am bi-sexual and fiveplay forte' lmao|`|AA10172823	im 40 and never had sex. You dont need sex...  just look at me :D sex just makes things complicated.                           lmao at anyone who falls for that lol|`|kBzIdPp8aa	im sure you have heard this too much but you are too young  once you lose your virginity you are officially not a kid  i think you should wait a couple years ..i know it sounds long  but you'll know when you are ready|`|QAiKdIYRaa	Don't do it. Youre still so young. Theres more to life than just sex and if he doesn't stick around because you won;t have sex with him, then hes not the one for you and you saved yourself from being hurt.|`|mfbxyfEbaa	Duuude if he wants it go ahead and do it!!! im 13 and i lost my verginity last weekend :) it was fun!! so if he wants to the go do it!|`|RlxzbfAGaa	If you are not ready, then DO NOT do anything you don't feel comfortable.  Ughh, there are three negatives in that sentence.  >_> Anyway.  You also have to remember there are some activities that will release sexual tension without having sex.  IF AND ONLY IF you felt comfortable with something like a handjob, you could do that.  Tell him to go **** when he's turned on. xD  I personally think you are too young, but if you feel ready, then whatever.  If he's still all, "SEXSEXSEX" then dump him.  You don't need that if you aren't ready, and he should respect that.|`|CdbTaQU0aa	first off, yeah, you are too young. you just started puberty recently and not everything is stable yet with your body. it's normal to be curious and want to have sex and it's also very normal for guys to want it faster than girls. about the whole "we're gonna be with eachother forever" thing? don't count on it. i've had 3 boyfriends who have told me pretty much the exact same thing and it didn't work out. plus, you're in middle school and by the time you reach high school, there's gonna be tons of more guys and honestly, not to be mean but your relationship with your current boyfriend will most likely end. it's very very rare for a relationship especially in middle school, let alone high school, to last 'forever' or even for more than a year or two. if you want to know more about sex, don't ask your friends because they won't know anything. i'd talk to your sex ed teacher or your parents or even your nurse at your school if she's nice. but the most important thing to never forget is that you should never ever let any guy pressure you into doing anything you're not sure about or anything you don't want to do. so if your boyfriend starts pressuring you or bugging about it a lot, i'd break it off with him because that could go down a bad road. also, you've only been dating for 4 months. that's not a long time at all. by this step, at your age, you should only be as far as making out. don't rush into things because you have sooo much time for that and everything else. you shouldn't rush to have sex. it's a really complicated and extremely emotional experience and a lot of risks come with it too. but before you decide anything, know what you'd be getting into and know your facts. and make sure that you don't give in just because your boyfriend wants to do it. if i were you, i'd wait at the very least a year and see if you're still with your boyfriend or even until you were at least 16 to do that.|`|AA11670981	Don't Do it! Thirteen is WA-AY too young to start! Neither your body or your emotions have matured enough yet. Maybe at 16 IF you practice safe sex in comfortable, caring relationship with someone you trust. Notice I didn't mention love? It can cause you to expect too much from the first time and that can be emotionally traumatizing. I would suggest finding a little older guy you like and trust; tell him the truth about being a virgin and ask him to "Initiate" you in a safe situation where you can relax, take your time and learn. Good lovemaking is a journey, not a race.|`|gUMNpAgyaa	Don't do it!!! Wait as long as you can. God prefers married! If he does not understand, then he is not right for you sorry to say.|`|XoNl5SjAaa	Don't do it for a while! I know from experience. I had sex with my bf when I was only 17 and even though we're still together (I'm 21 now) it made our relationship sooooooo much more difficult and has made it so difficult for me to think of the possibility of us breaking up. We talk about it now and as much as we love each other, we both think we had sex much to early. When your a teenager, especially as young as you guys, you shouldn't be worried about getting pregnant, STDs and stuff like that. It's so stressful having to worry about getting your period at that age, even if you do use protection. Having sex is such a special thing and until you know that this is one special guy, probably after being together over a year, then you can decide to have sex (my boyfriend and I had actually been together for a couple years by the time we had sex even though we were so young). I completely realize the pressure both of you may be on, and how much you may feel like you want to do it but hold off every second you can and don't spend time a lone with him. It's really not worth the risk of complicating your relationship when your that young.  If you do decide to have sex, MAKE SURE you use protection correctly. look up on the internet how to use it, go to a planned parenthood and get birth control, do everything you can to protect yourself because if you get pregnant at your age, that won't just complicate your relationship, it will complicate your whole life to such a horrible extent.|`|bMRCtxEuaa	lmao your a whore
LPtUJ5p5aa	I would highly recommend going back to the doctor ASAP and getting the meds adjusted, sounds to me like your doses are much too high.    My brother was on antidepressants for a while and similar things were happening to him, to the point where he could not tell the difference between dreaming and real life, and they would ocassionaly cross eachother..    Turned out, medication was too large of a dose. Docs will tell you, its all trial and error to adjust the amounts corrrectly.    I do not belive this is normal for you to be experiencing, and I would def go back to the doctor to get the dosages adjusted.|`|39x9tNJzaa	It sounds to me like you have been misdiagnosed and therefore are on the wrong medications, or at the very least your medications are not working out for you.      Your hazy, surreal sensations sound like dissociative behavior.  They could also just be a side effect from your medication.  Many medications, vitamins, and supplements can cause vivid nightmares when even slightly overdosed.    Sleep disturbances, like sleeping too much, too little, or inconsistently, are a symptom of many things including illness, both physical and mental.  It could be your medication, but it sounds like it's related to anxiety.    If you're having auditory hallucinations and hearing voices, whether you can understand them or not, you need to see your doctor immediately.  Whether it's your medication or a mental health issue, you're having psychotic episodes and they can be downright frightening.  Hearing your own voice in your head is different from hearing "voices" in your head.  If the voices sound like they are coming from your ears, or from some sort of actual source, then that is cause for concern.      Schizophrenia and D.I.D. both commonly cause these symptoms you are experiencing, but so do improper medication and overmedication.  Go see your doctor.  If he can't figure something out, get a second opinion.  I personally see two doctors because one of them just doesn't get the mental illness thing at all while the other one does.  Get yourself into counseling immediately if you aren't already.

If you are doing something that has a lower beat to it, such as weight training then eat within 30 minutes.    But it matters too what you eat.  If you drink a sports shake (and not all are good for you:  http://www.toneupyourstomach.com gives you some free shake recipes in their nutrition guide and emails) then you get the carb hit just when you need it.    Eating bananas is perfect.  Try this:  a banana and a black coffee.  normally in sport you avoid the black stuff, but just before a workout it is perfect and you perform better.  The bananas have a perfect high glycaemic level and release the energy about mid-work out.    You don't want to eat a roast meal just before any exercise.    If you want to get the best from weight training, make sure  you have some protein before you workout as well.

(For a more accurate answer, you could give us the state that you live in.)    You should:    1. Make sure that the plan you choose covers braces.  2. Make sure that the plan you choose serves your area.  3. Make sure you can afford the monthly payments.

zkHwRCm3aa	I really think he should be the one to decide to give you that happiness.He loves you, and if he thinks you deserve to be happy, then why don't you? You are selling yourself short. You do deserve all that happiness, you have just been through some really traumatic things, and you may have a slight case of depression. I know it sounds silly, but we all get down sometimes, especially during and after the loss of loved ones. i would use that oppertunity to let him closer in, to comfort you, instead of trying to have the hard outter shell. my husband loves to comfort me, and has never stepped back from the occasion. I think if you do not let him in a little more, he may feel shunned or not worthy, and if you love him, you don't want him feeling neglected.|`|RCt6QyL4aa	ok, i think u SHOULDNT leave him. u r like sooooo lucky to have a man like that!! you really dont see guys like this out here!!!!

OMG WHY DO PPL SAY IT SMELLS IT DOESNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! tht bugs me it doesnt smell any different then u usually smell. wait for cramps. wen u start gettin them get a pad on ASAP|`|dTdLrjFNaa	First of all, it's not that bad. You should notice because it kind of feels like you wet your pants a little, for lack of a better term. It won't get through to your pants for a while, so you should have enough time to say you feel nauseous and go to the nurse or bathroom.    Wear pantyliners. That way you'll be ready for it when it comes, and you won't have a bloodstain.|`|lZLtEyodaa	You can buy panty liners.  They are MUCH thinner than pads.  When you think you're close, you can start wearing them to school.  You should keep pads or tampons in your bookbag, and if you start at school, you can just change the panty liner out for a pad!  It's nothing to be scared of!  Good luck :)|`|lFlPWFwYaa	dont be so scared. be sure to keep some extra pants in your backpack or locker cuz  its never easy to tell if u will have a heavy first period or not  always ALWAYS have at least 2 or 3 pads with you all the time until u start (dont start out using tampons... get used to your period first and let it become regular b4 u get into that)  mine wasnt so bad. i remember having that discharge when i was in the third freakin grade! i hated it and one day in the 4th grade in may i think i went to the bathroom cuz that discharge stuff was buggin me and it was brown. i wass like holy crap so i put some toilet paper in my panties (i was only like 10 so i was unprepared and stupid) and nothing else happened.  then my next period wasnt until like a year later but yours could be like a few months later   just always be lookin out for the signs     -irritability     -cramps in your stomach     -backaches (i get the worst ones ever)     -headaches|`|gUMNpAgyaa	Get prepared! they have scented pads you can buy at the store, buy some and keep them in your backpack.

It started at school but it wasnt too bad of a leak, it didnt leak into my pants.  And the first time its not too bad so dont worry!|`|af43e8f6af5feac294cdbceeba67f982aa	Keep a pad with you at all times, also wear a thin liner or pad if you think that maybe you are going to start soon.  There are some signs, a smotah pain, feeling lazy ect.  And just keep some perfume in your purse if you are worried about the smell, but its not that strong so not one will really notice.|`|GfIkEpYdaa	well you are deff. ganna start it soon so if I were you i would keep pads with me all the time.

Make an appt with your Dr  though!|`|lv7IhkoNaa	Well there can be many things wrong but really if you've been coughing for a month serisouly got to the doctor and if you can't go take madicane for coughing as it says on the label|`|wNwGA0Ztaa	go to the doctor- duh!|`|8WqTvPBbaa	Stop smoking that weed
7iEk06aDaa	Yes, but I think your envisioning it wrong. The 'skin' your talking about is actually a thin piece of tissue, or membrane that is located deeper in your vagina. It is torn when the penis enters. A quick, sharp pain and it''s over, though usually a girl is very tender for awhile. But please, no sex yet, your too young.|`|qX0KdYUjaa	what a miracle!|`|0WOvEw2Daa	NOOO. not unless you are having sex with something that isnt human. Thats.. uhhh kinda what the female privates were made to do. as well as deliver 6lb babies. so, im pretty sure you'll be fine. But wait a few years, your only 14.|`|5Aej2zebaa	No, your hyman inside your vagina breaks. Any other breaking is not normal and you should see a doctor.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	It depends. Not all girls hymen break. -by the way it's referred to as a hymen- Some girls are different than others. If you notice tiny blood spots after sex, than your hymen may have tore.|`|af43e8f6af5feac294cdbceeba67f982aa	Yes it dose...|`|zRit8suXaa	yes its called a hymen and when the penis enters it breaks or tears

That probably doesn't make much sense, lol.    I would go to a doctor and see what he/she says about it.|`|07u50wubaa	if the feet are cold the water feels hot and the purple toes are because of the blood gathering there and that is okay because it is good to have in your feet.|`|58abdcb0652955a0d84a28b08b3cab8eaa	It's fine. Whenever I get into the bath my legs turn white and my veins are really dark purple and they are so visible and it's kind of creepy, but then it fades away.   My feet turn purple when they're cold and get put into warm water. Reach down and grab your foot in the shower- does it feel cold to your warmed up hand? If so, it could just be cold skin in a warm shower. It happens.
QAiKdIYRaa	You can still have a pelvic exam when youre a virgin|`|zRit8suXaa	if u hav a prob then u get one if ur not i guess............maybe|`|pn88K8UXaa	i was a virgin (besides oral sex she found out and ive been fingered so it looked like i was) and they did a pap smear even when she thought i was a virgin. so look at this site to see what it is, and if they did that, then tell your parents they do that for virgins too.    if it was a pelvic exam, they do that on virgins as well to look for common things like ovarian cysts and stuff that do occur in virgin females. if you have cramps when you get your period, tell your parents its because of them and he wanted to check out to make sure there were not any ovarian cysts.
6HhO1Evfaa	Sorry I might be too late.    Eat a banana and drink ice water.  Bananas calm acid and the water makes it better.  Eat a mint.  Have mint tea.  Chew mint gum.  Have some ginger ale.  These are all things that might help.  Sorry if I did not answer in time.

8UfyHGdVaa	your heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 BPM when resting. In a test two people ran. 1 drank a monster another did not. Person with energy drink BPM was about 115, 105, 110 on 3 tries. person without energy drink did not spike but decreased after each test. The results where   95, 93, and 81 you can see there is a drastic change of about 20 bpm. and when ever you take a sip you feel a little jolt in your heart beat  Hope this helps :)|`|IYu3bBFqaa	This would depend on many factors. Which energy drink is it?  What heart raising ingredients are in it?  Also it depends on personal health, high blood pressure, and other factors that vary from person to person.  In order to better answer this question for yourself, pick an energy drink, look at the ingredients, research the ones  you don't know, and factor in your personal health.|`|AA12074512	most energy drinks are bad for you. ask your doctor he can tell you.|`|9Kp4nZX9aa	There is no way to precisely answer your question as metabolic rates and reactions to the mass amount of sugar they put in those drinks will vary. It will definitely rise however!!  You'd be better off to forsake these "junk food" energy drinks for real energy drinks that replenish real vitamins and minerals lost during excersize. Pro athletes don't drink that kind of beverage, especially for endurance sports.  You could always get a heart rate monitor and see what the effect is on you personally.
xNkmK0SHaa	You might try heat and/or ice - whichever works.    In my experience (personal) caffeine has little to do with it, and after 50 needle biopsies (many years ago), one of the docs finally heard/learned that it is usually caused by a hormone problem. Duh.    You know, these newer birth control medications have more side effects and cause more problems than we will know in this lifetime.    I would not presume to tell you what to do other than try to obtain some degree of comfort. Still - - -|`|sy9rDK1Gaa	You have to try a natural, homeopathic pain lotion called ExtRemedy.

f51d44e105a2a3f4397e420c549a4437aa	I don't have a big acne problem, but when I noticed I was getting more small blackheads and whiteheads on my forehead and chin, I started to use Acne Free.  My skin is much clearer now.  I do use a light moisturizer with SPF 15, but I live in Hawaii, so not using a moisturizer with sunscreen would be stupid.    BTW I am 38, so my acne is mostly hormonal.
lK6S5cGSaa	Yes, it will hurt.  It's not so much pain as it is soreness.  Every month the orthodontist will tighten them and your teeth will be very sore for the next couple days and then it goes away.  If it causes too much discomfort you can always take some ibuprofen.  It is worth it in the end though.|`|6t76bgS3aa	yeah it does hurt, and your teeth will be really sore afterwards and also every time they tighten the wires.  i had braces when i was a teenager and i hated it, but i'm glad my parents made me do it, because i wouldn't be too sexy with crooked spaced out teeth.|`|hX3Yf2TLaa	mine did not hurt that bad|`|oDaDcDZpaa	braces DONT  hurt as well as spacers dont be worryed you'll be fine stay clam!!|`|BM1GgcnMaa	they feel like a little metal monster eating your teeth|`|2fYdY1fiaa	just the first few days, probably 7 days it is hard to eat. but other than that it does not hurt at all|`|d5ug5W5kaa	in the beginning, but u get used to them.
l4WEwTWwaa	I honestly think he is just embarrassed. When I dated a women four years older than me I got embarrassed during sex because I knew she was more experienced than me and I felt I had to perform. When you feel pressure and embarrassment you lose your erection. It never happend to me but if it did I would definately avoid that women out of shame. So as a guy who's dated older women my honest opinion is that he is just embarrassed and there is no serious relationship issue there. Although you should tell your friends about him. You are the only person it needs to be ok with and if your friends aren't happy for you then they aren't your friends and kick them to the curb. Tell them about him, you are both grown adults doing nothing wrong. So anyway if you have sex again and he perfoms better I'm pretty sure things will get better and he will not be so distant.|`|W1MgefrWaa	The bad news is that this happened to me after I cheated on my gf. I felt so guilty that I couldn't stay hard while we were doing it. I eventually broke down and told her. She left me.|`|mzN3hlb9aa	You slept with a guy who you dated for only a month?!?!?!?!?!|`|175ydQo5aa	6 years younger? maybe your too loose.     Just a thought.|`|dycyfRrsaa	The reason he's acting distant is because he doesn't want to be in that situation again; his lost his erection and its liked he failed and he's afraid of failing again when you get intimate. its happened to many people including me lol !  =(   there is a list of things that may have caused it alcohol,  stress ...     If you are sure about him and you love each other you should just tell your friends about him in the right moment and if they must respect your decision, age shouldn't matter =)  besides 6yrs isn't much difference.  Good luck!|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Hey dawn    Six years is absolutely nothing, unless you are over legal age and he is under legal age. If you are both of age, then don't give 6 years a thought. Even 10 or 15 years age difference can work. For Me! :- ) 20 years diff. would be stretching it a bit! Haha!    You don't need to say how old he is unless they ask. Just say how awesome he is and how you feel about him.    If you get negative feedback for someone, distance yourself a little from that friend. Your Man or your Woman must become more important than the opinion of your friends, unless they are tying to protect you from and obvious jerk or nasty person.     Since Ladies reach their sexual peak a bit later than a Dude, a Lady who is 6 to 8 years older can be a better match for frequency of wanting to Make Love.    You need to be careful to not put yourself above him because of more age and experience or maturity, or even let him feel that you are above him. Let him lead as much as you can, and encourage, but don't force him to help you with ideas and his opinion about stuff and give him positive feed back on his thoughts for the age of six years younger where they are coming from, as many of the will be awesome for his age.    He will mature faster, and you will slow down some...That's awesome for both of you. You can always feel six younger as well this way. Haha!    Just act normal, Love your Dude good, and he will soon forget about what didn't go right, and there will be lot of going right happening.  Make him feel that you would be happy to spend a life time with him..that really tells good stuff.    As time goes by, he will feel his way into being able to talk relationship stuff easier. It just happens slowly with us, but we get there after a while it's a new thing, and we aren't accustomed to trusting anybody that much. For little girls, it their mommy or more often their Dad. For a Dude, who is there to practice with?....are Dads are often dinosaurs and hardly interested in our stuff, and for our Moms!....Haha!  how is she supposed to understand a growing Dude, or discuss our spontaneous erection questions and problems, or our powerful sex urges that we deal with as well as the feelings about really wanting a certain girl, but wanting to do it right and not just sex, but that wouldn't be so bad either, so you see what I mean?    We just learn to deal with our own stuff instead of being judged, shunned, shut down or shot down, or just sneered at.    A site like this is good because we get to go into our stuff in a safe way and can get some bad as s remarks, but may good and useful responses as well. We get to see how the Ladies feel about what we are expressing, and can sort out the ones who mean us no good, from the sincere ones....it's easy to spot!    Me! :- )|`|c71316f440c7c102ff8ab9c606b89e49aa	Cause he feels like less of a man now.  You should really flirt him up and get him going|`|lW2W1ApBaa	try bathing next time.. That always gets me too.|`|0WOvEw2Daa	He's just embarrased. that happens to my boyfriend sometimes, and he gets embarrassed, but if you are having sex with someone, you should be comfortable enought to talk about it, or whatever when something like that happens.|`|OBFyz3z8aa	Well he feels used, you don't want other people to know, how do you expect him to feel. He feels unwanted and alone. He doesn't feel important so he doesn't feel like sex is important if he isn't that important. I've felt that way with my ex and sadly it was true and she in fact cheated on me. Don't give him any negative vibes, especially if you want to be with him.

rVnTnuU1aa	Its not exactly what is eaten but rather the portions that are eaten.   A huge factor is how often you work out and also your metobolism and how many calories your body burns in a day by doing nothing.

Not too much sugary foods and be physically active and you won't get fat.|`|EbNQDAHPaa	I eat only 1200 calories a day (23 yrs old, 106 lbs). It's all about portion control and not eliminating anything out of your diet. That is setting yourself up for failure. ALWAYS look at the nutrition labels! Low calorie, low carbs, low fat. Ice cream is loaded, just eat a scoop or two on a "cheat day." I try to cheat once a week. Cut everything in half.. it works. Eat lots of white meat and fish. Not a lot of sweets, chips, salad dressings, sugary cereals. Eat plain oatmeal with sweet and low and cinnamon. Eggs, with only one yolk. Take cheese and crutons off your salads. And low cal dressing on the side! Always try diet sodas, unsweet teas, or flavored 0 cal waters. Hope this helps :)|`|4CsGde1qaa	Technically, anything that is made for the human to eat is calories in our mouths, and calories equal weight, and if you don't exercise then you will collect much of the weight and eventually get fat.

NEVER eat fried foods, butter, mayo, fast food and especially ice cream (try fat free frozen yogurt).  Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low fat protein (fish, soy, beans, yogurt) and substitute olive oil for your cooking and salad dressing needs.

Otherwise, do a really good job of keeping it clean, with hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol on a qtip or cotton ball several times a day. Also, if you have any topical antibacterial ointment (like polysporin) put that on, trying to get it right down near the hole.    in the future, remember to avoid touching your earrings all the time, because your hands can carry lots of bacteria that lead to infection. And don't forget to keep up with cleaning the piercings regularly.    should do the trick in a day or so.    good luck!
ToILKl6waa	Take a deep breath and relax your muscles - it's going to be alright. When I'm anxious, it helps me to look at one solid thing, such as a mug or table and say what it is aloud to bring me back to reality and away from my irrational thoughts.  I advise you to go drink some water and try to relax for the night. Worrying is no use at all - you are in control of the anxiety. The anxiety is not in control of you. Realize that your mind is your worst critic and everything is exaggerated within it. A situation or problem is much less than what the mind portrays it to be.|`|nXxtBkguaa	okay, I'm not a therapist or anything.  But sometimes it just helps to have someone tell you that everythingg will be okay.    everything will be okay.|`|bxxwhP04aa	Drink a glass of milk and swallow a calcium/magnesium pill at the same time.  Learn to breathe from the bottom of your lungs rather than the top, which is probably what you are doing.  Get some exercise and fresh air each day.  Get plenty of sunshine on your skin, or take Vitamin D tablets.  Get a massage if possible.  You ought to be on some mild medication such as klonopin.
D0JsiC0Paa	It is very common for the stomach to produce excess acid at times of stress, may it be conscious or subconscious. It's hard to stop if its subconscious, and only happened to me once for a month during my GCSEs.     What you can do is drink plenty of water, but I would suggest going to the doctor - they gave me something called Lansaprazole for a month, just took one a day and it was brilliant, got me through the stressful period and the acidity never returned.    The cure however, is to better learn to manage stress and identify what it is that is stressing you.    If it's not an isolated event - and continues to happen afterwards, or happens frequently - it could be the signs of something more, which is still common as there are conditions that develop that cause this kind of acid reflux or burning, self-digesting feeling in your stomach, and you still need to get that checked out.    Good Luck.|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	I went through this EXACT same thing when I was your age.    Pepcid AC is a great counteracting medicine for an overactive stomach.    The bigger issue here is, what is causing your anxiety? No over the counter medicine will fix that, you will only continue to medicate yourself so that your stomach doesnt burn, however eventually you could suffer from an ulcer.    I would go to the doctor, most likely he will prescribe you a prescription strength antiacid, they work wonders!    I would recommend trying to figure out what it is that is causing so much stress and anxiety in your life. Being a teenager alone is enough, yes I remember!    But its always good to check into, you never know if you might have social anxiety disorder or something that can be easily helped!    Take care|`|4k59EjXUaa	Well First Of All See A Doctor Because You May Be At Risk Of Acid Reflux Disease Although It May Not Be To Serious You May Still Need To Get Tested Just In Case Because The Acid Level CAN Hurt You GOOD LUCK!!!!!!|`|6TAsm1Bzaa	I've had this recently.

AEAxZEveaa	Dont' eat any dairy for a couple of days, then eat an entire meal of dairy foods. If you start feeling sick, you probably are. By the way, what ethnic background are you? If you're not caucasian, your chances of being lactose intolerant are much greater than your chances are for being able to tolerate it. Most people of asian and african are lactose intolerant. The rate is about 5% in european ancestry. It's actually the normal state of things to be lactose intolerant.

After I relized what I did I drank tons of gateraid and made sure to eat lots of solid food (crackers, bread, rice, ect)    That'll help it.       if you're wondering, all that made me REALLY shake. I was hyper and shivering. I think a bit dizy.That's about it though. Nothing that conserned me.  3 advil is fine|`|Q3bmBCueaa	yes you can take up to four ibuprofen at a time every eight hours|`|EN32vSsCaa	I can't tell you that it's OK to take more than the instructions on the box tell you to.

OtiTiVDNaa	hi there, well let me break it to you, one of those belly fat belt that tightens ur stomach so that u can burn more calories work not as efficiently as what iam going to suggest.     1. Start jogging , while jogging for some time eventually when you get warmed up, start to sprint , thats right -jog/ sprint/jog sprint/jog sprint atleast for about 45 minutes. ( beleive me best cardio ever makes you loose fat so quickly)     2 Drink lots of water     3 .stick to proteins and lowcarbs for sometime.     4 . 5 pounds is rather easier to loose  if you stick to such a routine   Good luck!|`|xwG6e7IQaa	Richard Simmions- Rolling to the 80's he's great....and gay what more could you ask for in a video tape!|`|70LIxqdxaa	Lift weights,run, jog, walk, crwal, sprint, jump, play sports, and F cK everything else that matters in life.
511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	I don't know why you would want to go to that extreme. I had an eating disorder from hs thru college, and I didn't compare my disorder to other peoples. I wanted to seem as normal as possible. So I'm kinda at a loss at your question.|`|Z2f5Ka6jaa	You'll notice probably in a few years that you'll get more cavities. Probably around your early-middle twenties.    I'm not sure what you're asking when you asked, "When will it end?"  I think you should ask yourself, what is your goal in doing this? Did you place a time limit on how long you're going to keep up this activity?  Are you punishing yourself for something?    If you want to know when the affects of your actions are going to appear, (depending on the frequency of your purges- like if you do it 3 times a day) I would say your mid twenties. You'll probably develop IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and have to take medication for that. As for your esophagus, once you have a hole in your esophagus, then I think you need like one of those crazy things one your throat with the weird voice. To my knowledge they don't have esophagus replacement surgery...  EDIT: you probably WON'T die from throwing up. You're just breaking down your organs and speeding up the deterioration of your arteries. You don't know what the damage is until a doctor does x-rays and an MRI of your insides. The damage you're doing is a long spectrum... anywhere from polyps (pre-cancerous) to damage to your reproductive system which could destroy your chances of being able to have children (if you even care about that).|`|AiOBRjYlaa	please learn to lvoe yourself and be confident.|`|8yygCf9Yaa	i suffer from bulimia myself i am 15 although i dont gag myself either i simply just throw up its weird. nothing has happened to me yet either, we can talk if you want?  email me  xohhemilyx24@yahoo.com|`|UB7pWWHeaa	Hey.   I couldn't help but to read your question and feel exactly the same way you do. I'm 20 years old. 5'11 120 lbs. and have been bulimic since I was 16. My healthy weight was 140. I wish I could be 140 again, healthy but I'm not and don't see the chance. Like you I have no complications as far as bleeding etc. I have an idea for the both of us, we can become pen-pals.... write eachother what we ate everyday week by week until we realize we need to get better..... I feel you 100% it's crazy//// I think if I decide to write on paper exactly what I ate it can help control myself... as you.. what do you say?  My email is bitterfnsweet@yahoo.com  Write me back if you think it's a good idea  Like I said I am in the same predicament as you, and even if you don't want to mail........... I feel ya .  Peace|`|Ezcyodycaa	May I just know WHY you feel a need to do this? Do you think you are fat? If that is you in the picture, you look WAAAAAAAAAAY too thin just from what I can see, I can see your bones on your upper chest.    Is it like an addiction? Is it just a normal response now for you to puke after eating?    Yeah, of course eventually something bad's gonna happen to you. If you are abusing your body like that and depriving it of the nutrients it needs, eventually you will "break".    You need to just eat healthy and excercise to stay in shape. You shouldn't be like a twig. Also from what I saw in your picture you are a pretty girl and you should throw some curves on that by eating and not puking it up. You will be much happier and much healthier, and probably much more attractive too.     I feel really bad for you, and while I can't fathom continuing to do this when you know it is harmful or unessecary I am sure you have some reason for it. But you need to realize you need to eat and keep it down. if you just take care of yourself you don't have to worry about keeping weight off. You shouldn't even have that be something you worry about. People are so hung up on being thin no matter what when all that really matters is that you are healthy, which you are probably not. You aren't fat. And even if you were, you should keep it off not to look thin but so you are healthy and can put more value in your life.    So to answer your question, yes, it will hurt you eventually. Your body needs food to keep going, and it's not just the action of puking that can do you in, it's the not taking in the food all the way too.    Please, as the first responder said, love yourself and take care of yourself. And PLEASE stop binging and purging.
M4tJM8jSaa	1. For the color if you want your braces to stand out then choose a bright color. If you don't want them to stand out then get a pastel color or clear.  2. In order to have braces put on it takes two visits. In the first visit they put in rubber bands in between your back teeth. They do this to make room for two metal bands that will be put in when you get your braces. Then when they put on your brace that visit could take an hour and a half to two hours. You might want to bring your Ipod.    The pain isn't like a falling pf your bike sort of pain its like a sore muscle pain. The pain only last for 3 - 6 after you get them on. Then they will hurt about three days after you get them tightened. I suggest taking a Tylenol or a Motrin before you go. Also don't eat anything that is really hard after the appointment because it will hurt.      (:|`|D3hLhqR7aa	When you first get them on they won't hurt till a few hours after, then the pain starts to kick in. Just take a pain reliever and it will help some. THe pain will last a week to a week in a half.     Eat soft foods such as: Soup, pudding, jello, ice cream, yogurt, etc.    Get your favorite color, I like light blue and also white. Good luck with your braces experience :)|`|QObcxCPgaa	Hi braces r a breeze to put on. They only hurt after wards for a couple days but then u get used to them:)  so first they clean your teeth then he will put a plastic thing in your mouth to hold it wide open! :o and then he drys all the teeth and puts the glue on each one then puts the little squares on each tooth then he adds the wire though. its so easy. and its soo worth it then you will get supplys for them and he will teach you how to take care of them and tell you what not to eat   colors for braces  pink and blue  blue and purple  purple and pink  pink and orange  pink and green|`|fTtkXFJLaa	ok everyone says they hurt and i got them last week but trust me there is barely any pain!!!!!!!!!! the only pain was like eating for the first couple of days and it was a LITTLE BIT sore but that was because teeth were shifting. and i advise yu wash your mouth after every meal! i know that may seem tiring but its worth it! if you dont its unhealthy for your teeth AND you have food stuck everywhere in your braces and its just a bother.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Braces (for me) took about a half hour to forty five minutes to put on. It doesn't hurt to get them put on, but they are sore for a few days after that. The pain will go away within 1-2 weeks. Take ibuprofen. The best colors are the colors your most comfortable with. If you want bright pink, go for it. If you want white, go for it.Remember you get to change your colors next visit. So just pick the colors you really want. Good luck! Everything will be a breeze, just think, beautiful teeth!|`|wzskooHBaa	Braces don't hurt that much. To me it felt like the pain of having a headache. I think they hurt the most the 2nd and 3rd day though. But seriously, no unbearable pain. They should hurt the most for about a week. I just got braces a month ago, my teeth felt sore for only 2 days. But by the 4th day, i could eat normally again. When your braces get put on:               1. They put a thing that keeps your mouth open.                                 2. They sort of dry your teeth.    3. They put glue on your teeth.                                 4. They put the braces on.    5. They dry your braces with this blue light. (It seriously helps dry the glue.)   6. If you choose the color braces, they put the color on.                      7. They will explain how to floss and brush.                                 8.. They give you wax, a toothbrush, and floss.      The first time i chose the colors baby blue and baby pink. These colors don't show that much. Most people couldn't even tell i had gotten braces. If you really don't want your braces to show, choose silver. But the best color to choose is pink.     GOOD LUCK!!! : )
syT3XUAraa	I hope you aren't too curious! In my opinion, though, the least painful methods would be:    Instant/No Pain:  Gun or beheading    Not Instant/No Pain:  Sleeping pills, drinking antifreeze (actually sweet-tasting and pain-free), maybe drowning (I've heard that people who have survived say it is peaceful once you let go) bleeding to death (I've heard the actual bleeding-out is painless). However, I would never attempt suicide! I'm not Catholic, but I'm not stupid, either. : )|`|IYu3bBFqaa	no one can truthfully and honestly answer this question unless they have  experienced all of the options.  Since you can only die once, I would say not even a dead person truly knows this answer.  Also, pain tolerance is a factor here.|`|l87SLSwgaa	The least painful way of dying would be not to die at all.|`|WgbMjvroaa	:(  This makes me sad.  Please don't kill yourself|`|jgZIh5lMaa	I think burining to death would be very painful, along with stabbing yourself.  Hmmm.... I think that hanging yourself would be in the medium zone... along with drowning.  I think a gun would be the fastest way.    But if I wanted to die or something I would join the war, that way Id know I went for a good cause!|`|pTbGI4sZaa	Although I can't vouch for it, as I've never died, I would guess natural causes, in your sleep.    Guns are quick, but messy, and it's possible that a person may live for at least a few seconds (depending on where they're shot).  Drugs might seem painless, but actually an overdose can be extremely nasty, what with choking on your own vomit, frothing at the mouth, and so on.  Heart attacks and strokes can be pretty painful.    Of course, like I said, I've never died - but I've seen a lot of people who have, and none of the causes you mentioned have ever looked like death was easy for them.|`|y4IzoJP8aa	no! dont die! we love you too much! life is a gift, dont throw it away!!!|`|Ts33DJSwaa	a very slow death, check out a website called unite against drugs which is a campaign run by drug free international and imagine what a person would have to endure to end up dying from a cocktail of street drugs, alcohol and painkillers for example....why are you interested??

cPIYUWxyaa	Here are some ways to eat less salt:    At the table:        * Take your salt shaker off the table.        * Stop using all kinds of salt. This includes table salt, sea salt, garlic salt, onion salt, celery salt, lemon pepper, monosodium glutamate (MSG), soy sauce, and teriyaki sauce.    When you are shopping:        * Buy fresh foods. Processed meat and canned food have salt in them. Choose fresh meat instead of processed meat. Buy fruits and vegetables fresh or frozen instead of canned.        * Buy unsalted foods. Choose unsalted crackers and nuts. Look for foods that are marked "salt reduced" or "low salt".        * Read the labels. Most packaged food has salt added. If salt or sodium is listed as the first, second or third ingredient it is probably too salty for you. If the % Daily Value (DV) for sodium on the Nutrition Facts table is 5% or less (120 mg or less), the food is low in sodium.    When you are cooking:        * Cook pasta, rice and potatoes without salt. When you bake cookies or muffins, use less salt than the recipe suggests.        * Cook with less or no salt. Try making soups, stews, casseroles and desserts with less salt. Bookstores and libraries have lots of low-salt cookbooks.    When you drink water, choose:        * Tap water, spring water or distilled water.        * If you choose bottled water, check the label. (Water treated with softeners is salty. There is also sodium in club soda.)    How can I add more taste without salt?    Use spices and herbs for extra flavour:        * Use lots of onions, garlic, ginger, parsley and other fresh herbs.        * Sprinkle lemon juice, lime juice or vinegar on vegetables, fish or chicken.        * Make your own salad dressings from oil, vinegar, herbs and spices.        * Use wine to flavour stews.    Here is a low salt spice mix you can make. Put it in your salt shaker instead of salt.    Mix together:        * 1 tablespoon each of:            o dried mustard            o paprika            o onion powder            o pepper        * 1 teaspoon each of:            o basil            o thyme    What foods should I avoid?    Some of the things on this list might be your favourite foods. You can eat them, but don't eat too much. Try to have no more than one salty food at a meal.        * Packaged foods and instant foods  these include: mixes; canned food; packaged food; instant food; and frozen dinners.        * Deli meats        * Processed foods  these include: canned meats and fish; processed cheese or cheese spreads; smoked fish and kippers; and sausages.        * Pickled foods        * Condiments or gravies  these include: ketchup or steak sauce; mustard; relish or horseradish; Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce; salad dressings; packaged gravy or sauces; and bouillon        * Snack foods  these include: potato chips; pretzels and salted crackers; salted nuts or sunflower seeds; and microwave popcorn        * Some desserts  for example, commercial pies and desserts; and pudding mixes        * Some drinks  these include: tomato juice and vegetable juice; sports drinks; soda water; and some mineral waters    What about salt substitutes?    Look for salt substitutes that are made from herbs, spices and citrus peel. Some salt substitutes are made of potassium instead of sodium. If you have kidney disease or you are taking blood pressure pills you may not be able to use these. Ask your doctor if these salt substitutes are safe for you.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	Stop eating anything that tastes salty.  The big offenders are processed foods.|`|AA10797214	Most of the prepared foods have a high sodium content  that you can see on the label. If you prepare the fresh food yourself you have control, over the salt that you add to it, or even better flavor it with other  herbs and spices and omit the salt totally. Start looking at the content of sodium on the frozen Dinners and other canned products and you will see just how much salt is in them, and if you are having potato chips take a good look at the sodium on the package, and soon you will see how this will add up and fast. Once you are on a sodium free diet, add a few drops of iodine, to you juice, and potassium to as well|`|108cbf465aba14d306cf8d0e8081f6e3aa	Stop adding salt to your food and during the cooking process. Use whole/fresh foods instead of canned ones. If you eat meat, use only real meat products, not breaded ones.|`|LYXzpLTkaa	too much sodium can affect your organs , you may try going salt-free and add potassium and iodine

l4WEwTWwaa	Sometimes when your gums rise up from your teeth or go higher or lower it is because of bacteria eating away at your gums. Are your teeth sensitive when you eat or drink something cold? Also brushing extra and mouth wash do nothing to repair the damage to your gums. In fact they can make things worse. If you press extra hard when you brush you are doing damage to your gums. Press softly when you brush. Next only your dentist can tell you if that is the cause but if it is there is nothing you can do on your own. You may need a skin graph if it is that. A skin graph is when they remove skin from the roof of your mouth or other places and sow it onto the bad area. I had one and its really no biggie. So the next time you go to your dentist point out the gum problem and see what it is.
oRq9o8mcaa	Yes, they feel really weak for a few days after you get them, and it makes you nervous about eating and things. But don't worry, a few more days and they'll feel normal again, you'll not even notice the braces any more. It's just the braces trying to move the teeth, which is good, as soon you will have a perfect set of teeth. It's worth it :-)  Hope this helped.|`|YY6JjIiAaa	The reason you have braces is for your teeth to become straight im guessing, and in order to do that they have to move and in order to move they have to become loose. So im almost positive it's normal! your teeth feel loose because they are going to move soon probably. i wouldnt worry!|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	yes, that is very normal being that your teeth are beginning to move and shift.

And Ketchikan is further north so the sun is at a lower angle and travels through more atmosphere, (even when it is sunny in Ketchikan).  Going through more atmosphere removes a lot of the UV.  That's why you sunburn much faster at high elevation than at sea level.    And Ketchikan is in surrounded by mountains.  So that low-angle sun is often behind a hill or ridge.  Paris is in the middle are broad flat plain.  So sunrise comes earlier and sunset later.    The long days of the Alaskan summer are cancelled out by the short days in winter.  Every place on Earth has an average day of 12 hours long, if you consider the whole year.    I can also vouch for there being MANY more shorts, short skirts, and t-shirts being worn in Paris than in Ketchikan.  So people are more exposed to the higher UV as well in Paris, but isn't really part of the UV index.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Apparently so, if the hole in the ozone layer people are to be believed.

I had most of my pain the 4 days before I broke out, I thought I had appendicitis and had a cat scan, then I broke out. Good Luck, glad you are doing ok...mine were extremely painful
BG8vMyZjaa	TMJ = temperomandibular joint where a bone from the skull (temporal bone) meets the upper jaw bone (mandible)    TMJ disorders are also sometimes referred to as myofacial pain dysfunction and Costen's syndrome. Because muscles and joints work together, a problem with either one can lead to stiffness, headaches, ear pain, bite problems (malocclusion), clicking sounds, or locked jaws. The following are behaviors or conditions that can lead to TMJ disorders.       1. Teeth grinding and teeth clenching (bruxism) increase the wear on the cartilage lining of the TMJ. Those who grind or clench their teeth may be unaware of this behavior unless they are told by someone observing this pattern while sleeping or by a dental professional noticing telltale signs of wear and tear on the teeth. Many patients awaken in the morning with jaw or ear pain.   2. habitual gum chewing or fingernail biting   3. dental problems and misalignment of the teeth (malocclusion). Patients may complain that it is difficult to find a comfortable bite or that the way their teeth fit together has changed. Chewing on only one side of the jaw can lead to or be a result of TMJ problems.  4. Stress frequently leads to unreleased nervous energy. It is very common for people under stress to release this nervous energy by either consciously or unconsciously grinding and clenching their teeth.  5. Occupational tasks such as holding the telephone between the head and shoulder may contribute to TMJ disorders     The falling asleep and body jolts could be related to fatigue, but you need to see your doctor to eliminate any other causes and to put your mind at rest.  Tedious when you are busy and tired, but essential.
ayGeAonbaa	I have wondered this too actually. I do think it should be up to you when you want to die and yes, I'm depressed. Incidentally, I used to be a committed Christian and the lack of God was confirmed to me when my best friend died in 1999. So, I do see your point very much....I wish you well.|`|YzKRUniLaa	iv seen their website - an expensive way to die!! Just throw oneself off a tall building. Think of it as a free skydive|`|TAqwdOK8aa	The only problem, as I see it, is that what we want changes, so often. I've wanted to die, very often, but only at my lowest have I tried to make that happen. Really, beyond my true lows, I even see death in a morbidly-positive light.     Now, if you wish for death, endlessly, and it affects your life, as a whole, then it may be something to think of. If you are just depressed, and thoughts of suicide are a product of that, it may be something you need to fix. However, if you suffer, truly, from horrid pain, be in mental or physical, I see it as a perfectly fine option. That is only my opinion, though.|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Yes as answerer number one rightly said ...   You have to have a terminal illness ...   And apart from that ...   Look at yourself ...  God has given you the gift of life and love.   There is someone for you just waiting to be discovered, you are special and you are loved. Never think of the bad (i know it is easier said than done) always look to the good ...  Always keep a positive mental attitude and surround yourself in people, surround yourself in friends, think of all the good things you have done in life, all the people you have made smile ...   Your life is precious, make the most of it.   May God always bless you and offer you his protection and love.   Stay safe out there.|`|d5a52bb19a9fa6747be1ee4084979a27aa	You have to have a terminal illness|`|8sXw0iEXaa	Carly,  You are very important to Satan, that is why he wants your soul, so that he can show the world that he has the power over a person's life.    You obviously have Godly traits that would be a prize for Satan so that he could brag how he defeated God and took something of value from Him. It is a battle between Satan and God. But know this, God has overcome Satan and holds the keys to his house.    Jesus has risen from the grave and conquered death, defeated Satan.  God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten So that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but hav everlasting life.    Do as God instructs and enjoy the life He has planed for you,    God Bless,  Daniel    God requires that we believe that Jesus is His Son and that we repent of our sin and be baptized.

Women are biologically programmed to respond to the pheremones of other women in this way.

Some believe it was so prehistorically when the males went away to hunt, on their return all the women would be at their most fertile at the same time. Of course, as the average cycle is 28 days, this meant the rest of their cycle was in synch also.     Apparently, the rest of the tribe would have longer and shorter cycles accordingly until they matched that of the alpha female. As some have said, this was through her pheramones.
mlh58PTNaa	Do you have anything (splinter maybe) under the fingernail.?  Can you move the finger in a full range of motion? Did you do anything to injure it or did this come on gradually?|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. Carpal tunnel syndrome can cause pain at the wrist. In addition, this syndrome can cause pain to shoot down into the fingers or up into the forearm. Usually there is a numb feeling in the fingers as if they were asleep. In this syndrome, the median nerve is trapped and squeezed as it passes through the fibrous carpal tunnel in the front of the wrist.  No major pain medication should be necessary. Acetaminophen and similar medications are all right but probably won't help much. If you know what triggered the pain, work out a way to avoid that activity. Common sense means listening to the pain message. If the problem persists after six weeks of home treatment, see the doctor. And good luck.|`|V4BaRBtnaa	you are on the computer too much.

x15GsmEiaa	if it's painful bloating, it sounds like cramps from PMS.. whether you are on your period or about to start    ALTHOUGH, It sounds like you are bloated from other reasons (you would have stated that you are about to start your period or on it at the moment). Being bloated is not an unusual thing at all. This can happen to any women. When you retain water (this is the bloated feeling) you swell.    A prime example of this is pregnant women retain water all over their body.    To fix this the easy peasy way, all you need to do is up your water intake.    Also drink less soda as the fizziness could also be a cause of this.    Goodluck and i hope this helped :)|`|8bh0IGwJaa	Sounds like 1) Period cramps or period related symptoms  or 2) constipation (drink a cup of coffee)  or 3) digestive problems (try taking some digestive enzymes)|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Maybe you're getting very close to your period.

Complications of anorexia include:     - Death   - Anemia   - Heart problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure   - Bone loss, increasing risk of fractures later in life   - Lung problems resembling emphysema   - In females, absence of a period   - In males, decreased testosterone   - Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, bloating or nausea   - Electrolyte abnormalities, such as low blood potassium, sodium and chloride   - Kidney problems     If a person with anorexia becomes severely malnourished, every organ in the body can sustain damage, including the brain, heart and kidneys. This damage may not be fully reversible, even when the anorexia is under control. "    As for how long it takes...I don't think there is some magic amount of time.

5rsN7VsUaa	Kara,  I was exposed to toxic mold 5 years ago as well. I still have headaches to this day. Just yesterday i was at UCLA getting an MRI because of them. Toxic mold exposure can devastate your entire life, robs you of your health and belongings and destroys your relationships and steals your quality of life.     Also, if your re-exposed to toxic mold spores even in small amounts it can cause relapses in recovery from exposure, almost as severe as when you were living in that type of environment. Toxic mold spores will be on all your furniture from your old dwellings and will cross contaminate your new home. Unfortunately its highly likely your neurologists will adimintly deny its from toxic mold as the education on the effects of toxic mold on the brain is just not there yet despite plenty of evidence of its devastating effects and deaths it has caused thus far. You might want to be proactive in asking your Doc for anti fungal medication. lamisil pills are only $4 at walmart and have worked for me.  Please let me know if you need any more info/help  God Bless   Elias Garcia|`|AA11971271	Also have this doctor refer you to a pulmonologist as well.

If you are in school maybe you should talk to a nurse or guidance counselor or a teacher.  If you have anyone else around you that is an older peer that would listen and even help you talk to your mom you should contact them.  If you go to church, you can always talk to them too.  Try to find an adult that can help you if you can't talk to your mom.  Another good one would be a doctor.  I hope that helps.  I know how it feels to move to another state.  Its lonely.  As far as blaming yourself.  You aren't to blame.  My mom didn't have alot of money either when she was raising me and my sister but I got a job and helped her out every chance I could.  If your over 14 depending on the state you live in, try finding a job at a coffee place or something.

AA11080641	Are they on the top of your tongue, or on the underneath part? Canker sores can form on all the "soft" parts of your mouth - inner lips, cheeks, and the underside of your tongue - and they do have a tendency to form together, so if they're on the underside of your tongue, it's like canker sores and nothing to worry about. It's not unusual to get several at once, though it sure is pretty damn annoying.    If they don't go mostly away by about two weeks after they showed up, it'd be wise to see a doctor though - canker sores very rarely last more than a couple weeks. Try to pay attention to which are lasting though - while an individual sore will only last a couple weeks, multiple forming could mean that when one is disappearing, another is forming nearby, extending the time it takes until you're completely free of them.    For future prevention, try switching to a non-SLS toothpaste. I was skeptical about it, but I used to get multiple sores every couple weeks, but since switching to a non-SLS toothpaste I've only gotten 2 or 3, and those have been significantly less painful. I was skeptical that switching to a toothpaste without sodium lauryl sulfate would help, but it really did - just look at the ingredients on the sides of the boxes, only one or two actually don't have SLS.|`|iOWROvuxaa	Please let me know if you find out any more info on this.

J3iBuHAHaa	A lot of the times when you go all day without eating, it's because you're busy, nervous/excited (butterflies) , or have too much on your mind. Even if you don't feel the need to eat, you need to eat to give your body fuel for the day, help you think strait, and maintain a healthy body and weight. Ghrelin is the hormone produced when your body is saying it needs food. Your body may not be producing the right amount of Ghrelin, causing you not to have much of an appetite. I would ask my doctor about this if the problem progresses and you continure losing weight. Also, if you want food that witill help you gain weight and be healthy try eating more pastas, foods high in protien (steak, chicken, turkey), almonds and other mixed nuts, and try putting more cheese and dairy into your every day diet. Stay away from food that will make you gain unhealthy weight though such as rich pizza's, fast foods, and other things high in saturated fat, sugar, and perservatives.|`|Xxf5dA9jaa	As long as your not throwing up your food or starving yourself, you don't have an eating disorder.

I would suggest going to a doctor. There they can examine you, go into greater detail, and, if necessary recommend something. Here we cant even see rather or not you appear healthy or not. Go see a doctor, just a checkup; they should be able to answer that.    Warning, do not let them walk out the door or send you to someone else without giving you some sort of check up or at least a professional opinion. Doctors love to shift responsibility.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Do you feel that you need to control everything in your life? Do you ever binge and purge? How often do you weigh yourself? Do you skip meals because you are really busy, or because you feel that you need to lose weight?

Skipping meals is not good, and can end up messing up your metabolism for when you are older. I had an eating disorder when I was a teen, and today I have a lot of trouble with maintaining my weight.

8bh0IGwJaa	I don't quite understand what you are saying.  You started birth control 2 weeks after your period?  That is not really when you are supposed to start.    Regardless, all of this sounds normal.  You need to take birth control for at least 1 full month to let your body become adjusted and sometimes, it takes up to 3 months.     But, if you feel like you really must change, there are other kinds of birth control pills and maybe  you need a lower dose kind.    Ask your doctor for her advice and / or to change your script.

Yours already is, by definition, average.  It may grow more (I had a friend who had a growth spurt at 18 and added 2 inches), or it may not -- but it is already plenty big enough to do anything you need to do with it -- and to please any partner (female or gay male) that you try to pleasure.

I lost both testicles, and have a shorter penis from being sewed back on many times. I now have a penis implant but still have a penis!!

ILUYVQ0naa	No one can tell over the internet, it is prob nothing and you are just thinking about it because you learned about it the other day, in the medical professions you learn about all types of signs and symptoms of many diseases and thought out your life you may have generalized symptoms appear for you and can relate them to a disease but it doesn't mean you have this disease.

Have you been sick with a cold lately? If so then that could be one cause.  Do you have a history of asthma?  If neither of those pertain to you then you may have anxiety.  Many times if someone has anxiety it could feel like a heart attack.  No matter what the cause may be you should always go to your family doctor and get checked out, if you don't have a family doctor then you need to go to the local ER and get checked out.   You know your body better than anyone, so if you notice anything that doesn't seem right go get checked out.
5p7gpj36aa	I have taken old medication.... it won't hurt you.  It will either work or not work if it got too old.  They just slowly grow weaker and weaker in time.  The only way you would be hurt is if you really needed the meds like for your heart or something and they had already lost thier stregnth.    We just tried benedryll from 2003 last week!  It didn't work at all. :(      Edit:      I guess I could be totally wrong, the chemist says no, and I'd go with her!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Would you give it to your kids?    Take the advil that should help alleviate it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I wouldn't take it, it's probably out of date, and meds turn into other things when they are out of date, loose their potency and so on.    I too have a sinus problem going on. Take the advil, it will reduce the swelling, it's an anti inflammitory, and then gross as it is, make some warm salt water like you usually gargle with, put it into your mouth and tip your head down until it runs through your nose and into the sink. It is gross, yes, but it always works for me, and has the same effect of taking sudafed, only w/o the side effects (sudafed gives me the jitters)|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I wouldn't take it. I don't think that it would hurt you, but it's 2009...I don't think that it would help much either.|`|hCSuAhfjaa	I would avoid any medication that is more that 1 year old.  I have been told there could be a chemical change that in some cases can cause side effects.  You might take the advil and make a trip to the store for safety sake.|`|zdlLVB1Kaa	I wouldn't risk it.  The longer past the expiration date, the more the product degrades.  The degradates are what causes side effects.  It is also possible that the active ingredient would no longer be active.|`|vdIXzX4naa	No, don't use it. At best it won't work; at worst it could have decomposed and become dangerous.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I've heard tequila sometimes helps sinus issues... Have any of that?|`|aXnVFFUkaa	no i would not risk taking it as there is  reason why there is a use by date on
c71316f440c7c102ff8ab9c606b89e49aa	I quit, which pushed 2 of my friends to quit    Here is what I did:    1. Throw out all your cigs, lighters, ash trays, and all other paraphernalia  2. Don't buy any more cigs  3. Don't bum cigs off of people. I stopped going outside the bar to talk to people so to avoid these situations all together  4. Chew regular sugar free gum when ever your bored or feel an urge  5. Start a fitness program, even if its 10 push ups a day or a long walk  6. Don't indulge with a cig every now and then, if your going to quit you have to cut it out of your life 100%. No exceptions.  7. Explain to others that smoke that you've quit forever. Make sure they understand.         -You'll start to see how much stronger, less tierd, and healthy you look. Honestly my skin was so much clearer and my attitude was a lot better in the morning.|`|s6RPiUE8aa	just use gum, you don't need to prove your own willpower for this, just get off ciggys.    there will be other ways to test your will power|`|Y2lArpDvaa	Well you can come down to Rochester NH I will show you my Grandmother then that will make you want to stop smoking! For the love of God give it up, come on now!|`|La49JNrAaa	I wouldn't quit cold turkey. Its a lot harder than a gradual stop. Just take however many cigarettes you smoke a day and reduce the number slowly every few days or even once a week. eventually you'll get down to one a day and then one every few days and hopefully then you'll get to none. A thing my dad used to stop that may or may not work for you is that he would tell himself he would smoke later but "not right now". By using this technique, he kindof fooled himself mentally by just saying he was delaying the smoke, when really he would end up putting it off all day or at least most of it.   Hope these sugestions helped!!  Good Luck|`|oMaUESphaa	just do it.     i was addicted to cigarettes soo bad.  get rid of every lighter, and every cigarette you have.  let people know you're quitting, so they'll keep you in check.     i'm not gonna say its easy, but once you get past the physical withdrawal, it really isnt that hard.    also, work out on a regular basis.  the improvement in cardio and whatnot is crazy.  it'll really keep you motivated.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	Yes i did, i have quit twice just going cold turkey, i haven't smoked for eight months now and don't have any cravings now    Good Luck|`|syT3XUAraa	Very few people have any luck giving up cold turkey, and even strong will power may sometimes not be enough. Some people will recommend exercise, new hobbies, nicotine drugs, or even chewing gum. However, my grandmother smoked for nearly 50 years, sometimes going through two packs a day. Eventually she had a heart-attack. Thank God, she survived, but she was told that she had to quit her smoking habit. She tried nearly everything on the market. Everything from Nicorettes, Chantix, patches, etc., but eventually discovered the Grizzly Bear pouches, though she doesn't like spitting in a cup constantly. She thought that she would have to regardless though, until she heard about the new tobacco product from Camel: Camel SNUS. It's like pouches, but you can swallow the liquid. No smell, no spit cup, fewer health risks! She started using this product, and now recommends it to everyone. The official website is:  www.camelsnus.com/  If instead you want to remain tobacco-free, then you may have to use some sort of drugs, since quiting cold turkey is almost always doomed to fail. However, I have heard of some people managing it, so whatever you choose, don't give up. You're making a very good decision, and I hope whatever method you try will work for you. Good luck. ; )|`|Wbo0PEZaaa	yes|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Good luck....I'm right behind you.    People that quit cold turkey have a higher rate of staying smoke free than those that use drugs.    Stay busy and work out at the gym alot.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Im currently on day 6 of cold turkey and doing okay. You just have to take it a day at a time :)|`|IYu3bBFqaa	Here are a few tips, hope they help:    Try to make sure you are at a point in your life where stress is not a huge factor before even trying.  If  you are really stressed out you are setting yourself up for failure.      If you are in a household where you can make it a rule that there is no smoking in your house, that is a good start and get rid of all ash trays.  This will force you to have to step outside and think twice before lighting up.      Try to keep yourself relatively busy with activities that you do not relate to smoking, this will help keep your mind off of the cigarettes.    On the other hand, avoid activities that you relate to smoking, such as drinking.  You may also want to temporarily avoid friends and family that smoke, calling them up and telling them what you are trying to do and why you are avoiding them may be a good idea, you may get some extra support from them.  Smoking is social, that is why this is necessary.    Smoking can be an oral fixation, so when you do have the urge to smoke, try to keep healthy snack foods such as carrot sticks and celery sticks handy to munch on to perhaps deter the urge without gaining a lot of weight.  I hope this was some what informative Good luck.
g8U6NthEaa	no its not that normal-u guys are 20 years apart! thing is, she probably doesnt like u like that or anything, she is just old and probably doesnt have a husband to give it all to her, so she asks her son's friends....(she probably asks more people than just you.....) just make sure your friend doesnt find out about u guys having sex, or at least tell him before he finds out.....this could ruin your friendship-esp, if u guys are like best friends.....but, hey, if she doesn't have a husband, then who cares,  right??|`|p0dxIZeSaa	i think somebody is watching a little too much porn..|`|z5WbH7Yfaa	troll... and if not, then very odd for a 19 year old.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Its a sin to have sex with your friend's mum. His mum just want to have free sex with you. Think of what will happen if your friend finds out, will he be your best again? You better stop it now before he finds out or his father.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	That's a bad mom! You just lost a friend when he finds out and why would a mom put her son in that situation?

There is nothing you can do until you get the results.|`|AA11749193	It is only human nature to worry yourself sick.

AeeX1Wnkaa	Vesicare helps with the kind of bladder problems that cause you to feel like you need to pee all the time (urgency). It sounds like that part is getting better for you, but there could be other issues that cause leakage. Do you notice the leakage more when you sneeze, cough, or laugh? That's called stress incontinence. Have you tried doing daily Kegels (flexing your pelvic muscles, like you are trying to stop the flow of urine)? These help a lot with leakage. There are other medications that treat stress incontinence specifically, like Cymbalta (an antidepressant, but it works very well for this). Talk to your doc about this, and see if maybe he thinks you have stress incontinence as well.
EFYxcWNyaa	Call them and ask them what they are going to do on that day. I think they will want to talk with you more to get your agreement before they start anything. they will answer any question you might have and then when you are ready to start they will start.|`|aNnjH7L7aa	They will put the braces on OR you will have spacers. I didn't have spacers so im not sure
sEhHMKdZaa	Probably. It sounds like he got all that he needs to put the braces on. If you know how long the apt will be that can help you figure out if he will. Long apt means braces most likely. You can also just call him to double check.
Iq0JbKwPaa	dont worry about this its pretty common. once youve been lying down or sitting for a while, its easier for your heart to pump blood to your head and other areas of your body. if you get up too fast, your body has to work harder to get the blood up to your head, (thats why you black out for a little bit and feel dizzy). this happens more often in women than men|`|xKg0yovcaa	Could be low blood pressure - I sometimes get like that when I stand up too fast.|`|83ZqvqjUaa	sounds normal to me|`|pTbGI4sZaa	It could be something called postural hypotension, it might be a blood sugar issue, or it might be chronic low blood pressure.  You need to check with your doctor, and be sure to explain what is going on.  Make sure they check your blood pressure with you in different positions - lying down, sitting, and standing.|`|yuFH9FSRaa	i get this all the time! so does my mom...she said its just because we get up too fast..and it is harder to get the blood back to normal flow again. Try getting up slower, thats what she told me anyways, lol i havent tried it yet though..|`|CBfGXLvKaa	could be your not eating enough..Or that u have low blood sugar..I would discuss w/ a Dr.
iFTa9FqZaa	I assume you are pretty young, but I wanted to know young too so...  Basically you start off intimately kissing, and hopefully you are in a committed relationship where you've talked about sex, then it turns into making out, then some clothes come off and either the guy is hard (erection) or you 'help' him become hard, then he typically will put the condom on and insert it into the vag...a few minutes of pushing, typically an orgasm...then no energy and you fall asleep.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	You must be young.  The real answer is that the body cannot tell the difference between masturbation and actual sex.  Both allow the body to climax and there is no difference  between the two except that masturbation is 100% STD free, and Sex carries health risks.    From natures stand point masturbation both male and female versions are practice for the real event.  Little boys must practice what one day will be expected from them.  This same training is a must for females to lean as well.  Its just not talked about much.  Masturbation and sex topics often do not get the proper attention they deserve.     So if you get masturbation right then you know exactly what happens during the sex act.  Both have the very same resulting product.  One is just safer then the other.      This is your real answer.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	ask your parents they are the best person to tell you|`|Q27cXlGbaa	the penis goes in the vagina.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	if you dont know then im going to say your to young. But its different for everyone. it depends what u like|`|ru4wtKFsaa	You can go see Porn. It would be very self-explanatory after that.|`|SFoMSEpgaa	You are to young if your coming here asking things to that nature...go talk to mom!|`|JVnRyPQ8aa	simple the dude takes his penis, and puts it inside the vagina.|`|TryTZykqaa	you back cookies and give them to a boy you like
mdwyZpyHaa	You must drink fluids even if it hurts.    Take a pain reliever or suck hard candies or sore throat drops.  You may sip fluids if you have to to keep hydrated.     If your sore throat lasts longer than 48 hours especially if you have a fever and no nasal symptoms, go to the doctor for a strep screen.     Vaseline and A and D ointment can help with keeping your lips moist.|`|la3Y0QHiaa	vaseline,,, as.  a nurse I suggest you see a doctor. Youn may have strep infection. If not treated with the correct antibiotic strep throat leads to scarring of the mitral valves of the heart. Serious heart risks such as this can be life threatening. You can get irreversible heart damage. go to a free clinic if not insured. to find one call your local  hospital speak with social services.|`|j6MNHoozaa	Try that vicks vapo rub.

I know it sounds crazy, because parents are always so judgmental and make all of your problems about themselves, but they may help you talk things out.

Bgzq0K1Iaa	Clearly you were sucking too hard.  There isn't a treatment I shouldn't think, she'll just have to live with it for a few days.  Don't be so rough with her nipples next time, it's a sensitive area.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	you are being too rough.    Or maybe shes going to get her period.  Men, they are nipples not food.

ERP0L3i8aa	HI Blunes - Strange how Dr's cant find problems but addiction is weird. Its likely 2 hit you @ any time, withdrawal effects can last for years.|`|f0otK4zQaa	short answer is... from close family experience and scientific studies pot is known to be linked to many many mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts to name but a few. my dad who just stopped smoking it after 25 years has suffered with all of these symtoms whilst smoking it, and acute manic depression. once he stopped ( a month ago) his personality cahnged completley and he actually seems like a different person (not better or worse just very different) this is basicly a huge come down from years of drug abuse. but to answer your question yes this probbably wiil happen when you smoke and for a while after until the chemical imbalance from the pot wears off completley. hope this helps you
EodpVuqJaa	e-prescribing is electronic prescribing - ie physicians can write prescriptions electronically via computers and other portable electronic devices. e-prescribing systems are certified through SureScripts and you're going to want to make sure you chose one that is GoldRx certified.    which is the best one? thats a difficult answer and depends on your prescribing workflow. however from my research, it seems as though Rcopia from DrFirst seems to be the most flexible and widely utilized e-prescribing system. when looking for an e-prescribing system, be sure to find one that is truly electronic (GoldRx certified), is scalable (can communicate with any future changes in your office's IT solutions like upgrading to an EMR), one that does not pigeon-hole you into a particular EMR, incorporates your staff, and is truly flexible so that it can adapt to your prescribing style, instead of you adapting to the software's style.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	E-Prescribe is  Electronic Prescriptions. This is where a doctor sends the prescription electronically to a pharmacy instead of writing the prescription on paper.     I'm bias as to what is the best software because I work for Allscripts who owns a E-prescribe software.
Qd0sFMdHaa	your father's situation seems very similar to mine... i have had right hip and low back pain for some time now, plus pain in the bottom of my foot. i am going to have an mri soon and am currently in physical therapy, which i feel is helping. so try the physical therapy and yes, get a second opinion or even a third. you have the right to ask for additional/new doctors to review your dad's tests and to talk with him about the pain. if his doctor admits she's overwhelmed, then perhaps she is not the right doctor for him. i have to take pain medication, as well, and it does help, but it never makes the pain go away. the stretching and strengthening exercises, plus the massage of physical therapy has been helping me, though. so please, encourage your dad to try that. and get that second opinion, too--perhaps an orthopedist or neurosurgeon can tell what is going on. good luck to you and your father!
0rpN2419aa	Oh, I have had that too, and unfortunately got hooked on an anti anxiety drug.  It started impairing my memory, and concentration to the point that I am working on a withdrawal program with Dr. instructions.  I already feel better, but will be withdrawing for over a week tapering off.  I did research and found that there are vitamins that help with anxiety like Omega 3, manesium, and vitamin D.  I hope they work for me, along with going for a walk and getting more exercise, thinking positivly too.  I tried going cold turkey from the anti anxiety meds and it was absolutely terrible   I was like a puppet on a string and my arms, neck and legs were moving and twitching involuntarily.  If you do need meds, work very closely with your Dr. about the side effects and use the lowest possible dose that you can.  Do not get into the habit of using them every day like I did. (at night so I could sleep)  The pills were ruining my life, I couldn't drive in the afternoon, because I was so tired and anxious wanting that next pill so I could relax.|`|dQcPV4Rqaa	THAT IS PROBABLY NOT ANXIETY !!!!    YOU NEED TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR.....    GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE THEY GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS...|`|8goEkQ49aa	This could certainly be anxiety-related.  You simply must see your doctor about this, there is no other way to know for sure.  Hang in there!|`|QDQIvBveaa	You might has anxiety.   I have anxiety and its not fun  when i have an attack i feel like i cant breath.  But i also has a rele bad feeling in the pit of my stomach like im going to be sick.   If you worry about things constienly and feel like crying like you cant do anything like your going to die, anything lik that you might have anxiety|`|FIALhwlKaa	If you would have panic attacks you dont have this all the time. Normally it will get better after a couple of minutes. Anxienty could be more the reason. I ask myself... if you have this now for ten years, why did you never talk to a doc about it? There are good medications against those kind of stuff. It also could be something different, so let yourself get checked from your doc.
x15GsmEiaa	VERY close to getting it    Pre-menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a common condition affecting up to 75 percent of women. PMS symptoms vary widely and typically occur up to 14 days before the menstrual period and generally cease within a day of its arrival. Many side effects of PMS, such as such as food cravings, bloating, sore breasts, headaches, stomach ache and irritability can be alleviated by proper diet and nutrition.    I would use a panty liner so you are more confident and aren't as shocked when it does come.. (and don't get your underwear FULL of blood when you at school or out and about).    Congrats! You are a woman now...!|`|CHCPnvksaa	It's possible but there is no way to tell for sure. My daughter has been going through the same exact thing for months, and still no period. Personally, I had no tell-tale signs that it was coming, it just showed up one day. So everyone is different. You might want to start wearing panty liners everyday just in case. And you'll probably be about 14 or 15 before your boobs round out. If you're comfortable talking about that stuff with your mom, she's the best one to go to, since there's a 50% chance that you have her body.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	congrats youve hit puberty .   and no one can tell you when anything happens .. its all up to your hormones . your too young to be worrying about anything , especially boobs .|`|6qsocyK3aa	Sounds like you could be if you have all those symtoms but if you don't, you're not abnormal or anything. Some don't get theirs until they're 17 so you have plenty of time. Your boobs will get rounder when your body wants them to, it's as simple as that.
5nfqY9T7aa	Maybe it's a PH imbalance?  It can happen after intercourse, or after your period, or if you douche.  Try using those "rePHresh" feminine wipes.|`|z7ivcj8Maa	NORMAL VAGINAL DISCHARGE - All women have some vaginal discharge. Normal discharge may appear clear, cloudy white, and/or yellowish when dry on clothing. It may also contain white flecks and at times may be thin and stringy. Changes in normal discharge can occur for many reasons, including menstrual cycle, emotional stressors, nutritional status, pregnancy, usage of medications - including birth control pills, and sexual arousal.    SIGNS OF ABNORMAL DISCHARGE - Any changes in color or amount of discharge may be a sign of a vaginal infection. Vaginal infections are very common; most women will experience some form of a vaginal infection in their lifetime. If you experience any of the symptoms below, this may be a sign of vaginal infection:    Discharge accompanied by itching, rash or soreness   Persistent, increased discharge   Burning on skin during urination   White, clumpy discharge (somewhat like cottage cheese)   Grey/white or yellow/green discharge with a foul odor     hope this helps if not i also gave you the link|`|Pn8SATLuaa	OMG, i just vomited
H0aiDO9Paa	Peripheral neuropathy, can have a number of causes. Probably the most common is mechanical pressure on a nerve. Under compression, the first nerve fibers to lose function are the ones that conduct sensation. As the sensory fibers "go to sleep," the first signal perceived is the familiar "pins-and-needles" tingling sensation. And good luck.|`|ipqH3UcWaa	yeah but only once in  a while|`|PyUDK9IGaa	once when i got fire from my job|`|7VfWz7zyaa	My friend has that.|`|VyrabmsIaa	they burn and tingle expecially at night right or when u wake up? mine sometimes do i work in construction and mine do that from the vibrations i get from my hammer and other vibrating tools. Its because your tendons get tight and constrict your viens not letting enough blood get to your hands and fingers or you have carpotunel same thing but you might need an operation for that.|`|uoMEFT4kaa	yes. it turned out to be carpal tunnel. my friend has neuropathy....that is feeling an injury or result of pinching in one area (your extremities) that begins from another part of your body (stressed neck)...etc..poor circulation (caused by a variety of reasons) could be the culprit.  Get your doc to take a look.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	No sure don't.|`|fdP9UJOsaa	Yea, but only when my hands are numb from the cold... then when i finally get warm the tingle arrives.  sorry to hear about your hands, if it occurs try seeing a doctor    feel better soon :-)
aQ8o4w3Xaa	If you're bleeding, it's your period.   Get some pads and wait it out. As it's your first, it will be over soon and will most likely be very light. That's why you're in some doubt because there isn't much blood. In a few years, you'll balance out and get into a regular cycle. Up until then, it's bound to be on/off. You may go a month without, or you may get 2 in one month. It's nothing to worry about, just your body adjusting to itself.    Good luck!  :)|`|0SIhrYCbaa	How old are you? its your period sweetie, sorry.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	you have your period ..  get some pads ,  and it usually starts out light , and for the first few months alot of people dont get mood swings .|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	Sweetie that is a period welcome to woman hood!|`|SNTbvo7Daa	well it sounds like UR period to me. IF U have had some cramps or leg hair, pubic hair, armpit hair, breast buds, and white discharge  for a little while U've probably started or very close to UR period.I am not saying if U've had ALL OF  these U started UR period, but just a few would even do it. talk to UR mom  and ask her some questions. U'll be fine. I am getting through puberty too, but i have learned  a lot about it.|`|89Qejqx0aa	Ya ur probably getting Your period.....

lFqUMMAGaa	My first bit of advise is don't listen to nasty replies or take them to heart ~ Second I think you need to seek good medical advice so I suggest you try having a talk to your GP and asking for his/her help ~ also talk to your family and friends and try and enlist their help and support ~  The sooner you get help the better GOOD LUCK|`|Z6ZJTj8laa	talk to some one asap you need some help, before this gets hold of you. please do something,|`|a0v3q3J4aa	Just don't  It's so not worth it. I've been there and done that and it has severely ruined my metabolism and screwed up my stomach.   You will actually gain weight when you do decide to eat because the body will store all fats thinking it's not going to get any more for a long time|`|5WhvFZOhaa	Well I am going to give you advice to why you should not be that way. You open your body to susceptible problems because your immune system will loose its strength without the nutrients your body normally consumes. You will loose alot of weight which is very unhealthy. Its not a healthy idea.|`|8goEkQ49aa	Please see a doctor.  Fast.    People with eating disorders usually have a very distorted body-image.  You look at your ordinary and beautiful body and see fat, where the rest of us see a fine and healthy person.  It takes a long time to get over this, especially because you have to eat even though  you may not want to -- in order to remain healthy.    Be very tender and good to yourself, but see your doctor before you do some harm to yourself.|`|WpH9zProaa	There are many reasons not to. I have listed some below. The problem with society today is it makes everyone think they should look like what the girls do on tv. That isn't the case.... Women come in different shapes and sizes and men love them all! You should be happy with yourself and embrace who you are. Nothing is sexier than a confident women. You can diet and exercises in a healthy way. Anorexia or Bulimia is not the right way. Nip it in the butt, before it gets really bad. I think you have already done the first step in admitting you have a problem and second trying to get help. Good luck!    Loss of menstrual periods   Lack of energy and weakness   Feeling cold all the time   Dry, yellowish skin    Constipation and abdominal pain   Restlessness and insomnia   Dizziness, fainting, and headaches   Growth of fine hair all over the body and face|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Heres one: dont do it.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	you will get better results using a micro or macrobiotic diet with 30 minutes on a stationary bike 6 days a week with weight lifting and yoga. here is why: when you fast you lose muscle mass so you burn less calories and if you fast too long your body will take calcium and protein from your bones and Internal organs (heart) making your body even more fragile / weaker ( more likely to be injured in an accident ). if you use a micro-biotic diet: 50% grains - brown rice, barley, oat meal. 30% colorful vegetables - baby carrots, broccoli, spinach, bell peppers,.. 10% fruit - strawberries, blueberries, watermelon,.. 10% protein - lean beef, white fish,.. and do yoga you will lose weight what ever weight your body doesn't need while you build and tone what muscle you do have. you also need a certain amount of fat in you diet to maintain a regular period so cook with olive oil. drink bottles water before bed. avoid sugar, dairy, white bleached rice and bread, and poultry.
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, the medication could be having an effect on your periods but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
C3DSUacAaa	Friedrich's Ataxia is a neuromuscular degenerative disease. I would not consider it a learning disability, as the only impairments to learning would be motor or sensory (hearing and visual impairment, lack of coordination), not neurological.    If you want a lesser known learning disability, try dysgraphia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia] or other articles from the list of learning disabilities [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Le... If you'd rather a syndrome of which one of the symptoms is learning impairment, try something on the autism spectrum [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Pe... Good luck!
Yn6pM2Xyaa	youll be just fine, the dentist will prescribe some pain meds for afterwards and just make sure to take some time off of school and or work and have someone around for the first 24 hours to baby you.  if you are a smoker you might want to consider getting some patches to tide you through the healing process and stock up on some soft food for the first few meals.  Honestly though for most people it is really not a big deal other than general sucky discomfort.|`|NDkbZlBwaa	It really isn't as bad as everyone says for the most part I had all four of mine done a couple years ago and it didn't hurt much after wards but your cheeks will probably get really swollen and there will be some bruising they will probably give you some type of pain killers after you have them out just make sure you eat something before you take them otherwise you might be sick.  For a few days you probably won't be able to eat very much, you will probably have to stick with soft foods like yogurt, pudding, jello, mashed potatoes, soup, ice cream but then you'll be back to normal!|`|M85Dn5Ccaa	I had all 4 of mine out January 29th, 2009.  I still look like a chipmunk and I lost feeling in my bottom lip and chin.  The doctor said I will get it back, however he doesn't know if it will take days, weeks or months!  So unless you HAVE to have your wisdom teeth out, don't.  This is the worst surgery I have had.|`|FIALhwlKaa	You get all 4 done at the same day??? In Germany they wont do that cause it might happen that it will get swollen. The most they will pull out on one day is 2! Dont let them do it without any narcotic... at least a local narcotic you will need! It doesnt mean to be a baby when someone is scared about going to a dentist.
c68nVKIYaa	Any profession that requires you to put a strain on your back by leaning over or shifting your weight into unusual positions all day is probably going to cause you discomfort, or back pain. I have scoliosis myself, have taken massage classes and been massaged numerous times by pros. I can see that my back would just kill me if I did that for hours a day. It feels much better to lie prone and have the masseur or masseuse do their thing on my back -- LOL.    That being said, there are things you can do to strengthen your back and to improve your posture. Which would be a good idea anyway. Work with a strength trainer on general conditioning (your arms and hands will need to be strong, too) and on the lumbar back. There are lumbar flexion-extension machines at some gyms and chiropractic offices that can build back strength very rapidly. But be very careful because your scoliotic back is twisted out of normal shape, so a machine designed for symmetric back muscles may strengthen the already too-strong side if you sit straight on it. The person supervising needs to know you have scoliosis and how to prescribe exercises for the weak-side muscles of your back and elsewhere.    There is a German system of specialized physiotherapy called the Schroth method that has a long track record of improving scoliotic posture with targeted asymmetric exercises. Particularly if you're younger (teens or twenties) and your curves are not too bad, it can reverse the abnormal rotation if you find a good therapist and apply yourself. For more info see:|`|NwiJ1MBUaa	I have a friend who chose to be a professional standing on her feet all day with scoliosis.  It hurts her, but she has made it through her career ok.  You may experience more pain than a therapist without this problem, so it depends on what you want to do with your life.  You could choose to specialize in foot or hand reflexology that might be easier on you than full body massage.    Good luck.|`|DhZ67kgoaa	Most people have scoliosis to some degree.  It all really depends on how you keep yourself in alignment.  There are many types of massage that work with that effectively.    You will be ok if you think you are ok.     Any job you take will put a strain on your body - sitting at a desk, standing at a counter - whatever you do.|`|8WYWEDOpaa	You didn't say how old you are or how many degrees your curve is.      If your curve stays under 30 degrees when you're done growing, it will probably never get worse.  If your curve is over 30 degrees, your curve may increase even after you're done growing.  Why does this matter?  The larger the curve, the more staying on your feet or bending over a table stresses your back.  Even then you can probably see a pain management doctor.  If you ever get to the point where doing Massage starts hurting, you can work with the pain doc, to get meds that make it possible to have Massage as your profession.    One thing that will help, though, is to keep active or do exercises to strengthen your core muscles.  By keeping your muscles strong, your pain can be reduced.  I don't want to say your pain will go away, but if it does, great!    Email me if you have other questions.|`|xRvetiAMaa	Consider learning Bowen Therapy instead of Massage. It's not as demanding & pays well. Checkout www.totlhealth.com for advice & ideas. Just helping a doc be rid of an ache in seconds & you'll have a busy practice!    Eventually scoliosis will cause more trouble if not corrected. Prolotherapy can help scoliosis. See my article:  http://www.totlhealth.com/painrelief.htm...    If you decide on Bowen, come back & tell me how you're doing! :)

AA11678263	It really depends how you seek help.  If you seek help via the Gp they will usually decide what best to do to help you.  They may refer you to a counsellor or therapist, may offer you medication, or if they deem these issue to be complex, and numerous, they may refer you to the community mental health team (CMHT) or a psychiatrist, who will assess you and decide whether you require a formal diagnosis, and what further support should be offered.  It may be that you receive a dual-diagnosis, it may be that all of these things can be accredited to one thing, or it may be that they do not give you a diagnosis, but treat you anyway.  Either way, it looks like you could do with some support.  In the meantime, if there is a waiting list for a referral, you may wish to utilise your university counsellor.  They can be amazing.|`|p5oRMt9Saa	Well are you talking about yourself? Have you or this person seeked help and found that it hasn't worked?

UsH20vSAaa	Hi,    It can be painful especially the first couple of days.  They did not give me a shot to numb me because the actual putting on of the braces does not hurt.  It is just getting used to them.  I had some soreness every time I had mine adjusted but nothing major.  You will probably want to eat soft foods the first couple of days that you have them because it tends to hurt to chew.   You can also take something like Advil or Tylenol to help with inflammation and pain.|`|qq159sWMaa	Okay well for me braces wasn't all that bad, they put spacers in and on occasion you'll have bracket come loose or fall off but that just means you go in and they fix it. I never got a numbness shot, not sure why you would need one.  It hurts the most when you go into get them tightened or new elastics are put on... I suggest advil before those appointments.  I had my braces on from the week of halloween in 2000 till January 2005.  My half sister (who is much older might I add) had invisalign and said it was not as great as ppl said because they are difficult to take off when you are trying to eat and drink.|`|lv7IhkoNaa	Don't be afraid sorry no you dont get a numbness shot and you have to taste this very nasty glue my advice hold you tounge UP. Also you could try putting wax on the part of metal that poke your skin. I'm not trying to say anything bad but i had braces I chew gum alot and nothing ever happend to me and the gum helped me. You could try using stuff for sores. Lastly you have a choice between what type of braces you get the ones with a straight line take longer and make your teeth look yellow but you cant barly see them or the otheres ones you can see work faster.|`|SJM1f87Waa	usually the numbness shot doesn't hurt, it's uncomfortable but doesn't hurt. I thought the part that hurt the most was putting the caps on the back of your teeth for the braces..I had mine on for only a year. Bad about getting braces is that everything gets stuck in them and it's hard to chew gum, good = teeth get straight quick. Invisilign ruins the enamal on your teeth, i wouldn't recommend doing that

qq159sWMaa	From personal experience it does hurt more but that's because when first getting a piercing or tattoo you are hyped up thinking that it's going to be the most painful experience you'll ever go through so it doesn't.  When you go to re pierce or get another one you already know what it's like so you aren't all worked up causing it to be a little more painful because your guard is down.    ...

ParFJxnSaa	A previous answer follows: There is advice on recurring dreams & nightmares in section 3, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris. Remember the troubling nightmare in as much detail as you can. Create a scenario in which you manage to prevail. "Tonight, in my dreams, I want to confront the ???/call on a dream ally for help". Write down your chosen form on a piece of paper, at least 3 times, and repeat 3 times aloud, after lights out, and visualise yourself doing it, as vividly as you can, and WANT TO DO IT!!!, with all the desire you can muster, to better communicate this concept to your subconscious mind, through imagery & emotional intensity, so it understands that this is important. Place the piece of paper under your pillow (metaphorically "sleeping on it"). Your subconscious existed before you could walk, or talk. It knows images, muscles/movement, and emotions: communicate with it in terms it can understand.      It doesn't understand negatives. When dreaming, try calling for assistance from a dream character - anyone, alive or long since passed on, even your favorite superhero is available to provide assistance, in the dreamstate. You can even try the technique of "dream re-entry", and use your new solution in that exact same situation. Try the above for 2 - 3 weeks; I believe there is a good chance they will work. Options, for later, if you are in the 40% of those who are fairly suggestible (not free) are hypnotherapy, (Stop Recurring Nightmares - Recurring Nightmare Hypnosis Download  http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/downloa... or professional hypnotherapy, or Neuro Linguistic Programming - NLP therapy. In dream analysis, we are taught that each character inhabiting a dream represents some part of us. It is an axiom that the sole judge of the interpretation of any dream/nightmare is the person who dreamt it. If the nightmare doesn't respond to the above, after a few weeks of trying that technique every night; then it is time to look deeper for the cause.      If you can't remember your nightmare, it may well have been a night terror; The subject is addressed in section 3, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris on pages J & N. "Night terror is a parasomnia disorder characterised by extreme terror and a temporary inability to regain full consciousness. The subject wakes abruptly from slow-wave sleep, with waking usually accompanied by gasping, moaning, or screaming. It is often impossible to fully awaken the person, and after the episode the subject normally settles back to sleep without waking. A night terror can rarely be recalled by the subject. They typically occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep. There's no definitive way to prevent night terrors because no one knows exactly what causes them. What is known is that, on their own, night terrors do not mean a person has a psychological problem or is even upset about something. Night terrors can result from an erratic or insufficient sleep schedule or any type of sleep deprivation.      Solving any other sleep problems you have (such as getting up in the middle of the night) and making sure sthat person has a regular bedtime with a calming routine and gets enough hours of sleep can help ward off night terrors. In certain cases, night terrors can be triggered by sleep apn(o)ea, a serious, but correctable disorder in which enlarged tonsils and adenoids (normal tissue in the throat) block airway passages during sleep, making it difficult to breathe and prompting them to be partially awake." Never try to awaken people suffering from true night terrors (as opposed to nightmares; ways of differentiating the two may be viewed in section 3, at ezy-build ) as they may become violent, particularly males.|`|qm6jJjoOaa	Chances are, if it was that bad of a dream, you probably wouldnt want to remember it.|`|NJhXW72Yaa	If you remember your dream, then you did not sleep well.|`|LPtUJ5p5aa	Keep a dream journal.     In the first few seconds after you wake up, you will remember certain parts of your dreams. The longer you wait, the more you will forget.    Dream journals help with trying to figure out patterns in your dreams, but also, if you look back at what you wrote down earlier in the day, it may trigger further memories of that dream.|`|ovbBEJfMaa	i dont think its possible to remember a dream.  yo should keep a dream journal and as soon as you wake up write what you remember  you might see a pattern
ZF8zu2ehaa	Technically, the defintion would be after penile injection.|`|3BrOSZujaa	well, I was stupid and half did that at 7 but that dosn't count. Did you have your period at the time if you did then your cooked, if not your a virgin!    Hope i helped|`|4BBjhHAnaa	11 was too young, IMO.    If there was no penetration, *technically* you are a virgin.    But it is up to you to decide whether or not to consider yourself a virgin.  If you know how to handle yourself in bed, I would say you aren't.|`|lYr1zmQeaa	thats not physically possible|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	if there was no vaginal penetration yes your still a virgin|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Hey Kimmy,     A virgin is someone who is chaste and doesn't engage in sexual relations. Even if you haven't been with a guy, and haven't been chaste. You can figure it out from there.|`|h7uHcpBhaa	hows that possible? having sex with a girl? and how is it possible that you had sex with a girl but ur still not gay or bi? oh i seee...ur lesbian...|`|JVnRyPQ8aa	no more virgin...|`|ru4wtKFsaa	You might be gay or bi when you DID IT WITH A GIRL.   Not that I have anything against that. But I would say you're not a virgen .|`|Q27cXlGbaa	technically you are still a virgin. a girl cant penetrate you to brake the lining. and if you had sex with a girl your gay or bi.|`|ygELhfO6aa	It depends on how you define virgin. I personally believe that one loses their virginity the first time they have sex, whether there was penetration or not. So therefore, you are not a virgin. However, some believe that you lose your virginity when you break your hymen. Those people would consider you a virgin.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	sex is sex so no your not a virgin and im going to say that yeah you r gay or bi because u did it with a girl and why did u do it so young|`|qesIBFcHaa	nope your not a virgin. what were you doing? sexually experimenting? i am a girl and i would never touch a girl.|`|fv7uOe3kaa	well 1stly we are sisters in sex lives...i aint found male able to adore me even after letting them lust me for weeks some months.lol.small ***** can even bore me .lol...my first was 11 too last was 5 hrs ago she asleep 3ft from me now.lol.ive had sometimes 5-6 girls in one day babe.lol...ok once 5 once 6.lol.but im wishin daily i swear ...i fall for 8 out of 10 gals i meet u know...once i see the look in their eyes as they undress me from afar...******' love it ....oops shhh did i say that out aloud om|`|nDPvaojNaa	you are not a virgin, sex is sex, it doesn't matter who its with|`|HqahOwoMaa	yes, thats a virgin.|`|UQ7IsLVWaa	11 whoa! idt doing it w/ a girl counts.|`|SuuIPFn2aa	I know i am not a lady but i thought i would try and help answer. So the short answer is probably no, assuming that your hymen is no longer intact. But if your hymen is still intact then you technically are still a virgin. I would personally call you a virgin though but that is because of my own personal beliefs.|`|Ue2Ly7Q8aa	You still are a virgin. The only way you are not is if your cherry was popped. If you like guys and girls then you are gay. Experiment and have fun!!!!!
r8M4CRoTaa	What I do is have my computer read books to me with its voice synthesizer. I used to read actual books, but the benefit of listening to the computer is you can turn off the light and close your eyes. It's a nice monotonous sound, puts me right to sleep. Audio books might also work.|`|AA10822361	seriously  pamelor and ambien together might help|`|rVnTnuU1aa	Sleep 2 sold at Walgreen's. I can stay up for days at a time but this helps me.    Television turned on low. Nothing interesting though, that will just keep you awake.    I work out for a 30 min in the evenings and then i take a hot shower to relax a bit.    No caffeine after 6 pm also. This helps.    When you get ready for bed and close your eyes try to think of things that you need to redo in your house. For some odd reason, when i close my eyes and think of that stuff i go to sleep much faster than when im thinking of everything stressful in the day. That just keeps me awake.    Put something over your alarm clock so you cant keep watching the time.     Most importantly- dont think about your troubles sleeping when getting ready for bed. This will just keep you awake more than anything.    I hope this stuff helps some and good luck :)|`|meHwFnQ1aa	Well make sure not to drink caffeine past 12:00 PM. Also if you have a lot of stress and are busy a lot try and cut down on things... Take some time to relax.. Insomnia is often caused from to much stress.|`|AA10011095	1)  No caffiene or alcohol at all  2)  No food 2 hours before bed time  3)  No TV or computer 1 hour before bed time  4)  Exercise at least 1/2 hour during the day.  5)  If you don't fall asleep in 30 minutes, stay up for another 30 minutes, walk around, etc...    This will work.  It almost always does.|`|rDly6CVOaa	man, i know this may sound gross, but put milk in a pot, boil it or at least make it mad warm.... drink it... don't burn yourself.... it'll put you out. Freud says it's a rememberance of your mothers breast milk... you'll fall asleep like a baby. I promise.
MSfsg9dBaa	YES! you're doing great. But don't get too carried away, you wouldn't want to get unhealthy. good job on eating so much protein, fruits and veggies. You'll be thin in no time!     oh and another thing -- you don't say anything about what you're drinking. Some good things to drink while trying to lose weight are ice water and green tea (they speed up the metabolism). Stay away from sodas (yes, even diet) and maybe drink a little bit fruit juice with dinner but don't drink a lot of juice because it has a lot of calories    GOOD LUCK! I know you can do it :)|`|IeOeYOJ3aa	hmm well it would take a long while to calculate the number of calories you eat in a day and I'm too lazy to do that. But the important thing is that you know that to lose weight, you need to decrease the number of calories your body takes in. To reduce the number of calories your body takes in you need to know how many calories you should be eating each day. That would be your BMR. I did it for you and it says you should be eating around 3165 calories a day.   I'm guessing but from your description it sounds like your probably eating around 2000 calories a day?  Your body needs those 3165 calories so that you can do whatever it is you do in a typical day. Since your body is not getting all those calories from the food you eat, then it will be forced to get it from the fat stored in you body and use that as energy.  There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat, so since your eating around 2000 calories a day, that's 1000 calories a day that you're losing in fat. Multiply that by seven (days in a week) and you'll get 7000 calories that you're losing in fat. Or roughly 2 pounds that you're losing in a week. Don't try to go any further since then you'd be starving yourself.   The fact that you're getting an hour of exercise is great since the best healthy way to lose weight is with diet AND exercise. However your body does need to rest so try to only exercise five days a week. Or not so much every day.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Based on that menu, you're eating too little. You will lose and then stall. I am assuming you are female, you need a minimum of 1200 calories a day if you did no exercise. Your eating frequency is great, that will keep your metabolism revved. You could safety eat 1500-1800 calories a day and still lose with the exercise.|`|4CsGde1qaa	You seem to know EXACTLY what you do in your daily diet life. You are doing fine, but try not to think too much about how small you need to eat, just increase your exercise level more and more.
F3Dhlzedaa	i will be honest it depends on how tight the bands around ur back teeth are. my bands were to tight so my gums grew over them (we didnt know till they took it out) so they just use a clamper thing to pull it of ur teeth. since mine were so tight they pulled some of my gums of to. other than that it wasnt bad it feels weird when  they take the bottom part of and u dont have the bar under ur tonge(right behind ur teeth) and my jaw started hurting a few days after because it had to get used to the pressure.
LlMS9NsSaa	Could be.
lmcxefEgaa	It's perfectly fine to care for your parents family and even friends, that reflects on your character and how you react to everyone else. It shows that you are a caring and loving person. But, you do have to realize that yes, people do pass away, it's life, that's just how it works.    Being the youngest in the family should not make a difference, to each his own, and you just happen to care for other people's life. Maybe you could become a nurse or a doctor, you certainly have the passion for it.    I do know it is tough when others pass away, and there is nothing you can do about it, but you should not dwell on what you could have said, you need to think about what you have said and have done for that other person. You need to cherish the time that you had with that person.    Don't think negatively every time you say goodbye to your parents and walk out the door each morning. Thinking that way will do nothing good for your well being. What you should do is anticipate coming home to your parents each night. They will always love you, and they know you will always love them, just try and be happy. :)|`|rtIS8mdtaa	this sounds pretty normal, but maybe getting help will make you feel better, or talk with someone about it with someone, thats not a stranger like you are doing now. But i think your fine. I've gotten those feelings before, like sometimes i keep on saying good night to my parents frequently at night because im afraid i wont ever see them. but it will get better later on|`|yBrKP2sFaa	This could be demonic. Pray.|`|wOsxpIjYaa	Um get help now!!!|`|ovbBEJfMaa	Well, its normal.  For starters.  its just something you have to live with.  Of course its probably a phobia.  And if you want to get ri of it, you have to overcome it|`|PmG0Isnnaa	If you have had people close to you pass away, it is understandable that you would be afraid of that happening to others.  However, if this is constant and doesn't go away, that could become an unhealthy paranoia.  I would talk to a counslor about your fears.|`|f37A7esiaa	Well actually, I am the youngest too, and I find myself hoping I die before my parents or siblings because I don't want to deal with it. It may sound depressing, but it makes sense to me. I've never dealt with a death (other than 2 small pets) so I don't know if this relates to you. And I also enjoy all my time and it's also on my mind. If I'm away from home for a while I think I won't see them again. I'd prefer to die over them... I don't really care if I die... I mean, I don't want to, but I think you get it.|`|AA11523164	its normal it is just a phobia. everyone has them :)|`|g7WZnT8Kaa	its ok that you are scared to see people go because they are people you love....dont let this ruin your life....if you focus all ur energy negitivly on dieing that will happen...so think positive...live life to the fullest...instead of wasting time thinking of death use your time to appreciate the people around you.|`|8qQ2vHscaa	Not kidding, i would go see a therapist.  They know how to help much better then the people on Yahoo! answers do.  I sometimes do get scared like you do, and keep my phone- on -with me at all times.  I don't end up crying, but everyone lets their imagination run away once and a while.    It's okay! You should enjoy life and your time with these people while you have it.  Nothing is going to happen to your family while your in another room or at school.  You don't want the only thing you remember with them is being scared that the only time you spend with them is their last minutes on Earth, and that's not the case.    Honestly, take some tums, advil, and call a therapist.  They seriously do help, a lot.  Trust me.|`|vp8N2lcXaa	i have this same problem..i always tell my mom and siblings that i love them every day, it is normal but you should probably talk to a counsleor about it. I have to overcome my fears too...dont worry. Pray to God and ask him for help...he is my source!! =D|`|N4A3pKStaa	Sounds like you are being overly sensitive. Get over your fear of death and stop worrying about it. Yes, its true you can die at any minute and so can anyone else.    You don't have any control over death, so stop worrying about it. If someone you love does die it is okay to feel sad for them and miss them. However, to constantly feel sad and worry about someone you love possibly dying is not okay at all. It is self torture. You're creating your own problem.     Let go of your fears and worries.
xMl18FU8aa	Not much, just follow your pre op instructions very carefully.      Most likely braces will be placed prior to surgery.  Jaws can be wired shut for a few weeks post op.  Then braces until your new bite is corrected.
Y2lArpDvaa	OK I think you need to go see your doctor for a swolling evaluation, I wouldn't take this lightly, go get it checked out ASAP!|`|XmD61yBpaa	mild throat infection|`|3J3cNZpZaa	Inflamed tounsils. Take cold meds and chew your food really well . .you should be fine . ..See a doc if that doesn;t fix it.
syT3XUAraa	Mine does the same thing. It's normal for older people. Maybe you can use some Beano.|`|1jS20kGdaa	Tell her to go to the doctor and get it checked out. Or get her some prevasid i think it's called. Tell her to Drink pepto bismo too! Sorry it must be ambaressing|`|0WOvEw2Daa	BBBEAAAAAAAANOOOOOOOO, there will be-no gas, get it? =D|`|XmD61yBpaa	buy her some bicarbonate of soda|`|73458eadba0f98a5aadf5ddb0b5dc1ceaa	Tell that woman to drink some water! She could carry a bottle with her.
8d4101bd2f19e36c261644a3bb9e609aaa	There is no way to get rid of a cold fast. Try hot showers, drink plenty of water to avoid you dehydrating. The average cold is usually gone within a week. You may also want to avoid others who are sick.|`|UMRk2PoDaa	U can't but you can blow or cough up mucus so it doesn't get worse or last long.   And night quil & day quil
