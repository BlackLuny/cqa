20090226192955AAGyfN3	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How can I convince my fiancee to move with me?	I am a certified teacher--without a teaching job.  I badly would like to move out to Las Vegas--where teaching jobs are abundant, and the weather is much nicer.  However, my fiancee doesn't care for the idea.  She says it'll be too far away from family.  I've tried to compromise the idea that the move will only be until I get enough experience teaching that I'm more hirable in the nepotistic PA teaching system, but she really doesn't seem to move.  She says I can move if I like, but I don't want to leave her--still I'm tired of working subpar jobs that don't pay well, and have little future.  What should I do?

My partner and I usually start off the night curled up together either spooning or with me laying my head on his chest.

Ok I know I've asked this question before but a lot of people said no he doesn't like you but there have been more signs that he does.   Here are the examples:      1. In drama we are performing a midsummer nights dream and my teacher put me on his list to audition for titania and immediatly he said "I want to be the donkey!" (titania falls in love with the donkey)   2. He kept doing these funny dance moves infront of me and I laughed and so did he   3. He showed me these pictures he drew and asked if I liked them before he showed them to his best friend   4. He flirts with me sometimes   5. He told me this story of how he punched a kid (I thought he MIGHT be trying to impress me?)    6. 2 months ago we were choosing seats and he sat next to me   7. we always talk alot and he asked me to be his friend on facebook      Thanks please tell me if you think he might like me or if he is just being friendly

I've heard they're super expensive, but then I also heard they can be very reasonable.   I love the idea of just using roses in my bouquets and centerpieces.  I want to use different shades of pink roses      I know prices vary from area to area, but in general, how much do roses cost?   I would need one bouquet for the bride (about 25 roses) and then 4 smaller bouquets (about 12-15 roses each).

20090226195435AAs6vwc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls fear me or do i fear them?	Myself: Like im sort of a loner at school, im shy, but i must admit that i might act weird and random sometimes. Im not the show off guy who has plenty of chicks surrounding him everyday as you could read from my question. I listen to heavy metal music, and do whatever i have to do. The fact is, ive never had a gf, and i wonder if having one in 9th grade is ok. BUT, girls always felt the same way about me (and i think i am pretty sure of it) - Tall dude with no life, who makes dumb jokes and is annoying. For some reason, ive never really had the guts to ask a girl out because of the fear of getting rejected like i was in elemantary school, yet again, in high school. Why im asking is because i am aware that puberty might hit some girls or guys later than planned. I also dont have the feeling that girls might be looking after me. So, can anyone help me how to approach a girl? Or do anything?

One day I was joking around with her and she got mad and went rambo on me..she left me..stop texting me and everything.

We also decided to take all the same classes..so we are in every class--which sucks! Oh and when i mean joke with her i just mean that i say stuff like "Stop being so slow lets go, you should have been did you stuff"...its not mean joking so yeah she gets defensive!      I just keep thinking about it..i dont know what to do. any help or advice would be great??

20090226201912AA3pDst	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and a girl love each other, except that she wants to remain celibate for life, please help.?	Basically, this girl is in love with me, and I am in love with her, we are both 21.  However, she wants to remain celibate for life for religious reasons.  She wants to get married, but remain celibate in marriage.  There is no way I will go into a celibate marriage.      We aren't in a relationship, but we still have been in bed and done every single sexual activity with the exception of sex and oral sex.  We even dry humped.       So, something doesn't make sense to me.  How could someone who vows to be celibate be so much into these other sexual activities?  Is there any way that she will change her mind about celibacy because of her love for me?      This really really frustrates me so much knowing that we both love each other but we will not be able to end up together because of this.  It is also frustrating because she is willing to do all these other things with me.      What do you guys think?  Thank you for any advice.

20090226201125AALDg8p	Family & Relationships;Family	I had an arguement with my sister and im so angry.(kinda long) plz help?	Hello, im 16 yrs old and my sis is 35. Well my mom died when i was 12 and my dad just had a stroke like a  month ago and i was forced to live with my sister (whom i do not like), until my dad recovers. I never got along with my sister. Shes a divorced mad woman. She yells and screams over the littlest simplest problem and i hate that. Well she told me to get up of the game and clean up (which monday that just passed i cleaned the whole house by myself) I didnt get up, i actually stayed there. Then I tell her im not doing anything because i didnt mess it up (her 8&11 yr old does the mess). So i go in the room and pack my bags and she's yelling all in my ear. So i hear her on the phone telling her ONLY friend "You know what? Im gonna tell her uncle that she has a boyfriend and she's having sex" Then i was like OH MY GOSH! She actually went this far (btw, my uncle still thinks im a virgin and i get anything i want from him). She calls and tell him i be coming home late and all that crap. She's just so childish and i dont know what to do. My uncle wants me to stay with her because my school is right by her house and he doesnt want me to stay back. Things is so messed up for me now. I hate my sister. She's never been there for me. She's a backstabbing whor3 and i wish she was never my sister. I dont know what to do about school. theres no one else who i could stay with so that i can go to school. I dont know what to do. Im so confused. What should i do?      P.S. : There was waaaayyy more to the story, i just didnt wanna bore u guys to death.

20090226201446AAwsHjf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i stop all these feelings and hope and get closure - i hate it?	i lost a friendship. i got very insecure and treated my friend badly by always arguing and pushing her to spend time with me. even after getting chances and my friend always telling me that our friendsip is just as fine as it always was, i still ended up being bad as i was genuinely insecure.   however, i felt my friend was lying/hiding etc. and she probably made other friends etc and doesn't want to spend time with me. i was losing trust because i felt she was lying etc.      till date, i do not know if i was so insecure/jealous that i felt she was lying and indeed she was not and she MEANT it that she and i were just as close friends and we always would be.   or if she did just lie to me all along and manipulate me while in reality she was acting on a plan to distance herself.   i apologized for being so insecure and treating her badly. she has not accepted it nor talked to me ever.   i feel i am not getting closure beacause   1) i do not know if there was nothing and i simply got insecure and lost a friend OR   2) i was indeed right in her being manipuative and dishonest.
20090226201658AADLYvw	Family & Relationships;Family	Why do teenagers hate their parents so much?	I'm a teenager and i have negative feelings about my parents. I have my theories about why this is, but I want to know what you think. Preferably I'd like someone who knows something about psychology to answer, but anyone can share their opinion. Also another thing, it seems like my parents want to be friendly with me, and talk to me about my life, which even though I find this peculiar, I can completely understand why someone would want to talk to their kids, I believe families should spend more time together. It's the human thing to do, I'm all far peace, love, and humanity. It's just I'm completely hypocritical cause I don't want to spend time with my family. I can't stand my immediate family, They're just so...I can't even think of the right word. Why is this? Now I don't want you to give me some speech like "you should give your parents a chance" cause I'll be ignoring you on a subconscious level. I just want to know why I have this barrier with my parents, why I just wont allow myself to give them any respect. Why I'm counting the days till I can escape. Any help would be appreciated, especially if you actually know what your talking about. People who've gone through this are probably the most qualified to answer, but I'm open to all opinions. Thanks!

20090226201718AAzvpXw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends with the Ex and problems are arising.  Help!!!?	Ok, I know it was stupid of me to begin dating my friend right after he dumped his ex for cheating on him.  I even expected him to dump me, meaning I'd be the rebound.((Jeez, what am I a carpet?))  We're still friends, after this.  However, even though he's started dating again (I haven't, can't find a guy to fit my schedule -_-;;; Sometimes I hate college), he still treats me the same as he did during the time we were dating.  The only difference is that there's no happy time after our playful bouts.  It still feels like we're dating to me, he's in a long distance relationship now, but because all of his friends have mostly gone off to the military or to some other school he's practically always around.  I still have feelings for him, and I just don't know what to do.  I keep on wondering if that time we were together even meant anything to him, or if it didn't and if I've lost his respect because of it.  I just need some help to try and feel better about this situation because it's beginning to make me miserable to think that I've been so stupid in this relationship.

20090226195951AApCAXE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I consider divorce?	I've been married for 12 years right out of college. Have 2 kids 7 and 4. my husband is a man with good heart, but I never really have passionate love with him. He works so much, left no time for me and kids. For the past 3 years, he has been come to  home after 9pm almost everyday. I just feel like I don't have a husband except that he provide a paycheck for the kids and sometime in the weekend, kids can play with him a little bit, he does go to work on saturdays too sometimes. Myself working and make about the same as him in the same industry.      I feel like there is no meaning to live with him and nothing really looking forward. At the early years of the marriage, both of us worked very hard, to get graduate degree and  establish self at work, bought house and being fiancially sound, I was okay with that, but more and more, I realize that he isn't the type of person I'm happy to spend the rest of life with. But the delima is 2 kids, should I be that selfish to only think of my own feeling? And I'm full of fear being out there by myself. I never really lived by myself since age 17, I lived with my first bf, then the husband.
20090226202648AAz76nE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Problem with a bridesmaid. Should I ask her to step down?	I'm getting fed up with one of my bridesmaids. She is my fiance's cousin. From the beginning she didn't seem very happy to be in the wedding party and I was sorry I asked her but there wasn't an elegant way out of it.      Now it's even worse. Whenever I send out an e-mail about the wedding, she is the only one who doesn't respond. When I finally get a hold of her, it's like I am being rude and demanding. Now, the last straw...      I let everyone know about the rehearsal plans 3 weeks ago - the wedding is in July. I let them know early (5-1/2 months notice!)because it is really important they all be there and on time. I'm Greek and we're getting married in the Greek Orthodox Church. It is not going to be your standard "I do" thing!      If the bridal party doesn't show up for the rehearsal, they are going to wonder what planet they are on!!! This is VERY important!      When she finally got around to responding to my request for everyone to be there, she declined. She said she has to work and can't take the time off.      My fiance talked to her about it tonight and she said this is not the most important day in her life and she has to do what is right for her.      Well, it is the most important day in MY life and in my fiance's life. I feel that she made a commitment and she is letting us down. I don't want my day spoiled because she doesn't care enough to even ask for the time off - 5 months in advance. If she just wants to show up and wing it, that's not good enough for me. My fiance's family is French-Canadian. They have never been to a Greek wedding so she won't even know where to stand or when to move without an elbow to the ribs. It will NOT work!      She clearly doesn't care so what do you think? I want to ask her to step down. What's the best way to handle this?

After that, he usually pulls my wrists together so I can't move and jabs me in the side. (It tickles when he does it! XDDD) And today, I found him moving me out of his way with his arm around my waist. Then he jump hugged me from behind which is kinda weird because he's taller than me.   I think he's cute and would go out with him if he asks, I have no problem asking but I'm done with the asking. Guys needa learn to get the guts!

My little brother is a 17 years old and he is an arrogant cocky little punk and he thinks he is good at everything and he never backs down from anything.   He is the most disrespectful person I have ever seen and ever since he started going to gym and winning couple of amateur wrestling tournaments he has been the most disrepectful little punk.   He also disrespects my parents and he disrespects everyone and he doesnt believe in anything and all he believes and respects is himself.

I'm really getting pissed off and I wanna beat the living **** out of him but my parents wont let me.

20090226201100AAZBe6F	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Friends with a married woman and her husband is making things uncomfortable?	I've recently become really close with a woman I used to work with. We talk all the time and hang out a lot. She's 38 and I am 26. Our relationship is nothing more than being, pretty much, best friends. This coming weekend, she invited me to spend the day with her, while she shops, because her husband doesn't want to go and she doesn't feel safe going to a big city by herself, so I agreed to go along. Her husband is a really cool guy, but he's been joking around recently about us 'dating'. It's just become a really uncomfortable situation to even be around him. And now, instead of me meeting her somewhere, her husband wants me to stop by their house to pick her up.      She warned me that he will make some comments and jokes when I get there, and like I said, I'm just really uncomfortable with it. Any way to over come this fear?

20090226201450AAvqpC8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Relationship advice needed..?	My boyfriend and I are both 18 years old, we have been dating for almost 3 years now, and we both plan on attending the same college in the fall. My boyfriend is a very honest guy, therefor there have been a few instances where he has told me he "wonders" what it would be like with another girl and that he is curious because I am the only girl he has ever had sex with. He tells me that I am the girl he wants to marry someday, but he wants to "play the field" next year in college. What am i suppose to do? I know I want to be with him, but I can't just sit back while he plays the field. I feel hurt and like a fool. I honestly can't stand the fact that he will be having sex with multiple girls, then having him expect me to just take him back when he wants to be serious. I need some serious help.. I can't talk to my friends about this because they do not understand how hard things get after you've been in a relationship for so long. It's not easy to just call it quits. Plus, he tells that although he may have sex with other girls, I am the only girl he will ever sleep with. What does that mean? Sex is sex to me. Suggestions?
20090226201501AAVePF0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get rid of my ex-boyfriend?	My ex-boyfriend and I were together for 6 1/2 years and broke up over a year ago.  We have lived together for the past 6 years.  We have a 4 year old son.  He has not had a job for the last 4 years, which is one of the reasons we broke up.  Since he hadn't worked in so long, when we broke up he could not afford to get a place of his own. I aggreed he could start looking for a job; but move into a spare room of my house until he found work and could afford his own place.  He cares for our son while I am at work everyday.  But he has not even tried to find  job yet - in over a year!  I am at the end of my rope.  He is both physically and emotionally abusive towards me.  He is extremely controlling.  I am ready to move on with my life and start dating again, but that is nearly impossible to do with him still in my life.  His family will not allow him to move in with them and he has no friends that are able to help him.  I ask and demand daily that he move out, but I am not physically strong enough to remove him myself.  I know the simple answer is to have him removed by the police, but that would be horribly tramatic for my son.  Not to mention I am actually kind of scared what he would do after he is gone.  He is the kind of person who would seek revenge and I am affraid a Protective Order  wont protect me from him - by the time the police I am sure he could hurt me pretty badly.  Does anyone have any advice?  Has anyone had an experience like this one?

We've known each other for three years, we talk every day, I like her, she has a boyfriend.      How do I stop liking her while also maintaining our friendship?

20090226210806AAtJlCx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Requesting girls' thoughts: scared that my relationship is ending...?	this is a long one...sorry!      me and my girlfriend (high school) usually see each other a lot at school, but lately that has changed...      a usual day:   walk her to first hour, walk her to third hour, see her in 4th hour (p.e., we usually talk in there), walk her to lunch after 4th hour, eat lunch then sit with her (or she will eat at my table), walk her to 5th hour, walk her to 7th hour, walk her out.      lately:   walk her to first hour, see her at p.e. (then afterwards she goes off with her friends faster than i can get ready), and sadly that is about it.      the first day, she said she was just talking to her friends (i did see them together), but i didn't even think about it because i pretty much had her all to myself (not by force, just happened that way) so i didn't mind, but still felt alone. a couple of days later (might have even been the next day) her best friend asked if we were still together?      that is when i freaked out. i figured that since it was her best friend, she would probably know something like that...and then she asked ME? i feel like it might end soon, but i REALLY don't want it to. also, when i called her today, she said that she was watching a show, and if she could call me back. i said sure...that was 4 hours ago, no call.      do you think we are over?   what are some tips to find out what is going on?   what can i do to try to prevent this from happening if you think it is?   also, we have been together for going on 4 months.      i am not afraid to hear the truth, though i may not like it...i would rather know the truth, or at least a truthful opinion.      I guess i am too confused and, actually, worried, to figure it out for myself.      she really started acting this way a day or two after she got back from Alabama with some family. She seemed excited to be back when she did get back, but then normal the next day. (could it just be a change from her time away that she doesn't want to be with me as much?)      also, it is kind of weird, but her mom doesn't like that she has me (a boyfriend, not necessarily me, but just one in general), or at least that is what she told me after the first week or two. is there a good way to change that? or was that part a lie because she wanted it to stay at school?      i am fairly shy around people that i don't know very much, and am bad at conversations in general (i never have anything to say)      and lastly, is there any chance that this change is just hormones and will wear off (or possibly an effect from a period?)      i posted this earlier, but it seemed like the posts stopped coming, and i really want some more advise

20090226205832AAgc5XU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is eye contact, even brief, generally a good sign...?	I don't know for sure, because the girl I like sits next to me in one of my classes and I don't know whether she stares at me out of interest of boredom and curiosity. She acts uncomfortable, but that's probably just her personality (I see a lot of girls that sort of move around and fidget a bit...) I really like her but am too scared that she thinks I'm a creeper who watches her (I try not to look at her lol) which might be why she's staring      Sometimes when I look back, she'll hold the gaze with an indifferent look or look away really quickly (but I think it's just too avoid further tension)
20090226211755AA4HDN3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce rate in India?	I am really very sad about increasing divorce rate in India. Many people are debating here whether love marriage is good or arranged marriage is good. Nobody is thinking about how we can reduce this divorce rate. I am not saying that girl should not divorce if she is in  abusive relation, dowry harassment, cheating and financial instability. But when husband loves her so much more than his life and is ready to do anything for his wife except he will not come up to her expectations and her dream husband. I am telling these things in love marriage as mines is love marriage and faced these situations. My wife whatever I asked was refusing to do that. In our initial days of our marriage, she was good, but afterwards whatever I ask she use to refuse that from sex to food. But I didn't go get sex from other person. I was trying not to hurt her in anyway. But she was getting irritated for whatever things I do. What is the solution for this?

20090226210836AAYjwse	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you tell a guy you like him?	Yes, this might be the typical teenage question, but honestly...how do you tell a guy that you like him? I know that i should, because only good can come out of it: he likes me back, or he doesnt and I am able to move on. But i dont want to be the type of girl that tells her friends to tell him, and i dont want to be the straight forward type. (the whole "HEY i like you and it wont hurt me if nothing changes, but i thought i should get it across that I like you."  ) yeahhh...thats not my kind of thing. I guess I am shy, but people know me as someone who's sweet  (but I'm not sure thats right, cuz i dont judge myself)  I want to do something special, and the result is very important, but i wont be going all super duper sad if nothing happens...and hopefully we'll stay friends. Hes a great guy, full of energy, spirit, and good looking =] hes very nice to everyone and hes a gentleman. He's going to move in the summer, and i really want to tell him. Probably May will be the month that i definately HAVE to tell him. Right now, i'm just thinking of something to do for him...   any suggestions?   thank you
20090226211400AAfMI3N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In love but he's with someone?	I’m gay and have fallen in love with a male colleague who joined our team in August last year and it’s driving me mad. He’s living with his boyfriend who is neurotic and emotional but they are together.      I liked him from the first time I met him. A few months ago he started flirting quite heavily with me and running his boyfriend down to me. This has calmed down in the past few weeks but I’ve noticed he has started leaning his top half very close towards me while we’re both seated or I’m standing up by him sitting down.       When he leaves me to go somewhere with his boyfriend he never really looks at me or says goodbye properly – if I try to say goodbye he speeds off which breaks my heart. He was talking to me normally for a short time just before he left the last time looking into my eyes and smiling then marches off saying he was going now.      Part of me wishes I wasn’t so into him, I love him more than I’ve loved anyone before in my life. It’s brought me a lot of happiness but I want him to be with me and am thinking about him every moment of my waking day which is affecting my work too.       I've tried forgetting about him and getting on with my work but it just isn't possible.  It hurts when he's there and when he's not there too.

Im 15 and in the 10t grade. (In our contry high school starts at grade 8) My family and i moved away when i finishd the 8th grade. I feel like i lost half my life, friends, the people i grew up with everything except my family. Ive tried a private school, hated it. Tried a state school which ive been a for 2 months now still im totally depresed and feel so unwanted and lonely. I still talk to my friends back in durban lots and my parents said that they will support me if i want to go back to my old school (which is 600Km away) I will stay in the boarding house there and beable to fly back twice a month. I just feel this is my only option left, im just scarred everything is not going to be the same as it was.
20090225122029AAtWzNa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are some good ways to get through a break-up?	A relationship I was in on/off for 6 years has recently ended. I could get into all the details but I am not sure that is really necessary. I love this guy and have given him so much of my life, that it’s hard just to throw it away.

He was, in a way, there for me through the hard times and now I have to do this one on my own. I am lost, empty, confused, and can not stop crying.

20090226205330AAFABkD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! I'm all lonely inside!!!?	I'm a 16 year old guy, and to my disappointment, I have never had a girlfriend. The main reason is because I have a condition called Hyperhidrosis in my hands, which causes non-stop sweating. I got a little bit luckier than most people with this condition though, because my hands don't sweat all the time, only when I get just a tiny bit nervous or stressed. I am also super shy. I have a great personality while I am talking over the internet or texting, or if I get to know somebody real well. But I turn into a turtle when it comes to trying to talk to a girl in real life, or even trying to meet someone new. So, first question of the day, (For the ladies), How big of a turn-off, if at all, is a man with sweaty hands? Would you still date them if they completed you? And how uncomfortable would you feel while holding hands? Second question, how can I overcome my fear and actually start meeting girls? It is something that I can not do alone, I have not the slightest chance of even trying to say "Hi" without motivation. And any other comments/tips would be appreciated. Thanks.      Before I finished posting this question, I felt the need to share this story to show how shy I can get... and I guess I am feeling pretty gloomy right now, and just need to tell someone. Bear with me.      In 6th grade, I fell in love with a girl named Jordyn. She wasn't moody, or silly like all the other girls, she was sweet, and she didn't care if you were cool, nerdy, hot or ugly. She looked past the clothes, looks or reputation, she cared about what's important, the heart of a person. She was also beautiful, and wasn't caught up in makeup or fashion. She was perfect in my view. I never said a word to her until two years later when my friend introduced me to her, and talked to her some with him standing around. She eventually invited me to her party, which I attended, and we later became friends. I became comfortable talking to her and was able to carry on conversations, and we would walk around during lunch everyday, just being kids. This went on for a while until the new school trimester came around. We had no classes together, nor lunch. I never saw her. Later on, the school year ended and by the time the new year came around, I was back to my old shy self again when it came to her. I occasionally smiled or said hey when I saw her passing by in the hallways. But I started taking different routes through the school to avoid her because I was too scared to say anything. Shortly after, I couldn't even make eye contact with her if I ever saw her, so in the blink of an eye, all communication was gone. Since then, I have not said anything to her, and she has not said anything to me. And I have a friend who's best friends with her, and if he ever goes and talks to her, she pays no attention to me at all, she won't even look at me. I have tried to make eye contact with her and give her a smile, but she always just looks at the ground when we walk past each other. I feel like a jerk, and I can't even get the guts to tell her how sorry I am, and I want to so bad. Even if we wouldn't be friends again, I just want her to know that I never wanted this to happen. So my one true female friend and my first true love was gone, and it was all my fault.

20090225122229AAMYUNa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If he doesn't care about me why keep me around?	I still text this guy that I have always had a thing for. He is a major player, but just keep hoping that he'll change and want to be with me. When I think about how silly this is it makes me feel stupid and down on myself. But, actually, isn't there something wrong with this guy, too? Why keep me around, be all nice, 'say' we'll meet up when he could just as easily just say he has a girlfriend or ignore my texts all together really. He is just doing it to feed his ego? When I think about this I think that he is messed up in his own way, too - right?        I am trying to feel better - be nice!!!!

I'm a senior in high school, and I've known this one guy for about three years, but I just started becoming friends with him this year. I'm not really sure if he's still with his girlfriend right this second,  but I do know that they've been fighting lately. I know him flirting with me is probably just his personality, but even though he's taken, I just wanna know if he's interested in me anyways.      He gives me compliments like "cute" and "nice" instead of hot or whatever so I don't know what that means...   We seem to get along really well when we talk about stuff too...   I don't wanna get too specific, so I'll stop.      but please try to help me out!

20090226210818AAMlWQC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is polygamy hated on so much?	why is it not ok to have sex with more than one person. when you get married you vow your love for one another, not sex with one another. it's human nature to love more than one person, look at your family, you love your mom, grandma, sister, ect.....not sexually of course but still. why not have many wives and love them equally and get double sex. i just don't see the big deal, yes its illegal but if it wasn't....

20090226211225AAwirJi	Family & Relationships;Family	Ashamed of circumstances . . .?	I come from a not very well off family, probably look pretty trashy to the average person if you came over to our "house" because we just don't have time or money to really do anything. I am kind of ashamed of it, and I feel like this has held me back A LOT in life. I never invite friends over, and for a long time when I was in middle school avoid getting to close to my friends because I didn't what them to judge me based on my circumstances.   I feel like a am a good person, not trashy looking or acting in anyway. But I still feel like my circumstances are preventing me from having close friends or even any relationships. I know that most of you will say, "If they were really your friends they wouldn't care" But I still think that a lot of people do care, and I want people to feel comfortable when there are here, not like they are in a dirty whole.    What should I do? Do I just get over it? It makes me panicked to think that someone may come to my house, and honestly when people drop me off I lie to them about which house is mine . . .   I don't know how to get over it, or to find people who really don't care.       Also I feel like with relationships and such it is hard because I would feel totally embarassed that I couldn't invite their parents over to meet mine, or anything of the sort.    It is just really holding me down in a lot of ways.    Help please.

I could go on and on about this guy...But I won't.Basically,I've known him a year,and I used to really like him,but now idk.Anyways,I get the vibe now that he likes me now.   Sunday,at church,and he wouldn't really talk to me,but while he was talking to my brother he kept looking @ me.They were talking bout engines and he was telling my brother how to do something,but he kept looking at me like he was telling me how to do it?Even though he was talking to my bro..and not me?   Then a group of ppl we know went ice skating that afternoon,and I got my camera out to take pics,and everyone else just went by or smiled, but he was like, "Oh,ur taking pictures...Don't take a picture of me!" and yet tried to skate up to the wall where I was taking pics and he ended up crashing into it full force...LOL. I was like "Wow.That was graceful."   While I skated he would occasionally come up,but didn't like skate w/ me or anything.I was taking a video and he showed up,and I said 2 him, "Okay...now crash into the wall again for me. So I can put it on Youtube…" and....he actually did (you know, all dramatic,but still hit pretty hard).LOL. Like on purpose.   I don't know if you can kinda have a clue of if he likes me or not from those minute details, but what are your thoughts? We're both 17,btw. He's never had a gf.

We talk about anything and everything, and he's made comments like he thought I was hot, how he misses me, etc...      He's also the sarcastic type, so I joked with him and said "I think you have a crush on me" and he said "No, I only call you to kill time"      He's a busy guy, with work and school, and I doubt he'd have an hour or two to waste talking on the phone...so, why did he deny having a crush on me when I called him out on it?

20090226212455AAGRrtq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help with Masturbation?	Im from Utah, I am a christian and I started masturbating when I was sixteen which was about a year ago.      It felt cool at the time and I did it daily and I started to get bad luck.      I especially feel like doing it when I know guys out there are doing it and having a great time and getting rewards.      Once you do it you dont feel like studying or playing sport.      I felt God was trying to tell me something, and I tried to stop. But everytime I try I cant give up. I seem to be tempted on the weekends and I dont know how to stop it. I need some tips on how to stop.      And is it that bad like once every week. Does getting a gf help etc.   Or having sex, i really dont know, my friends in LA back in 7th grade used to talk about all the time and I think thats where i got it from.      Please Help. Im a guy by the way. What are also the pros and cons of masturbation for a christian. And if you suggest I should do it, how often and in what circumstances/ what to think of?      Thankyou so much

20090226210714AAvtclW	Family & Relationships;Family	Have you ever caught your parents having sex?	I never have. Just wondering what your feelings at that moment were.    I would be grossed out. lol
20090226212431AAvrWSB	Family & Relationships;Family	I can't get along with my brother (kinda long story)?	I've just finished my university in October 2008 & was about to start a job at a deaf school. I will be starting my Master's in the following fall of 2009. Currently, I am engaged for 3yrs (getting married in August 2009) & pregnant (due in May). My family are very supportive & are willing to help me finish my Master's in the fall.      I am very disappointed with my younger brother. He is almost 20yrs old & didn't finish his high school. There was no absolute reason for him to not finish his high school. My parents gave him everything what he needed, cell phone, tv, mp3, games,...you name it. They even helped him get his car. I worked my way through (never asked for anything) & I don't regret it at all.      My parents are against with my brother smoking *ahem "marijuana". In fact, he did a couple times in our home (in basement) & the smell goes through the heater, up to my room...& I am pregnant. I woke up couple times recoginizing the smell & got very upset. My mom yelled at him for doing it in the house.       Just recently he asked me if he was going to be the baby's god father =// & I said "I don't know,...would you set a good role model for my kid?"      Today he tried to convince me that it is his life, he'll do weed all he want, & telling me that I am not a good role model for being pregnant lol. I explained to him that I finished my education, will be doing my Master's, getting married in August, worked my way to get my things, never asked my parents for any money or help, & you're going to tell me that I am not a good role model? & you are? he is always asking for money in fact he will argue for it. My mom still wash his clothes, clean after him, (he never ever did any laundry or cleaning or did much help around)....,I am telling my father that he should move out & should start acting up his age & not be a lazy person & using my parents =// my dad has heart problems & need more problems from his son? I'm worried about his health.      I don't get his g/f who is currently in 2nd year university & want him?? I'm surprised.      should this guy move out? is he out of his mind? I'm ashamed of him.
20090226212618AAGFhqn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does my boyfriend like her?	Okay, to start off, my boyfriend usually walks me home after school everyday. But every now and then, he would say he can't walk me home but won't explain the reason. Today, he said he couldn't walk me home, so I walked home alone. My friend came over and we decided to go out to eat. But first, we stopped by school to see if any of our other friends could go out to eat with us. Then I saw my boyfriend and our friend walking together around school (my friend AND his friend).The girl knows that me and him are together. But whenever my boyfriend sees her, he would give her a huge hug that would last minutes at a time sometimes (he would even do that in front of me). My friend that I went to eat with was wondering if he liked her and I've been wondering that too. If my boyfriend couldn't walk me home, couldn't he at least tell me that he was going to hang out with that girl? I don't think he's been cheating. I know for sure he's not like that. I trust him in that way. I'm just not trusting the way he feels towards her, like, what if he dumps me for her? They say they are just friends and everyone knows that me and my boyfriend are together. Like really, EVERYONE.    Do you think he likes her?
20090226220523AAjvR4h	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when something is wrong?	My friends do different things. They do something so subtle that no one really notices it, unless you're really good friends.   When something is wrong, they look at the ground, they tie their hair up with a certain color hair tie, they switch their bangs to the other side, normally when they have their hair tie on the right hand, when something is wrong they move it to their left hand, etc.. (All this shows that something is wrong, without actually bringing it up in conversation)   What do you do when something is wrong?

20090226200349AAVd5YE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I save my marriage?	I recently came home after being away from home a long time. My wife would barely touch me, kiss me, and when we go to bed she turns away from me and says she is tired. She told me that she feels numb, and that she has no feelings for me anymore. She told me she didn't think there is anything I can do to change the way she feels. Before you pass judgement on just know that for a long time I wasn't a very good husband. I cheated, and I lied to her alot. I also had a bad prescription drug problem. I've been faithful since then, I don' lie to her, and I somehow kicked my drug problem to the curb. We have a daughter together. I've never wanted to make something work so bad. It hurt me to know that she doesn't love me anymore. She says she wants a divorce. I love her so much and don't want to lose her, but I don't know what else to do.

20090226220256AAtLlCf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm Hooked From One Evening?	So I met this guy (he's in his 20s- I am too) at this small social event at the college. We talked a few times. While I was joking around with a friend I noticed this guy smiling at what we were saying. Later on while I was alone trying to get things in order, he came by and helped out.       When it was time to eat, I spotted him and decided to sit next to him. I asked if someone was sitting in the chair next to him. He said in a jokingly way "yes" and then I said "oh really ok." Then he said he was just kidding so I sat down. We talked briefly because we had to pay attention to the speaker. He wanted to know if I was involved with any groups on campus and what not. Afterwards we briefly talked again and that was it. He left and told me before he went "it was nice meeting you."      I'm glad my friend knows him so she can invite him out with us so I can get to know him, but do you think he may want to get to know me more? Opinions, thoughts on the situation?       Should I ask for his number or something the next time I see him?

Im scared thhat when he finds out that I told him, he'll be angry and he'll come after me or something.      I  really need advice pleaaaaaase!! Im  scared :(

My husband and I were in the beginning stages of a divorce, and then he passed away.  (1 year ago)  I believe im the biggest I've ever been and can't find the motivation to work out.  I've always been able to lose weight that has been gained in the past.  Where can I find the motivation?  Has anyone had anything help pull them out of feeling like this?  I have been to counseling a few times, and that has'nt worked, because the psychs all keep relocating, and I have to start all over with a new doctor each time.  I have four children, and I just really need some advice.  I can't stand this weight gain.  Everyone gives me this "free pass" just saying, "Well, you've gone through a really hard situation..." and things like that, but my body is starting to disgust me.  Please, if anyone has any sort of advice, I would really appreciate it.

20090226213748AAwz8Ll	Family & Relationships;Friends	My ex-best friend is the most PATHETIC person in this world! What should i do ?Absolutely pissing me off!!?	Well here goes.   Were both 13.I used to go to her school. When we became best friends, she was un-popular and well not to brag but i was part of the popular gang. She joined us. She used to be quiet but now she talks heaps! Her attitude towards teachers is completly weird. Like when their telling her off she just rolls her eyes looks the other way and says their picking on her. She also gets teased by the boys because shes overweight . For example when we were feeling for our pulse they said she cant feel her pulse cause of her layers of fat. She ran out crying. You see if i were there i wouldve comforted her. But since i was in another school i found this out from someone else. She NEVER EVER used to call me or anything! I always used to call her to keep our friendship going.   During the summer holidays her cousin came from melb and they hung out together heaps but i didnt mind after they had never seen each other.    After her cousin left my cousin invited me to her b-day movies party and she has tonnes of her friends and said i can bring 3 friends as well but then i just said i'll bring my best friend along. The whole day she was really pissed for some reason. I was supposed to go home with her because my parents were all busy. Then in the middle of the movies her mum texts her saying she cant take me cause she has to go shopping. My cousin was really pissed because while i went to the toilets she left without saying goodbye! So i went to my cousins place.    Then later on i told her on msn that we were drifting apart and that she doesnt act like a best friend. I also told her that obviously her best friend is her cousin and that i really dont care anymore because your dont care about your other friendships.

20090226221205AAtM2kd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I found a sample pack of viagra in my husbands glove box?	he recently was with another woman-only kissed her, was texting her a lot.  I caught him, he said he ended it, caught him texting her again, this time said he would change his behavior "control" it.  Has been having a "hard" time getting it up, went to Dr, who gave him viagra.  Brought prescription bottle in, never said anything about a sample pack, which I would think you would try that out before spending all kinds of $ on the prescription (not covered by insurance). Because I don't completely trust him yet, I search car periodically, found a sample pack in his glove box.  By the way this woman he was kissing is his co-worker, so he sees her everyday.  I don't know what to think anymore...

20090226203904AAW3SvO	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about my dad and also my anger?	Well, my dad seems to let the new woman in his life do and say whatever she wants about me and my family and friends. I moved out because she started to tell lies to my dad that I was doing things to her that were mean. I tried to fend for myself and my side of the story but it seemed that he would not hear me. I couldn't take anymore and left. My mom was seriously upset that he pushed me aside only worrying about himself, it seemed he was happy I moved out and that he didn't have to give me rides to school (college, have no car) anymore. My mom would try to talk to him but he would just scream at her. She finally said that "I'll just be praying for you, for you and your daughter's relationship because your letting a woman get between you two."   He goes back and tells her what my mother said and she goes to the church (she's an ordained minister, but not of this church) and says that me and my mother are praying against their marriage. An elder, concerned about this who has know my family for a long time, calls my mother and my mom is appalled.   I try to talk to my father wondering why he is pushing me away like this, and asks why he believes her word over me when we are blood, but he doesn't want to hear me. It hurts alot cause you know I'm a daddies girl, he was my childhood hero. So it makes me angry, I've been very snappy with people around me, I'm trying to change that. But when you have a father who doesn't say I love you anymore because she is in the room, breaks my heart. I don't want to be angry anymore and taking it out on the ones I love.

I wouldn't mind doing it for him but he doesn't venture in any other form of sexual acts.We have been talking and doing all these stuff before we got married but he seemed to lost the interest after we got married.We rarely become intimate and if we do it's always oral sex.Are there really men who are like that?I feel like I'm cheated in this marriage even if it doesn't involve other people.He prefers sleeping in a separate room too so I really think now that he has a serious intimacy issues.
20090226213758AAGTUqH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I get the man I fell in love with back?	My husband is a great man, but for quite a while he has been acting differently and not treating me the same in fact he has been very mean... He refuses that he may need help, he always says that we can just figure out things on our own. Which most times I very much agree with, this time however he does not listen to my ideas he simply says things like that would never work or that's just stupid. I am a very emotional person and he knew that from the very beginning and now he says that my crying is ridiculous and I should grow up. I am kinda having doubts as to if the man I married is the same man I am with today. I am throwing the idea of a break around, but honestly I don't want to be without him. Although it may be better for us both, I just don't know how to get the man I fell in love with back, and I desperately want him back!!

She also says she wants to adopt children. im not after sex nor do i pressure her for it, but it does disappoint me a bit, because i really have feelings for this girl and im into "making love".

I am a very "kinky" and she knows it from a few experiences we have had (above waist)      so im just curios what people think
20090226215029AAlQh6Y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Visitation rights for infant?	My husband and I are getting a divorce. Our son is 3 months old. We are somewhat amicable and are going to continue to live together until the lease on our apartment is up at the end of September. I will move out and get my own apartment and he wants to go back to live with his parents. His parents house is a 3 bedroom house with an extra bedroom built in the basement so maybe a 4 bedroom house. There are currently 5 people living in that house. So he will be the 6th person. We had agreed on a visitation schedule of 15 hours a week and overnights every once in a while but not regular until he gets his own place. I just don't feel comfortable or like it would be safe. My son would be sleeping in a playpen in the living room. What about a fire? Or an emergency???? His family is the one pushing for divorce, and I know that their the ones pushing for overnights on a more consistent basis. I'm in Illinois. I have been a stay at home mom until now, that I have been forced into work. My son spends most of the day with me and he cares for the child but doesn't as much as I do. He doesn't know how to give him a bath, he can change a diaper but he always ends up peeing on himself because he doesn't put the diaper on properly. I just know that this is all his mom and she will be the one caring for our child. I want him to do it I want him to get his own place....will he get overnight visitation while our son is so small considering the environment? Also, his family didn't come into the picture until I was 8.5months pregnant. Our son doesn't go over there frequently and I'm worried he may be stressed or scared being with strangers. Please help me I'm going crazy!

20090226215706AAkmfpG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To date or not to date?	I think I may have fallen for my best friend's boyfriend's best friend. He's funny, he's cute, and I can't help but smile even when he's not around. He's expressed interest in me, texting me upwards of fifty times a day and spending hours on the phone with me late at night. The catch is he's actually a year younger than me, and far less experienced. I'm not concerned that his inexperience will make a potential relationship unfulfilling, it just makes me feel sort of guilty and whorish (for lack of a better word) in comparison. Furthermore, I'm scared any rift between he and I, or my best friend and her beau could somehow transcend into either relationship, and I don't want to be responsible for ruining both relationships. I know that it's not a good sign to be doubting myself so much from the start, but I don't exactly have the best track record with guys. So, should I give him a chance?
20090226215810AAhoHkg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Seeing a guy who's seeing another girl!?	Don't be judgmental please.       Okay, so this guy started seeing me and another girl at the same time. The other girl and I didn't know about one another, but we live in a smallish town, so it was inevitable that we'd find out about one another. So, our guy came clean to us and explained that he was seeing both of us. He was confused and didn't know what to do.      He had slept with us both. I have had sex before, within committed and loving relationships. This other girl, well, he took her virginity. Yikes. We both really like him, and he really likes us both. The other girl is super sweet. We met each other. We even tried the threesome thing, but that didn't work out.       We decided to see him separately and let him decide who he wants. Problem is, he can't choose. He likes both of us more and more and he becomes closer and closer to both of us. He's a super honest guy.       I don't know what I (or we) should do! It hurts us girls to have to share him, but he can't make up his mind! He thinks its a pain to balance us two, but he thinks its worth it. He sleeps with us both still too. Neither of us girls want to give up on him. Thought I'd post this question to see what kind of responses I'd get.

Ok this guy and i liked each other all summer, but we never did anything, just hung out, he is very shy. So after summer he went off to school and i started to go and see him, when things started to happen and we started getting closer, he said he didn't want anything serious, and i said the same. but then he acted really weird and wouldn't talk to me. He wouldnt' look at me, would leave the room if i was there. I made some mistakes later on with other guys, and he knows, now he talks **** on me and calls me a ****, he said he didn't want anything then, so i moved on.I don't know if he moved on from it so quickly or he was hurt that i did things with other guys. I am not a girl who hooks up with other guys at all,thats why it was a big deal.Over christmas break we hooked up, and we haven't talked since, not one word, or text or phone call,is he waiting for me to say something? or should i leave it?I figure if you don't like someone you wouldn't want to hook up with them so badly.The thing is im still not over him, how do i get him back? or is it to late?

20090226220939AAeHVBf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question for the girls...?	ok so thanks for helping if u do      if a girl claims that she used to "really like" a guy, but now says she jsut likes him, do u think there is anything still there. its been about 4-5 months since weve had a class together or seen eachother.       and more aptly if a girl ever has strong feelings for someone does it ever really go away?      and asuming he hasnt done anything, nor have they been together yet
20090226220950AAkyuZz	Family & Relationships;Family	Why would a Mother keep hurting her Daughter?	I'm the good child, I clean for her, cook for her, jump for her, respect her when i shouldn't...but she is always hurting me with words. She is really evil with her tongue,when it comes to me! I forgive her and I'll keep forgiving her. But it doesn't stop the hurt, what should i do? Most people would never talk to their Mother again for what she has done.  But like i said, I forgive her for hurting me, but would just like to know why..PS... I am an adult, not a child just so you know.

20090429122001AABdKiP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this girl and i want to ask her out.   Any Advice for me?  Guys and girls please answer.?	Ok, so here is the deal.  There is this girl I really like in one of my classes.  I asked her out a few months ago just before Valentines Day but she said “no” because she had a boyfriend at the time.  When she said “no” though her attitude almost seemed like if she didn’t have a boyfriend she would have said yes but I can’t say for sure.  Since then we have been pretty good friends and talked quite a bit.  On Monday when I was talking to her in class we were talking about jet skiing and she said that she had never been jet skiing and she wanted to go so badly.  I invited her and her boyfriend to come over the summer if they were ever down by the shore.  When I said that she told me her and her boyfriend had broken up.  When she told me she didn’t seem sad or upset at all.  She said it in the same upbeat attitude and tone with the same smile she had as when we were talking before she told me.  I told her that she was still more than welcome to come and I would love to take her jet skiing over the summer.  Yesterday I also invited her to come over and go swimming with some other friends that I had invited over however she said no because she had work.  I did this through a text because I wasn’t sure if she was in class.  She text back saying that she would have loved to but she couldn’t because she had work with a frown after it.  Between her reaction to my invitation to go swimming and jet skiing and the way I feel she has been acting towards me since before I even asked her out the first time I get the feeling that she does kind of like me but I can’t say for sure.  Anyway, now that she is single, I want to ask her out again but I am worried about a few things.  I don’t want to ask her out too soon if it turns out that she really is kind of upset about it because I found out that she had only broken up with him on Saturday.  I also don’t want it to be weird or awkward because I asked her out once already and she said “no” because I don’t know if she only said “no” because she already had a boyfriend or not.  Also I don’t want to ruin our friendship by asking her out again if she if there is a chance of that happening.  Does anybody have any advice for me?  It really like could get some advice from both guys and girls.

20090226194950AATR9nE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband is not sexually attracted to me, how do I react?	My husband told me that he is no longer attracted to me because of the weight that I have gained. I have gained 25lbs. after having a baby.      He said that he is not sexually attracted to me. He even said that he could pretend to enjoy having sex with me if I wanted to have sex with him. I was absolutely appalled by his statement. My self esteem is at a zero in terms of my body image. Even if I was in tip top shape my mind would wonder if he really liked the way I look.      I don't even know what to say to him after this? It makes me question if we truly are meant to be together.
20090226195357AAdcTub	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i live with this?	its been exactly a month now since my best friend and i got into a car crash, i grew up with her since i was in first grade, i am now about to be in my freshman year.. and she would have also. I remember that night like it happened an hour ago. I wanted shot gun and so did she so we were fighting for it (just in a kidding way like we used to when we were little) and i finally let her have it. We were on are way to new york with her older brother who was driving, and i always felt badass when we would drive really fast on purpose. Well it was around 3 in the morning and not much people were on the road so  jesse and i was rooting him on to go  fast, so he did. We were all having a good time but we hit a car. Lucky me i was in the back seat and only got a fractured collar bone and a lot of cuts from the front window shattering.    I was in a lot of pain and in shock so i wasnt thinking much. The ambulances came and took all of us to the nearest hospital and hour a way (including the family of four we hit) My family was in california were i live, so they couldn't get there until 2 days after but jesses parents where there by the next four hours.    when ever i think about jesses parents coming into my room where i was attached by tons of cords crying i already knew what was coming,  all her dad said was "shes in a much safer place now" and left. Her mom kissed me on the forehead and stayed with me. Her brother lived, he is really hurt though. Sometimes i wish i would of fought harder and took the front seat because she deserves to still be here way more than i do, and the fact that i was cheering him on to go faster. I take fool blame for everything.
20090226200502AAZgOqk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	High School Boy conversation starters.?	Hi I'm in 9th grade.  I sit next to this boy in two classes and I like him.  We're both shy.  We used to talk sometimes last year with like mutual friends but none of them are around anymore.  I think he might like me but I'm not sure.  I mostly just want to talk to him and be his friend.  Some people make fun of him and say hes awkward, but there are MUCH weirder people, hes not like a loser or anything.  We have sat next to each other in both classes all year because they were assigned seats.  We have said like 5 sentences to each other, like  "what page?" or "Can I borrow a pen?".  Hes so cute and shy, but I know hes different, cause our families are friends and i know a lot about him.  Hes just different in school, and I am too.        So anywayss... please help me.  I am getting fed up with wanting to talk to him but not being able to.  My major road block is like the first convo.  Cause after that it should be easier.  I have no idea what to say to him.  There is a girl who sits behind me in both classes I usually talk to, but it will be weird if all the sudden i start talking to him.  But I want him to know I want to be his friend.  Hes so much different than people think.  Suggestions on what to say PLEASE!!!   im desperate.

20090226202234AAnXB7Z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How would you feel if your boyfriend blurted this out during a heated argument?	My boyfriend of two and a half years and I had a huge fight (over the phone) tonight. I feel like he doesn't appreciate me and that he puts zero effort into the upkeep of our relationship.       He then went totally off-topic and started griping about our sex life. (Background: we have sex 6 to 8 times a week, haha we're young, what can I say) I was under the impression that our sex life was great. Well, he said that 75% of the time, he doesn't even want to have sex and it feels like I am forcing him to. It is true that I almost always initiate sex, but he's never said "no" or done anything else to lead me to believe that he doesn't want to. He said that if it was up to him, we would only have sex once a week.         What. The. Hell.       He said that it is nothing to do with me, he has a low sex drive and he's always been that way blah blah blah.      I'm really hurt and not sure if I want to have sex with him for quite a while after that.

20090226184917AAMpSuq	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I become more like a man? (serious question)?	Okay, I know it sounds weird. Anyways, when I was in like first or second grade, I used to hang out with these girls at my church. Really, everyone was friends, from kindergarten kids to seniors.       So these girls were in middle school at the time. One of them was really girly, crying over a broken nail and all. It sort of rubbed onto me, and now it's had a really bad outcome.      For a long time, it's been sticking with me. Now, it's five/four years later, and I've become a LITTLE less girly. I still use O-M-G and stuff. I'm in sixth grade (luckily where I live it's still elementary).       So, I'm working on it. I really want a fresh start when I hit middle school because for three or four years, people (especially the guys) have been calling me gay and a girl. For example, when the teacher says, "Boys on one side, girls on the other," they'll point at me and go, "Don't come to our side. It'll be the wrong one:"      I don't want that in middle school, especially since I'm aiming for a school that's 7th-12th. Could you guys give me some advice as to how to become more like a guy?      Thanks. :)

20090226102311AA4a0iM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I apologize even though I am hurt and I know I'm right?	We had a huge fight last night...not a yelling and screaming fight, but a discussion about something very personal...  Something that I have wanted to fix in our marriage for two years...  I don't want to say what it was, but it involved intimacy.      It affected him so deeply that he couldn't sleep last night and spent the whole night in the living room...had to call off work today.      I don't feel like I can just let it go, but maybe I should.  It's more his problem than mine, and I keep bringing it up even though there's nothing I can do about it that will make me feel any better...I just feel neglected and hurt.        Should I apologize just to get things back to normal between us?  I can't stand us not talking...it tears me apart inside and I feel sad and lonely and depressed.  I just want my husband to talk to me...but I can't.        do you think I should apologize and take the blame even though I don't think it's all me?  Or should I continue the discussion until we come up with a solution to our problem?
20090226220317AAGgpIl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me???? Or not?	I could go on and on about this guy...But I won't.Basically,I've known him a year,and I used to really like him,but now idk.Anyways,I get the vibe now that he likes me now.   Sunday,at church,and he wouldn't really talk to me,but while he was talking to my brother he kept looking @ me.They were talking bout engines and he was telling my brother how to do something,but he kept looking at me like he was telling me how to do it?Even though he was talking to my bro..and not me?   Then a group of ppl we know went ice skating that afternoon,and I got my camera out to take pics,and everyone else just went by or smiled, but he was like, "Oh,ur taking pictures...Don't take a picture of me!" and yet tried to skate up to the wall where I was taking pics and he ended up crashing into it full force...LOL. I was like "Wow.That was graceful."   While I skated he would occasionally come up,but didn't like skate w/ me or anything.I was taking a video and he showed up,and I said 2 him, "Okay...now crash into the wall again for me. So I can put it on Youtube…" and....he actually did (you know, all dramatic,but still hit pretty hard).LOL. Like on purpose.   I don't know if you can kinda have a clue of if he likes me or not from those minute details, but what are your thoughts? We're both 17,btw. He's never had a gf.
20090226210657AA6lEqX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was i crazy to say that to him?	ok, so i know this guy.(he is really quiet) I happen to be really loud. Make that extremely loud. and i laugh a lot. so anyways we were in lunch, and a bunch of my friends got up from where we were all sitting to get lunch because the lines were short. He and i stayed. I was actually being quiet, like not talking at all. i was staring at the wall actually. When i finally came back from my daydream, he was staring at me with a goofy(yet cute) smile. It kinda startled me, and i was like, "What?" he was like " you were being quiet. Normally you are loud and obnoxious." he wasn't trying to be mean, he said it in a cute surprised voice, with a big smile. He has done stuff like this before, and it all started when i was on the phone after school, and when i got off the phone, we were the only ones there. i said"What up with the weird smile?" and he said "Thanks" sarcastically. i said " no, it isn't your normal smile, because your normal smile is kinda cute, it was a weird smile" and then he gave me his normal smile and i said something like, " Yeah, that's the cute one" or something. did i accidentally make him think that i like him? i mean hes really nice, and all but i really didn't mean to. or is he just being friendly? i am so confused. sorry about the length of this question. =]

20090226201119AA8cIRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Having a girlfreind at 14-15-16-17?	I asked this question, but my title wasnt exactly correct for it, so i'll re-ask it again.   So, i mean, im a 14 year old guy, and im in 9th grade. The way i can secribe myself is this: Random sometimes, tall, act weirdly, and introverted. Might seem strange, but yeah. I see a lot of those called "relationships" between people who are younger and a bit older. Now, there are guys that keep bugging me about the fact that i've never really ahd a girlfriend of my life, and it's not that it really disturbing, but ridicoulus. I mean, when you look at things such as MSN and Facebook, they keep writing on each others walls and writing each other messages "ily babe" and " awh thank you ily2 even more". I read this, and im confused. Being in a relationship is normal, for everyone. So i wanted to know - are those all bull**** child stuff of which they will all remember when they will be adults? How am i supposed to react to comments such as "OMG you have never had a gf?!?" (i must admit that a lot of girls might find me ugly. For being tall for my age, for wearing glasses, for being annoying... If i do anything that doesn't annoy someone, it does annoy somebody else for sure.) and "You get no chicks, never will get one". Help please? How can i get girls interested? Because eventually every guy has to have a girlfriend, some day. Thanks In Advance

Starting tomorrow, I'll be spending the weekend with my cousin's family. It's usually a lot of fun, and when my aunt asked if I wanted to bring a friend I talked to my best friend and now she's coming along with me. I'm in an odd situation, though... a couple of months ago for christmas my aunt sent me a pair of really dorky looking footed pjs (red with white hearts), and I just kind of hid them away and forgot about them. My mom is helping me pack my stuff, though, and she thought "Oh wouldn't it be nice if you wore them to bed during your visit" and put them in my luggage... It sucks because I couldn't think of a good excuse not to wear them without making a scene and when I tried to pack another pair she just looked disappointed and almost upset so I didn't take any others with me. I'm worried that my best friends and cousin will think I look like a dork! Since I'm pretty much stuck having to wear them, what do you think I can do to deal with it?

20090226220135AAO6jQ8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	College girls, how would you respond if a guy with a player-reputation asks you out?	Okay, assume theres this guy that you flirt around with.  You always look at him wide-eyed and you keep looking back at him trying to make eye contact.  When he comes up to talk to you, you get all nervous.  You also introduce him to all of your guy friends, but as soon as he comes around, you stop talking to your guy friends and totally focus on him.  He also has a bit of a player-reputation around the campus.      You're walking with him one day and suddenly out of nowhere he goes "Hey, wanna have dinner on Friday?"   How would you respond?  Would you ever reject him by saying you're already dating someone?  What would you do?  Would you reject him out of nervousness?  The girl kinda went "uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....I am dating someone"

20060808155330AANT73Q	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do about a guy who won't move on?	I met a guy a couple years ago when I started college and we went out on just one date.  After the first date I realized he wasn't the type of guy for me.  He's immature academically (has admitted he's at the learning level of a 6th grader) and he gets into trouble constantly.  Every time I talk to him, he's done something crazy.  I wouldn't mind continuing a platonic relationship with him, as I still talk to him every once in a while.  However, he still thinks that we're dating even though I've told him that we are not and that he should move on.  He says "OK," but the next time I talk to him, it's the same thing over again (still thinking we're dating)! He thinks that I hate him and he blames his depression on me.  I have a boyfriend now that I've been dating for over a year who knows about this and gets upset when I talk to the guy and claims the guy has some sort of mental issue.  What do I do? What can I say that will make him get that we're not dating?
20060913164522AAjuhY8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This a question for guys?

The question is : who would you rather hear your ex is going with someone else to a dance her or another person(gossip mill)?

20090226215234AAHRQ6X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he...?Should I...? help me please, PLEASE?	We are both thirteen.   I like him, apparently.   At the beginning of the school year my friends told him I liked him and then he asked me if I like him and I said ya. I asked him if he liked me and he said ya.      Then we went on winter break.      He flirts with me and stuff but he flirts with EVERY girl. He hugs every girl too.   He is a HUGE flirt, but he only gets with girls he likes.      A month ago my friend he does not know asked "do you like (my name here)"   he said ya   then someone else asked him the same question three weeks ago and he said i was alright.      We were walking home and he and his sister were behind me and my friend and his sister came running up and walked with us but he was like "dont go! stay here!"..he didnt wanna go and walk with us.      Some of my friends went up the other day and were like "do you wanna get with (my name here)" and he didnt answer. and his friend was like "he is saying yes in his head" and he said "no" and then asked why and my friend said "she likes you"      later that same day he was walking with a girl and my frien said "do you wanna get with her or not" and he nodded and when the girl turned he shook his head but when she turned back around he nodded.      I know for a fact he is a flirt and I know for a fact at this point in time he has no gf.      He is touchy with me, likes hugs, and flirts. He does that with lots of people though, so i dunno.      Does he like me?   What should I do?   How could I get hiim to ask me out?   Should I forget him?   Is this a waste of my time?

20090225144958AAC9IJA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do i bother? Is she just taking me for a mug?	Ok, so i have this 'best friend' whom i haven't seen for ages (like 6 months or more) since she got her new boyfriend she doesnt seem to wanna know me, despite us going through a lot together and being friends since nursery. I've recently gotten engaged and shes always been jealous of that (shes a very jealous person really, a trait i've always just accepted), but then she texts me out the blue yesterday saying something along the lines of shes sorry she hasn't seen me in ages and she feels really bad about it, and i'm moving into a new chapter in my life with my fiance and she wants to be there to see it and not allow us to drift apart. Now she is not the kind to ever admit fault so when i got this text i thought ok it must have taken her a lot to admit that so maybe i should give her another chance even though she had really hurt me and let me down in the past. So, i text her back and say yeah i suppose we could meet for a coffee and catch up, she says she would be free tomorrow (as in today now). I didn't check my phone right away and texted her back later on the night to say i was busy in the morning but could make the afternoon, and she tells me that her work had asked her to do overtime and she's agreed cos she needed the money so wouldnt be free afterall, but promised to let me know as soon as shes next free. This irked me a bit but i thought fair enough if its work, but then i just went on facebook and it says 'lauren has had a lovely day with her boyfriend'!!      I feel so stupid and used, like she asks me out but then if something better comes along she lies and says shes had to go into work. I feel like i jump for her and despite all the things she done to hurt me i still give her another chance and she throws it back in my face. I feel like i've moved on in my life and we're not on the same wavelength any more really, and i have real friends i spend a lot more time with now, but i don't like the idea of cutting her out of my life, as i'm not really one to hold grudges.... What should i do, i feel like a complete mug!

20090226215743AAXD96G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I do it dispite it upsetting my husband?	When my husband and I decided I should go back to work (after baby) he decided it would be better to have our own money and split all house hold bills down the middle, then we could be free to do whatever we wanted with our own money.       I took a job where I had to work Saturdays (and have Wednesday off instead) as this would save money in childcare, but now, a year later, I am tired of not having a weekend and my job sucks, so I want to look for a Mon-Fri job.       So I explained to my husband that our childcare bill is going to go up by about $600 per month (by having to put our daughter in an extra day per week) and he thinks that this additional childcare cost should be my responsibility, as he has budgeted all his pay and can not handle any more expenses right now.    He says that it's my fault for getting us in this situation and I am not doing the right thing by my family by causing extra expense.      Is he right? Yes, I did get myself in this situation, but I can get myself out of it - he's the one that can't afford it and he dosen't care that I'm tired & hate my job!   The change won't send him into debt - it will just mean that he won't be able to buy all the luxuries that his job can afford him right now.        So, what do you think? Should I put up with my crap job (no bonus, no promotions available, 45 min drive there and back, work sats) or should I do what I want to and get a new job despite him?

He says we never talk anymore, why would I want to talk to him, he never listens to me any way. Any time I have an idea, he says no that won't work, he criticizes me all the time, then wonders why I don't want to talk to him. I am hurt, and my heart hurts.

Seems kind of conceited to me black guys would think like that though...like every girl likes them. But I mean...is it true?? Im just wondering because I do see quite a few of white girls with black guys nowdays so thaz why I'm curious. Im sure not all girls like them but maybe majority. So ladies is this true or false??

20090226220645AArxjM7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Men, has this ever happened to you ?	A woman is in bed with her lover who also happens to be her husband's best   friend. They had sex for hours, and afterward, while they're just laying   there, the phone rings.   Since it is the woman's house, she picks up the receiver.   Her lover looks over at her and listens, only hearing her side of the   conversation... She is speaking in a cheery voice)   "Hello? Oh, hi. I'm so glad that you called. Really? That's wonderful. I am   so happy for you. That sounds terrific. Great! Thanks. Okay. Bye."   She hangs up the telephone and her lover asks, "Who was that?"   "Oh" she replies, "that was my husband telling me all about the wonderful   time he's having on his fishing trip with you."
20090428133935AAnEFDg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does this seem like a good idea while hubby's deployed?	I live half way across the country from my family so hubby decided that while he's gone we should put our things in a storage unit, I should move back by our families and stay in a apartment for the year he's gone.    It would be nice because my sister is moving out of my mom's house and then we could be roommates and then we both would be in a bigger nicer place. And I would get a chance to go to college either community or real college because this town has both.   But then when the year is up I pack up the things I brought and move back to be with him.   Does it seem to complicated or like a good idea so I have a support group. Because out here I have no family, no friends. I'm a SAHM and don't get out much. I don't know if it would be better or worse to move. :/

20090225123931AAz6PkU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do i move forward with this?	my fiancee left me when i was 6 months pregnant a year ago and treated me appallingly, it has been a very tough year for me but also happy in many ways due to the birth ofmy son but tinged with such sadness as it wasnt they way i wanted it all to be. however im a year on and i still have bitter feelings towards him as so much has gone on..he doesnt see his son but it is currently via solicitors and is trying to be sorted out (maintenance etc) as he has never provided a penny/ However, my real question is will the horrible feelings i harbour towards him go away and should i allow them to go away when he treated me so badly (its too much to tell you about on here) but mentally cruel things. i want them to go away but then i feel like i have forgiven him and i dont want to do that as i dont believe he deserves forgiveness as hes not one bit remorseful. and if i forgive its like im condoning his behaviour and i dont. so i feel stuck on how to cope with this situation as i dont want to feel like this forever and i want to move on but feel like its impossible to do that. please help?

I only talked to him once for a short time and i initiated conversation. He keeps to himself and it kinda makes it hard to flirt with him. Also the class I'm in is just an english class so asking him to study is out of the question as it's just reading and analyzing readings in class. How would you approach a situation like this? I want to ask him out....or at least give him my number!      PS never asked a guy out before : (
20081020134318AAQeLUP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy problem!! Any advice plz!?	Okay, I just moved to this really small town awhile ago and two weekends ago, I met this guy that lives across the road to me and we have so much in common (thought there were a lot of awkward silences...). Well, he doesn't exactly go to my school and has to leave on Sunday at 11 so i can't text him or see him or anything during the week. Well this last weekend, we planned to go to a movie together, but i was swamped with homework and fell asleep. When i woke up it was around 11 at night (on friday). I expected he would call or text me, but he didn't. So i waited till saturday, but my parents and i went out shopping the whole day and he still hadn't texted me, so i texted him saying i was sorry about the movie, but he still didn't respond. He seemed like he was interested before, but now i hear nothing from him? I don't know if i should just wait till he texts me again? What should i do, if anything? And we've only met two weekends ago and he is a bit bold for a guy (at least i think). I don't know if he could just be playing me or not. I need any advice you can give!!   Thx
20090226104219AAUM7YB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I left my ex fiance' a year ago and our custody date for our little girl is coming up in march..(see the rest)?	I left him because he gets angry easily and he pushed me. I have it written in a letter to him admitting to him getting angry easily and to him pushing me and my lawyer does have that letter. But now my ex is telling me I don't stand a chance at getting my daughter. I have her right now, and i've had her since I left him in June.Yes, he gets to see her, I'm not that mean of a person. He tells me I'm not gonna get her.  #1 because he will not allow her to be raised or be around another man (if i'm to get married) #2 because right now I'm not working because of my medical condition. I have seizures, we are working on a disablity case right now, I am living with my parents though. I just don't know where I stand, and if he is right? Help.... I want honest answers please!!!

It looks really good from the front but the profile looks horrible. Other than that girls say I'm gorgeous/hot/cute/stunning and if I just got a nosejob I would be perfect. I look a lot like Jesse Metcalfe...with a toucan beak. I really like this girl but she's really really hot, almost a 10/10 and I'm worried she will reject me because of my nose. Anyway, is this a deal breaker to you?

20090226221151AAnU8ZI	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do with my sister?	I will try to make this brief by summing up our relationship. I have two brothers and a sister. I get along very good with my brothers but can't seem to have that same relationship with my sister. Growing up we had a dysfunctional family, which it still is. My sister and I would fight then get along (physically too) constantly. Now we are both in our mid twenties and I love her very much but feel I no longer want anything to do with her. I believe she is bi-polar (which my mother has been clinically diagnosed). She can be very manic. If things do not go her way she will be very abusive verbally. I know she is very jealous of my relationship with my husband. I think she gets a little kick out of it when my husband and I get into arugments. I think she is jealous because her eight year relationship failed. I am also a little overweight and when I was pregnant I had a miscarriage. One day when my sister and I got into a argument she said "ahh your a fat B*tch and that's why you had a miscarriage!" Ever since that day I have distanced myself from her and found it hard to want to be around her. I know my sister needs help, which I have suggested she seek counseling and maybe she needs medication too. I do not want to keep this kind of relationship with her and do not want to continue to talk with her until she seeks help. I am not perfect but I have never gone that low. Someone please help with advice, also a plus if you have been in similar situations.

So I liked this girl recently, she held me to a door at school and told me I couldn't leave because she would miss me and I finally got her to move. Well we talk online so I asked her if she ever had a crush on me and she said no, but I have beautiful eyes, a great smile etc etc. Well a year later I decided to write a blog on my myspace cause I was still feeling down and I wanted to let my feelings out that it hurt me. Well long and behold she writes me a message asking who it is about huh huh? I told her its personal. Anyway she keeps bugging me about it, why the hell does she care so much now that she knows it hurt me when she turned me down? I am trying to forget this, not rekindle old memory's of her.      BTW I JUST told her it was about her and I told her she can take me off her friends if she wants or do whatever, I don't care anymore and she just said no, its cool. What does that mean?

20090226124647AAqVhO6	Family & Relationships;Family	I cannot cope any longer.?	if you read one of my earlier questions about hating my mum you will get the back ground info on this and this question will make more sense. Sorry its long i just needed to get it of my chest.   i really feel i cannot go on like this anymore   Tonight i had a really bad argument with my mum after i had made dinner as my nana was at work my mum and her boyfriend barry came round to eat (they stay sometime in a an extension at the end of the house) well once they had finished my mum said to me me   can i borrow ￡20   i said no she cant manipulate me into giving her money.. i said she alreay owes me forty as it is   she began to get nasty and went into the lounge and asked my grandad for the money   i told him not to give it too her and then she got even worse she then said (stop getting in to my f*cking buisness. you will get a broken nose if you carry on)   we got into a reall major argument she began threatening me   but i did try and stand my ground saying she needed to grow up and become an adult (afterall she is 31)that she needed to sort her self out because the family cannot take it anymore.    she started swearing and talking in a way a boy would to another boy in a fight (saying come on then you f*cking stupid b*itch.. keep running round causing hassle for me and you'll see what f*cking happens to you) things like that and i began to cry her boyfriend barry started to tell her to not talk to me like that, and to calm down also that its not right to say thing like that to me( he is a really nice, gentle sweet man who deserves much better than her.)   well basically it kept going on like this so i went into my room and cryed   i could hear her in the kitchen though saying to barry ( you f*cking wait till we get back round mine, your getting you f*cking head kicked in your supposed to satick up for me you spinless c*nt ) the she kept shouting this so i could hear (that f*cking c*nt she int my daughter, shes fu*cking dead to me.. stirring sh*t shes f*cking lucky i havent broke jaw )   basically this went on for a while me shouting stuff back but that a normal arguement for us   but this time im really scared for barry im just really scared because i know that she will beat barry up and i mean badly beat him up like she has before and he is a lovely man and i feel guilty because he was sticking up for me.      why does she have to be like this?   why does she nevr try to be normal?   should i go round their and check on barry?    you will understand this is you read the previous question about me hating her.. i did right a really special letter from the heart about her needing to get better because its not fair but i couldnt give it to her   I just love her so much and i wouldnt be able to survive if she picked drugs over me   sorry its so long   thanks

I've been dating one of my good girl friends for about 4 months now (we have been friends for a year). She invited me to her apartment last week to watch a movie. I sat on one end of the couch and she sat on the other. I held her hand, but I couldn't work up the courage to sit closer to her. I thought it might be awkward to just get up and sit real close to her halfway through the movie. We're hanging out again at her place this weekend. So, I want to make a move and put my arm around her. How do I get over the awkwardness of getting up and sitting real close to her? How can I do this in a smooth and suave way that would make her feel comfortable as opposed to "oh my god this guy has no idea what he's doing"? THANK YOU!
20081115170317AAtWDQn	Family & Relationships;Family	I am fighting with my mother over her cooking HELP?	hi, i am tired of fighting with my mother.   first, she is a housewife and does all the cooking at home, and i do not like the way she cooks some times.   and when it does happens she gets all upset that i dont eat and that it is so hard to cook for me cause i am a picky eatier...   when i used to leave alone, (i am 24) i used to do some cooking for myself, but i really hate to cook so majority of the time i would oder out or eat whatever doesn't require cooking,   now when i am back living w/ my mom she gets upset she i order out or dont eat what she cooks, and she literally takes it personality, like an insult to her that i dont eat her food.   i feel like a teenager all over again - i alwasy never liked the way she cooks- what do i do now?????   i dont want to start fights over this stupid things   and yeah, i dont cook - i just dont like it
20090225124134AAXzDup	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Porn Addict, am I going to heck, what can I do?	Okay so i'm 15, and for awhile I had been watching porn videos & masturbating almost everyday. I'm not proud of it, or trying to be graphic but I just have an extremly high sex drive, and I would orgasm everytime. But after getting grounded for always fighting with my sister, I didn't have my computer so I didn't watch any porn....&& I was okay with that. I masturbated without it, not as much though. But then something tramatic happened in my life, and I prayed to god that if he helped me through this i'd stop masturbating and watching porn this happened during the month I didn't have my laptop. But then I got my laptop back, and I had done fine for about the first 3 days of having it back...but then I got an extreme urge to look at porn, i resisted it and looked up sex stories & read like 2 got week and rubbed on some stuff NOT TOUCHING myself & orgasmed after I felt really terrible. I honestly fear god and i'm afraid i'm going to he!! now, i really don't want to at all obv. I'm really sorry for what I did. So my questions are since I didn't get naked & touch myself or watch actual porn there wasn't even pictures on the site i read the stories:   1. Am I going to hell?   2. Did I break my promise, or not technically.   3. Do you think I'm addicted to porn.   4. Is it normal to orgasm that much?

20090225124038AAdR7nx	Family & Relationships;Family	9 year old sister bullied by stepfather?	My mum had a daughter with her ex boyfriend who used to beat and bully me, my mum and my other 2 sisters until he was thrown out a few years back. My mum then married another guy who at first seemed to be nice, but as time went on he began to take liberties around the house and became very moody. I have 3 younger sisters ( 19, 16, 9) one o whom has left home (19). I'm 20 now, though I tend to spend a lot of time at my girlfriend's house. Over th past 2 years I have noticed him become aggressive towards my little sister and treat her with a total lack of respect, example: provokes her to say something in order to get a reaction, says very mean things, such as: "it's a wonder you can go to church and don't melt, cause you're evil." " Tell your father he won't be laughing when I shoot him". - She can't eat her dinner or even walk past him without being told off, and he has openly admitted to my mum that he hates her (my little sister). I would just like some advice on how I can deal with this situation. Should I go to social services?

20090226163507AAqc2h9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	After your guys' help with my last question...Was my email response appropriate?:?	Kind of goes back and forth....keeps saying that he "needs time" and that "he wants to work it out, but it will just take time cause he's afraid I will say/act like that again." And he gives no credit to his part in the hurtful words and actions. I feel like he's holding this over my head. He's avoided me for nearly 2 weeks, and I feel like the only one puting in 110%. Lastnight we "got back together", or so I thought...then this morning he tells me to give him more time and space to heal over those things that happened a few weeks ago that we already talked about and I already appologized for several times. I think he has forgiveness issues. I love him and don't want to lose him, but I don't want to lose my self respect either.       no getting back together was not sleeping together. It was cuddling, touching my face, telling me he loves me and missed me and that us being apart felt wrong...that we should start over, etc. He is not that booty call type of guy.... in fact, he is sweet and sensitive and doesn't believe in sex before marriage.      I sent this email...do you think this was appropriate?:      The more I think about this....I feel there needs to be understanding that fixing this is NOT one-sided. It seems to me that the focus of this entire situation are the things that I have done wrong. And that the one puting in most all of the effort to fix us is me.You haven't even addressed the fact that you did and said things that gave validity to my concern. I am not saying I handled things right....but I feel like I am having to pay a heavy price for the entire situation, which had two people's faults involved. I cannot do that. It has also been completely overlooked that at this time and 2-3 weeks prior to this...I had started birth control pills that completely affected my rationality, mood, and personality. I warned you about this and asked for your support. When I realized it was hurting us....I stopped the pills and made that appointment with the other specialist. You had told me you would be understanding.       When someone truly forgives someone, they do not bring the offense up again. And again, and again. I am not sure if you have noticed....but I have ceased in doing so to you. I am equally concerned about you, just as you are with me, Nathan. You have concerns regarding my words when I am upset. I have concerns regarding your ability to forgive and not hold something over someone's head. I feel like I've really been puting myself out there and giving 110% effort in prayer, fasting, talking with you, coming to your house, waiting...to restore what happened in our relationship. And you know....I realize I feel like I am the only one doing so. It takes two to make it work, and one to ruin it. I've been saying "I'm in" to recoup...but I feel like you've been barely hanging on. If you can't forgive me truly, or restore to our relationship joy and trust, it will not work. And if that is the case, then maybe you should move on. I do love you, but I have to love myself, too...and I have owe myself just as much dignity and respect as you. I cannot do this alone and will not beg. If you don't come back or put in 110%, then it doesn't work....and I accept that. We will both face these issues in the future with others. Why not fix them with US NOW and be happy? What's more important, Nathan...being RIGHT or being HAPPY?

20090226115432AAwFu3o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I file for divorce from my husband of 1 year?	My husband and I have been married for about1 year. Although we have known each other for about 14 years. I always knew he like to party and drink and do cocaine. After we began dating more than 2 years ago, he promised me he had stopped doing coke and was only drinking socially. We moved in together before getting married. He would drink when I drank and so on. But eventually things got a bit out of control for me. He does not have control of himself when he drinks and does not known when to stop. He is not a crazy drunk or anything like that but just doesn't know when to stop. We've had a few arguments over this and  I found out he had done coke behind my back a few times. We are now separated because I am confused,. I have two kids from a previous relationship and I don't want them to grow up with his behavior as an example. Am I being too dramatic about this? He says he wants to change for himself but that he wants to work it out. I don't know what to do.

20090226195723AAB3jk8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do if there's this guy?	Okay, so there's this guy whom I really liked and we went out for a while and he always made me feel better when I was sad and we went to a dance together and he would give me his jacket and stuff. Then he broke up with me and I've been miserable ever since. I am friends with a lot of his friends and one of them told me he never liked me (even though he did all that stuff) and another friend I was talking to and I told him that I still really liked the guy and he told the guy and now my ex's friend tells me that my ex can't stop smiling whenever he says something about it. I really want to go back out with him but I don't know. And the worst thing is he sits next to me in class.    Please any advice? How do I find out if he still likes me?
20090225124011AAFWvcX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl acting like this?	Ok theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back at home and I think they seem really close. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I got the feeling that she liked me and I told her I liked her but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being friends but she still avoids me. She stoped sitting next to me in class and 3 days later i got a text saying she needed a while, i guess before she would sit next to me again. However I catch her stairing at me all the time still. So do you think that before the school year is over she will sit next to or start talking to me again if she really likes me, or you think she won’t talk to me anymore this year?

20090225132551AA8GE8u	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What should I do? Evil Bridesmaid!?	So I'm 23 and engaged and I want all my bridesmaid to be my sisters and my closest friends and my mom. My fiance's mom volunteered his 15-year-old niece to be one of my bridesmaids while his niece was there to hear it. It was so awkward because I was put on the spot but I didn't want to say no and hurt her feelings so I decided it would be okay to let her. His niece has been nothing but a monster to me since the moment I met her. I moved on past those situations, hoping that with the wedding and her being a bridesmaid, we could become friends. Fast forward to the present: I wanted to get measurements for all the girls so I could know what size dresses to buy for them. I called his niece for her measurements and she said she'd get back to me with them. A few weeks passed and I still hadn't heard back from her. I texted her saying, "Hey, do you have those measurements for the dresses?" She texted me back and said, "Who is this? What are you talking about???" I said, "It's me, Sara, and I need your measurements for the bridesmaid dresses." She never texted me back. After that, I tried talking to my fiance's mom (her grandma) about my frustrations and she kept giving her excuses like she doesn't mean to be rude, she's just being a teenager. She told me to call her mom to get her measurements. I wrote her aunt, who I am pretty good friends with, and she finally sent me his niece's measurements. This was at least 4 months after I originally asked for them -- I think it was more like 5. I ended up finding dresses for them that just ran in size S, M, L and XL, so I called her to see if she'd rather have a M or L and she didn't answer. She never called me back. To top it all off, when I was showing dresses I liked to my fiance's mom, she would say stuff like, "I don't think that style would look good on her," and "This design is better for bigger girls like her." That made me so mad because my sisters are little and this is my wedding, not his niece's, so I was very upset that she was making this about his niece and not what I liked for my big day. Any other girl wouldn't do what some other girl wanted for her big day -- that's why it's their wedding. I am so upset with his niece for not even treating me like a friend and blowing me off. I don't want to look back at my wedding photos and every time I see her in them, think about how bad she makes me feel. I don't want to spend like $200 to have her in my wedding when she doesn't really even treat me right. I want to drop her as a bridesmaid but I'm sure it will make his mom mad, and maybe his sisters cuz the girl will cry and play victim. I'm to that point though. I don't know what to do. Any advice?

20090428125447AAeZCea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong for me to be upset/hurt?	In March of 2007, I met my ex.  We were together until August of 2008, and by that time we were engaged.  The relationship ended on a sour note, but we both agreed not to go out of our ways to make it any more difficult for the other person.  We tried getting back together twice, the first time was his idea but I couldn't handle it so soon.  The second time was his idea again, but the next day he decided he didn't want to try... ANYWAYS... he has been dating this girl (which doesnt bother me) since, at the MOST, November of 2008.  Earlier this month I found out that he asked her to move to where he is (from erie PA to hampton VA) and she did...  They are living together...  they met over the internet and started dating before they met face-to-face, they have known each other for at most, 5 months, and they have an apartment together.... We were together for a year and a half, engaged, and we never lived together...      To make things even more interesting, when we were together I asked him about if we ever moved in together if we could get a kitten.  He said 'no i f***ing hate cats'.  Turns out, as soon as he moved into this appartment, he bought a kitten.  For himself.  He bought it, not a present from her, not for her, for him.  So much for hating cats.      So you tell me if I have a right to be a bit irked by this, or if you think I'm being completely crazy.  All of this information was given to me by a close friend of his who I don't really talk to, I just ran into him at the carwash...

20090226161941AAmmvg3	Family & Relationships;Friends	Omfg. I am so mad. What do I do?	Ok, so I get mad or angry sometimes but I get over it in a day or two. The situation that happened at school will probably take more than that to get over. Here's what happened:      I made one of those 11 minutes in emo heaven thingys on Quizilla.com. I told my friends to pick a number 1-4 and they picked 1 and 3. So I printed out the results and they read it and saw the guys. Later on in the day, they asked me to print the other two to see if they were hot just like the other guys.       I printed it out and gave it to some of my friends to read it. I always tell them NOT to let anyone else see it because I'm afraid of what'll happen.    I won't mention names so Person H, Person K, Person S, Person J, Person B, and Teacher B will be used....   I gave the second paper to Person H and I told her not to let anyone else see it. She probably let someone see it but that was an exception because I trust Person B. Plus it was Homeroom and they don't really do anything in there.   Then, I gave it to Person J...she gave it back. I showed it to Person S and let her read it and I told her not to let anyone else see it. She read it during a class and gave it to Person K after I specifically said not to let anyone else see it.   Well, Person K was reading it and Teacher B just "popped up out of no where and snatched it" <-- (Person K's words.)   Teacher B read it and it wasn't meant for anyone's eyes except for the people who I gave it to.    Teacher B asked me about it and I didn't want to be asked questions about it.       So now I'm really mad and I don't know what to do to get over it. Teacher B told me to get it at the end of the day but I forgot....   Just ignore the category....I couldn't find one that fit.

20090226185323AAAE5oB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do I keep taking him back?	I dated him 1 year & 4 months. I lost my virginity to him. I had huge feelings for him. But we were on and off a BUNCH of times! So much my mom doesn't want me dating him. I've heard he cheated on me when we started highschool and just used me for sex but then I ignored it and went back with him. Then he broke up with me and got this other girl. Today he said "I love you and I know what I've done I'm sorry I played games I miss you and I need to kiss you. I really want you to be my wife in 5 years. I promise I won't hurt you! I'll give you what you want. What do you want?" I told him I wanted proof he'd always be there for me, like, not making me feel invisible, not playing games with me, making me feel special, stop telling his friends everything that we do, etc. He promised he wouldn't and that I could have that. I reminded him I couldn't go with him so we'd have to keep it a secret and he said that's fine he just wants to be with me. So I took him back at 6:00pm. It felt weird saying "I love you" to him. But when I said it I felt so much better and I asked him why I felt like that and he said "Cause it's meant to be" I said "Aw that's so sweet" So then we stopped talking because I went to the movies with my daddy. I came back and he texted me saying "Why can't we hangout again?" I said "Because I'm not even suppose to be dating you. So if we hangout my mom will know" He said "I can't deal with that" I replied saying "You're breaking up with me?" He said "Yea" So then I sent him back a text saying "Do me a favor? Don't promise me anything and don't come back to me. You knew about the family thing and said it didn't matter. You lied to me again didn't you? Well don't promise me and let me be." He replied saying "K"      WHY AM I ALWAYS SAYING YES TO HIM?      DO I DO IT IN HABIT? OR DO I REALLY LOVE HIM?      I'm desperately looking for advice.

20090226205137AAtc4h9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she nervous or bored or indifferent?	There is a girl at my high school who I like but I am not sure if she likes me. I met her at the beginning of the school year and at first it seemed like we got along really well. She would flirt with me a lot and was always enthusiastic and happy to see me. I really like her so I asked her to Winter Formal to make a move and she said yes. I feel like I made it kind of awkward by not saying much but we danced almost the entire time and I think she was pretty into it. After she said she had a good time and I could tell she was being sincere. But now it seems like we are growing apart for some reason. I had been thinking nonstop about whether she thought of me as just a friend and when I asked her she said it was just friends. I would still like to be friends with her but when I am around her and other people she usually only talks to anybody else who is there and not me during a conversation, and when I see her now she doesn't seem excited or happy just bored and when I say hi there is just a tiny smile. And now that I am done writing this the answer appears obvious to me but I was just wondering if anyone had a different take on this.

20090226212829AAF8H2D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex-girlfriend drunk-texted me at 3am last night? Need some help from the ladies(or guys)..?	My gf of a year and a half broke up exactly a month ago today.  I received a txt from her saying that she has been trying really hard not to bother me, but that she had been thinking about me a lot tonight.  We ended up txting; she said several times that she is completely heartbroken and that she wants to work things out, but she thinks there may be no way of us working out our problems.  The last text she sent said, "soo I don't know what I'm trying to say.  please keep being happy and healthy and I'd like some time to figure **** out.  This is all new to me you now".      What the hell does this mean, without equivocating or beating around the bush?

20080210121555AAX4jyk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Some Girl Help?	I am 16 and a sophomore in high school. I go to a small school where everyone knows each other. And being that my name is Jack Daniels it seems that every single person in school knows me. So I need some ways to make friends with girls in my school without meeting any for the first time because that would be impossible. I couldn't just go up and say hey my name is Jack what is yours since everyone knows me. So how can I fix my image around girls I already wear nice clothes and stuff and a makeover or whatever isn't the problem so I just need other ways. I am kinda shy and don't talk to any girls in school. I guess they do not really talk to me because for the past few years I always weird and extremely awkward in any conversations. I just need some tips on forgetting about then and focusing on now. And I also just need to know what to say and how to possibly make friends with girls. Also, does it matter their popularity? I am not all that popular but people like me and stuff. Thanks.
20080225100647AAy1CYg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Caught my BF watching porn... I want to do something fun to get even :) Ideas?	We sometimes watch porn together, but he promised not to watch it alone... He's very contrite and is "willing to do anything" as a forfeit -- so I want use the opportunity to do something fun... (Fun for me, not for him, that is :) )      My best friend suggested I leave him tied up while I go out, but I think that's a bit too easy on him. Another friend suggested I make him wear a French maid's uniform and wait on me hand and foot, which sounds like it has potential :)  Or maybe a chastity device? :)      Any other ideas? Or comments on the ones above? Thanx in advance.

20080319221211AAO1SS5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pregnant, not with the birthfather, but another guy is showing interest in me?	Is this weird? I don't know why a guy would be attracted to a single 6 month pregnant 17 year old. He is 21. He says he doesn't mind and that he likes me a lot. Would it be wrong for me to start seeing him but not ever use the boyfriend/girlfriend title? He is so nice and he makes me feel really special, something I haven't felt since me and my fiance broke up. Would people think I was a slut if I started hanging out with him? I live in a real small town also.

20081003083933AApKDeK	Family & Relationships;Family	My father's spirit is haunting me, what do I do?I'm serious?	This is serious and I'm not joking at all. Whatever i am saying, its true. I am a 16 yr old from India. I’ve had a disturbed childhood. My parents divorced when I was two, since then I’ve been living with my mother and grandparents. My father and his family were always extremely rude to my mother for no fault of hers and then my mother moved for a divorce. Sometimes my father would come and visit me, mostly he’d be away from city since he worked as a computer engineer in France but to be honest I never liked him, he never fulfilled any of a father’s responsibilities and furthermore he’d say wrong things about my mother, he’d say that my mother was not good enough to bring me up and that I should’ve left her. When I was eight or so, one day my mother told me that he had developed the motor neuron disease. One knows what that leads to. He would come to our house occasionally to see me, slowly his condition worsened and he was becoming a stone. By the time I was ten, he was almost lifeless, sometimes he’d want to see me I’d always feel uneasy to see a man staring at me lifelessly, his talk was unclear. On the 1st of October 2002 he passed away. His family performed the last rites and we were not called. I didn’t cry since I never knew what a father’s love means. After six years on October 1, 2008, something strange happened, I suddenly woke up(I don’t know why), it was 2 in the morning, suddenly an eerie air went through the room, it was cold, I smelt my father’s favorite perfume – it was impossible since no one comes at 2 am wearing a perfume and then I heard my father’s voice, it said “you have grown up, now you’re almost a man” it paused and began again this time crying “son I know you’re not well, but now I’ve come and I’ll free you from your mother”. I was happy with my mother but now my world is turned upside down. I am not joking I am troubled. Whats the way out?

20081006230542AAjtrJF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I fall for players?	Why is it that i fall for those corny player lines from guys?   Such as enjoying the attention when a guy says he likes me, thinks that I'm pretty, etc?   After thinking about it, I know that that kind of guy is nothing good, that he is just playing around and wanting to hook up, etc, yet I still enjoy it?   I've fallen in this trap before... Just wondering how come I can't get it into my head that these guys are good for nothing and if anyone else has this problem ?
20081007040618AAxvcKl	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm really confused. I kinda hooked up with my girl- best friend ?	Last weekend, Me and this girl, whom i have known and been friends for a very long time hooked up at my house. We didn't have sex but we did mostly everything up to it. I guess it was the passion of the moment, and she was laying on my bed cuddling with me, so we got caught up by the moment. anyway, Shes looking for something more than a casual thing, and I just can't bear to have another relationship so soon after my last one. I'm looking for something casual, or short term.I like her, I'm attracted to her, but i didnt have that connection or that feeling you get whenever you're beginning to fall in love, u know that queasy feeling.  Well, she expects me to be this guy that she has always dreamed of, because i guess shes been into me, even tho we were friends. She lives far away, like 3 hrs drive. In the event of repeating myself, I just want it to be clear that I like her, but I didnt see a relationship with her in the near future. I think i led her on.  She asked to move in with me too btw..But i dunno if that was serious or a fantasy. I dont want to break her heart, and/or make her sad, but i need to follow what my heart is telling me...What's your opinion to solve this situation? thanks.      PS no we cannot be friends with benefits. I dont believe in sex without passionate love. Its like using each others bodies, but enough of that..      btw im 21 yrs old

20081117130928AAQEZJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What kind of girl do you like?	I'm a curvy chick, and proud of it. I've been told by almost everyone I know that I have a model face and an amazing personality.       But it seems the only kind of girls that the guys like are the ones with a perfect body.       My question is for the guys.      I've been told it's not about the exterior, but what is inside that counts.      I want to believe that. I haven't dated in 2 years, and I want a guy who respects who I am and loves me if I were 90 lbs. or if I were 180lbs.       Does it matter?       Seriously, do you guys care if you have a girlfriend who is different from the rest and doesn't have the perfect body? 
20081209064552AArlR7a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend wants to fly in his brother for me to entertain, what do I do?	My boyfriend is a medical student, and he is very busy with work and studying. He wants to fly his little brother down here for the holidays. Well he'll be at work most of the weekdays, and he said "that's alright, you show him a good time."      Ok, so I have will to drive the brother around, show him a good time, take him to parties, etc. And even drive him to New Orleans so he can get drunk and then drive him home.      Now considering that my boyfriend lives free with me, gets 95% of his meals paid for by me, gets driven to work by me, expects me to take him to anything he wants to do and pay (skydiving, plays, etc.), and asks for multiple $300+ items for Christmas, would you say it's time I put my foot down, or put my foot on his butt and push him out the door?      Or am I being too hard on him?

20090117144855AANnjg7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this the right thing to do to the guy?	I always thought of myself as a good girl, angel, in my eyes. My life is not like that anymore every since sophomore year has started for me. I am a sophomore in high school and I'm white. Most of the time in school I hand out with black guys. I flirt non-stop with guys single of not.            As of now, i am currently taking Intro. to Geometry. There is this black/white guy who has been wanting to "do stuff" with me, but, we are both very busy and lazy people(he plays basketball and i play soccer). IN that class I'm considered a "little nasty hoe". The reason I am one is because in that class i get fingered by the boy and kiss him mostly everyday on the lips. We don't go out and never will because our lives and personality are way to different! He has already bought a condom so he is dead serious about us having sex. As of now we were planning on doing everything(head,  eatin out, anal, etc.) we just need an open day for both of us. I'm not a **** because we have known each other since 6th grade. My body says Yes but my head is screaming No!             There is another guy who also wants to "do stuff" with me but is more of a gentleman than the other guy in my math class. We have been close friends since the very beginning of high school. He is currently going out with this girl that I have never met before, she doesn't go to our school. Usually we just joke about this stuff, but, now we have stopped joking. He is a good guy, but, as you probably figured out he is a player and a huge flirt. Now, the same thing is happening. My body is saying Yes, but, my body is screaming No.                 Right now there is another guy that seems perfect for me. He i a true gentleman, and we have mostly everything in common. We talk everyday for hours(they seem to fly bye talking to him). We don't go to the same school, but, he will be getting his license soon. He has already told me that he is in love with me. I have not told it back to him. We have not gone out either and never kissed each other.                   My problem is that I don't want to hurt his feelings so I think it would be easier to stop talking to him/seeing him so that i can get things straight in my life. i was thinking of sending him a text saying:         I know you are in love with me, but, I'm totally not right for you! I really hate to do this, but, I can't talk to you until I figure out how to fix my life. Don't make this harder than it already is, Please! I wish I could explain but i can't right now. I'm so sorry.              I want to fix being a flirt or whatever I am right now so it doesn't hurt him or me in the long run.?         My closest friends that i tell everything to, don't even know that I have gotten fingered by that guy because that is just not me!      Do y'all think I'm doing the right thing by sending the text message to that guy that doesn't go to my school?    ..If so, how can I make it better?      *Criticism is encouraged!!            Thank you so much.

20090225124518AArtoBA	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need serious help with this girl!?	My friend and I are both really attracted to each other and did some things we shouldn't have, because she has a boyfriend of 6 years...Now she had fallen for me and told me she loved me but was still with him. So over the course of several months I began to get depressed wondering why she wouldn't leave him for me, selfish yes. Anyway I was getting angry, my temper became a problem for me and one day I got drunk at a bar with some friends and called her. I asked her why it was okay for her to hurt me and not him and basically said a bunch of things I now regret. She told him everything after that call and now I feel I have lost her forever, as a friend most importantly.   The thing I don't understand is if she did tell him, how the hell are they fine to have people over the next day?   We work together and still talk and joke at work and text each other once in awhile but I don't understand this at all...some help would be nice. Should I forget about her and move on? Lastly yes I was wrong for having this affair, she did however instigate everything and yet I come out as the villain, they still have each other and I'm alone now.

20090225124251AAwQHze	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you answer his calls?	I'm not trying to play games, but my BF told me a big lie. He booked a trip which includes females to mexico without telling me. I told him to have fun in mexico, and hung up on monday. He also refuse to tell me who are the guys going. So this is rediculous and I really don't have a relationship. We seem like almost the perfect couple  b/c he do much wonderful things with/for me. Sayed he wanted one more boytrip, found out it included the female friends he use to go on trips with. Now he keeps calling and texting. At this point I don't even want to talk to him but I want him to understand this is crap and I will not tolerate it and he needs to talk. How can I effectively but silently relay this message. He just text and ask please let me know if you alive.

20090225124456AARbXzi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I just got served child support!!!!!!!!!!?	I received a child support summons, first it was from someone I met once at a party 15 years ago, never saw or heard from her after, do not remember sleeping with her so of course I asked for paternity through the courts and it came back positive, is there ever a chance that there is a mistake with the lab the courts use they could just want someone to pay and not get stuck paying themselves. Also What can I do so I don't get stuck paying a lot since one I never new of the child ever two I have two kids that I have raised since there day of birth, how much will the courts take from the kids I support, will they consider that? I mean I don't know anything about who the mother and child are, where they are, what they look like nothing!!! I just want to protect the children I have always supported from suffering financially. I mean these people are strangers!!! I know I have to pay I'm not arguing that, but what can the court do she never TOLD me, now when the child is 15 yrs old she wants child support so she surprises me with an order saying hey guess what your the father!!! Do you have any thoughts on what I can do or say to the courts that can help get through this. Do you have any advise  PLEASE!!!!
