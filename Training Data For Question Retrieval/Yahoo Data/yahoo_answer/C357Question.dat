20090131114346AA4ZGbM	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Silly phobias/fears you had as a child?	What are some silly fears you had as a child?      I couldn't stand leaving a video game on pause.   It freaked me out,I felt weird when I paused it and went to eat something.      I also couldn't stand that playing video games by myself,or without my brother actually.   It doesn't help that I'm sure one day me and my cousin were playing one of his wrestling games for the PS1 while he was taking a shower and we were customizing a character.    I'm sure he was trying to come out of the screen to kill us,he kept on talking to us and giggling the screen,that was NOT supposed to happen. To this day,I'm sure it wasn't a dream. I don't want to tell my cousin to make sure,I'm sure she doesn't remember it.       I also hated being alone,which is ironic since I love being alone now.      Anyway,what silly phobias/fears did you have when you were a child(not a teenager or anything,a child)?

20090131113916AAY0NbH	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Would this be the smart thing to do?	Is the following a smart idea.        A woman gets pregnant with a man.        When the baby, she tells the man, that if you don’t want to be a father, you can just terminate your parental rights.  You don’t ever have to deal with you again if you don’t have to.  This is basically what I want, because it gives me 100 percent say over her (well being and future).  I will still let you see my daughter, whenever you want to, because she has the right to know her father (on my terms) because I don’t want to victimize my daughter by not allowing her to now her father.  (Unless he is a danger)      If you want to get 50/50 custody of her and you are a good father to her I will give it to you, because I don’t want to deal with family court and can’t raise a daughter properly if we constantly argue and fight about money.   We can do this in writing.        If you want her to live with her mother, you can still voluntary pay child support on your terms, and we can also this in writing.        I only care about my daughter and my self, and not the interest of her father.  My daughter is more important than any amount of child support.

20090131113137AAnFGd4	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Help with piano, please?	Okay, so I've been away from the piano for some time now (a few months, to be exact), but I've recently started to get back into it and I wanna teach myself how to play more songs and such.       I wasn't exactly the most advanced piano--player out in the world, but I did know the basics and such. But I think what I'm struggling with most is hand positioning. All the sheet music I can find online doesn't tell you what positions your hands are supposed to be in so I'm not exactly sure how to place my hands and most of the time, they're just in awkward positions. Like for example, in this song, I don't know how to place my hands, at all:  http://ichigos.com/res/getfile.php?id=95...       So any tips? I obviously don't have anyone that can teach me, but I'm REALLY determined to learn new songs.      Thanks in advance :)

Recently I took a test and it had a section full of radical equations and they asked to solve them. I know how to solve radical equations, it's just that on this one question. This question was worth 6 points but my teacher took off 2 points because I got the answer wrong but I showed my work so she gave me partial credit. My answer was no solution to this question but it was apparently wrong. My teacher told my to do the corrections and I did. I followed all her steps and did it the correct way. When she showed how to do it, she didn't fully solve it so she said to us just finish solving it. When I finished working it her way, I got no real solution (I can't put imaginary solutions). Can you guys see whether the answer is no real solution, here is the question:      Square Root of:(x - 2) - Square root of (2x+3) = -2      Note that the expressions (x - 2) and (2x - 3) are all under radicals. Don't forget the subtraction sign between the two square roots.      IMAGINARY SOLUTIONS DON'T COUNT AS AN ANSWER. If there are imaginary solutions, the answer is no real solutions.

Last night we looked at Old Navy and they were either too small (an extra small was all they had for the one I wanted) or it wasn't what I was looking for. We also looked at Deb about a week ago, but all they had was large. I'm pretty sure we're going to the mall tonight, and my mom said we could look for them. But it can't be too expensive, and I would really like it if it was darker, but had a plaid pattern. The coat I have right now is warm, but when I tried some pea coats on last night, they were warmer. Thanks in advance!

20090131133211AAqUgZa	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of this? I wrote it all.?	Definition of love:   A strong positive emotion of regard and affection.      Most of the worlds definition of love:   SEX. That's it.      MY definition of love:   Realizing that you care so much about this person. They mean so much to you. You'd do absolutely anything for them. And being able to accept having to be with them and only them for the rest of your life. Caring so much about them that you have this pain in your chest that just won't go away.      Like my best friend said, so many people toss around this word as if its meaningless. It's not, people need to realize that.   This word is the most meaningful word in the English dictionary.   People should only ever say it when they truly mean it and can accept having to be with that one person for the rest of their lives if they have to. That's love.      Same with sex; in the olden days people would only have sex if they truly loved someone.Now people will have it with anyone. It's like a sport. People compare the number of people they have sex with as if they're comparing sport scores!!      I don't know if I'm in love, now that I think about it. I don't even know if I have ever been in love. But I do know this. That one guy in my life is amazing, and I care so much about him. I wake up thinking of him, and I go to bed dreaming of him. He makes me smile, and laugh, and care. He makes me feel happy. =)      Melinda, my best friend also makes me feel happy, and cared about. She makes me smile and laugh. She's my best friend. She means alot to me, I don't think she realizes that though. We've been through so much together in 4 years. And I wouldn't trade any of our memories, the good or the bad for anything  in the world. Ever. I hope we go through so many more years. So many more good times. So many more bad times. Either way I'll always be there for her, and she'll always be there for me. Because fact is; I love her. she's amazing!   And I am so much more lucky then you or all your big groups of friends. Because I have one. But that's all I need.      Melinda,   I ******* love you!!  =)   Best Friends Forever And Ever!! =)

Do you still call it a shout chorus if the overall dynamic is soft?  I'm thinking of a quiet section in the middle of a (hypothetical) big band piece where the whole band plays in unison, or at least rhythmic unison, but plays pianissimo.  Is there a term for this?        Thanks!!

I'm sorry, i have to take this outta my chest. there is a lotta injustice in this propaganda driven world. Why isnt there Yahoo in at least one African country? At least in South Africa since its one of the world economic superpowers. How come there is Yahoo Malaysia, Singapore etc? This is very disturbing. African countries are seriously used by the westerners to get what they want. Only when people die will they publish such things. How come that you never see African cities in yahoo? Is it because Africa is a poor continent, hell no. May be its about time these African countries go east, follow the likes of korea, japan, iran, russia, to get a lil bit of reccognition.       Anyway, i am not saying all these with hatred whatsoever. Just curios!

Theres this movie where there is a prince and his servant and they are turned into frogs (i forget how) and then are turned back (again i forget how) years later and dont know what to do because they come from medeval times and are now in our time.    Then i forget what happens up until the end where the prince is going to marry a girl named margot or something but then when he should say i do he says i dont because hes not in love with her but hes in love with kate who is standing at the back of the wedding ceremony. The prince servant says "Oh but master the clock" but the prince keeps walking towards Kate and he tells her he loves her and then the clock stops chiming and the orince and his servant both turn back into frogs that can talk. Kate picks up the frog prince and tells him she sorry for not believeing him and a girl who is a friend of margot runs over to the servant frog and picks him up and its pretty obvious that they are in love to and some over guy telss margot that they should get married and holds her when she faints after she sees the the prince and servant turn into frogs.    Then Kate kisses the prince and both the servant and the prince turn back into humans.     The next scene then shows a triple wedding with margot marrying some gray haired guy and the prince marrying kate and the servant marrying margots friend.           I would really like to know the name of this movie so help would be awesome.

Oh, and do you think rising sun could have an effect on how someone decorates their house or how messy it might be since it is how we make ourselves viewed to the world?       ---       Anyway, I am messy and disorganised. I hate cleaning with a passion. I will only do it if I get paid. I don't plan on becoming a housewife. If I get married and the husband wants it clean, he is doing it himself.    I would not say I am a slob, though.    In my messy room, I can still function and focus on  my coursework or any other thing I need to get done. I know some people who can't even function if things aren't super clean. Like, I have a step grandma who just had a piece of paper on the floor and she called herself a slob. In reality, her house looked like a picture from Good Housekeeping      Sagittarius sun/Leo moon/Aquarius rising       Anyway, what about you guys?

20081107203945AAEQwaI	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Does anyone else watch the J-Drama called "Nanase Futatabi"?	I just began watching it today, only watched the first episode and it seemd good. The site says it's a bit similar to Heroes, but not really. It's just the powers that are a bit similar though...      So If anyone else is watching this, do you like it? I did, I'm gonna start watching it now!       Here is a quick summary: A suspense story about a girl with an ability to read people’s mind. Together with her psychic friends, Nanase, the telepath, tries to save others from danger and fight those who try to abuse her power.   Taken from:  http://www.dramacrazy.net/v/japanese-dra...          SOOO, If you do watch it:      1. What was your first impression when you watched the first episode?      2. How did you first hear about this J-Drama?      3. Finally, are you all caught up with the latest episodes( I think they only have 4 out of 10 so far...)      >>>Here are my answers:      1. What was your first impression when you watched the first episode?    - I thought it was good, so now I'm gonna start watching it. The powers seemed ok, they could be a little better though. Like In Heroes, how each power is more powerful than it seems. Something like that...      2. How did you first hear about this J-Drama?    - I was on AnimeCrazy.net, looking at the One Piece episodes. Then at the bottom of there it recommended I watch this J-Drama, cuz it was a bit similar to Heroes, so I watched it and liked it.      3. Finally, are you all caught up with the latest episodes( I think they only have 4 out of 10 so far...)    - So far i've only watched 1 episode...like I just finished it about 30 minutes ago. I'm gonna watch another one tommorrow until I catch up with the 4 eps. and wait weekly for each episode.      >>>Please copy and paste your answers<<<

20060720032225AAbGdqY	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Are the movies way of developing?	When we see some movie we learn about our good nature from the good hero and in the same time we learn about our evil nature by the evil enemy of such hero. In such way, we develop in every way: we gain merits and we confess our sins.   When we see happy movie, we enjoy in our happiness.   When we see some evil creature in some movie, we get rid of our evil mind and publicly we confess our sins.   I think that the movies are some kind of hoza section where we preach our religion, confess our sins and grow together with our believers who watch our movies. In that way, we all are on the same path, the path of Buddhas.   Every movie preach the Lotus Sutra.

George opened the back door to go turn off the light, but saw that there were people in the shed stealing things.      He phoned the police, who asked "Is someone in your house?" and he said "no". Then they said that all patrols were busy, and that he should simply lock his door and an officer would be along when available.      George said, "Okay," hung up, counted to 30, and phoned the police again.   "Hello, I just called you a few seconds ago because there were people in my shed. Well, you don't have to worry about them now cause I've just shot them all." Then he hung up.      Within five minutes three police cars, an Armed Response unit, and an ambulance showed up at the Phillips residence and caught the burglars red-handed.      One of the Policemen said to George: "I thought you said that you'd shot them!"      George said, "I thought you said there was nobody available!"      (True Story) I LOVE IT...

I used to watch Oprah, but recently her shows just haven't been the same.  I'll never forget one where she came out and said "You're all wearing the wrong bra!"  I mean, come on.  Then you'll see her next show and she'll be talking about something really serious like internet predators.  Where's the middle ground?  I think I'll just stick to Ellen.

20090120120057AAsjz5Y	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	If you could do an in-depth interview with Golden Globe winner Kate Winslet...?	...what sort of questions would you ask her? I mean an interview about more than just her movies. Her life, family, career, political and religious views, etc. What would you(and possibly her fans, in your opinion) want to know most about Kate Winslet the person/actress/mother? I've been a fan of Kate since Titanic, but I've seen most of her films made before and after that one, and for the past few years a fantasy of mine is that I'm a journalist giving such an interview. I've always wondered what would be good intelligent questions to ask in such an interview.

Gadis: Dokter, saya merasa amat marah pada pacar saya sehingga saya memanggilnya lelaki bangsat. Ada kalanya saya rasa dia keterlaluan, dan ada kalanya pula saya rasa memang patut saya memanggil dia seperti itu......... ...      Dokter: Hmm.. . panggilan itu memang hinaan yang agak melampaui batas untuk seseorang.. tapi, mungkin kamu punya sebab tersendiri sehingga memanggilnya demikian.      Ceritakanlah kepada saya agar saya dapat membantu.... .........      Gadis: Ya memang ada....pada satu malam kami berduaan dalam mobil di tepi pantai,...dia pegang tangan saya.      Dokter: Dia pegang tangan kamu seperti ini? (Dr Tomi memberi contoh).      Gadis: Ya....... seperti yang dokter lakukan      Dokter: Kalau hanya ini, tidak sepatutnya dia dipanggil bangsat dong, itu tandanya dia tidak mau berpisah dengan kamu........ .      Gadis: Kemudian dia merapatkan badannya kepada saya dan memeluk bahu saya........ ......      Dokter: Dia lakukan seperti inikah?      Gadis: Ya..... seperti inilah dia peluk saya dokter...... ..      Dokter: Itu bukan bangsat, itu tandanya dia mau sentiasa berdampingan dengan kamu, kata dr Tomi .

Gadis: Ya, seperti yg dokter lakukan inilah cara dia memperlakukannya.      Dokter: Itu bukan bangsat, itu tandanya dia mau membelai diri kamu........

20090206091731AA7jUw5	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of my dream?	I had a dream last night that strangers dressed in all dark clothes came and told my wife and my 4 oldest kids to get to the train station and get on the train,I was to arrive later with our 5 month old daughter.    After they leave I hop on my Velociraptor while holding my baby wrapped in blanket and take off towards the station.    Im ziggin & zaggin thru the town and then my kid is gone and im not on my raptor,im holding a rock and rolling down the hill in a empty barrel. When the barrel stops I get out and go grocery shopping.    Finally I am done shopping so I leave, I end up at a friends house I havent seen in over 10 yrs and I pull out a dead mouse from my wallet and say "Im glad Im out of Missouri,they all wear their pants upside down."   After that we sit down to watch tv and see a video of Motley Crue doign that crunk dance stuff to a new song they wrote.    Then I woke up.         SO what do you think?

20081223170619AAL3jB3	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	AKU PUNYA PERTANYAAN SOAL CERITA(KAYAK ZAMAN SD DULU)..?	Di suatu malam, seekor cicak betina berambut panjang di curly2 gt deh kayak Laudia Cyntia Bella dan berbadan sintal seperti Julia Perez dengan senyum manis seperti Cris Jon berjalan dengan angkuhnya. Dia gerakan keempat kakinya kekiri dan kekanan, langkahkan kedepan dan bentuklah putaran(Lirik lagu Pesta).   Terjeratlah seekor cicak jantan yang sedang HBW(Haus Belaian Waria),      STOP..!!! HOI, JANGAN NGELANJOR(NGELAmuN JORok) YANG ENGGA2 DONG.. JANGAN NGEBAYANGIN TUBUH INDAH JULIA PEREZ DENGAN WAJAH LAUDIA CYNTIA BELLA DAN SENYUMNYA CRIS JON GT DONG.      Sang cicak jantan tadi bersiul dengan indahnya. Siut.. Siut.. Suit.. Suit.. Suittttt.. (artinya: Cantik, bukannya ingin mengganggumu;Liriknya Kahitna>Cantik)..      Tapi sang cicak betina berambut panjang di curly2 gt deh kayak Laudia Cyntia Bella dan berbadan sintal seperti Julia Perez dengan senyum manis seperti Cris Jon mengacuhkannya. ACUH. ACUH. ACUH. ACUIH LO kata cicak betina.      Sang cicak jantan tadi kecewa, tapi dia terus membuntutinya(Halah, bahasanya). Sampai akhirnya cicak betina itu dijemput oleh pacarnya yang dia cintai. Lalu mereka pergi dengan motor HD-nya. cicak jantan tadi mempunyai firasat klo mereka berdua akan berbuat ASOY GEBOY, si cicak jantan itu tetap membuntutinya,dengan MOBEK(Motor Becak bervelg racing ring 20 di ketiga rodanya) yang odometernya uda perna over lapping 15 kali, karena dulu MOBEK ini perna dipake ma Oktavinus ma Cleopatra pacaran disungai Nil.      Akhirnya, motor HD itu berhenti digudang kosong yang dulunya dipake Leonardo DaVinci ngelukis Monalisa yang senyumnya lagi-lagi kayak Cris Jon. Lalu mereka berdua merayap naik kedinding. Tak lama kemudian cicak jantan yang tadi membutunti.sampai juga digudang yang sama. Lalu ia juga sesegera merayap dinding juga. Si cicak betina itu perlah2 membuka busananya. AAUUUUUUUUHHH, si cicak jantan tiba menjerit. Untungnya, sepasang kekasih itu tak mendengarnya. Lalu cicak betina itu membuka pakaian dalamnya. Sekali lagi cicak jantan yang sedang HBW itu menjerit AAAAUUUAAAAUUUAAAUUUUAAAUUU UHUY. Kali ini kekasih si cicak betina itu mendengar, dengan gusar dia memeriksa sekeliling, tapi dia tak mendapati apa2. HUH, dasar penggangu. AWAS ya klo aku sampe ngeliat ada yang ngintip, akan aku musnahkan. Begitu sang kekasih cicak betina itu berteriak memberi peringatan. Tak lama kemudian kedua pasangan itu sudah bercucuran keringat. Lalu terdengarlah suara cicak lain jatuh dari langit2 gudang. GUBRAK!!! Kedua pasangan itu tertawa puas karena berhasil menemukan si tukang ngintip.         PERTANYAANNYA:   KALIAN TAU GA KENAPA CICAK JANTAN YANG HBW ITU JATUH?      Klo ga tau, coba baca lagi ceritanya dari awal.

20060707221619AAi4dgX	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Book idea: Need help?	When i was about 6-10 years old I loved shows and movies about space. In fact they inspired me to create a story that has spanned my life since.    It is So long (all in my head) that if i wrote it in one book it would be about 100 miles long in heighth.    My question is: Is it a good idea to write something that parts came out of other things. One of my enemy ships was an exact replica of somethiong off of Star Blazers.       My story line dealt with Earth in trouble with natural resources, were exp-loring the solar system (it would have originaly started about now)    And an alien race appears in huge war ships promising us help. But its all lies and a attempted assasination on their leader throws us into a war we cant win. Soon Humanity is on the run (whats left of it) and deep in space we gain allies and fight back.       For most of the years thats all it was.. constant war between two universes. What i mean, is that the enemy litteraly came from another universe. They ccould open doors

20090131151531AAW6snk	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Language Barrier......................?	A Russian woman married a Canadian gentleman and they lived happily ever after in Toronto.  The only problem was that the poor lady was not very proficient in English.   Although she did manage to communicate with her husband, she had a real problem whenever she had to shop for groceries      One day, she went to the butcher and wanted to buy chicken legs.  She didn't know how to put forward her request, and in desperation, clucked   like a chicken and lifted up her skirt to show her thighs. Her butcher got the message, and gave her the chicken legs.        Next day she needed to get chicken breasts; again she didn't know how to say it, and so she clucked like a chicken and unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breasts. The butcher understood again, and gave her some chicken breasts.    On the 3rd day, the poor lady needed to buy sausages.  Unable to find a way to communicate this, she brought her husband to the store...          (Please scroll down.)                                  What were you thinking?     Hellooooooo, her husband speaks English!           I just don't know about you   sometimes!

I'm 17 and I like listening to old rap music especially Bone Thugs. I'm kinda directing these questions to the teenagers of the nineties. I'm in high school right now and all I hear is people bumping loud music on their ipod of lil wayne( to me he sounds like hes choking in every song), soulja boy, T.I, and young jeezy. T.I I like and I kinda like Young Jeezy even though he sounds like hes taking a crap. So who were the most popular rap artist in your high school years. Like I imagine people in high school of the early 90's bumping loud music on their boom box of NWA, bone thugs, Dr.Dre, Tupac. So tell me what it was like back then.

20081014215214AA8e9Mp	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I'm Going To Prison! ..... What Should I Do .....?	Here' the deal. I've been fighting with Uncle Sam for several years on back taxes. He won. By the time it was done instead of me owing several thousand dollars I only owe $93.72. I'm cool with that.       The thing is Uncle Sam took the last 2 years of what he owed me to satisfy what I owed him. Still with me? Good. Well the money he owed me he sent in the form of 2 checks directly to me. Why ??? Technically it's his money. These total exactly what I owed him not counting the $93.72 I still owe.       I have these incredibly beautiful pieces of paper in my very hands right now and I want to cash them so bad I can taste the Prison food! Why would our favorite Uncle torture me like this? I wish I could keep these and make payments on what I owe. Is this possible? Probably not. Any ideas?       Go straight to Jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.      Please take this queston with a grain of salt (or sugar) and the Levity in which it was intended. Thanks!

20070214040535AAfuEtO	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What about this?	My husband's old school friend called him after 20 years the other day. His mom gave her the number. Anyway, she's 2000 miles away but she sent him a Valentine to our shared email yesterday. Not steamy but a Valentine non the less. Normally the distance thing would ward off red flags but my ex had a long distance affair while we were married and I found letters where they were planning their "escape". I don' think it will happen this time but I want him to quit talking to her because I never got over what my ex did. Is it wrong to ask him not to communicate with his friend?  My ex was very open about talking with his "friend".  I never had a clue it was more than platonic.  I don't want to be that stupid again.

20070220234643AAVBDP7	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I have this CD by the Moody Blues called "Days Of Future Passed"...?	It's a musical, lyrical and poetic journey of observations made by the artist(s) through the course of a day, starting from dawn through nightime. But what really blows me away is the title of it. Can anyone make logic of it or it's meaning? I'm open to opinions as of now. I know this should go into music, but I belong here. Thanks.      NOTE: The CD was released in 1968. It's a collaboration with the London Fastival Orchestra and it's director at the time. It's full of symphonic imagery blended with Psychodelic English Rock/Pop/Folk/Poetry. It was truly ahead of it's time and I consider it to be obligatory listening for every music enthusiast. The most notable and recognizable traks on the record are "Nights In White Satin" and "Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon)"

New York has a good body but her face and her choice of makeup are too drag queen-ish.

20090131041730AA95nUx	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Here are body parts i hate ?	10. Plica semilunaris   You may not know it, but you have a third eyelid. Pull open the two more noticeable eyelids and take a look—it's located right in the corner by the tear duct. This small third eyelid is left over from what's known as a "nictitating membrane," which is still present in full form in some animals including chickens, lizards and sharks.         9. Body hair   No doubt we were once hairier. Up until about three million years ago, we were covered with body hair. But by the time Homo erectus arrived, the ability to sweat meant we could shed our woolly ways.         8. Sinuses   Doctors don't really know much about sinuses—only that we have a lot of them. Possibilities for their function range from insulating our eyes to changing the pitch and tone of our voice.      7. Adenoids   Adenoids trap bacteria, but they're also prone to swelling and infection. Just ask any seven-year-old. Luckily, our adenoids shrink with age and are often removed, along with...         6. Tonsils   Also prone to swelling and infection. If you still have them when you reach your 30s, it's almost an accomplishment.               5. Coccyx   More useful as a game-winning Scrabble word than as part of the anatomy, the coccyx or tailbone, is made up of several fused vertebrae left over from the days when we had tails.         4. Arrector pili   When we were hairier (see No. 9), the arrector pili made the hairs stand on end when we needed to appear bigger and scarier. Now, it just gives us goose bumps.         3. Wisdom teeth   Back in the day, when we ate mammoth meat off the bone and didn't floss afterward, our teeth tended to fall out. Therefore, when those reserve molars, aka "wisdom teeth," came in, they were welcomed. Nowadays, fluoride and dental plans have just made them a huge pain.         2. Appendix   Darwin claimed the appendix was useful for digestion during our early plant-eating years; it's dwindled down to little since we started eating more digestible foods.         1. Male nipples   Because, why?      Whats yours ?

We were meant to be, supposed to be"      5) "Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness"      Note (again): If you've seen some of my other answers or questions you can probably guess my favorite songs or bands mentioned here.       Peace and enjoy! : )

20090131163023AA0vpas	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	At what point does "HEAVY" or "BRUTAL" for the sake of, become a detriment to "Music"? ?	MUSIC: the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity b: vocal, instrumental, or mechanical sounds having rhythm, melody, or harmony         Obviously, either through cultural context of personal subjective taste, considerable varience in definiton is to be expected.  I like Heavy Metal music, and can even distinctly discern the harmony in Brutal Death and other genres (such as DeathCore), so this is not for people who like nothing louder than Jonas Brothers to rant.      But I am curious... where do YOU draw the linit between Music and Noise, and how do you come to that definition.      An example of a band I find to be right on that razor's edge is Suicide Silence.  The only reason I cannot categorically call it noise is that there IS a rhythm, albeit basic, but there is NO harmony or Melody.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpsNdqzIe...       And is Brutality or Heaviness with little to no structure really the desirable or the  "future" of music?  And can someone who DOES like this stuff actually explain to me the appeal.  I am sure Jake or someone will call me an elitist for asking, but I really am curious.         MQ- What is a band you would use to define "Noise" over "Music"

20090131160426AAz87iT	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Am I not allowed to listen or something?	Most of the time when someone ask me what I'm listening to on my iPod and tell them I'm listening to Bone Thugs or 2Pac they are like surprised or something and I get this weird feeling like I'm not allowed to listen or something. I mean I'm not black, I'm Filipino, I'm not poor but I'm not rich either, but I do know what poverty is like as I use to live in the poor slums and towns of the Philippines  and one time this black kid in my class asked me what I was listening to and I told him it was Bone Thugs and he was like "Yo this man listening to Bone Thugs" and he then went on telling his friends he was like "That man listening to Bone Thugs" and they began laughing but I just ignored them.

So I was watching season 1 of OTH, and I am at the episode where brook finds out she is pregnant, and she said that it is lucas's baby. I know in the later seasons she doesn't have a kid, and I know in season 4 she says she's pregnant to cover up for Haley's pregnancy. But what happened to brook's pregnancy? Was it just a scare? Did she get an abortion?
