I am hoping to go on a road-trip across the northern United States (New York to Chicago) next year as part of my gap year.  I have two main questions,       1. I heard there is a system where it is possible to drive somebody Else's car on a road-trip across america and in return you sell it for them or just return it to them at the end or something. Does this exist? and if so how does it actually work?      2. if this car thing does not exist i will aim to just rent or buy an old car and use that. While I am on the road i want to generate some sort of income, does anybody know of any companies that employ people that are on road-trips to do stuff like traveling salesmen or something like that?    my cousin tells me she got a job selling encyclopedias door to door whilst traveling across america and she had a great time, even managed to save up enough money to travel to Venezuela after wards.      any advice and info would be greatly appreciated.      Thanks alot.

20090307090410AAc4qze	Travel;Cruise Travel	Do cruise ship dining rooms have a minimum age?	It has occurred to me that I've never seen a small kid in the dining room.  If someone at my table had a toddler throwing food (nothing against your toddler but hand-mouth coordination is not a skill at that age) on the floor, I'd be at the Maitre D immediately requesting a new table.  That would ruin the dining experience.  But I know people bring them on the ship.      But I've never seen anything saying "No children under __ in the dining room" so does anyone know?  Is there a rule on this?      Just curious =)

Vegas is the place I am considering due to the fact that I am young, love to have fun, and outgoing. I have been looking online for jobs bartending, cocktail waitress, anything in a bar or casino, but I have noticed that all of the ads say I would need an alcohol awareness card, nevada health card, and an nevada gaming card. I did complete bartending school here in PA which makes me ServSafe Certified...I don't know if that would transfer over as the alcohol awareness card in Vegas. So, my question is if anyone knows whether or not it will transfer and if not..where do I get it. And also, what exactly is a health card and a gaming card and where would I go about getting those as well??   Thanks in advance.

20090307084218AA1ToKD	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	Best towns to live in the south-east of england?	i live in london, have done all my life. however i've had enough of living where i do as the number of immigrants coming in has completely changed the place. i don't know what the statistics are, but i never see any white british people in my area just a lot of greeks, turks, caribbeans, africans and eastern europeans. fair enough if they want to live here, that's fine. but it's not really that great for me.      anyway i'm looking for a town in the south/south-east of england to move to. somewhere where the native english population is the majority. i'm unsure what would be better... moving to a big town like, i don't know portsmouth, or a smaller town. a few places i've had in mind are: maidstone, canterbury, gillingham, chelmsford, colchester... they came up as fairly large towns of 75,000+ population. however i've read some pretty bad stuff about some of these places, especially maidstone and that they are unimaginative and bland places. also i'm not sure whether these towns would feel too small as i'm used to living in london. i don't really have the time or money to visit all of these places. at the moment i'm staying in st.albans in hertfordshire. it's not that different to parts of london; it has a large and growing asian and black population... just feels like ghetto london i'm used to.      by the way i'm 20 and male if that makes any difference.

20090307083911AAnQR1W	Travel;United States;Atlanta	2009 good time to buy a house in Atlanta?	I know that some experts are saying prices may drop a little more, however there are already TONS of deals to be made right now. I plan to stay in Atlanta for quite a while - over 5 years - so this isn't a short term deal.      If I do buy a house here in Atlanta, it won't be until the end of the year anyways b/c of two reasons: (1) I want to increase my savings. My plan is to have a 6 month reserve in savings plus atleast a 10% downpayment. So I'm basically looking to buy once my savings is atleast 28K (10K for 6mth reserve + *18K downpayment). (2) I recently moved - so I haven't been at my current position very long which may make it hard to get a mortgage. So waiting 7 or 8 months may help with that.      I have excellent credit (about 730). I'm a single female with no kids. I don't require a ton of space, however I would prefer a new(er) nice 2 or 3 bedroom house - and there's a LOT of inventory in the Atlanta area! *$180,000 for a house is just a rough estimate and I know prices may be higher or lower depending on area, etc.       I'm a first time homebuyer. Also, will it be hard to secure a mortgage with only 7-8 months worth of job history w/ current employer? Even w/ great credit and savings?

In the United States, it seems very rare for a man to kiss a female acquaintance or friend on the cheek (or anywhere, actually) unless he's particularly fabulous. But once when I was in Australia, a very stubbly Scottish man totally caught me off guard by kissing my cheek while his girlfriend was introducing us, and later that night his clean-shaven English friend did the same while I was saying goodbye to him and his wife. I'm sure these were just friendly gestures, but it was very strange in my uncultured American mind.      Is this behavior widespread in Britain? And is it normal for the kiss to be kind of wet? (Eeeww)

People always say things like 'never pay the asking price' for things in an open air market. I assume this is true, but, how exactly do you go about bartering with a merchant? What are the "do's and dont's?"       What do you say? How much do you try to reduce the price?      Which settings does this extend to? I'm assuming I don't try this in a modern store, like a corporate chain or something, and not restaurants and stuff. I'm thinking just street markets probably.      Oh, one more thing. I've been told that in Cancun, US currency is accepted by everyone, and I should bring lots of $1 bills to tip people. So... what's an acceptable tip in Cancun? For things like airport shuttle driver, bellhop, etc. Are there people I should tip who I wouldn't expect to at home?
