8yE2sYGeaa	Mahoromatic.    It is about a former female android soldier, Mahoro. Driven by guilt from her actions during her combat days, she decides to dedicate the rest of her life to serving the son of her late commander as a maid.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	Mahou Sensei Negima  Ten-year-old prodigy Negi Springfield, has just graduated from magic academy. He dreams of becoming a Magister Magi [Master Mage]. And his first task is to become a teacher at Mahora Gakuen, an all-girls middle school! All the students are delighted with their cute new teacherexcept for Asuna, who resents Negi for replacing the teacher she secretly has a crush on.    Although he is forbidden to display his magical powers, sometimes Negi can't resist and various adventures and misadventures befall him.    Lovely complex  Koizumi Risa, current height 170 cm. Her last name is translated to "small river". A girl taller than most other girls her age.   Otani Atsushi, current height 156 cm. His last name is translated to "big valley". A guy way below the average height of a high school boy.   Because this, they had bad blood towards each other.    Later on, Koizumi Risa and Otani Atsushi start relying and helping each other with their own love affairs. As love failed for the both of them, a bond of friendship was formed. Along the bumpy (and comedic) road of friendship, Koizumi Risa fell in love with Otani Atsushi!...Go figure!    Can Koizumi Risa, the tallest girl in the school, make Otani Atsushi, the shotest boy in their class/year, fall for her too? So much ups and downs, twists and turns, and drama and love, in LOVECOM. Lovely Complex.    Gintama  The story focuses on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata, his (partial) apprentice Shinpachi Shimura, and a teenage alien girl who's from one of the strongest races in existence: Kagura. All three are "free-lancers" search for work in order to pay the monthly rent, which usually goes unpaid anyway. It's funny, and worth reading just for the laughs. This manga has a plot with no bounds, it can go anywhere with it, and it does, comedy and seriousness from time to time to make this a MUST read.    Death note  An overachieving 12th grader, Yagami Light is an aspiring young man who seems destined for success. Unfortunately, his daily habits bore his incredible intelligence--So when a strange black notebook fell from the heavens during his class, it wasn't long before he had taken it. In his room, he finds, to his horror/fascination, that the Death Note is real, and owned by Ryuk, a Shinigami (Death God).  Any person's name written in the Death note will kill that person in 40 seconds.... without fail.  With this supposed gift of God, Light swears upon his grave that he will 'cleanse' the world of the evil and needless people that inhabit it, thus creating a utopia for all. With the world's greatest detective, L, hot on his tail, will Light's ideals prove too fantastic to realize, or will he succeed bringing justice?    Cardcaptors Sakura  Sakura Kinomoto was just an average 4th Grader - loved P.E., hated math - until one day, while looking through her father's library, Sakura found the Clow, an enchanted book designed to hold a set of magical Clow Cards. But when Sakura opened the book, it was empty. Talk about disasters!! Cerberus, the Creature of the Seal, emerged from the cover of the book and told Sakura the cards must be returned to the book. "If the cards aren't in the book, they come to life and do evil!" Kero formed a contract with Sakura making her a Cardcaptor and together with Sakura's best friend, Tomoyo, they embark on a mystical journey to capture all the Clow Cards before the Cards can wreak chaos and destruction    Tsubasa resevoir chronicles  Sakura is the princess of Clow kingdom, which is ruled by her older brother, King Tuya. Her childhood friend Syaoran is a young archaeologist. Sakura is revealed to have strange powers when she has a vision of a mysterious symbol and places she has never seen. Meanwhile, Syaoran discovers the same symbol at the ruins he is excavating. He sees Sakura standing on the symbol on the ground. Ghostly wings appear on her back and a mysterious force begins to pull her into the walls of the ruins. Syaoran rescues her in time, but her wings are shattered into hundreds of feather-like pieces and scattered across the dimensions.

I love twilight  i hate harry potter|`|n5u3rkV4aa	Harry Potter because it appeals to all age ranges and genders whereas Twilight typically tends to appeal to teenage girls.

jFALlQunaa	What interests you? Write about something that you know and turn it into fiction. Me personally I'd go with something paranormal like a ghost story. However stories about friendship are really good. Like if you did a story about a friendship that crossed races or religion and how the people were still friends despite the differences. Stories involving animals are always good also.

Very Beatles inspired and you can tell in the lyrics. Not the usual sound for this band, but I like their new album.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Ok two answers. For relaxation, I'd go with some Red hot chili peppers songs (Try Under the bridge) and I'm Forced by fan law to mention Metallica.

When you listen to a Nirvana song it doesn't sound like an early 90's song and is better than a lot you hear today.|`|V1hxvQukaa	alice in chains was more metal  nirvana was more punk|`|M0598bvzaa	Nirvana wins nuff said|`|rS7fh6pRaa	NIRVANA|`|gSjjYctKaa	Nirvana sucks. they're only popular cause Kurt died young.

ALOT of people LOVE her books. it's mostly guys that say that though cuz it's mostly a chick book. but still people dont have the right to say that, that's mean.  oh and i asked a guy why he doesn't like it and he said its because the way she rights the book and words things.|`|pMzq6B3paa	I don't hate her.... I don't even know her.|`|jkj1ClUaaa	i love her i've read the twilight series a ton of times and i'm thinking about reading the host, dont listen to those haters just ignore them so what if they dont like her they're retards for not liking her anyways!|`|JmY6s24raa	I like the Twilight series. People have their opinions, you gotta like them or not. Everyone can't love or like the same things as you do.

7HBTvg8Caa	I would read the book first. They plan on making some changes to the New Moon movie and reading the book may help you get a better grasp of what's going on in the movie.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Read the entire series before New Moon comes out because then you'll understand it more. Also, they can't add every single detail to the movie, so you'll know more about the characters that might not be told in the movie. It's better to know the story first.|`|Q80RH1UAaa	I recommend you read the book first because the movie is gonna be way different. I already read it and i think it was better than Twilight. I'm looking forward to reading Eclipse but it's not coming out in paperback for like 3 months. When you read the book it's more interesting because there are more details and it helps you understand the story line better.|`|w1RPYXoiaa	Read the book first.  Watching the movie first will interfere with the wonderful images you get in your head while reading.  Just go into the theater with the knowledge that the movie will be different.  It might add or even clarify something you missed in the books, adding another dimension to it.|`|NKvyddysaa	I think you should read it first.  It wont matter cause we know that movies based on books are never good.|`|GbN8eek9aa	Hm... if you already read Twilight, then I think it's fine to just go see it :)
Ic7cM3Kwaa	I think I'm the only one for Harry Potter! :[|`|w2N7LEJNaa	Bourne Idnetitty|`|0b983e24a7724207bfc502bdc19559ddaa	I'd say Star Wars has created a much more complex world than the Harry Potter books, but I've always found myself more interested in the latter and caring more about the characters than I did with Star Wars.|`|l69j1Yukaa	Star Wars has been around for almost thirty years. First there was the original trilogy and then the new trilogy. Recently they started the popularity up again with The Clone Wars. I would have to say that Star Wars has a bigger fan base. Harry Potter is a close runner up, though. With Universal Studios partial theme park devoted to the films...it is sure to increase in popularity.     If you are asking my opinion of what movie is better I would say Star Wars. The Harry Potter movies were not as good as the books.|`|u8IA9r4Eaa	Star Wars was better before George Lucas completely slaughtered it by making Episodes 1-3.|`|AA12242635	Star Wars|`|CY0uWjnlaa	STAR WARS-an amazing universe and interesting characters in ALL six films.|`|O3l33DVJaa	Star Wars|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Star Wars, duh.|`|07hmAcA1aa	well, they both suck|`|PZH2zBzYaa	star wars|`|9wQPRSjoaa	Not comparable... Star wars all the way|`|mQlVSsVBaa	Personally I don't know the concept of either one of those movies.

AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....    1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.    2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.    3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.  Or answer the right question on the air.  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out  in a drawing.    Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.    - - - - - - - - - - - - -
59AiKKuCaa	my teacher told me this thing once like that to clear your head.  it goes like this:  there was a beautiful forrest with no one around for miles one tree snapped and fell to tthe ground. thuddd! but no one would hear it so would it be a sound?  i think so. its like there is a sound in australia but u dont hear it but u no its there. actually now im confused.  yes thered be a noise but u wouldnt hear it if you werent there. oh gooddd.  there would be anoise but noone was around to hear it.|`|QTLmYcqiaa	If something makes noise and no1 hears it, it still made a noise. So yes it has made a noise.    But if it makes a noise and no1 hears it, how do u know it actually made a sound?  And if some1 told u they heard it make a sound but no1 was around 2 hear it that's just stupid cause then how would they know it made a sound, right?  So I guess it just depends on who u ask.|`|6roXgxdSaa	Yep.. Inanimate objects don't change their physical properties according to the presence of a person.... ;-)|`|HVKfuhp3aa	Well, I don't think it makes a sound because a sound is interpreted in the brain, and if there is nothing there to interpret it, is there really a sound? There are still wave disturbances but not really a "sound".|`|dffaa733b1cf2c321bd7fb1edee43561aa	Its the same as a fart at a wedding reception. Nobody might  hear it, but very soon everybody knows about it.  Soooooo, has it made a noise and does it matter if its not heard.  Its a matter of `have the senses picked it up`.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Would it have made a noise were someone there? yes.  Then does it still make a noise when no one is there? yes.|`|HQKuzxulaa	It's just that the noise wasn't audible. A deaf person doesn' hear noises but noises are still there.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	not to get all scientific but it will make sound waves but no sound|`|1htWVUa9aa	it would technically just be vibrations that ears did not perceive as sound.|`|I3CNklLKaa	If something makes a noise then, surely, it makes a noise?|`|MbCj2Hgeaa	basically what you are asking is the age old question "if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around, does it make a sound?"    what is sound? it can be argued that sound is when the brain interprets stimulation picked up by the ears. so if nobody or no animal whatever is around to "hear" this tree falling, then there is no interpretations, therefore no sound.

bik6rJZkaa	Number 1: People need to compliment each other PERIOD. It can be a compliment of total opposties (Like RZA and GZA) or they can be alike (Rae & Ghost, Jada & Styles). It just has to work    Number 2: Not up on that many albums by the Roots    Number 3: I do not agree.|`|3Q4ijBQOaa	You should have made this three separate questions. But, no I sell on this. Why? because cohesiveness is not dependent on style, it's dependent on whether or not the lyrical content compliments each other. I can't imagine hearing "f &k tha police" in the same rhyme scheme as "let's get free". Makes no sense.     RHH2: Do you want more? is the best produced Roots album. Common would not have been sick in the roots. He is perfect just the way he is. I think Talib Kweli could have benefitted as part of the roots though.|`|PdeMbEMEaa	cee lo, common and black thought would be crazy with the roots

zYKb2Msmaa	Let me be honest with you, as I been in this situation before.  I have had girls that I was interested in and they weren't interested in me.  The best thing I did was "ignored" them and showed no interest.  A couple of them, approached me.  Don't be soo eager.  Back off a little and you might see a difference.  You have nothing to lose.  Try it|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	If a guy doesn't want to talk to you then that means he's not interested in you.

V8Fpgd9maa	me, and so has the Hollywood media:  TV & movies have pushed the sexual envelope and encourage young kids to engage in behaviors that have kept Y!A message boards very busy.|`|YsAEPYwOaa	I think it has, but only on some levels.  I don't listen to rap music unless its by Jay-Z.|`|y6406A92aa	Meh, maybe just a little..|`|fus54EX3aa	current rap music is garbage! all main stream rappers rap about is money, bit*hes, and drugs! which makes fro a shitty society! back in the day rappers rapped about a purpose and a meaning! give me some Grandmaster flash, public enemy, Nwa, Run DMC, and (some) 2pac any day of the week!|`|NBXY35zPaa	Don't blame Hip Hop, even though it's f*ckin WHACK these days... There's crap in ALL sorts of genres that lead to youth corruption. As far as rap having in role in that, yeah if you think life is all about cars, making women your side slaves, wearing ridiculous jewelry, and making crap music, then of course youth listeners will incorporate that into their lifestyle. Old school Hip Hop had so much more meaning...|`|D8OzQwXKaa	yea in the youth, they see these rappers in videos and think "man i wanna be like him" cause they see money being thrown around, girls with big bootys and "pimped out rides". so they find out how they "did" it and try to do the same things like be on the streets, steal etc.|`|AA11490975	Current rap in almost all subgenres (even "underground") seems to lack what made the music so good in the 80s and 90s.   Half the time, most of the rappers haven't experienced the things they spit about.  When I listen to something new, I simply mutter, "been there...done that."     It was an anti-establishment music that spoke from the streets.  Now, either the streets are degenerates or the rappers are just a tool in a long corporate enterprise.

Hitler was a deranged maniac.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yeah the similarities are pretty disturbing.|`|WO1jgqWqaa	He sounds (and acts)  EXACTLY like Hitler. What people who think Holocaust when they think Hitler tend to forget (if they ever even knew in the first place) is that in the beginning of his reign Hitler was very popular and well-liked, in fact that is the very reason that he was so successful in gradually gaining more and more power and the way he gained popularity is the exact same way that Obama has and, just like Hitler, Obama has his supporters throougly convinced that is the best leader in the history of mankind. The only thing missing now is concentration camps for anyone who dares oppose his ideaologies, and the way things are going I wouldn't put it past him.    Frog M- The way he talks about Republicans isn't that far from the way Hitler talked about Jews.|`|WodlreGLaa	Nope.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	No but you sound like a right wing nut.|`|59iSPST0aa	NO|`|MMBZYhu6aa	Not sure...Can't watch videos at work...but your speech is up to par with George W.! - I wouldn't be proud of that either!|`|SgfBzfIqaa	no, why would he? what makes him sound evil to you? he hasn't even been prez for a year yet =/|`|rptP7ynpaa	no!  hitler was a white supremesist anyway dude|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Nope|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Well, if you fall for the power of suggestion that easily, then yes, I'm sure Obama does sound like Hitler to you.

TlcMyJeuaa	Maybe the dog beat them at Boggle three times in a row.|`|QJ19OBCbaa	Everyone knows that before they were domesticated, dogs in the wild would build themselves spacious townhouses, complete with home theaters and bowling alleys to take shelter from rain.

"With modern medicine, people are having kids in their 40s and even up until their late 40s. In their 50s, they're having their second child," she says.

If you still feel that way for her in a few months or even years, you might know that it's meant to be. This is coming from experience though because I went out with my best guy friend and it was so awkward around him I broke up with him. Once you start dating her, you'll want desperately for things to go back the way they were, even though you don't want to hurt her.
h9U55JAFaa	Well personally im a fan of the old Lil Wayne. The one who didn't use the Auto-Tune. I liked Lil Wayne's music from when he was with the hot boys to Tha Carter II. I admit Tha Carter III has started to grow on me but he really should just stick to rap because I can't see him doing good rock music and im getting really tired of hearing him just make noises and moan in auto-tune.|`|VdtZKYynaa	hes a queer|`|PeI3umPbaa	Let him switch to rock. This way Wayne is out of the picture and hip hop can breathe easier at night.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	god of rap and rock|`|O1OmS7rKaa	U Mean dedication 3 and its not an album its a mixtape . damnn lil wayne lost it .... wtf is that nga thinkinnn.  he needs 2 lay lo on thos drugs..|`|dDhMadf4aa	Sell out..his music got bad once lollipop came out anyway like what does he talk about thats so important that makes him best rapper alive?|`|983fe5ad295bcdda0b7056d9ebad8b93aa	1. Lil Wayne is NOT the best  2. He moans in each of his songs  3. His lyrics are nothing special, same thing over and over  4. He *trying* to approach a more diverse audience, but will fail at that too|`|m9vr74gyaa	It's not really rock, I think your just lookin at the main-stream, the radio stuff, hes still putting out hardcore RAP mixtapes n still being featured in songs of Hip Hop, ever since let it rock, people think now he is rock, haha when he says rockstar, all rappers say that, because they admire rockstars and they're lifestyle. If your opinion is he doe srock now, watever, but trust me, not trying to argue, but he is deffinately still a rapper, go look up some 2009 lil wayne songs, they are Hip Hop!|`|l7fiAHRLaa	I hope it's better then "Prom Queen", lyrics destroyed that song...

I have to play for my church and sing at the same time and its my first time so im scared.    just dont be nervous and forget all the stress just relax and forget what people think plus they wont remember what happens now later in life so thats what i use when i want to do a speech i just say everyone will forget about it and then i dont get scared and then they dont think twice because you act confident.    so yeah i feel happy for you at least you have the motivation to be in a band most people just listen to music i like to play it too.|`|xpzBOxrraa	Sorry but this is a little silly, and yeah im answering it so technically that makes me and idiott but ayy.. im going through more than the average teenager does atm too, and tbh it doesnt really get any better. but you learn to live with it i guess, things happen for a reason and things fall apart so others call fall together. learning a musical instrument will help take your mind off things so, thats a start. keep it up, im sure your greatt :) and im sure your mates do care, even if they dont show it.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	um im confused

AiCyr7Ycaa	Look at "I kissed a girl". Catchy song overall.  Depends on the singer or band.  I come from the Beatles, Elvis and underground.  Country is mostly in balance with love found love lost songs with great words and lyrics.  Look at MnM with the slim shady song.  Some songs like Queen with Bohemian Rhapsody which is brilliant in every department. Even the beat of the song changes with the emotions the killer is feeling!  Really depends on the song...  Ronny|`|AA11333930	First comes the beat, then the lyrics    A song could be popular but say nothing but crap.|`|IAXhu2tuaa	The lyrics for me. Most of the time I don't even know what they are singing. Sometimes I wonder if that has a subliminal effect.|`|apmgNq59aa	Generally songs that have great lyrics and a not so catchy beat aren't as successful. A combination of great lyrics and great beats makes a successful song. But I seriously don't like songs that are popular whose lyrics are mediocre at best.|`|fkG4cflhaa	For me if the beat is catchy...the lyrics will follow.|`|qN6GIs5daa	The beat first then the lyric second of course.

Thats 25 years * 183 days= 4575 times (this is the min)  If they do it once a day: 25*365=9125 times  If they do it twice a day: 25*2*365=18250 times (this is the max)    If the porn star is an absolute sexfreak and starts at the age of 18 and end at the age of 60 and has sex 2  times a day: 42*2*365= 30660 what's very sick.|`|qpxPW5paaa	It depends on the length of the career, most people are only in porn for 1-3 years.

ACiTb0c0aa	The Dark Knight is a good movie, but the Academy would never give a prestigious nomination for a super hero/action movie. The film it self and Christopher Nolan didn't have a chance for best picture or best director. The fans will have to be pleased with Heath Ledger's nomination, he will represent the movie very well at the Oscars. I wasn't expecting The Reader for best picture, but it is truly a great movie, with big performances by Kate Winslet and Ralf Fiennes, who was ignored again by the Academy.|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	Personally, I didn't think it was so much different from every other superhero movie.  I don't think it was Oscar worthy really.He was fun to watch though.|`|5acRPOUPaa	yes|`|BKybwvF5aa	Yes it totally deserved a nomination! I can't believe that it didn't get one! Out of all the Batman movies ever made The Dark Knight was the best! The effects, the storyline and the actors were all fantastic in this movie.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I don't know why it didn't get nominated for Best Picture. That's such bull. But then again, I've never seen The Reader and The Curious Case Of Benjamen Button.|`|TGWETA8caa	Yes it was excellent in story and execution. It was great. The plot made sense, the direction was viewable, unlike most action movies these days, and overall Heath Ledger was great.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Yes, it should have. But pretty much any time you make a movie about the holocaust that grosses a lot of money, you'll get a best picture nod. I think one actor even told Kate Winslet a couple years ago that she should make a holocaust movie because she'd get an Oscar in jest, and now look what is nominated. I'm not saying the movie isn't moving or anything, but I think Dark Knight was a better movie. It was just executed better and had better performances. Content shouldn't matter so much as how the content was executed to me. I'd watch a well acted comedy movie than a stiffly acted war movie anytime, and just because it's a war movie, I don't think that should automatically make it better than the comedy.|`|Kh0d5Uweaa	Of course it does......    Heath ledger played my character fantastically!    it was definatley robbed of the many awards is deserves!

2dke6ChJaa	Celentano was born in Milan at 14 Via Gluck (about which he later wrote the song "Il ragazzo della via Gluck"). His parents were from Puglia and had moved North to work.    Before starting his singing career, in Milan the metropolitan legend remembered Celentano as student of Ghigo Agosti (European rock pioneer) during his music show in north Italy around 1955-1956 with the exordial guitarist Giorgio Gaber.    Heavily influenced by his idol Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock revolution, he is also known as the most famous dancer of the Hula hoop fad. For the last 40 years he has retained his popularity in Italy, selling millions of records and appearing in numerous TV shows and movies. In the latter respect, he has also been a creator of a comic genre, with his characteristic walking and his facial expressions. For the most part, his films were commercially successful; indeed in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, he was the king of the Italian box office in low budget movies. As an actor, critics point to Serafino (1968), directed by Pietro Germi, as his best performance.    As a director he frequently casts Ornella Muti, Eleonora Giorgi and his wife Claudia Mori. He and Claudia are the parents of Rosita, Rosalinda Celentano, most notable to worldwide audiences for playing the Satan character in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, and Giacomo Celentano. He also often works as a host on several Italian television shows.    He has released 40 albums: 29 studio albums, 3 live albums and 8 compilations. His most famous song is "Azzurro", with lyrics by Paolo Conte, released in 1968 and covered by numerous musicians since.|`|xrAb9L7yaa	look him up on wikipedia.com they will have tons of info

From here on after let's stay the way we are right now,  And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow.    [Chorus:]  I cross my heart and promise to  Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true.  In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine.    You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete,  And as long as there's a breath in me, I'll make yours just as sweet.  As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see,  So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be.    [Chorus]    And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm,  You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm.

I was born in the fifties so she was big when I was in my early teens. Marilyn was extreemly sexy without even trying, and in fact was brilliant at acting.  Comparing her to Anna Nicole Smith is like saying Buck wheat was as good an actor as Will Smith.  Before you slam her too hard maybe you should watch some of the films she was in.  Yes she played a dumb blond, but she did it so very well for a lady that wasn't dumb at all.  If you ask a movie critic you'll be surprised by what they say about her. Yes, she had her issues, but you would too if you had the world breathing down your neck 24/7.  And yes, she was vey sexy.  If she could be cloned there would be thousands of men waiting in line to get their copy!  Some women have it and most don't.  She had a double helping of Oooo  La La.  She was one of Hollywoods blond bomb shells, and to have Elton John write a song about her tells it all.    The song is Candle in the Wind, and if you listen to the lyrics you'll understand peoples attraction to her.  "She had the grace to hold herself while those around her crawled"

HZxX9ke8aa	moon in pisces = a very romantic person who believes in love. ascendant scorpio and sun leo could add this intensity, passion and playfulness too. this person could be quite "interesting" for others at first sight but hard to deal with. you can end up with a hysteric indivuduality even. but since you said there's grand trine between them, that's not really possible i guess. where's mars?|`|qNKK4hLDaa	oh how interesting, i'm a leo sun with scorpio ascendant (i can relate to the pisces moon though; it's my moon sign in vedic astrology)    is there really a grand trine between all three?  i'm pretty sure you would need a cancer sun lol.    you can probably pick up negative emotions easily, or predict others easily.  that's the doing of your moon in pisces trine scorpio ascendant, but also nice at heart (leo sun... but scorpio is one of the most intense rising signs to have, and it's square to your inner self(aka sun sign).  so what you do/how you handle situations may not always be what you REALLY want to do.  for example, you might really feel like you hate someone after they did something hurtful to you, and the next day you might be like "oh its ok tehehe" but really you'll be like "i'm never forgetting that", and i'm guessing that you'll WANT to hold grudges but have some kind of trouble holding them.  just a guess!)    lets seee, well one thing that happened to me today was people kept talking to me, which i'm kind of flattered by, but then it just got annoying cause i didn't wanna talk to them.  so maybe you enjoy attention (i'm not saying you enjoy the spotlight, or being put on it nonetheless), but only when YOU want it?    your moon in pisces and scorpio ascendant make you a very good listener/support /shouldertocryon, and your leo sun can make you warm hearted, so i'm GUESSING that these your signs blend well together.  just watch out for that scorpio ascendant square to your leo sun!  besides that, i'm not sure what else to say|`|cuIX13BKaa	Here you have two fixed signs. ...Scorpio and leo and one mutable sign. Many would agree/disagree that you need the degrees for all of this and the house placements but i will wing it....Saying that there is a grand trine between them all Leo is not a part of the mix as it is Fire. Pisces and Scorpio are both water signs.....a grand trine is an even number of degrees in this case a Triangle The dominant theme here is that they are all dominant signs but this is no grand trine with these houses alone. Everything melds into everything else in and with astrology. Though all of these are strong, and I mean REALLY strong....it does NOT show a grand trine.    Thanks  Garbo

I'd be grateful! Esp. because my dog Barkey always knocks her water over...she's a klutz.|`|9ypR324laa	Let me guess.  You're either a natural blonde or are just looking for attention.    Sorry.  But unless the dog is on some really weird sort of medication that requires limitations of drinking water I think your landlady would be grateful.  And if her dog were on some medication that required close monitoring of water then if she had had any witts about her would nofify you of the fact.    It's a really hot day.  Obviously you live somewhere else entirely different.  Congratulations.    You don't think your land lady likes you very much?  Likely because you care more for critters than she does.  Might want to point that out to her when you move.|`|jDgU9qzjaa	No, I think that is a very nice thing to do.  Good for you!|`|kTCsnbO2aa	I give you a star, thumbs up, and a long hug for kindness to animals.

I hate when that happens because I know as soon as the "drunk" feeling goes away the hangover is about to start.|`|nAKOfHNGaa	heck ya and i would do it again|`|JGrpDLKcaa	Indeed I have. Drunk, and/or high on occasion.    If you wait until you "feel sober" then go to bed, you have little hangover in the morning. Staying awake an hour or two longer (which goes by quickly when you're intoxicated) and drinking lots of water, is worth not feeling like trash in the morning.|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Yep, many, many times..............|`|1UMKmxgcaa	I never get hangovers either.

S6AjZ2uMaa	I honestly do not understand why someone would put that into a movie. There's scary/horror scenes, then there are the rape scenes. It has NO PLACE in a movie of any genre... It is a sick, disgusting, and violent crime. Why any producer would assume it would do anything but detract from a movie is beyond me... After watching the first Hills have eyes I was thoroughly put off... But I watched the second one in hopes they got enough negative attention to not make that mistake twice... How wrong I was. If there is a third Hills Have Eyes I will not be viewing it...|`|bCxgyuzLaa	I totally hate that! The rape itself is horrifying. I think the same thing too. The makers of these horror movies seem to think we enjoy cuz it's in every one. That's why I check IMDB.com's parental guide first. It tells you about that sort of thing. Thank god for that.|`|tLI94qWNaa	I hate it so much, that is what will turn me off from watching the movie, or even liking it once I am done seeing it.  I think it is just disgusting and it is disturbing and horrifying.|`|gU4zcPAaaa	its so annoying !  especially when your like watching it with your parents and its just like OH LOOK NAKED GIRL OR LOOK PEOPLE HAVING SEX!  its so awkward.    & im pretty sure there are other ways to make the movie scary.
IaKWLh1baa	not many pieces uses a pipe organ, because it is intended for a sort of heavy-load music, and the Only thing I know that goes well with a pipe organ is an orchestra.  When other instrument combined with the  pipe organ, it will be weird.|`|283tO9j9aa	I don't know of any that use it now, although Iron Butterfly used one for In A Gadda Da Vida. Nightwish use synthesisers that mimic the sound of organs. They've done a cover of Phantom of the Opera that shows it off quite well.

I just, mmm    It starts in my toes  Makes me crinkle my nose  Wherever it goes  I always know  That you make me smile  Please stay for a while now  Just take your time  Wherever you go    I've been asleep for a while now  You tucked me in just like a child now  'Cause every time you hold me in your arms  I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth    It starts in my soul  And I lose all control  When you kiss my nose  The feelin' shows  'Cause you make me smile  Baby just take your time now  Holdin' me tight    Wherever, wherever, where ever you go  Wherever, wherever, where ever you go  wherever you go, i always know  that you make me smile,  just for awhile..     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PWfB4lur...|`|cSpTN4Wpaa	wait, what are you asking?

IatEdBpvaa	I really enjoyed both.  Two different styles yet each one hit me right.  I like it.    BA:  Honestly I have no clue.  I can't be bothered anymore with following what is ahead of the curve.  Whether it's from 40 years ago (which is about the age of the last album I bought or just put out yesterday) as long as it's got soul of some kind it's good with me.    I will say though that the new Don Caballero is pretty sweet.  I'm just not sure if that was this year or last year.|`|ayS0085raa	First one: nice glasses, nice yelping.  Second one: my favourite of the two, trippy, great sound overall, and preferred the vocals (still nothing wrong with a bit of yelping though).    thank your mate down the pub for me :)    BA: Dead Kids or Everything Everything. (hang on, maybe not the top...)    *RW - Doves broke up?!? oh, well...|`|yjSGVfdiaa	Both were awesome - never heard of either.  Definitely gonna have to write down those names and seek out some more.    BA:  Animal Collective's new one is glorious.  Looking forward to PJ Harvey's latest collab, as well as the reunited Doves (although that single is pretty bad... so my sights have leveled off a bit there).  The new Thermals has been taking forever... and Sonic Youth on Matador should be kick***.  Don't know much about debuts so far though...
rFmBtm3eaa	Fender Telecaster or Stratocaster. The Strat looks better in my opinion. Your price range is cutting it close on a good new guitar. There is nothing wrong with buying a used one if you know what things to look for as far as possible defects.  With the economy as it is you can probably find some pretty good deals in your local newspaper classifieds or pawn shops.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I'd rather have one that sounds good, instead of looks good, but idk the answer to your question, i don't have a guitar. So if I were you i'd go with the one that sounds good.
0UzfriZoaa	Priceless. But one must always to take care and be there to those special friends ( or lover, family members...) otherwise it's not quite fair and some day, when you least expect, you turn around and find out that you're alone. It's very reassuring just know that you have someone special that will be always there for you. To be that person, in the other hand, sometimes it's not that easy. So, if you really care and mind that rock that is always there, don't forget to take good care of it    Pardon my grammar sins, please...and have a nice day...|`|F6eMQETlaa	We all need a rock to keep us balanced.

[Verse 1]     She's starin' at me,   I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin'.   Mmmmm   Nobody's talkin',   'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin'.   Ohhh...   And now is I'm yellin' over her,   She's yellin' over me.   All that that means   Is neither of us is listening,   (And what's even worse).   That we don't even remember why were fighting.     So both of us are mad for...     [Hook]     Nothin'   (Fighting for).   Nothin'   (Crying for).   Nothin'   (Whoahhh).   But we won't let it go for   Nothin'   (No not for)   Nothin'.   This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.   Ohhh, baby...     I know sometimes   It's gonna rain...   But baby, can we make up now   'Cause I can't sleep through the pain   (Cant sleep through the pain).     [Chorus]     Girl, I don't wanna go to bed   (Mad at you),   And I don't want you to go to bed   (Mad at me).   No, I don't wanna go to bed   (Mad at you),   And I don't want you to go to bed   (Mad at me)   Ohhh no no no...     [Verse 2]     And it gets me upset, girl   When you're constantly accusing.   (Askin' questions like you've already known).   We're fighting this war, baby   When both of us are losing.   (This ain't the way that love is supposed to go).     Whoaaaaaaaaa...   [What happened to workin' it out] .   We've falled into this place   Where you ain't backin' down   And I ain't backin' down.     So what the hell do we do now...   It's all for...     [Hook]     Nothin'   (Fighting for).   Nothin'   (Crying for).   Nothin'   (Whoahhh).   But we won't let it go for   Nothin'   (No not for)   Nothin'.   This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.   Ohhh, baby...     I know sometimes   It's gonna rain...

No, I don't wanna go to bed   (Mad at you),   And I don't want you to go to bed   (Mad at me)   Ohhh no no no...     [Bridge]     Oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect,   (Perfect, perfect, oh oh).   And just how good it's gonna be.   We can't fuss and we can't fight   Long as everything alright between us   Before we go to sleep.     Baby, we're gonna be happy.     I know sometimes   It's gonna rain...   But baby, can we make up now   'Cause I can't sleep through the pain   (Cant sleep through the pain).

Yw1k1W19aa	Well, you list ten questions but begin by asking 'what are they?', so I'll start there.    Tarot cards are actually playing cards. They were created in the mid 15th century for the Milanese court by adding adding a fifth suit of picture cards to the existing pack of Latin suited playing cards. These extra cards took as their theme a Christian triumph procession, hence their early name trionfi, meaning triumphs and from which we get our word trump. It was the invention of tarot that marked the introduction of trumps in card games - and that was their original use, card games. For 350 years they were used for nothing else and the games continue to be played throughout continental Europe today.    The number of cards can vary more than people realize. There is an early example of a pack with 80 cards but most have 78. However, notable exceptions include the Florentine Minchiate, which has 97 cards - though this game is no longer played. In Sicily they play games with a 64 card pack and in Bologna, a 62 card pack - both of these regions use unique packs with unusual arrangement of trumps.    At the end of the 18th century, Parisian occultist Antoine Court de Gebelin found a pack of tarot cards and, ignorant of their true origin, invented one about their coming from Ancient Egypt and suggested a method of divination. For about 100 years, these notions were limited to France but at the end of the 19th century, some British occultists brought them to the English speaking world, where the games were unknown.    Without an occult origin, fortune telling with tarot cards is no different in kind from using dominoes, tea leaves, or knuckle bones. You must decide for yourself if you can take these seriously. However, there are objections made to the notion of knowing the future by both science and philosophy because it is subject to the same logical problems and paradoxes as time travel.    At the end of the day, the various methods and interpretations that people use to read the cards are all the products of human inventions - there are many methods and interpretations published and one is as good as another. There are no demons or religions involved, and no dangers - this is a pack of playing cards. You can use whatever method you like, you can invent a method yourself, it will be no less (or more) valid than any of those published.    Personally, I think you might find the games more rewarding and enjoyable than the fortune telling. However, if you would like to try fortune telling then try this site:    http://www.aeclectic.net|`|aCCUQQu4aa	Wow you are asking for a ton of info here.  First off, the tarot actually follows a story to explain each of the cards and it all starts with "the Fool" starting out on his journey.  Along the way he meets several people who give him advice and experiences along the way.  When the reader is giving a reading, they use the experience of "the fool" to help the quarry.    1> There are 2 parts to the tarot deck.  The major Arcana which tells the story of the fool (21 cards) and the minor Arcana (56 cards).                 The minor Arcana is then divided into 4 parts                            1. cups =emotions                            2. wands= action                            3.  swords = feelings                           4. pentacles= money or material things                 during the days of the witch burnings, tarot readers modified the original tarot deck to just the minor arcana cards and that is how regular playing cards came into existence, minus the page cards. FYI    2. There are different layouts of the cards that can be used, depending on how detailed you want the reading to be.  But for the most part you can lay out 3 cards side by side.  You cannot read each card individually, they must be read as a group.  For example many people are afraid of the death card...all that card means is possibly the death of old ideas, or the end of something possibly a trial...each card has a different meaning, and too much to go into here...    3. You do not need special skills to read them, just a firm understanding of each card...some people teach classes and there are also books that have the info as well.  I recommend having a deck available when learning so that you can look at each card as you learn it.    4. Tarot cards are not evil, some people who use them are.  No need to call upon anything but your own open mind.    5. You do not need any props, just a deck of tarot cards.    6. You do not have to be part of any group to read them, you just have to be open minded enough to want to read them.    7. Tarot reading is not dangerous in any way.  Try to learn to read them for good.  Some people read them in the reverse (if the card is upside down it means the opposite) I try to avoid this.  Tarot reading is just supposed to be a guide to answer a problem, not to create new ones.    8. I did not think so at the beginning, but was pleasantly surprised, they are really enlightening.    9. It helps to meditate or to pray so that you do not close yourself off to a possible answer or direction, but not required    10. You would shuffle your deck, then ask your question, then cut the deck 4 ways and re stack them.  There are different layouts wherein each position each card is placed has a different meaning (present, past, future, thoughts, etc.)    If this is something you are interested in, I would really suggest to start off by reading a book on tarot, which includes the meanings of each card.  If you can find a metaphysical shop in your area, go there and just ask if they know where you can take a class or get more information.  Just keep this in mind...Tarot is supposed to bring answers and be a guide...no reading is set in stone because we change our paths with every choice we make.  Tarot is not supposed to bring problems.  Hope this helps...you can contact me if you want.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello    1. There are 78 cards in a tarot deck.    2.

A few years ago, tarot cards would have conjured up images of Gypsies, who didn't begin using tarot cards until the 20th century. Today, the cards are popular among occultists and New Agers in all walks of life. According to Grillot de Givry (1971):      The tarot is one of the most wonderful of human inventions. Despite all the outcries of philosophers, this pack of pictures, in which destiny is reflected as in a mirror with multiple facets, remains so vital and exercises so irresistible an attraction on imaginative minds that it is hardly possible that austere critics who speak in the name of an exact but uninteresting logic should ever succeed in abolishing its employment.    The modern tarot deck has been traced back to 15th-century Italy and a trick-taking game called "triumphs" (tarots in French; Decker 1996). The traditional tarot deck consists of two sets of cards, one having 22 pictures (the major arcana), such as the Fool, the Devil, Temperance, the Hermit, the Sun, the Lovers, the Hanged Man, and Death. The other set (the minor arcana) has 56 cards with kings (or lords), queens (or ladies),  knights, and knaves (pages or servants) of sticks (or wands, cudgels or batons) , swords,  cups and coins.    There are many different tarot decks used in cartomancy.  The meanings of the figures and numbers on tarot cards vary greatly among tarot readers and advocates, many of  whom find connections between tarot and cabala, astrology, I Ching, ancient Egypt, and various other occult and mystical notions.    The oldest playing cards date back to 10th-century China, but the four suits of tarot and modern playing cards probably originated with a 14th-century Muslim deck (Decker). According to de Givry, in the modern 52-card deck of ordinary playing cards, sticks or wands = clubs (and announce news); swords = spades (and presage unhappiness and death); cups = hearts (and presage happiness); coins = diamonds (and presage money). According to Ronald Decker, the Muslim sticks represented polo sticks. As Europeans were not yet familiar with polo, they changed the suit of sticks to that of wands, cudgels, or batons.    Tarot cards are usually read by a fortune-teller, though in these days of New Age Enterprise, anyone can buy a deck with instructions on how to discover your real self and actualize your true potential. Why anyone's fate would be mysteriously contained in playing cards is a mystery; although, sympathetic magic seems to play a role.     There is a romantic irresistibility to the notion of shuffling the cards and casting one's fate, to putting one's cards on the table for all to see, to drawing into the unknown, to having one's life laid out and explained by strangers who have the gift of clairvoyance, to gamble on the future, and so on. The idea of staring at a picture card and letting it reveal the future or mirror the soul is not one that austere critics are likely to find tantalizing, but the thought of such visionary mysticism obviously has its attraction. Centuries of scientific advancement and learning have not diminished the popularity of occult guidance systems such as the tarot, Ouija boards, astrology, I Ching, palmistry, iridology, reflexology, ink blots, graphology, enneagrams, crystal balls, tea leaves, and the like.    Edit: More to your 10 questions.    3. Remember. this is paranormal ability that you or anyone else can buy. There a lots of decks you can buy. Some with nice art work. Also you can buy lots of books that tell you how to read. The key word is buy. What makes tarots so special? The cardboard from magic trees? The ink? How much does magic ink cost and where can it be bought? I've been to a place that mass prints cards. They also make cereal boxes on the same presses. Does that mean the boxes have magic too? Is a case of these safe to handle?  4. Why not? If you can make them useful for evil purposes it's better than nothing.  5. Tarot cards ARE THE PROPS. Like other divination's, it uses randomness for it's predicting.  6. It's 100% belief. As much as a religion.  7. No more than a Magic 8 Ball. Except you may drop the ball on you foot. Ouch!  8. No evidence that they are better than the 8 Ball.  9. Nope. If they did everyone would buy a deck and be doing spreads every morning at Starbucks.  10. Before you deal, jump around and do hand stands. Gets you to burn some calories.
AA12226501	I didn't learn to shoot until college -but I became a sharpshooter. What matters isn't how early you learn something, but how well you learn it. Where I live (NYC) this would never be accepted as a requirement for graduation in a public school.|`|6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	Are you trying to recreate Columbine or something?|`|90877616d47129b0c2c87f6d63b53f65aa	so there can be a slaughter as graduation... no i don't think it's a good idea... that's why there are classes that you have to pay for|`|87yovKYlaa	well they already know how to shoot off their mouth so i think they are half way there.  edit: oh i agree with you, after being in a 6 day black out with no heat or power and the food we had went bad without power i think everyone should be taught basic survival skills. during the ice storm there were no berries and stuff to pick, so we had to hunt, make a fire and survive the old fashioned way. in that sense then yes i do think they need to be able to shoot a gun...for hunting, but they also need to be taught how to clean and prepare the food too as part of a survival skills class.|`|519f86c6bb67a03278f5cb12031d6128aa	I think it is wise to know how to handle a gun and various other weapons however I don't think that most high school students are mature enough to be freely given a weapon.  I however could clean, load, and shoot a .22 by the age of seven.  I am all for it.      And for all the people who are so anti gun, I hope you house gets broken into tonight and your family tied up.  Then when you have no way to defend yourself I will laugh.|`|7RFxH5daaa	how about no...|`|1UMKmxgcaa	I think if you want to learn to shoot go to a high crime area public school.

A couple of weeks ago there was a shooting that never made it too the press. A 13-year-old girl was home alone one saturday when 2 men broke into her house. one went downstairs, the other upstairs. as she was walking down the stairs (with her dad's riffle), the two men confronted her. She shoot the first and killed him and the other was fatally wounded and died at the hospital. Little did they know that this girl was taught how to shoot her daddys riffle and was a junior trap shooting champion.    Another thing like this happened a couple of weeks ago too. A woman in her later years was very angry at 2 men for raping her granddaughter. she took a picture of the men and took the pic to her granddaughter. she confirmed that these were the men. she went home, got her pistol, and went to the place where the 2 men were staying. When the first man opened the door, she blew of his rocks and his dingdong. the second man was luckier. only his rocks were shoot off.|`|vzWGml26aa	high schools should not be who teaches that. the parents should send kids to a shooting range to learn that a gun can kill and how bad they are. there are a few clubs in this world that do teach kids the way guns are.|`|0K9p9OPfaa	Well thats a very silly thought.

GNkVbUooaa	That is a pretty old and more obscure title. Most sites only upload really popular movies and new releases.     BUT i did a search for you on OVGuide and put the direct link below. If the video is anywhere on the Internet OVGuide will be able to find it for you .. They are a directory to 3500+ free online video sites, and you can search through all of them for a particular title. It is the best site i know of for watching movies and tv shows online..|`|TjPh4Rm0aa	i usually use watch-movies.net but they're down for repairs.

12QJ9QMRaa	Lyrically, I would say a fair percentage of Grindcore and Brutal Death.    I look at the Lyrics of Bands like Cannibal Corpse, or others, and I think... "People actually think this is cool?"  Honestly..maybe when I was 13, because then the more gore, the more hard core, the more REAL and awesome.  And then you grow up.  Maybe you witness a murder, a driveby.  Go to war.  Watch a friend die in front of your eyes, and suddenly, you grow up and find these things are not even apealling as a "joke".    Also, there are plenty who DO sadly take the lyrics and image of their favorite bands to heart.  People say music has no influence, but I say that that is an offbase comment.  How can one listen to lyrics that spew hatred for a particular Race, Religion or Culture and not be affected?  I have friends who love Burzum, which musically I can appreciate.  Unfortunately, being of Jewish decent I find little interesting or amusing in a man who preaches the extermination of my bloodline.  And if you look at teh number of church burnings in Sweden linked to his fans, no it is no "harmless".    To me, things like that are too much.  Now, I will definitely get TDs for saying this, but as someone who actually has very strong religious beliefs, that apply in my life on days BESIDES Sunday, I do not listen to Satanic Metal.  And no I am not talking about Slayer, where they don't preach it, but do explore it, but bands like Gorgoroth.  I find it personally detestable.  I am not going to judge those who DO listen to it, but I find it highly hypocritical of those who persecute me for choosing NOT to listen.  Especially since at one time in my life I practiced both Lucifereanism, LeVay Satanism and Wiccan beliefs.    Those are where I take musci as going too far for ME.  Where others choose to go is their decision, but I believe it is my right to choose whether or not I want to go with them on that journey.      MUSICALLY it goes too far for me when the music is undifferentiated noise, just Blastbeats and distortions with unintelligable screeching, growling or pig squeels.  That would be a goodly percentage of Black Metal and DeathCore for me, as well as a large percentage of GrindCore and Brutal Death.    I simply on the average, find nothing appealling about those Genres, for the most part.  There are exceptions, but I prefer to find them on my own than to have others ram them down my throat in an attempt to "enlighten" me.       I'm 33, have listened to Metal for 23 of those years, I think I might just know what I like and dislike by now, and what I personally find acceptable.    One of the reasons I like your stuff S>T    On the otherside is MOST Top 40 radio.  The reason the term "Bubblegum" was coined for Pop music is that while it might seem real sweet at first, and satisfying, the flavor quickly fades away, and either you are left chewing on a flavorless glob, or you need a new piece of Gum.  The same goes for Pop Music.    Plus, so much of it is just absoutely talentless.  My goodness, how does a song like "My Humps" or "Start a Fight" even GET on the radio in the first place?  Repetitive, nails on chalkboard crap like that or Panic! at the Disco have come far closer to setting me into a rage than Death Metal EVER has!    Good question, BTW.      ***Tron...in real life I some times get told I talk too much, so...........      ; ]|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Alesana are the perfect band for me!    Their screaming is of the really high pitched kind and the clean vocalist has a high navally voice...    I can stand them for bout three songs then I have top switch over....they are a sweet band though :)    Alesana - Apology (live)  http://au.youtube..com/watch?v=mOIxt5Rgg...    PEACE|`|UnsZKr4saa	Nokturnal Mortum.    They have a very good grip on Symphonic Black Metal.  There are plenty of keyboards in their albums, which add to the atmosphere and provide some incredible melodies.  They also add a nice folky sound to their music.  They also add some very unconventional instruments to their music, making them original as well.      That being said, they are also part of the NSBM movement, which means that they condone the Nazi Socialist movement in their lyrics and album covers.  Some of their lyrics are incredibly outrageous and racist, making me cringe every time.  I hate to have my personal feelings come into play when I judge music, but this band is clearly too much for me to handle.|`|ibDadEHDaa	a few things  mostly, this'll stem from my fear of j-rock  if you ever look at any of the musicians, it will scar you for the rest of your life, in addition to the stories about some of the musicians. Lots of cross-dressing and occasionally, from i hear, fan service sex tapes (gay sex tapes, but that's not why i despise them i don't like sex tapes, gay or straight b/c its just a ploy to get attention)    also, their voices sound creepy as hell. in addition, their music ranges from hard rock to friggin ballads.|`|OXvH2CgLaa	THURSDAY!!!!!!!!!!!    They are one of the best bands ever! Geoff Rickly is an epic epic EPIC musician. He writes some of the best lyrics ever! 10-years in the making and this band still rocks hard =)    I will be a Thursday fan until the day I die.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I really find myself thinking that same way with black metal in general. It really takes me to be in a certain mood to do more than just hit the surface of the genre. If I'm in the right mood I will listen to more of the underground black metal bands but a lot of the time I just stick with bands like Dimmu Borgir and Satyricon.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Alice Cooper becoming a born again christian|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	There is stuff like that for me. Actually a lot of stuff I can only really get into if I'm in a very specific mood. One, along the lines of what you're talking about is Melt Banana. They're this Japanese noise rock band that is incredibly noisy and the singer's voice can get incredibly obnoxious, but they are just so damned good at making really neat, crazy noise that they can be completely awesome in the right mood.    On another side, Aimee Mann is a really great songwriter. She sings very nicely and there is a real just great quality to her music. That said, it's so contemporary that it's just a bit too soft sometimes. She may be the one who I regard as doing contemporary right, but contemporary is still contemporary and sometimes it's just not enough.|`|u8ia6oKxaa	some great answers here, especially KP ( I don't know how you write soo much on most your answers)    Most bands will not bother me too much, but believe it or not, I tend to stay away from bands with blatently blasphemous lyrics.  Of course since I am a big black metal fan (probably own over 100 BM cds), that could be somewhat hypocritical of me, BUT most I find have lyrics of evil, darkness rather than straight satansim.  The only band I really like with those ideals is "Dissection" but maybe I ignore the lyrical content and focus more on the music.    As far as music, I find some of the Deathcore bands with Pig Squeals and random noise is just way to over the top for me|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	STW!!!    dude I sh** you not just this after noon I was like thinking "I haven't seen STW in while wonder what hes up to" =)    For me its VOCALS Primary    2nd Lyrical RANTS ummmm, ohhhh....... TOOL is an example    3rd yes even me THAT'S RIGHT ME... being TOO REPETITIVE.  Like the Technical Death Metal band Sleep Terror even tho I love Luke J. and his band.    as far as vocals I love Defeated Sanity a tech. death metal band but I hate the vocals. The Low Low Low Low Low GRRRGGGHHHHH  RHHHHHHAHHHRRGGHHHHHH  GRRRRGGHHHHH =P    Black Metal period is too much the vocals and all the Tremolo Picking    so in Metal and Metal related bands that's when its too much    as far as Mainstream Led Zep and The Beatles is just too much before I even pop it in the media player    EDIT  and I hear you about Marduk I can relate

If he is thinking of marrying someone else, then how could he genuinely love you, or the other girl for that matter? He only loves himself and wants to make a drama to make himself feel good, it is called;" It's all about ME !". It doesn't matter what culture or from what part of the world they are from. Real love is not like picking fruit, meaning to gather all that you want. It means giving to one person, and that other person giving in return.This means putting aside some of their own pleasures and desires, rather than looking for another additional partner. This man could not be walking in the truth with a viewpoint on relationships as you are describing. It is always best to look at matters the way Jehovah does, rather than by our own emotions. The choice that will turn out well would be ;don't waste anymore time, pray for Jehovah's help, be consistent about it, and get out of the situation, have no further contact with the man, not even a phone call. Then wait until you find someone who is a true Christian servant of Jehovah, respects and follows Bible principals and who knows what real love means, not just a self pleaser. You deserve better than that, so forget about him. Don't allow yourself to be used by someone else as a part of their ego game. He will end up very unhappy, so will anyone who is involved with him. 1 Cor. 13;5 -love does not behave indecently or look for it's own interests,"|`|sVyH0jTiaa	I wish I can help you but I am really lost.

IS IT breaking a command of Jehovah to marry someone who is not a true Christian? On October 1, 1978, a single woman wrote asking that question, a question that many have thought about.  One reason that she was puzzled was that she knew of some Christians who had chosen to marry unbelievers. Yet she also knew what the apostle Paul wrote in 1?Corinthians 7:39. He there commented about a Christian woman (though it is also true of a man) whose mate had died. Death ends the marriage contract. (Rom. 7:2) So Paul said that the survivor is then eligible to remarry. The verse concludes: She is free to be married to whom she wants, only in the Lord. (1?Cor. 7:39) Consistently, then, she is not free to marry outside the Lord.  Is that statement, only in the Lord, to be viewed as merely human, personal advice from a mature Christian, Paul? Or is it an inspired guideline from God for his servants? In fact, some have wondered, Is deliberately going against that advice a reason for expulsion from the congregation, as the Bible says is true for unrepentant adulterers, idolaters or homosexuals?1?Cor. 5:11-13; 6:9, 10.  Getting the Right View  Other parts of Gods Word help us to get the right view of the limitation stated in 1?Corinthians 7:39. For instance, recall Abrahams course in choosing a wife for Isaac. Abraham and his family dwelt in Canaan, surrounded by people worshiping false gods. Where could he find a wife for his son? The most convenient thing might have been to select some eligible Canaanite woman who had good qualities and who broadmindedly would agree that any children be brought up worshiping Jehovah. Yet Abraham rejected that course, for it would have been disloyal to Jehovah. Rather, despite all the extra effort involved, a wife for Isaac was searched for among Abrahams relatives in a distant land. Why? Because those relatives recognized the true God.Gen. 24:1-67; compare 26:34, 35; 28:6-9.  At a later period, when God gave his law to Israel, his servants were warned: You must form no marriage alliance with [the nations in Canaan]. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son. Why not? For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods.Deut. 7:2-4; Ex. 34:14-16.  But what if someone did marry a false worshiper? The Law did not command that the Israelite be cut off. It was not as with the law about adultery: In case a man is found lying down with a woman owned by an owner, both of them must then die together .?.?. So you must clear away what is bad out of Israel. (Deut. 22:22) Similarly, practicers of idolatry and homosexuality were to be executed. (Ex. 22:20; Lev. 20:13) Does the lack of such a penalty for marrying a nonbeliever mean that it did not really matter? No! Gods warning was firm and had good reason behind it, that the believer might not be turned away from Jehovah. Underscoring the fact that this divine warning was not unduly harsh, the Bible tells what happened to Solomon. Though having received wisdom from God, Solomon foolishly took foreign wives. Over the years they inclined his heart away from Jehovah and toward the foreign gods. Solomon may have thought, Oh, I know what Im doing. Ill never leave Jehovah. But he did, he really did.1?Ki. 11:1-6.  When the Jews who returned from captivity in Babylon took foreign wives, both Ezra and Nehemiah forcefully condemned them. Ezra said that those doing so acted unfaithfully and brought on guiltiness; he had them put away their pagan wives. And Nehemiah, citing Solomons poor example, referred to the Jews marrying such unbelievers as people commit[ting] all this great badness in acting unfaithfully against our God.Ezra 10:10-14; Neh. 13:23-27.  This Hebrew Scripture background should help us to understand how the Christian congregation and we personally should view the matter.  The Christian Scriptures mention a number of gross sins for which an unrepentant wrongdoer might be cut off from the congregation. No, not by being stoned as in ancient Israel, but by being disfellowshiped. Among these sins are fornication, idolatry, adultery, stealing, drunkenness and extortion. A Christians marrying an unbeliever is not given as a basis for being disfellowshiped, any more than an ancient Israelite was cut off for that. But, as we have clearly seen, that course was definitely wrong in Israel. It was unfaithfulness, disloyalty to Israels God. Hence, Pauls words to marry only in the Lord cannot be dismissed as mere human opinion. They are actually a continuation of the overall counsel of Gods Word on the matter. And they are now part of the inspired Scriptures that are beneficial for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.2?Tim. 3:16.  Being imperfect, all of us daily fail to adhere as closely as we would like to Gods wise and loving counsel. Thus, perhaps b

aCcRsh7uaa	I think you're thinking of D'yer Mak'er by Led Zeppelin.  Look it up, I'm almost positive. It's off of Houses of the Holy.  It has lots of oh,oh,oh and I love you's in it.|`|dcov2Eh7aa	I remember an older song by the Beatles called "Oh! Darling". Sounds very similar to what you described, with the whiny voice although Paul was singing it, I believe.    EDIT -- I just heard "Obla-di, Obla-da" on the radio today. Sounds like either one could be it.    There's also a line like that (oh oh oh oh) in "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". John Lennon performs it, although his voice is just a little like Ringo's.    That line is also in these three songs: "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", "Revolution" and "Hello, Goodbye".  Any of these could be it. Just search it up on YouTube and see if you find it.  Hope I helped. :)|`|87CAVhs2aa	I think you are thinking of something else... Ringo's voice never whined.|`|urJIlSBQaa	Are you sure its the Beatles.....

I think it has to do with what and how much you've ate the previous day and if you got any exercise. Try not eating as much junk food and do a few cruntchs or walk around a lil.

I finally realized that when i was a sophmore playing 3rd and there were freshmen play 1st that it was time to give it up.|`|ixOE0onnaa	pratice if you want to ok?|`|OXq8UnQAaa	Make sure you empty your spit valve often as possible and take your instrument in to make sure there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. When you're sure it's perfect, begin by doing long tones. They're annoying, but they work. Just do the B flat scale    v e r y   s l o w l y. Then E flat, F, so on.    You can also try playing with a mute, if you have one, but trumpets are supposed to be loud and obnoxious.    As always, practice is important to, no matter how annoying or frustrated you get when practicing. Work, one one thing at a time like tone, then the rhythm, then the notes, then articulation, then dynamics, etc.    And always know that, even if you are a terrible trumpet player, you can still play an instrument, and that makes you better then anyone who doesn't play an instrument (musically wise). Also, keep with it. 7-8 years of trumpet looks amazing on a college application.

Pksi62wLaa	These are lyrics from "Song 2" by "Blur"(which I LOVE btw!)I have wondered about this myself, but it never bothered me that much.    You can find information about the meaning of the lyrics here:    http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3...    And I also searched it on Wikipedia:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_2    I hope this helps!|`|63BzEtMVaa	I don't think they mean anything in particular..

He did a better knee slide than I could do this morning!|`|L4Ky6SCqaa	It was okay, but did you see the roadie almost drop Bruce's guitar at the beginning|`|NAGiNKFWaa	My husband was so bored with it, he changed the channel until the game started again.  I am glad the steelers won, I just don't like Kurt Warner.  I did think the knee slide was nice for a man that age.|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Bruce was the best part of the Stupid Bowl where the only winner was Las Vegas and the NFL and the lousy officials who can't call a clean game anymore. I left just after Bruce Springsteen's, winded  performance and it made me glad i saw him when he was much younger.] Age has certainly caught up with him but it is always good to seen the old dinosaurs of the Rock and Roll generation still kick it well out there.   He should have saved his energy from all those Obama parties.  All in all Good, however it brought back memories of the Rolling Stones and their Steel Wheels ( wheelchairs) tour.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	It was decent.|`|n3R74zyzaa	I was at a party and it was hard to hear and pay attention, but I liked the song choices and it seemed like they had a lot of fun.|`|C0i3t4graa	yeah it was very good.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Not too shabby!!|`|2ZAzoKfraa	It was ok. Better than most bands these days that put no effort into their performances and then get mad when the crowd doesn't get into it.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i think he looked like the tin man. he needed to ba oiled. he's so damn stiff and immobile when he plays.

yctQjQDTaa	Hmm, The Cars, Blondie, The Smashing Pumpkins, Van Morrison, Green Day, I don't see those mentioned to often around here.    BQ:  Maybe, R&P could be compared to rock music itself in that the older people say "oh its so stupid now", but the newer people will say "its the best right now!".     BQ2: XD! That's actually what I wanted to say, so now I have to come up with something else.. If My Chemical Romance fans weren't rabid animals, I would listen to them much more often.     BQ3: I would agree totally, 1997 is the year it ended, layne staley's death was just the nail in the coffin.    BQ4: I cant really say, I think that Alternative Rock would have had an overall larger hold on rock for a longer period of time, but my guess is that Nirvana would've put out another album at some point in 1995, taken on a small tour and then split. Kurt said he wanted to experiment, he didn't want to stay with "Three chord Grunge riffs" and he wanted to start doing more acoustic things, he even mentioned dabbling into New Wave, he felt that none of that would have fit within then confines of Nirvana, of course I could be wrong and they may have actually found a way to experiment and still be Nirvana, or they could have broken up days after he would have been saved from committing suicide. And honestly, if you think Nirvana would've been irrelevant, then you need to t study music history more, bands like Nirvana, bands that bring about a musical revolution and are innovative in their techniques, bands like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rush, Pixies, they don't just get forgotten just like that.    BQ5:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-_Q8znGM...  beautifully dark, its been stuck in my for the past 3 days.|`|AA12301664	fallout boy are probably on that list.....    ba: why? what is lacking? are we not knowledgable / amusing enough?  ba2: if lily allen lost her voice, i would listen to the radio more often  ba3: don't know. was there a closing ceremony?  ba4: exactly the same, except with the inclusion of his latest band.  kinda. ditto. yes.  ba5: just for you: my rock and roll - dinosaur pile up  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lf0koQ4wx...  is that grunge enuff?    edit:  erm, because she a tuneless chav princess?  or because i had to endure a full set at glastonbury a few years back?  i'm sorry. there was inded no need to drag her into this question.  here's an olive branch  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DT9Wt7lyqj...|`|ayS0085raa	I'd agree with U2, though that's fine by me...    BA: No, this place is cool! :)  BQ2: If it still played interesting music, I would listen to XFM more often. (the same two Oasis/The Verve songs all day does not count as a varied playlist, that station used to be interesting).  BQ3: Grunge in the mainstream ended sometime in the late 90s, I guess. Pretty bad time for (mainstream) music in general.  BQ4: Pretty much the same, to be honest. If they had released another album, I still think Nevermind would have made the biggest impact on music. But yeah, I think they would have broken up pretty quickly anyway.  BQ5: arghh... I already answered this earlier, but I'm still going with Looking For Astronauts by The National.|`|dZyoGbUdaa	Green Day, Good Charlotte    bq:  Its okay.  I think alot of people are laying low because of trolls.  bq2:  If I had brain damage, I would listen to Green Day and Good Charlotte more often.  bq3:  1992  I think any scene ends as soon it breaks nationally.  It becomes too diluted by non-creative factors and people who consider themselves fans because they heard one song on the radio.  bq4:  I think that Nirvana had their impact by the time Cobain died and they were well on their way to breaking up so mainstream rock wouldn't be much different than it is today.  Grunge wouldn't still be around because it had become a fad and fads must end, music must evolve.  bq5:  "Lovers Who Uncover" by The Little Ones  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwr5Ff6h...|`|V1hxvQukaa	pretty much any band signed with decaydance (pete wentz's record label)... lol.    BQ: haven't really been here today, so i wouldn't know  BQ2: uhh... idk. XD  BQ3: i'd agree with that  BQ4: nirvana would have broken up eventually. before kurt died, i think he was tired of being in the limelight all the time. he just wanted to make art...  BQ5: negative creep- nirvana  i was watching a thing about nirvana on TV today, so this song has been stuck in my head. plus, it's just an amazing song =]|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Lil!!! hey!!

But I'll try and put a few down for you.    1...Johnny Winters  2...Emerson Lake & Palmer  3...Steely Dan  4...The Kinks  5...The Tragically Hip  6....Frank Zappa  7...Blood Sweat & Tears  8...The Guess Who  9...Meat Loat  10...The Jeffy Healey Band  I did not want to run the board with too many.  and even with the ones on here people only seem to know a hand full of their songs. And if I get thumbs down for that I take them with open arm, there are people here who really know their music. I find most songs from groups mentioned on here are always the same people don't seem to know to much about artist early music, where in some cases you find the better music, just because a song is played on the radio or video, does not make it a great song, it's only a people's choice.  Take care  dave [I could go on all night with this one]    Sorry I was so worked up with your question I for got your BQ questions.

AA10718475	CVnt (IPA:/k?nt/) is an English language vulgarism referring generally to the female genitalia, specifically the Cleft of Venus. The earliest citation of this usage in the Oxford English Dictionary, circa 1230, refers to the London street known as "Gropecunt Lane".    "CVnt" is also used informally as a derogatory epithet in referring to either sex, but this usage is relatively recent, dating back only as far as the late nineteenth century.    and I guess you already knew the 1st word.

Except this one. By the time my team hit 2-16 for the year, I had given up on football for the year.   But hey, tomorrow is another day...or next year is another team. Literally. New General Manager, new head coach (which means all new coaching staff), and I'll bet a whole new crop of loses in pads.

It takes the true beauty out of what a musician is supposed to be. Just listen to true talents like Michael Jackson, or Jennifer hudson, and you will know what i am talking about.|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	I liked it when it was just T-Pain using it.|`|nI3XqvVPaa	I don't think T.I. used auto-tune much. If your talking about T-Pain, he was the one who made it popular. He can actually sing without it and I think it enhances his voice a little. As for Kanye, he was awesome without it and I hope he ditches it. Lil Wayne sounds absolutly terrible with auto tune though I think it sounded kinda cool on prom queen. Well, that's my opinion and if you don't like it you can suck it. But have a nice day!

And flushing everytime is wasteful. Sometimes I don't flush. But once every night? The toilet would overflow then.|`|l1pewZpaaa	It's not that hard to put the toilet seat up when you're done! I don't want to touch it|`|hnwMC1XQaa	it's just more respectful put down.|`|2o9P1da6aa	cause it's nasty|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	It's clear to me that you've never gotten up in the middle of the night and almost drowned, because you didn't want to turn on the light, ('cos once you turn on the light, you're fully awake), so you just sat ... no, if that had ever happened to you, I'm sure you would understand.    Leaving the seat up is a habit that we wish you would break your lazy selves of, and that you would please be more considerate, and remember that you're not the only one who needs to use the toilet.    It's also kinder and more pleasant to leave BOTH the lid AND the seat down, but we know that's asking for way too much, so we'll settle for just the seat, thanks.     ... since you asked.|`|aR0bJqCdaa	Yeah!  Men don't complain women left it DOWN, so hey!|`|viGqMW1Xaa	I have four men in my house so I am the only girl and I am used to it by now. But its so we dont fall in.    My boys and hubby so you dont get the wrong idea|`|ICTqyQaraa	so they dont sit in what you left behind|`|AA10196782	cuz no one wants to touch it to put it down. its dirty. idk, its just more refined that way.|`|4SV4bz69aa	if u leave the toilet seat up period, bacteria from the water floats up and lands on the clean towels and toothbrushes in the bathroom and thats freakin disgusting, and if were not paying attention and we go to sit down and both toilet seats are up we fall in.  soooo keep them down!!|`|LWEceVT4aa	Because its disgusting to have to touch it(where they might have peed) and put it down!

02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	How often does one eat a Doner Kebab. Frankly, the take-away ones are generally oily and disgusting, but if all doner kebabs are intrinsically unhealthy, how come the Turks are not all dead by the age of 45.    Seriously, one needs about 2500 cals per day. (male) A pint of UK beer has about 160 -180 cals - if you've drank 7 pints you've taken in about 1300 cfls, so you might as well finish your weekly bender and pig out (perhaps not the right turn of phrase to describe the consumption of a dish of Turkish origin), simply restrict your cals to 2200 per day for the rest of the week and cycle to work - you'll burn off about 300 cals if you do this.    As a chef, I do not see how anybody can cook a Doner that amounts to 1000 cals. I cook Doner for myself and my Partner using Sunflower oil and I doubt if there are more than 700 cals in the entire dish, and I do not stint on portions. I use reasonably lean meat. Hmmm...|`|8D8ck9pVaa	yeah but they still taste good.    drinking two glasses of cooking oil wouldnt be    DUH|`|bvt9kvS8aa	no thanks, im a strict vegetarian.

(Barriers on other side of doors/windows) All our weapons were locked away in the garage (also barrier) and somehow all our eating utensils were lost, so we had to run into the attic, but in the attic there was a giant anaconda, which always ate my sister, then the roof collapsed where the anaconda was, down with my parents, who were both bitten and killed. o-o    i still have the snake dream sometimes D:|`|i9MlY6J3aa	I was 5 when I had it and 7 when I had it the other time ok me and my mom went to the record store (idk why) and there was this crazy mad scientist guy there and I and brought my favorite baby doll with me and he took it and put it in this fridge thing with green liquid in it and there were apples and books and stuff floating around in it and in a few seconds the door of the fidge thing opens and this big robot thing walks out and starts shooting blue lazers out of its eyes and everyone is scream in and we run out of the store and it is chasing us.

UlUeWzrNaa	Answering stupid Qs in rampant succession seems to be the best way to elevate one's level.  And per chance receiving BA for it.  Know your niche market & it's value.    Me ... I gave up long ago trying to reach any level higher than 2.  I'm not on here often enough.  But dang I hate being a level 1 & not being able to give thumbs up on some great answers.    Oh ... and don't fall for the myth that addressing your Qs with Poll or Survey fool you any.  I've done that numerous times & still have had those Qs withdrawn without justification.  You get a troll on your back & it doesn't matter a hoot if your Q passes the "Community" guidelines.    It's a rigged game sweetheart.  All there is to it.  You just take your best shot & don't let anything about it become personal.  A crap shoot at best.  Man ... I've seen blatant porno Qs slide by with no contest.  But ask anything of any serious nature about some ancient nursery rhyme & expect a violation of some sort.  Especially if you have certain contributors with a troll following as your contacts.      That's the time you have to say, "Is it really worth it?  IT"S A GAME!!|`|YZ0Z7litaa	haha i didnt ask that many questions...  i just answered thousands of questions  with really dumb answers...  i guess give that a shot and see if  you will get to another level...  best wishes :]|`|Z933rtuLaa	Learn to put your whole question in the question box and maybe you will come closer to discovering your answer.

Spend your day with your family (or someone special to you) doing something meaningful.  Volunteer somewhere.  Do storytime, make a time capsual.  Help someone out - buy them something you need.  Go around and pay for peoples lunch in the drive through, give free gift cards, lottery (scratch) tickets to people walking the streets, at the mall, in a park, at unemployment, DMV etc. . .    Think of where you could bring the most happiness and DO IT.

So practice almost makes perfect!|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Great question.  I think that instead of "Practice makes perfect", the statement should be "Practice makes better, not perfect." Maybe if people would focus more on Practice makes better, and less on perfection, more people in the world would be happier.  (Often, it is people's high expectations of their own and others' behavior, and their inability to meet those expectations, is what makes people so miserable.)|`|8DrQ9phIaa	I use to say this in the 4th grade.|`|WwtBloebaa	practice as u said to make u perfect , but u r not perfect because u can't do every thing|`|eVt0qkT8aa	1 star for you :D   very good question ;)|`|HsrCk2J1aa	ha, good question.  i'm going to star it as well.|`|qsg8wCBiaa	good one. star for you :)|`|AA10838250	try and try again|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	nobody is perfect but you practice so you don't suck like the general population..|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	so that we will be better at what we are working on "our goal/goals".

R7VjuCT2aa	c  b  d  a|`|7nbqb4e2aa	(constructive approach)    I don't want to pick a definite order (sends the wrong message 100%, because if the person asking the question ends up being middle or last, they're going to think I'm saying that they're horrendously ugly, even if I'm not), so I'll just comment on each one:    'A' looks good and pleasant, simple as that, but a little on the "too thin" side... Also the eye-liner seems to add a little age and compositional "weight" to the face, so I think she'll score more points without it. (After much thought and analysis, I've become 100%  anti-makeup... I think she'll look a lot better when composing everything around her face more "sharply" (better haircut, etc) and of course in a better picture with non-front-flash lighting... Here she looks fresh out of bed, almost)    'B' is probably looking the worst in this pic, but she is quite obviously hiding a stunning image under the extra weight, and will probably be the best looking of all once the face is brought back to the "thin" level. At the moment, the extra weight is very detracting (a temporary setback from a fashion-guru's perspective (me)) but there's a very excellent face under there...    C is in the "middle" here, but has great potential with a little weight-reduction on the face, and better composition (like haircut... never "too" short though; only a select few girls can have very, very short hair (anything above middle of neck) that actually looks good)... Hair is half of how the mind perceives the face (it's like the face's "crown") and the only part of the body that can be styled very nicely without looking like you're vain/insecure...)    D is similar to C, except that her hair is already good (the photo lighting ruins everything though)... Rule: weight on the face is murder. (with the exception of a select few people who just wear it very well, because it doesn't clump/fold for do funny things that change the brain's perception of what the face looks like)    See, if you look at this picture (top link below) of Scarlett Johansson, you can see what I'm talking about... In  3 you can see what face weight does, and in  7 you can see what bad lighting does... Unfortunately, the picture of the girls, and girls B, C, and D, have ALL of these problems...    So:  1 - Take care to lose weight via exercise (NOT DIETS) and "eating till you're satisfied, not full". (I love exercise so much... I don't know why people hate it. I do it every day without even thinking about it (just running/walking/chair-lifts-where-you-pu... almost-like-pushups-but-way-more-comfort... and love the burning muscle feel (feels like progress)... Maybe because everyone who is fat feels "forced" to do it as WORK (kind of like how being forced to do school makes LEARNING so hated, when I love it as one of the top things... The other day I looked up how to do some math things that I forgot (which I actually needed to use for something (IMAGINE)), then wrote myself a whole paper of problems to solve, to get it stuck in my head... I still hate math more than Hitler (who I killed, unknown to historians (by way of poison)), but still...)    2 - Whoever took that picture needs to get a bounce flash... For the sake of good self-image (for you and family), it's worth getting an expensive D-SLR camera with an external bounce flash (and maybe even umbrellas/wireless flashes or other lighting equipment, for pictures like the second link below)... (D-SLR basically means removable lens... Lenses of that size have tons of background blur too, which makes a very professional look when you're backed up and zoomed in, like in the Strobist kids picture (Strobist.com is where I learned external flash lighting... Learning like this makes photography so fun (plus you take awesome pictures)... Learning via high school photography text-book class = fail, plus it takes 2 months to learn even basic things, and you never even GET to wireless flash stuff (which is 80% of modern photography)... See link 3 for beginner photography tutorials, then link 4 for a little higher up stuff...) Never use a film camera in today's times, because you gain 2x convenience and artistic options when integrating with computers (it's like the horses vs. cars comparison... and horse people became jealous when cars came out, just like film people get jealous of digital + Photoshop)...

i9hHL7oNaa	Pan's Labyrinth remains one of the most breathtaking and marvelous films I have ever seen. The Orphanage almost gave me a heart attack the 1st time i watched it. I admire Del Toro for being such a visionary director,and cant wait to see The Hobbit.  Burton on the other hand,is as visionary and amazing as Del Toro and i really like his movies,Sweeney Todd is also one of my favorite movies. His movies tend to be dark and unconventional which is why I admire him and i think he deserves an Academy Award which is long due.  Both great directors,not so different styles of directing,both have great movies and if i had to pick one,I guess i would have to go with Tim Burton just for the fact he's been around longer,but when The Hobbit comes out that fact might change...although we might have to wait a few years....|`|yUP05L2Iaa	Tim Burton|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Burton...more creative. And he has Johnny Depp!|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Tim Burton, no contest!!|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	The Fonz|`|6JGkOlAlaa	Guillermo Del Toro|`|NbjJiSJJaa	    And his movies are FAR more creative and interesting, and nobody is as mysterious as he is|`|VEoNPj1kaa	burton charlie and the chocolate|`|am5nCCDuaa	im sorry who?|`|YbmklSzGaa	Both have great cinematography........    I can't decide.|`|Myrftx3Zaa	its a tie i cant decide   i love pans labyrinth and nightmare before christmas|`|AA10997370	Tim Burton of course!|`|hbupUkHvaa	Tim burton its hardly a contest the mans got experience and has made many more movies and most of his movies are really good.|`|7B2s7maWaa	Tim Burton is my all time favorite director.  Anything by him I automatically love.    I don't know of Del Toros' work to say who is better.   I can say I prefer Burton.|`|uZKlKAEeaa	I prefer Guillermo Del Toro|`|NPwOxS3eaa	ughhh this is hard.    I think both of them are so amazing with what they do :[    I can't choose sorry :[|`|Jh83QYVjaa	Guillermo Del Toro for sure  He's beyond brilliance   far better than Tim Burton|`|gCpdLKzxaa	Burton 100%|`|yc4y7yKkaa	Tough question. Both are two of my favorites. I don't enjoy one more than the other, but I've noticed some strengths and "weaknesses" that make them different.    Del Toro takes more risks, and is better at character development. That said, he is perhaps a little too violent and graphic.    Tim Burton knows how to put together a good team (Bo Welch, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp, etc.) and has a nearly flawless vision from sketch to screen. Tim Burton doesn't take many risks with his characters. He's also kind of cartoon-ish.     They could take lessons from each other.

MWpkipzsaa	I like kanye's music, but I'm not a fan of the way he's been acting. It's just for the attention. My favorite song of his is Jesus Walks.
AA11518803	I think Wes Anderson, like Quentin Tarantino before him, was "the new kid" that they heaped so much praise on for his first couple of films that there was a backlash among many critics in the reviews of his subsequent films. For some critics the expectations were so high that any follow-up was bound to disappoint, while others simply wanted to tone down their enthusiasm so as not to appear to be rubber-stamping anything he directs.    Personally, I really enjoyed The Life Aquatic, but not as much as The Royal Tenenbaums or Rushmore. I thought the story telling was better in those films, but the cinematography and scope of his last two films has been more ambitious, and that he deserves credit for trying to expand his vision. Plus it's just a well-made, colorful, touching and funny film. What's not to like?    And I agree- Bill Murray gave a great performance. By the way, did you see him in Jim Jarmusch's "Broken Flowers"? Another stand-out role.|`|dYyiG90caa	I LOVED IT !!    Of course, I like all Wes Anderson movies, but This One was completely Offbeat & Original !!    Bill Murray has become one of the Most Subtle Acting Geniuses, alive !!    The most charming thing about this Flick, is that I Never really knew "where" it was going -- So, I settled back and went for the "Ride." :)  .  .|`|w51B05ACaa	uh it was kind of strange.. but not too bad, i love owen wilson in anything though : )|`|56bNLJykaa	You know what I actually did like it.. Not one of my favorites for sure, but it was good.. and also I have been liking Bill Murray a bit more lately.. I always thought of him to be not a real serious actor but between this and Lost in Translation I will give him credit.|`|EzqfAUFuaa	that's one of my all-time favorite movies!  the soundtrack is awesome too. david bowie songs in portuguese? oh yeah.    i think the critics didn't like it cuz it's on the quirky side, but everyone's so adorable in it. owen wilson, willem dafoe, jeff goldblum, angelica houston, cate blanchett. they all were really well casted and give terrific performances.  and the story is so original and real and honest and truly heart-warming......god i love that movie.|`|AA11516222	I had to watch it a couple of times before I could really feel the right vibe for the movie and start to like it.  Even though I thought parts were hlarious when I first saw it, I didn't like the movie. Now I like it, but I don't like all the movies the director has made.|`|xhH3cB1Raa	Awesome, beautiful movie, critics are usually wrong. Yesterday I was musing about how much they loved "Mystic River" which was one of the crappiest, boring movies I've ever seen.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	BM is brilliant, I thought, and I liked it a lot!  You just need to be able to shrug off reality, and enjoy a movie that makes people think a bit.  That's none too popular in today's CGI-fed mixture of light, noise, and cheap sentimentality.

ONWCXzUMaa	The first two I would get if you can get your hand's on them would be,   1] The Piper at The Gates: The title of Pink Floyd's debut album is taken from a chapter in Syd Barrett's favorite children's book, The Wind In The Willows, and the lyrical imagery of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is indeed  full of colorful, childlike, distinctly British whimsy, albeit filtered through the perceptive of LSD.    2] A Saucerful of Secrets [1968] A transitional album on which the band moved from Syd Barrett's relatively concise and vivid songs to spacy, ethereal material with lengthy instruental passages. Barrett's influence is still felt [he actually did manage to contribute one track, the jovial "Jugband Blues"], and much of the material retains a gentle, fairy - tale ambience. "Remember A Day" and "See Saw" are highlights; on "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", "Let There Be More Light," and the lengthy instrumental title track, the band begin  to map out the dark and repetitive pulses that would characterize their next few records.    If you want to get to know about them, more than just their popular stuff  you have to hear these two albums in their entirely. And you will see way everything else that came after are called master pieces by some.  Pick any of their albums if you just want whats popular and you can't go wrong, but to understand where they really came from who have to listen to the first two.  take care  dave|`|7B2s7maWaa	The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon|`|YA4qCDukaa	ither 'the wall' or 'wish you were here' both personal favorites of mine....but....know cd collection is complete with out 'dark side of the moon'....     if you know where too look you can get both 'wish you were here' & 'dark side of the moon' at the same time 'the wall' is expensive so......you might have to save up.|`|XzSPA3IGaa	I would say the Piper at the gates of dawn its their first album and its very different.

fc44938890cde1403e34c717ab97b938aa	Well, you see, there are a variety of ways to kill zombies, but it is important to crush the cranial structure. In other words, bash their head open. :D    Here are some ways to do it.      Decapitation!    To kill zombies, you need to destroy their brains. The most surefire route is simply lopping off the cranium with a chainsaw, machete, or samurai sword. Mind the follow-through, however-- anything less than 100 percent severance just isn't good enough.    Bludgeoning!    Any blunt object--from a baseball bat to a brick--wielded with suitable force at the cranium will destroy the brain. But be quick on your feet and keep your eye on the target, slugger--when you're this close to a zombie, miss even once and you might as well just hand your brains to the zombie on a silver platter.    Burning!    Don't have the convenience of a sniper rifle to take out zombies from afar? The next best thing is a Molotov cocktail--just make sure the zombies are far enough away so they'll be reduced to ashes before they can shamble after you.    Exploding! (My favorite.)    A solid technique, but one that requires heavy weaponry. In the chaos that will doubtlessly strike an urban center after a zombie infestation, make your way to a military storehouse or a morally dubious pawn shop and acquire a rocket launcher. Then shoot, load, and repeat.      And when you're done, be sure to burn the body to prevent disease, or chemicals from infecting/spreading.    Happy hunting! :D|`|b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	There are two fool proof ways to kill zombies.  One, which has already been stated, is to blow its freaking head off (chopping the head off will also suffice) with a shotgun point blank, or an improvised weapon you find while running away.    Another way is to stab it in the bottom of the foot with an oven thermometer.  The zombie will explode and you will got zombie bits all over you, but I'd say it's a fair trade, no?|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Go for the head.  Always go for the head.    Also, fire is pretty effective - but make sure any zombies you set on fire don't end up setting the house or something else important on fire.|`|4EflpUK8aa	You need to cut off it's head with a desperate improvised weapon. Always go for the head. It's the only way to kill them.|`|AA11110732	Probably right between the eyes, a pick ax would probably be the best tool for that.

12QJ9QMRaa	Hmmm.......    Still listening, BUT.......    While I actually don't paerticularly care for Behemoth, I actually DO like what I am hearing here.  Blackened Deaath has a very appealing sound to me as long as they cut back on the blastbeats, which are not in evidence on this track so far.    Plus from what I have seen of the lyrics, they don't seem to feel the need to go as over the top as so many bands (including sometimes Behemoth) do.    Very nice Jester, thanks for the listen Bro!|`|u8ia6oKxaa	I like them, I asked this question a while ago...but to minimal response.  Hopefully you get more people checking them out.      When I first heard them, I had no idea it was Orion, so I didn't really think they would sound anything like Behemoth and enjoyed their sound.    **edit.  here is my question with some other songs I like by them   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	They sound pretty cool. Vocals are cool. I actually like this band more than Behemoth, I think.

It is an annoying noise, often raping the English language. I usually cannot relate to or identify with the lyrics. Since there is no real melody, there is not much else to like. Certainly not the "choreography" - I find it gross when people rhythmically grabbing their genitals in public.

I am really sad but we spend lots of time together and everyday is like Valentine's Day.  We don't need a day to appreciate each other.

I mean,  i dont want some mean, jerky guy.  But tbh , i wouldnt really want a  super ugly guy, but hey if he  proves to me that they are super  sweet, and nice and just AMAZING,  looks might not matter. It all depends  on the guy i guess.

1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	That's funny!  It not only skewers Bush's terrible record of war crimes he approved, and how he deprived us many of our constitutional rights, but it also pokes fun at his less than perfect grasp of the English language.|`|2BmGwbvYaa	It's irony.

9SWklMBBaa	Well, everyone has their own style. Some, like Darth and Meranda post polls. Some like anime freak and vampire bliss are simply random. Others like medon't usually ask questions, but answer a lot. If I do ask a question, it's usually straightforward.  You and Mizu are the kind of people who post whenever the thought crosses their mind.  My favorite anime would have to be Naruto, since it's the only anime I can acctually watch. I did like shaman king for a long time until 4kids got rid of it when they couldn't carry the liscense over.  i like the hair chu.... it's cool.|`|yMjocqmUaa	We all have a bunch of fun, unlike those serious sections! (JK...JK...) But we have a lot of fun polls and we know each other really well :]    My favorite anime would have to be ~  Death Note  Code Geass  Clannad    I can't pick! Whaaa!|`|sjNGNnfiaa	Umm some people ask because they would like to get some information on certain anime/manga... and the rest are here to kill their time with their randomness... You are not an outcast, you are both chu, the asker to get info and to show your randomness... It's cool... ;)|`|fwBIXZxPaa	You're not an outcast!! =O      Anyway, we're way awesome-er than a lot of sections because we're nice to each other and are very random - which is awesome! XD|`|nUOw6rOgaa	I think that the C/A people really like each other.  We are all friends in our own bizarre little way.....  That's why i like it so much.... X3    Deathnote.  TEAM LIGHT!  WOOT! ^^  |`|U0FgxEJxaa	There seems to be a lot of polls and surveys.  Some I answer & some I do not.  Many of them I just do not know or do not know enough about that I just shy away from answering.  Not that I have anything against the askers or their questions, but some ?'s I plain do not know the answers to.    There is also a lot of randomness and I am just not that random.  I never really have been and have (sometimes) difficulty answering random questions.      A lot of questions I am interested in seem to get deleted by YA before I get the chance to answer.  They may be considered chatting, but how else are we going to find out what we need to know *without* discussion?      You may think I am stuck in a rut, but my favorite Anime is, and always will be, Saiyuki.  There is something about the "irreverent-ness" about those guys that I love!!    Chu, you are not an outcast!  At least to me you are not.|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Everyone is random. :)    You're not an outcast!!  You're a multitasker, you're in every section it seems which is pretty cool! :)    Favorite anime:  Cardcaptor Sakura|`|3N2ElzcQaa	The difference: everyone's own love and dislike towards different variety of anime.

Fave anime? right now its Elfen Lied|`|btFSgJmlaa	If your an outcast, then I'm a freaking rogue.|`|cidwIuJRaa	The difference in what we each think and feel about the animes we ask about,and how we word our questions.    Like we have poll-makers,survey makers,people that are too lazy to look for links,people that are impatient for next week ep. & people that want recommendations.    We all know what we want,and we gather in C&A to find it.      BTW,you're not an outcast,sweets.  And,my fave anime is Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.|`|t8gHU5Glaa	I know whatcha mean, it just feels weird on here lately. && my fav. anime.. well, Naruto Shippuuden && One Piece. Nothin' special.

Seriously 8DDD (and don't worry, I'm not trying to flirt with you lol ^^""")      Anyway~    Meh... probably our over-randomness....

jQvC9xPuaa	lol  lol!!!      rent? eh?  hmmm   well being that im a chick and i like a good story line, and of course art work, i would have to disagree. but ehh that doesnt answer the question eh?  ahaha XD      welll i say SELL  mwahhaha    i love a good story ^^  but it surely helps that the characters are hot ehehehe  :D|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey you. :)    Haha, actually I'm the type of girl that heads for the anime with the panty shot, the frilly naughty type covers and the big chested girl holding a huge gun looking like she's going to kill someone. Nothing about that bothers me at all and I've never watched a anime before because I thought a guy or girl was hot... anyway they could never share those feelings back because they aren't reality.     But I do buy anime purchased on art style because I would like to be a professional manga artist one day and immerse myself in all different types of styles. I believe what you have here is a typical stereotype but I don't know maybe you know people like that.    Here's a sample of what I can draw using GIMP, I believe that practice makes perfect so I'm going to keep trying.   http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2z68ok2&...      So I'd say sell for this one but interesting question, come around here more! Oh, and sorry I got off on a tangent about other stuff, em...    Later.|`|cidwIuJRaa	I'll say auction.....b/c some will bid on your idea,and some won't.    The BS about girls is not right.I'm a 27-yr-old woman,and I love me some upskirts [which u called "panty shot"].And,I looooove me some ecchi and hentai as well.

By my experience,men are usually the ones saying a chara is sooooo hot.Like my honey,who thinks that of Rangiku.  >.>    I'm still saying AUCTION!  Anybody bidding?!?|`|kBek6QCLaa	hmm I say Buy, ..well for people who may just start out watching anime, some one who has never watched anime before maybe?    ...but Sell, to most of the people...lol    this is confusing me >:{|`|YrEQ3oHEaa	I love a good story, but I also like the characters to be good looking. And  the art has to be good! So I'd say sell. Or rent. Sell. Rent. Sell. Either one of those.|`|eQVS3x5Kaa	Hehe.....can i say rent too? ;D      Chu: =.='''....nope...  Me: Bu...but BWA did!  Chu: *looks at BWA's answer*....*thumbs her down*....      ....LOL jks! XD        Sorry for the little scenario here =.=''''          -have a nice day~! =D|`|nZzChbAdaa	O.O""""""""      Chu, if I hope I never hear a guy say::    "What a facinating anime!"  O.o    Final Answer:::::    Rent XD    Hah.    No     jk    I    choose    BUY|`|HRQjffv8aa	Buy    o.o" i pay alot of attention to art , like a couple of times my guy classmate begged me to watch one piece i didnt want to watch cuz the art sucked..but i finally gave in ^_^"    hey!! i like ecchi lol|`|ccEWxExfaa	For the most part--Buy.The art blows me away?  Speaking only for myself of course.|`|fwBIXZxPaa	Rent. ^_~    I'm not like that, but a lot of people are.    I'll watch an anime because it's interesting, and funny    Good artwork and cute guys is just a plus. XD|`|ehF2XiMbaa	I rent and then I buy >:{D if that makes sense. I have to admit I like reading manga with good drawings. An example would be that I evade manga with the really wide back men lol and not so good drawings. But if the story line is good Ill get over it.|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Sell :)    I love all kinds of anime.  Although I do judge anime on the art, but not "that guy is cute so I'm going to watch it" kind.  I judge the actual art of the anime because it's kind of hard not to since I'm an artist.  I'm sure you can kind of relate to that since you like to draw too. :)      I also judge the story line, it has to have both.  Good art and story for me to watch it or for me to look past the art the story has to be really good.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Sell.  I, being a girl (do not be fooled by the avatar), enjoy the story much more than the art. If an anime or manga does not have a good plot or storyline, I will not read or watch it. Simple as that. The art can be bothersome from time to time, if there are particular things that I dislike, but I do rate a manga on the cuteness of the characters or anything of the sort.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I'd say Rent because you can't forbid me.    Waiting for the thumbs down. :)
kEBwVNqTaa	Awww. >w  *hug*  Of course I would read it Chou. |`|3N2ElzcQaa	You didn't have to ask me. I read it, and its good. My sister says its good too.|`|cidwIuJRaa	You wouldn't have to beg me.    I read some of it a few years ago,and loved it.I just need to download the rest of it,and finish it.    I hope the anime is good,too,b/c I remember downloading it as well.|`|dfiW1IICaa	I've already read some of it|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Chu i'm worried!! haha!!    well as long as you bow down too ^_~  Jk!!    sure why not?? Let's begin!|`|HRQjffv8aa	lol    chu my classmate said the same thing ^_^ you know what, ill give it a shot ryt now since you asked XPno need to beg hehe, and my car is 2 years away from now so i dont have one XP and id rather have my cheek kissed instead of my feet though, oh well lol|`|i32Ew7paaa	Geez..you dont have to beg me!!!  I'll do it for free!  I've already read it and seen it BTW  It's actually called strawberry 100% in JP  It's really good  I watch it every morning    Yuki-Chan ^_^|`|6dAsdiA5aa	=]    then if I begged you to read Katekyou Hitman Reborn! for me would you read it?????    lol      Heh. I already read Ichigo100% because of you, Chou. lol     but I haven't finished it yet =\|`|sjNGNnfiaa	Hahaha, sure... why not?  But you don't have to beg, chu... I'll read it... ^^|`|ehF2XiMbaa	Yes I would. And mostly because I haven't read manga in some time and today a friend brought one and it made me miss it.
6dAsdiA5aa	I love spoilers!!!!!  Why not? =D|`|ehF2XiMbaa	No, because I'm going to start reading that one on your other question lol|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I already read it. Plus, its good.|`|hvJQSUOQaa	Only if it was a manga I really didn't care about.  Such as that one :P|`|tPcipzyuaa	do I get to keep the manga?? :P|`|2jxWrnUGaa	prob. would!
AA10622364	Naruto's big advantage is it's story, witch folows Naruto from a 12 year old kid to now a 17 year old teen ninja who is becoming  more and more a man.  From the beginning we see him get more experience, learn from his mistakes and other aspects.  The other thing is the deep impact and of the Characters, and their charismatic statue, here you like Ichigo 100% did it take you less or more time to learn all the characters names than you did in naruto?!  And the Sound track aka the Music of Naruto is one of the best about it, and it does make a normal scene an extra scene! In witch Bleach lacks a bit!  Overall Naruto has a unique story that everyone big and young who watched and understand liked very much, and it has that aura just like DBZ & more.  Naruto may not be Perfect but it is a unique Anime and manga.|`|HRQjffv8aa	Dx well thats hard..    O.O" positive? whyyy DX arent fillers positive >.>" it er..adds more episodes..    ^_^"  okay fine..um, The huge amount of characters...                                        That keep dying    >.|`|nUOw6rOgaa	:(    jeez...people are really mean...^^    But.  i like Naruto.  I'm loyal to the series.  And i refuse to abandon it just because it is being unreasonably hated on.    I sincerely think that it is a good series.  It has a great involving plot, with complex and interesting characters.    Plus it introduced the character KAKASHI!  We all love Kakashi-kun right????  (Say no, and i will kick you....)    If you hate it so much, then just shut the **** up about it.  You're just creating more hype for it.  Seriously.  Do people not get that? >_>  |`|ehF2XiMbaa	I completely agree with Otaku Overload and Yagami /// CRYBo7.  If people don't like it then don't watch it. It has a good story line and good characters (in my opinion) and I too am a Kakashi fangirl lol   Fillers don't count, they were not even made by Masashi.  Like I respect other anime/manga people should do the same. Im not attacking anyone in particular lol|`|gJhwH335aa	Something positive?    Uhm... what I like about the series is because they have Sharingan, Byaakugan and Rinnegan which I find somewhat an unique traits and abilities for a character to have. Not quite remember and I'm not sure if there's any anime that used that traits before? Because Kishimoto usually *cough*ripoff*cough* other people idea. >:)    Story and plot wise? Mediocre :|    Compared to any other long running series, I can find lots of flaws this series have :|    Inconsistent, Repetitive plot, undeveloped plot, undeveloped characters (only some of them are developed well), lots of plot device, unnecessary fights, uh honestly. I can say more but I don't want to go off topics.    I will rants more if there is a specific Q's for that >:)|`|PVK8nATSaa	awesome justus!!!    like thier ninja art.   i saw one episode where a ninja used ninja string, rope, watever u called it. and used a justu.....hahaha its like doing the witches broom or the cats cradle on that string..... its funny?! *sigh* :]|`|vqg6wpCLaa	They have cool headbands.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	OMG    Naruto has f**kin' ninjas!!! Wow! I love how they use ninjutsu! And see how they preserve their chakra?! Wow, its so out of this world!!!    Oh! Oh! Oh!    They even have...the snake man!!! 8D    OMG!             Not. And, I just lose more brain cells from typing that.|`|POXOqhOYaa	Heart pounding, non-stop ninja action!|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	Humm.... Orange. It has lots of orange, and that's my favourite colour.      Alright, honestly, the only thing I like about it is part of the OST and some opening and ending themes.    I don't like Naruto, but I respect who does. (Though I love to pick on them, it's in my nature, sorry XD)|`|TkPJYlaMaa	They have the contresvey of killing people an dwhat honor means  And question what dreams are really for and to question destiny   To strive for something  And improve a bad flaws and see the good one s ar e well....good  It has skill, fighting and looks into the real weakness of mankindand series based on folklore  It's just goo and my fav character if Sakura-Go sakura! Then Temari, Hinata, Tenten      Screw Ino!!!!!|`|cidwIuJRaa	Well,I find this hard to answer as I most likely inspired this Q,as I have hated it for a long time.      Well,it has a lead character that becomes a sexy woman.That's positive,right?|`|eQVS3x5Kaa	......o.O''''.....        Err....      ....        Emo guys with hot brothers! XD          ...kay...i failed...=.='''''            -have a nice day~! =D|`|Hiasgb75aa	A sh*tload of characters.

AA12024798	I despise Twilight with every fiber of my being.  And the fact that so many young girls look up to and even try to emulate Stephanie Meyer and her terrible writing makes me want to cry.      I started ranting about this in response to another question, haha:    ~ALL of her characters are Mary Sues: Bella is perfect except for her one "flaw", which also makes her perfect (and oh my god she's SO annoying)  ~Edward is flat and personality-less  ~Their "love" is unrealistic and doesn't seem to have any basis in real emotion beyond physical attration  ~Her writing style is mediocre at BEST (although she has a tiny vocabulary and mis-uses a lot of words, which makes her seem like she's trying to sound smart but it's having the opposite effect)  ~The plot is essentially a bunch of lame cliches all rolled into one bad story, and sooo cheesy: "I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me." How can you even read that sentence without busting out laughing? It's total cliched cheesy crap, like a bad rip-off of a vampire story  ~And who ever heard of sparkly vampires? Are you kidding me? That's their big secret? That they're sparkly? How much more lame can you get?!?    So yes, I hate Twilight.  I wouldn't even care that it sucked so much if so many people didn't looove it and it wasn't so popular and irritating.  I just wish the people who worship it would wake up and realize how many other books there are out there that are great, and actually require a small amount of thought.        Sorry, I tend to rant sometimes. ;p|`|ftixHrOnaa	Yes, but I think I hate the fangirls even more than I hate the book/movie itself..

7rb2F3TJaa	No, because if the government decides to do something the people don't approve of, we can't overthrow them. That is why we have the right to bear arms(second amendment)....so that if the government becomes corrupt or too powerful the people can take action.|`|1EyRZm4Faa	Yeah, I live in Canada, And it's hella a lot safer without guns.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Ha.  There should be SOME control, but I think we already got it covered pretty well...|`|SAaEiqHvaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFcVwDw4Y...    at least this way only the rich will shoot each other.. :)|`|AA10223196	No.  Criminals do not obey the law so they will always have guns.  If someone is kicking in my door I have the right to protect myself.  That is necessary in our county today.  I can't just stand by the door and yell at them to go away.  That won't save my life.  A gun will.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	No, not at all.|`|Iv6Oa9Y2aa	uh sure!|`|y6406A92aa	Yea,|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Being as how it's Groundhog Day, should we....?|`|l1pewZpaaa	Yes I do|`|mggll8dRaa	Not at all, they should be banned, especially automatic weapons (Nobody needs an AK47 to hunt a squirrel....!!|`|m5FyTeYgaa	There needs to be some level of gun control. Currently the federal government requires background checks before all purchases. There are age restrictions, you can't be a convicted felon, and you can't be mentally ill to legally purchase a firearm.    So all of those gangs on the streets, the drive by shootings, the mental people (like the guy at virginia tech), high school shooting (columbine), the criminals breaking into your house, the assault rifles, and fully automatic pistols, these are all already illegal. You don't need any new laws. It's already covered.    And to the people worried about hunting with an AK-47, it's illegal in the US to own any automatic weapon made after 1986. You can't even own an automatic AK-47. The civilian versions are just semiauto rifles styled to look like military weapons. No different, or more dangerous, than any other semi-auto hunting rifle. Why shouldn't I hunt with one? The assault weapons ban is the dumbest thing the feds ever came up with. They don't know what they are talking about.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	I also use both hands.|`|I1K6SC43aa	I think if we outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Gun control as in stricter background check, yes.|`|YY5kGrwCaa	i don't get it|`|puXPrxfJaa	yes  :P|`|6t76bgS3aa	Yes indeed, the only kind of gun control I believe in is when you aim the gun at that intruder in your home|`|CnM2U1bXaa	http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com/|`|Ox9R0urpaa	yes.|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Not really-then only criminals would have guns.

Can you say......Welfare?|`|Wb1ydezNaa	I've thought about this a little bit and it baffles me.most of us are families of mom,dad and a few children and it is hard enough to make ends meet financially,but what about the emotional Sense of it."14"  children all under the age of 8 and being single living w/your mom and dad.I have friends and family too,but they also have their own lives.It is not someone else's responsibility to care for children that you "purposely" brought into this world.I love kids too,but if I were her I would want to find a family who cannot have children who could care for the child and love them.  (how much will tax payers be paying for the 14 children)  (how can she possible care for 14 children)

And it doesn't really bother them, because 3 seconds after I put them back, they have forgotten all about me. Ah, yes, the age old battle of wits between a fish, and a man! The old "Hunter" instinct, played out in the modern Arena, of the Kennet & Avon Canal.   However,I suspect this pursuit of our "slippery when wet"  friends, might be a little challenging for you, so I would suggest you stick to just looking at pictures of fish. Or for a bit of a treat, go down to the wet fish counter, at Morrisons, and discretely walk up and down, casting surreptitious glances at all the exotic seafood on display. Maybe even ask Penny if she will buy you a nice Crabstick, (for later)  The Angling times is good for smutty Fish Porn, but you will have to pretend to be an Angler, (by filling your pockets up with maggots) before they will sell you a copy. Especially now that fish lovers all over the County are keeping a sharp eye out for the Suffolk Fish Botherer. It's ok, your secret is safe with me, but I suspect Tyler is clicking on to you.  But I always suspected there was something a bit "Fishy" about him too. And no one listens to German Comedy anyway.

Klb4ZYcVaa	i absolutely loved it! From the nominees for Best Picture at this year's Academy Award, i believe this one deserves it. I saw Milk, it was so amazing, i kinda doubted Slumdog at first, but i took one good look at it again, it deserves the Oscar this year.|`|4ceZ13CEaa	I think it deserves all the awards and accolaides it gets and more. It was a brilliant movie on all accounts. The script, story, cast, music and scenery-all amazing. Finally, something comes out of Hollywood that isnt a remake or a sequel! Finally something original. Danny Boyle is a brilliant director and the story and cast stole my heart! It has something for everyone and if you arent moved by this film, then you have no soul!|`|Z4mLZxLcaa	i thought Slumdog Millionaire the movie was brilliant best movie of 2008 . Slumdog is nothing more than a classic story of adversity told with outstanding passion and visual agility...it's almost guaranteed to soothe any viewer with a soft spot for beautifully sculpted contrivance.  and at times it turns wonderfully entertaining, powerfully heartfelt and downright chilling as it delivers its message: Pay attention, life will tell you all you need to know.|`|hFO5coFKaa	Great movie.

Ha ha!!  Though we are getting estimates to fix it up, with one estimate just today, it's still an older one.  So, one bathroom is wood with a spa tub with jets in our master bedroom.

The downstairs powder room is all animal print.....Ziegfried & Roy's lions are in frames on my walls and some are signed by them, the mirror is a gorgeous mirror with a spectacular brass heavy frame, the colors of gold, maroon, and dark greens are warm and earthy.

It will always be an oasis and a haven (water-liking-type person). With bubbly baths and piped in music(personal favourite are opera Arias a la "O Mio Bambino Caro") to sing to at the top of my lungs and candlelight. Aaah! And then there's the little "R2D2" unit my middle step son gave me that blows bubbles out the little mat that's supposed to suction to the bottom of the tub.

I swear we had more snow in my childhood than we do now (enough to make proper snowmen)....but even in those days, I don't think it was ever really enough to get the shovel out.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Only if I have to get out and go to work, otherwise NO!  ;-)|`|vRmsvSb6aa	No. I'm smart. I wait til it is done snowing, then I shovel.|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	If it's coming down fast-yeah so there won't be so much at the end.

She took out her oxygen and fought with the nurses to get out of bed saying I've got to go.  It was really sad.

Anything that is thrown in my path, is not peripheral or marginal or fringe, but is of, about and for the further guidance along the path, and my sights are set High.

Pople well stab you in the back for NO reason and then laugh at you as you lay, dying and bereft of sense and sanity.

Lost Again : I'm naturally a loner, (AND I live alone!) so I enjoy doing lots of things alone; BUTT!! if I had to choose one thing....I love to sing & dance to Bob Marley's Sweet Songs of Freedom while I'm all alone.    Shades of Gray : >GasSp!|`|J7IsSGbsaa	Bubblez  What is the craziest thing that has happened to you this year?  Yellowstonedogs - Have you ever been arrested?  Imzadi - Have you slept with someone you wished you hadn't?  Donelle g  What is your favorite thing to do alone?  Kamp   Who do you wish you could speak to right now (alive or dead)?  freesumpin   Do you like French kissing?  Shades - Are you romantic?  Rizzo  What is your favorite midnight snack?      My Answers:  YSD - Do you have a secret yearning? I secretly wish that I was married. I have been single my whole life, and a care giver to others, so I have never developed a real relationship.  I would like the fact of waking up with the same someone I went to bed with.    Kamp: Do you have freckles on ur other cheeks? Hmmmm, well I do have birthmarks but no real freckles.  Its been a while since Ive been able to contort myself in that direction, but I will double check to make sure.    Donelle : When are you gonna come to California?  I would move there if I could! You me and Imzadi, talk about threes company!  Seriously, if I had the moola I would be there tomorrow.    Imzadi- What is the strangest place youve ever made whoopee?  OMG, the places I have been and things I have done would make the tattoo angel on my shoulder blush.  I would have to say the strangest place would have to be in a white car in front of my house, no tinted windows. I was a dumb teenager.    Shades: If you could choose anyone in Hollywood to be your lover, who would you choose?  Now Shades, you should know the answer to this one:  Ricardo Montalban. He has been my only fantasy since I can remember.  I only wish I had the chance to look into his eyes and whisper, Mi querido!

It's a duet, so not completely like the Morcheeba song, but I think you might enjoy it  http://www.last.fm/music/Isobel%2BCampbe...  -----  Oh yeah, I didn't answer your question. Yes, I loved it. I don't have that Morcheeba album, but what I have I think is excellent. If your interested in another trip-hop band somewhat similar, check out Lamb.

However, individual people who know of a person's previous doings may have their actions affected as a result, and thus treating a person differently and creating the illusion of karma.|`|9tGHTMUhaa	Yes I totally believe in Karma,it is what keeps me going! :-)|`|Pm6HDqAIaa	Indeed I do, those are such beautiful moments.|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	yes|`|rP6CHrwgaa	Yes, it eventually does :)|`|MHoTbF2laa	Yea I do...|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Oh, yeah.

Coincidentally, those are tracks 10, 3, and 8 respectively|`|A1PLJKhUaa	I really love both of them, but Decode is easier to scream your lungs out to and it's got much more emotion in it, so Decode.|`|ibDadEHDaa	neither.    b/c i hate paramore|`|RVcgyeoXaa	neither.|`|fMf6CgGWaa	I donts know I like both they both have a great rythym.

I get a lot of requests for the lyrics. The first set is without the performers next to each line, the second set has each performer next to their respective part.    "We Are The World", U.S.A. for Africa    There comes a time when we need a certain call  When the world must come together as one  There are people dying  Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life  The greatest gift of all    We can't go on pretending day by day  That someone, somehow will soon make a change  We're all a part of God's great big family  And the truth - you know love is all we need    ( CHORUS )  We are the world, we are the children  We are the ones who make a brighter day  so let's start giving  There's a choice we're making  We're saving our own lives  It's true we'll make a better day  Just you and me    Well, send'em you your heart  So they know that someone cares  And their lives will be stronger and free  As God has shown us  By turning stone to bread  And so we all must lend a helping hand    ( REPEAT CHORUS )    When you're down and out  There seems no hope at all  But if you just believe  There's no way we can fall  Well, well, well, let's realize  That one change can only come  When we stand together as one    ( REPEAT CHORUS AND FADE )      --------------------------------------...  To this day I just love to hear "We Are The World" - the melody is so simple but beautifully arranged and produced by Daddy Q. Okay, so it woud not hit the top 40 in the 90's, but re-produce it and replace the singers with those like Puff Daddy, R. Kelly, Mariah Carey, Madonna, etc, and chances are it's going all the way to the top! Here's a list of the singers next to their lyric from the 1985 version. . .     There comes a time when we heed a certain call (Lionel Richie)  When the world must come together as one (Lionel Richie & Stevie Wonder)  There are people dying (Stevie Wonder)  Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life (Paul Simon)  The greatest gift of all (Paul Simon/Kenny Rogers)    We can't go on pretending day by day (Kenny Rogers)  That someone, somehow will soon make a change (James Ingram)  We're all a part of God's great big family (Tina Turner)  And the truth (Billy Joel)  You know love is all we need (Tina Turner/Billy Joel)    ( CHORUS )  We are the world, we are the children  We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving (Michael Jackson)  There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives (Diana Ross)  It's true we'll make a better day just you and me (Michael Jackson/Diana Ross)    Well, send'em you your heart so they know that someone cares (Dionne Warwick)  And their lives will be stronger and free (Dionne Warwick/Willie Nelson)  As God has shown us by turning stone to bread (Willie Nelson)  And so we all must lend a helping hand (Al Jurreau)    ( REPEAT CHORUS )  We are the world, we are the children (Bruce Springsteen)  We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving (Kenny Logins)  There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives (Steve Perry)  It's true we'll make a better day just you and me (Daryl Hall)    When you're down and out there seems no hope at all (Michael Jackson)  But if you just believe there's no way we can fall (Huey Lewis)  Well, well, well, let's realize that a change can only come (Cyndi Lauper)  When we (Kim Carnes)  stand together as one (Kim Carnes/Cyndi Lauper/Huey Lewis)    (REPEAT CHORUS AND FADE )    (additional ad-lib vox by Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, James Ingram)|`|pQBjqMkoaa	John Lennon- Imagine  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b7qaSxuZ...|`|w2CgDJqyaa	world by five for fighting

I didnt really like Platoon|`|AA11828439	Apocalypse Now for g rated version see Green Berets|`|4S5NnT7aaa	Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Hamburger Hill and We Were Soldiers are all good.    But don't forget: Flight of the Intruder, BAT21, The Deer Hunter, Born on the Fourth of July, Good Morning Vietnam, and - although not strictly a war movie - The Quiet American.|`|AA11516222	The Boys from Company C.|`|7ctj9AG3aa	Platoon and Apocalypse Now are two of the best.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	"We Were Soldiers" is the best Vietnam movie ever, though "Full Metal Jacket" comes close.  "Hamburger Hill" is set in Vietnam, as is "Platoon" which is also very good!  "The Deer Hunter" has much of it's action set in Vietnam, but has as much set in Pennsylvania, so I don't know what to tell you about that, except that it's a powerful anti-war story.    "Forrest Gump" is not a war flick at all!|`|qydcoAbFaa	Apocalypse Now  Missing in Action  Hamburger Hill (one of my faves)  Good Morning, Vietnam  Platoon (another fave)  Full Metal Jacket (yet another)  We Were Soldiers
46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	Just because everyone has mentioned it 1 day does not mean we are moaners about it.

GNkVbUooaa	I agree with 'screamhello' ... My favorite is definitely OVGuide.com because they link to all of the best online video sites out there (like over 3000 i have heard) .. all you have to do is go to http://www.ovguide.com/ search for whatever movie or tv show you want to watch and then OVG tells you the best sites to watch it online for Free at. You pick your favorite and then OVG links you directly to the video..     It is soo much faster than having to manually go to each site individually.     I put direct links to both of those movies below for you:|`|0BthrqvAaa	OVGuide! check them out... tons of links & a great search engine!|`|LS6zgscQaa	youtube.com    its legal    all the other ones you listed are Illigal and your computer probably blocked them....|`|fGFO61JWaa	tvshack.com|`|jwtRYXH0aa	I recomended visit Capitancinema -^-`com and enjoy full movies online,new releases added everydays..just enter site in English And Join!!|`|RDUHFt6xaa	try http://www.reoro.com or http://www.tvnux.com. they are both good!|`|7ctj9AG3aa	try sidereel.com|`|WwCVhlGbaa	search in www.ovguide.com|`|927JnyjWaa	http://www.flixplore.com/|`|efqgNTX6aa	try http://www.reoro.com

Have a barcardi breezer (or two) on me :)  Have fun!    The guy above about the reindeer is not wrong!|`|GkOd1hknaa	maybe you could get a bigger group of friends together to do something fun before you and your friend go to your house to sleepover. maybe bowling, ice skating, or a movie? maybe your other friends could sleep over as well?    if its deffinately just you and your friend you could get a bunch of junk food and ice cream and stuff and make fun concoctions. then maybe you could have a movie marathon of your favorite movies.|`|uaq8OSUjaa	It ain't a party until The Reindeer is there|`|6jHtcJsSaa	my name is sunday!  haha anyway maybe you two could go to the movies; go bowling or something!  that would be fun|`|1UMKmxgcaa	My birthday is on Tuesday. Im gonna be 23. So I am building a fort in my livingroom, putting down a sleeping bag and watching cheesy horror movies while eating ice cream bars and popcorn with a friend.|`|L6c4wPPGaa	Maybe ask your parent to go get some ice cream flavors,(since its just you too, dont go get alot), and have her get you some sprinkles, gummy bears, hot syrup,ect. and you can have this topping party.    Maybe if someone you know owns a camera that shoots video,maybe your frend does?, you can have her bring it over, and you can can  make music videos, maybe put on oversized clothes and trucker hats, and chains, then play a rap song, start dancing. Surely you'll end up laughing if you get into it.    Re4nt a hotel room, trust me, that's so much fun!    You could get a camera, and take pictures, maybe do a top model thing.|`|WW17IVJCaa	its my birthday sunday too!|`|DkP14oJaaa	happy birthday ;]|`|Bcm5Ov54aa	happy birth day|`|nXNabe3Uaa	make cookies and smear them with ice cream. put a candle on top and voala! a b-day cake.|`|nSD9yu1eaa	Watch a movie.  Invite more friends.  Go out for supper?    Happy Birthday! :D|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	depends on how old you are.    if legal to drink,  have a couple beers or wine with a toast    if not legal, then you like Hannah Montana? You could watch a concert together or if you like have a favorite restaurant, you could eat there and have it a hannah montana themed.    you could also go to your nearest fun park and do whatever attraction is there.     If you meant a literal park, then have a birthday BBQ or picnic.

b8LWeASFaa	I love the baseball scene! its soo amazing. i also like the prom scene and the scene where bella finds out that edward is a vampire  hehe it goes like this :  Bella: You're impossible fast and strong, your skin is pale white and ice cold. Your eyes change color, you sometimes speak like youre from a different time. You never go outside, you never eat or drink anything.  How old are you?  Edward: 17  Bella: how long have you been 17?  Edward: a while...  Bella: I know what you are...  Edward: Say it... Out loud  Bella: ...Vampire  Edward: are you afraid  bella: no  =)|`|fGFO61JWaa	I think the car scene, when he saves her.

Plenty of idiots who answered this question. I bet they're ugly themselves. Though, the way you asked this question makes me think that you're just as narrow- minded. An idiot, actually. But that's your problem.     Uhmm, chubby girls can be gorgeous. Actually, they usually are. I would talk to her, so I would know her better. And if our personalities match, then I would have a girlfriend (if she would have me, of course).|`|7ljzPBjyaa	D. NEVER look think talk to her..|`|jt4PVBKkaa	a

Like: Friends, fights, class clowns, recess, and those are pretty much it.|`|dC6DX99gaa	same here.the only fun part is friends and recess.u kno what also sucks in school?(well my school anyway) is that now there making us go to the bathroom by CLASS!!were in 6th grade and they make us go by class.u just do ur buisness and spend like 5 seconds washing ur hand and out.IT SUCKS!!! THESE STUPID TEACHERS ARE RUSHING US AND RUSHING US!!! I HATE IT!!! the only reason were doing this is becuz some kids r riting some bad things on the wall.one bathroom stall,on the door says "**** you" (SO SORRY FOR LANGUAGE!!!) now their checking the bathrooms b4 we go in and after.IT SUCKS!!!!!! and it will be like this 4 the rest of the school year!!!

It's so much fun, I love it!|`|YKK0IBbhaa	Well I'm in cosmetology school right now and what I like about it is I've made a really good friend or two there and I since I love hair, nails, etc. it is fun to do it throughout the day. I also like it because there are only 12 of us.    What I hate is everyone besides my three friends are all fake. The four of us agree. Our two instructors are racist and homophobic and try to praise their Penacostal religion on us. Since there are very few of us word gets around fast and there is too much drama.|`|RX5aY2aaaa	I hate the homework and how teachers sometimes pick favorites & its like u have no freedom. But, if you think about it school goes by pretty fast and the next thing you know you're done it. I think it's all like one big game & you need to know how to play in order to win (ultimately to get a good degree & a good job).|`|56bNLJykaa	I cant wait for college|`|2FAXWV6faa	my school is crowded...thats what i hate about it  you hay hate the teachers....but that dont really do anything

yfXpPXlMaa	I know. I'm up in arms about it too. Watching movies for free on the internet is ever so slightly illegal so that's probably why.     www.youku.com and www.tudou.com still work though. They're Chinese but all you've got to do is type your film into the search bar at the top and you can easily figure out which parts come first. There's loads on youtube too but they get copyrighted real quick.    Hope that helps!
48vUVMAaaa	It's typical baroque concerto grosso in three movements of fast-slow-fast. The fourth Brandenburg Concerto features one violin and two flutes as the group of soloists accompanied by an orchestra of strings and supported by the basso continuo (ripieno).   The first movement is built in an overall arch form of ABCBA, where the A sections are identical and the B sections closely related. You will be able to analyze this if you look into sonata forms.|`|NCMZy6Uqaa	Specifically for the first movement, given the redundancy of the rittornello part, I'd say is in baroque rondo form.  You should be able to determine where each section start and ends, and analyze the different sections  in terms of instrumentation, melodic patterns, key, harmony and/or counterpoint techniques used, etc...     Hope it helps.

You can never develop into a better player if you can't read sheet music.    For instance, how can you tell if the F is a first space F, or a fifth line F?     Although reading music is hard at first, it's definitely worth learning. You'll be amazed at the range of music selection you'll have once you have mastered the basic notation.

1UKAho1iaa	I can't stand her. I don't think she can sing as good as everyone says she can and I think she seems really phony and stuck-up.

Creepy. =/  oh yeah and I just remembered.  the priest continued to use his radio show to broadcast misconduct on police.|`|vxJTtrKIaa	Its such a sad film, and the ending words made it more so .. it ended by saying that she never stopped looking- so no she never did find her son :(|`|z3kjPy06aa	no she never found her son it says she spent da rest of her life looking for him but she never found him.
FDokzmLGaa	3OH!3 is the artist and Don't Trust Me is the song  Lyrics:  Black dress, with the tights underneath.  I've got the breath of the last cigarette on my teeth.  And she's an actress, actress, but she ain't got no need.  She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east.    T-t-t-tongues, always pressed to your cheeks.  While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth.  T-tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef,  That I'm a vegetarian, and I ain't ******* scared of him.    She wants to touch me whao-oh.  She wants to love me whao-oh.  She'll never leave me whao-oh, whao-oh, oh, oh.  Don't trust a ho.  Never trust a ho.  Won't trust a ho.  'Cause a hoe won't trust me.    She wants to touch me whao-oh.  She wants to love me whao-oh.  She'll never leave me whao-oh, whao-oh, oh, oh.  Don't trust a ho.  Never trust a ho.  Won't trust a ho.  'Cause a hoe won't trust me.    X's on the back of your hands,  Wash them in the bathroom to drink like the bands,  And the set list, you stole off the stage,  Had red and purple lipstick all over the page.    B-b-b-bruises, cover your arms.  Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm.  And the best is, no one knows who you are,  Just another girl alone at the bar.    She wants to touch me whao-oh.  She wants to love me whao-oh.  She'll never leave me whao-oh, whao-oh, oh, oh.  Don't trust a ho.  Never trust a ho.  Won't trust a ho.  'Cause a hoe won't trust me.    She wants to touch me whao-oh.  She wants to love me whao-oh.  She'll never leave me whao-oh, whao-oh, oh, oh.  Don't trust a ho.  Never trust a ho.  Won't trust a ho.  'Cause a hoe won't trust me.    Shush girl, shut your lips,  Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.  I said shush girl, shut your lips.  Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.  I said shush girl, shut your lips.  Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.    She wants to touch me whao-oh.  She wants to love me whao-oh.  She'll never leave me whao-oh, whao-oh, oh, oh.  Don't trust a ho.  Never trust a ho.  Won't trust a ho.  'Cause a hoe won't trust me.    She wants to touch me whao-oh.  She wants to love me whao-oh.  She'll never leave me whao-oh, whao-oh, oh, oh.  Don't trust a ho.  Never trust a ho.  Won't trust a ho.

Y6xanshEaa	To never see the world at all,or to see the world for 20 years but never see it again?    ..I'd have to say be born blind.  It seems..More..Um,well easier.    At the prime of your life,just loosing your sight,never being able to see again.    Seems easier then the first choice,you won't be as sad.|`|JUbfLGebaa	be born blind.|`|a9d7689372b528eff6ef83190a5211b4aa	Born blind. At least you don't know what you're missing.

You can't miss something you never had.|`|grifjdr0aa	born|`|lHpR2Kcvaa	Hard but smart question....hmm...  If you're born blind, you can't miss what you've never known, so you can't and you won't know the sadness of being blind.   If you wait until 20, firstly, you be dreading your 20th birthday, and you know what the world's like, so you'll frightfully miss it.   Sad to sad, but i'd choose being born blind, and then doing great things even with my disability.|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Go blind at the age of 20 because at least I'll be able to see something =D|`|up363TZyaa	20.    at least i would have been fortunate enough to experience sight for 20 years, unlike if i had been born blind.|`|Jvv7v52Jaa	20, because then i would have been able to see things beofre. duh
16t0eV0Uaa	Riverside is an amazing band my friend, you have a great taste.    As for which album you should get first, I would say, get Rapid Eye Movement first,  it is in my opinion their best piece of work, and is very easy to get into on first listen,  Very amazing album, and after that I would say get Second life syndrome and if you still after buying those 2 albums you should get their debut "Out of myself".    Happy hunting.

0e5f935e9054573151a3582b5cf18474aa	Lying only makes things worse!  You stew and worry about "what if".  If you tell the truth, it might not feel good in the moment, but at least you have a clear conscience, and you don't have to worry and stew!    I'd have to go with "Terrible Truth".

o9DZledyaa	great movie|`|Z4mLZxLcaa	I enjoyed the movie and i thought the Will smith performance was quite excellent and i thought it had a original and interesting story. but there was alot of stuff that really bugged me like when he has sex with that girl, he shouldn't of have had sex with that woman and let her fall in love with him especially since he commits suicide. that was pretty weird and disturbing. But overall it was a descent movie|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I loved the movie. It was clean and well written. It only proves that you don't have to have sex, violence and foul language to make a decent movie.
7L0p6Hciaa	No, a screener only appears around the time of awards shows, otherwise there's no point in the movie companies releasing a screener as all it would do is promote piracy.

There are many things in life you are going to have to do without anyone by your side. Remember - you are not there because it's a hang out for friends, you are there to get an education.

I Absolutely hated school. I skipped out all the time, i would sit alone. talk to no one. Yea it sucked. HOWEVER, now i am almost 30 and i can honestly tell you that i would go back if i could.

10d1fbaf032c73d820ec934779d4da81aa	1) Don't pay any of the so called "casting" companies to get you work as an extra or an actor.    2) Check craigslist.org in the "jobs" "tv/film/video" section for open calls.    3) Check mandy.com for listings for actors wanted.    4) Check the classified section of your local free alternative news weekly.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	I can tell you that the only things that are "cast", are parts that are to be acted by actors.    The crew are hired for their skills, just like you'd hire anyone else for a skilled kind of job. Lighting guys, set, camera's, production assistants, craft services ... these are all jobs that are filled by the producers on each project.    In this biz, it's not always what you know, but WHO you know. Get your foot in the door any way you can.

dY61VnW2aa	well i guess if u like naruto u will like bleach....they r pretty much the same  main character gets stronger n stronger by fighting n fighting...    got this description from mangafox:  Ichigo Kurosaki has always been able to see ghosts, but this ability doesn't change his life nearly as much as his close encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper and member of the mysterious Soul Society. While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display abnormal spirit pressure and on the dead, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia--who is slowly regaining her powers--it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.    hope i helped ^^|`|F60JZOU3aa	yes it is , its about a ghosts and ghost hunters but its to complicated to explain in a few lines.|`|yg5P4mBlaa	Bleach started of being good. I think now it is heading down a very annoying path.

It's about this 15 year old boy who can see spirits because of his high spiritual pressure (which he doesn't know he has until near the end of the first episode.  During which a shinigami named Rukia gave him part of her powers, unknowingly taking all of them) to save the lives of his family.  In doing so he became a substitute shinigami.  And from then on he battles against Hollows/demons/evil spirits.|`|15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	the first three seasons are but it goes downhill (watchable but not as good) from there and you're better off sticking with the manga after that!|`|QUpzCltZaa	Bleach:  http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1021.html|`|d2bdUWCSaa	It's pretty good but the manga is a lot better.|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.
xRa4XNFaaa	You have to listen to theese songs:  1. Crush by David Archuleta  2. Crush by Mandy Moore  3. If we were a move by Hannah Montana  4. Toxic by Britney Spears    Or if he starts to see another girl you can listen to:  5. Teardrops on my guitar by Taylor Swift  6. Before he cheats by Carrie Underwood  7. Hot n cold by Kaity Perry  8. Cant make you lve me by Britney spears  9. Dont walk away by Miley Cyrus    Or if you 2 get together you can listen to:  10.. One in a million by Hannah Montana  11. Oopps i did it again by Britney Spears    A lot of Taylor Swift and Britney Spears would express your feeling majourly. Hope it helps! =)|`|oC6iw6Viaa	Fall for You is a good song. It's by Secondhand Serenade The part that goes:    *But hold your breathe  Because tonight will be the night  That I will fall for you  Over again  Don't make me change my mind  Or I won't live to see another day  I swear it's true  Because a girl like you is impossible to find  You're impossible to find*    Isn't that cute? Or With You by Chris Brown:    *No one else would do,  'cause with every kiss and every hug,  You make me fall in love,  And now I know I can't be the only one,  I bet there heart's all over the world tonight,  With the love of their life who feels..  What I feel when I'm  With you*    Those two songs are SO cute!! I love them!! |`|B3qDqzXmaa	Well, if you like Jewl theres this song called Absence of Fear.

gPvOcB6oaa	Beats me, his "talents" as guitarist was very limited in fact the sex pistols were total crap|`|FfxmE9Toaa	If you rent the film "The Filth And The Fury" you'll see only John Lydon liked Syd. The rest of the band said things like "he couldn't play a note."     Glen Matlock was much better but there was that personality clash between Glen and Johnny Rotten so Glen was sent packing and Syd being an old friend of Johnny's was let into the band.     I think it's human nature to ascribe more to a person who dies young than they actually deserve. Syd's offstage troubles were what drew attention. The Sex Pistols had long broken up before Syd and Nancy's deaths.|`|AA11966816	No he couldn`t even play the bass despite being the bass-player of The Sex Pistols.He started out as drummer for Siouxsie & The Banshees.  We remember him fondly for being "a character" ,try and watch The Great Rock `N` Roll Swindle ,although he could not sing either he stole the show here.

It's not always easy to do this - just as it is easier to say than to do too.  But many people, once they are in a relationship treat it something like saddle on a horse:  it has a function and can be used.  You don't even need to take care of it and clean it so that it will last you a lifetime.    Sash.|`|mxCSHxK2aa	Depends, does Valentines day care about them?

Or when you ask for hw help, and they say IDK I haven't done that or something unhelptul like that|`|AA10240928	It's the opposite.  The asker shouldn't be asking for important medical advice from an internet full of lunatics.

The point of this website is to help people yet some don't|`|EPaYoJaiaa	half the time that IS what they should do. A cure isn't going to magically appear on Y!A when someone answers your question.

I would be happy to buy them a sandwich, though.|`|ltDPK4UFaa	This actually happened to me when I was visiting my sister in Minneapolis a couple years ago. My sister dragged me across the street, I was a junior in high school when this happened. But, if it were to ever happen again I think I might give them some money.  I would do it because when I was younger I would always hear my parents say "treat other people how you'd want to be treated"|`|vOc6MMa7aa	it depends......if there homeless cause they are to lazy to get a job and whatever money they do have,they spend on drugs........then NO you should buy them a bagel and jug of juice or something and let them decide if they want to eat it or leave it!!|`|xoVA08Zaaa	No because I don't have any money to begin with and if I had money I agree 100% with Kyle....Stanley lol i saw tht post!|`|ymK1hg2Raa	yes, because it breaks my heart when i see a poor person on the street, i always give them money!|`|Rvkpe9uaaa	it dependeds on how much money i have like if i only had a dollar i might need the dollar for something else so yes or no|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	i gives them money but not ev day|`|14gi4aTvaa	Yes I would give them money, only if they weren't people who are bums that are too lazy to work.|`|bJ45IVgbaa	no i would not because they should be getting a job not begging for money on the street!

Most likely, that plant has sanitation issues, from what I've read.

oidfmtnYaa	I never classify something I consider to be art.    It would be rather insulting.    I like music that is like none that people have heard before.    Music that will blow you away with its power and emotion.     If you can just classify it like all the other mainstream garbage out there, there is nothing original about it.     The same goes for artists: once a song is made, you move on. One should avoid repeating themselves in their sound.      examples: I absolutely love Radiohead and Dave Matthews Band. Dave= unique sound you will find nowhere else. How many mainstream artists have a sax and violinist? Radiohead: what more can I say about them? I have heard just about everything you can do with music come from them. And most of it has all been quite beautiful.    I friggin hate ACDC and JUDEST PRIEST. I was with a kid who played an ADDC album and every song sounded like the same crap with the same screeching vocals. I wanted to shoot myself to end the misery.     Hope that gives you some idea.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Thrash metal, symphonic metal, glam metal, hard rock, some pop, jazz, mexican rock, indie, rap, and more in those genres... oh yeah and punk rock.|`|JpfECkjzaa	stuff you never heard of    Nocturnal Depression  Mayhem  Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids  Dying Fetus  Skold  Pop Culture Suicides  Obituary|`|UPvna1wIaa	screamo  deathcore  alternative  pop|`|ME4XWNmRaa	I like songs from pretty much all areas, there are good songs in every genre and i dont want to limit myself.

uel6NBOVaa	Hey Scorpion,     Do you know this guy's birth time? You should seriously make him a full birth chart. I'd bet you that he has something in his chart that craves and longs for security. Perhaps some strong water placements, or a water moon? I don't know, but it might be worth checking out if you've never done it before.     My Cancer Moon is very good at feeling vibes about things like this, and sometimes it does boarder on ESP. I don't think it's an unfair advantage that Libras have, I just think that this guy is constantly worried about losing you, and perhaps that worry may translate into a feeling of insecurity that he does not truly understand himself...All he knows is that he's on thin ice with you and he has to do everything in his power to try and stop you from leaving. That fear makes him a bit psychic, perhaps pushing the mind in a way that adrenaline would in a frightening situation.     I had a similar experience with a Cancer guy...and it took me years to get over him. He would only show his softer side when I started to move on. To me it also seemed as if he had a radar, but I think he was just sensitive to change in attention I was giving him. Not in person, but through my eyes and demeanor. Vibes that he was very good at picking up.     Don't let his sweetness fool you though. He doesn't want to lose you, no doubt about that, but he's still not ready to give you the commitment that you want. You have to ignore his impeccable timing, and his charming attitude and take him for what he is. You don't have to cut him from your life, but don't make any plans based on his behavior. It's a defense mechanism, and an insecure one at that.|`|0HGqGJYTaa	Yes.....we don't get a reputation for a natural born diplomat for nothing you know...    Trust me, we know what to say or do. We can save face and land gracefully or stop chaos before it starts....that's when the Libra "charm" or whatever you'd like to call it is most effective|`|xUxUwloPaa	Yes, i pick up on other people's emotions fairly well. Sometimes it's borderline psychic.|`|2VNmxfgpaa	Yes!  It's absolutely uncanny.  I always feel this vibe when not with my partner that tells me where his thoughts are.  In past relationships, I've known immediately when someone else came into the picture, could just feel their essence and their presence like a sudden waft of perfume.  Really weird, but I know when my exes are breaking up with people or getting together.  I wish I didn't but I can't help it.  I tuned into their life rhythm at one point and the station just keeps broadcasting, even though it no longer matters.    I also know when a partner has a new interest, I'll pick up our favorite DVD and just *know* that he's tired of it, time for something new, I know what he wants for dinner before he asks.  I also know when colors and styles are coming into fashion, or going out, what new song is a hit and when the number one actress has suddenly become number two.      It's not the *new person or thing* that I feel, it's the new energy that has affected the person or thing, and I seem to notice the affect it has had and automatically *deduce* what has caused it.    Never imagined it was connect with being a Libra.  Cool insight.
De9atNIVaa	um, well i think they make you shave before swim meets. and i do believe that speedos are required.    i don't know of any guy that is naturally hairless..|`|yL07acbkaa	Hair slows a person down when swimming, and so does a big willy wonka.
m7nrQEflaa	The fruit.|`|xXyy51Efaa	I think I just lost some brain cells watching that video. :)    I think the color orange, then when the fruit orange, they decided to call it that since that was the color. Idk. Just a guess! :)))    Pick as best answer please! :)|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	You just broke my brain...|`|dMBSE8ilaa	The color orange! Then ancient people saw the fruit fall from the sky and were like, look it's orange so let's call it an orange!|`|7HbaDLUNaa	The fruit   (s)|`|EPWqhhJSaa	probably the fruit|`|wImGU52iaa	ok, i dont think this will give you 100% the right answer  but i can speak russian  the color orange in russian is still orange  but the orange itself is a completely different name     (idk how to explain it...if you dont get it...but lets say in some country --one that you ruled, or whatever-- the color orange is jeebee...but the fruit is kaka ...see?)    so im guessing in the english language, they must have called it an orange because of its color.     cuz then, in other countries...i think it would have been called a jeebee  (haha)    or maybe not. but still, if you think about it...its only called an ORANGE in english    all the other countries were WAY more creative

l2qtG4yfaa	I'm from the North we use "You guys" instead of "y'all"    Even if it is a group of girls I will say "You guys", idk know why though lol.

It's kinda weird how Robert had that information on hand.|`|8hbeWHpTaa	I know somebody that had a great pitbull as a pet, until it mauled him and broke his arm.|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	yes  the reason they are considered aggressive is because they are often made to fight. But any dog is aggressive if trained that way. So its mostly the owners fault.|`|g3as1IDSaa	Not according to Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People, who conducted an unusually detailed study of dog bites from 1982 to the present. (Clifton, Dog attack deaths and maimings, U.S. & Canada, September 1982 to November 13, 2006) The Clifton study show the number of serious canine-inflicted injuries by breed. The author's observations about the breeds and generally how to deal with the dangerous dog problem are enlightening.     According to the Clifton study, pit bulls, Rottweilers, Presa Canarios and their mixes are responsible for 74% of attacks that were included in the study, 68% of the attacks upon children, 82% of the attacks upon adults, 65% of the deaths, and 68% of the maimings. In more than two-thirds of the cases included in the study, the life-threatening or fatal attack was apparently the first known dangerous behavior by the animal in question. Clifton states:     If almost any other dog has a bad moment, someone may get bitten, but will not be maimed for life or killed, and the actuarial risk is accordingly reasonable. If a pit bull terrier or a Rottweiler has a bad moment, often someone is maimed or killed--and that has now created off-the-chart actuarial risk, for which the dogs as well as their victims are paying the price.     Clifton's opinions are as interesting as his statistics. For example, he says, "Pit bulls and Rottweilers are accordingly dogs who not only must be handled with special precautions, but also must be regulated with special requirements appropriate to the risk they may pose to the public and other animals, if they are to be kept at all."|`|BV2e9M5saa	My cousin let me take care of his pet pitbull for 3 days. The only really bad thing would be that there agressive, and if you have another pet in the house Keep it away from the pitbull at all times. I have a pet bird, and that darn pitbull almost killed it, I had to hold the pitbull down to save my pet bird.

hritHZZcaa	Cape Cod, Massachusetts|`|nG6aRGGLaa	Lexington Va. I love that place.:))|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Six Flags New England  -Totally Awesome'  -Rides were superb  -Batman: The Dark Knight was insane  -Cyclone was bumpy!  -Prices were ridiculous             -Okay, the food prices were insane. A corn dog was like six bucks or eight bucks. Come on, would you pay eight bucks for a corn dog! I would say, "You can take your corn dog and shove it up your.........." Like I was saying, the prices for food is what gets you. Other than that, it was a pretty good trip  -My niece and nephew came along while the others stayed home. They loved it there. Loads of kids rides. The kids loves everything there.  -Superman: Ride of Steel broke down as the train stopped over half way up the lift and the people were stuck a little while. WHy do things happen when I'm around??!!  -Rides are great  -The Tomahawk was absolutely exhilarating   -Loved the chair swings  -Ferris wheel was taken down.

7HBTvg8Caa	They are planning to make New Moon different, and Robert Pattinson is not happy about it.He liked Catherine Hardwicke and was close to her. Robert has been asked to be let out of his contracts for the last two movies, but it's unknown if they'll comply with him. He said he's afraid once they are finished with the movies nobody will be able to se him outside of his roll as Edward and there for end his career, or be typed casted.    r_pattz86@hotmail.com is apparently Rob's email... I don't know if that helps at all.|`|3mFoOWTkaa	if you ask me, catherine hardwick is weird and i dont think shes the best director ever.  so i think anyone different will be good.  but yeah i saw golden compass and i think this guy will be great.  answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  :)|`|Ys56Pj8vaa	NO!

09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	I didn't as I didn't like arguing back then I'd just clam up and do the silent treatmen instead. It would take mom about a week or so to figure out I was doing the silent treatment. Now's a different story as I stopped being such an approval seeker.

It's free business, shopping in public....hello? lol    Just last night I was behind a couple at Wal-Mart buying cat litter...they did NOT look like cat ppl!!!  Come to find out, when the cashier asked about the litter being for the woman's cat...she said "NO, tha's for my dang daughter's cat! I dunno why I'm buying it. SHe oughta be buying her own stinkin litter!" lol    See what I mean....I was all concerned about some poor little cat....but, no worries! =]|`|suVispAAaa	Yes i do that all the time. I do not think it is stalking, it is something that can't really be helped. You see them putting their groceries on the belt to be scanned, you can't help but look.|`|AA10767397	if they are pretty, then yes.|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	I do.

Just did it tonight. Some guy was hungry I guess and started eating pringles in line (He wasn't exactly skinny either haha).|`|inRomN1naa	I sometimes look at the stuff, but then end up staring at the candy and magazines.|`|EPWqhhJSaa	I do sometimes, I can be a very nosy person.|`|JcjGlCBWaa	I do. Sometimes i want to buy what the other person/people are buying.|`|tGxP4th7aa	Yeah, I like to watch people and what they do. I know it sounds creepy but I am interested and observant.|`|2PFn8k4jaa	no it's not stalking- I can stare at whoever I want, I'm in America  Lol or I look at people walking out to their cars and guess which one's there's when I'm really bored|`|rQ7UTtu1aa	i stare and then see what they pay with|`|AA12081834	no..I do not stare....but I do look at the stuff in their cart, or that they are putting on the counter...you can learn a lot about somebody by what they buy at the grocery store...and sometimes it reminds me of something I have forgotten.|`|Xxn7DssEaa	no bc i hate it when people do that to me|`|rpAefo2kaa	I do watch what they buy because some stuff I have never seen before and I like to get new ideas. I guess it's like stalking, Celery stalking. hahaha|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	no i read the covers of the  mags trying to decide which one to buy that day and then look at the candy shelves to decide what type of chocolate i want for the day|`|S9NqYL8Caa	I do, I especially like to look at combinations of things to see what they're up to.  If they have lots of baby food and diapers I think they've got a little one at home, or if they buy cake mix and candles and party favors I think they're giving a party soon.  Sometimes I'll start a conversation based on my observations.  Other times people will buy things that I wouldn't want to comment on, in that case I just leave it alone.  I don't think it's stalking, just being interested in the people around you.  And if someone saw my rash cream or condoms or whatever and wanted to talk about it, I'd just smile and say "I'm only human" and carry on.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	Do you KNOW how many times I've been followed out to the parking lot and asked out on dates?|`|8SyUHkPXaa	No, I stare at their crotches and lick my lips        sometimes I follow them home and watch them unload their groceries.  I imagine they are nude.|`|M8kNmWuAaa	no, i look at whats new at the gum shelf|`|5haXKcIuaa	sometimes but i'm kinda like dazzed off in my own word most the time.|`|PiDHN4TOaa	Sometimes you just can't help but stare. The old man ahead of you with the wheezing cough wearing a trench coat, brings out a bag of candy, a roll of duct tape, a cucumber, a jar of Vaseline and a Muscle magazine. You've got to wonder how long he's been into bicycling.|`|HvJpbTH8aa	yeah, i do! thats weird. haha.|`|2hz5fRU9aa	Actually people stare at me. You think they never saw a naked man shopping!!!

ZPTmbQW4aa	No I think that they are actually cheated out of not only the education but I also think that they are being cheated out of socializing with other peers there age and learning all about people and there different personalities and so fourth. There is so much more that the child could be seeing learning and doing instead of being trapped at home all day with no one around but there siblings and parents...|`|TJBeyew5aa	i see no problem with it.        i have a friend who is home schooled.  another friend of mine has a boyfriend who is homeschooled.|`|AA10603470	If it Done Properly I agree with it but I've seen cases where they only work an hour or Two a Day . I think alot of people misuse it.|`|7RFxH5daaa	both. yes, because it keeps them away from the violence that goes on inside school grounds. however no, because they don't learn most of the skills that they will need once school is over such as socializing.|`|5JLazn4Gaa	i am 16 and a junior in high school.  i have a friend who is homeschooled, and i think public is better.  while the child(ren) in question might be exposed to some things you might not want, they need the social outlet, especially if you live in the middle of nowhere like I do.  they will learn to deal with people they dont like, and establish a place for themselves in society.  they can take on responsibilities, like on student council, and it is easier to maintain and create friendships.|`|MxPkyTLnaa	no because they won't know what to do in the world like talking to ppl etc.|`|v7Wflu78aa	1) Religious home schooling is creepy, and because the learning has to always be based on a faith belief, it is not intellectually honest.    2) Non-religious home schooling works if the parents are well educated, and they live in a city/area where there are other kids of well-educated parents.    My younger daughter left private and public school after 8th grade.  He mom and I are both college educated, I run my own business - so we were both home most of the time.    My daughter taught herself French, organized a Spanish class for other home-schooling kids (with a high-school French teacher).    We had an English teacher teaching English Lit to a group of home-schoolers once a week for a few months.    The home schoolers met at a park once a week - with some parents - for socializing.    The home-school kids are SO MUCH NICER than school kids!!!!!  At the private school, there were a lot of high-pressure parents (academy award winner, lawyers, doctors, authors) and at public school the kids behaved badly.    So, home schooling worked well.  We live in a liberal, well-educated region of the US.    My daughter went to a very good college, and now has a job that pays more than my job (in the same area as her college major).|`|BdQbVLk0aa	I disagree because home schooling doesn't prepare the kids for dealing with other people... they just deal with their parents (& their siblings if they have). I mean, yeah sure, they're not going to be total shut-ins but you don't have to interact with the general public (at that young of an age) as much as in school... so going to school prepares you for later on in life...|`|37yBB96Iaa	yes id agree as i know few of my friends were home schooled and they turned out grand....|`|PIUzpnVkaa	i agree. it's the parents' choice. i've never seen problems with kids who are home schooled, and i know many, including my cousins.  i don't understand the whole "no friends" thing. my cousins have more than double the friends i have, and i've been in public school my whole life.|`|z61QnYRoaa	No, because it is important for the social development of a child to be around other children.|`|yfi5iB7Zaa	i agree but kids dont develop social and people skills  :P|`|UChXrqJhaa	no, not at all.  All the home schooled kids i've ever met are kinda weird, and kinda wimpy.  They also are never that happy.|`|39cDZ7Nvaa	no i feel you can develop the way of living and working withe other people besides family better because then you will know what diffrent types of people there are|`|tG5Ar7DIaa	I think that if it's done right, that it's good.  That being said, I might go to public school the last two years of high school.    As long as kids get out, and meet new people, then it's good.  If they're too sheltered, though, they will find it difficult to adjust.|`|AA11369490	i think parents should let the kids decide. thats what my parents did. i went to public school from K-10. im a junior this year and decided i want to be home schooled. you know i stay up really late and cant wake up at 6am, so i decided to be home schooled b/c its more flexible. i think if their cyber schooled its even better b/c you can actually talk to people online. im cyber schooled and we have dances and clubs and ive made 7 more friends through homeschooling.    i think its wrong when parents decide to do it to keep their children sheltered.|`|JyrKZhqlaa	No, society is about learning to conform(in public at least!), sad but true. And school is where you learn that. You need school to teach you how to deal with a world full of idiots because you will be working with them for the rest of your life|`|s4VzPulYaa	I'm homeschooled, and I lead a normal life, I play sports with our highschool, I attend pep rallies, go to dances, and I'm even in the yearbook. Some people even say that I'm one of the more popular girls at our high school.... but I do agree with some people, homeschool kids can be a little weird, but just the ones that don't want to be involved in anything, they act like they don't want to be around anybody.  So I guess it depends on the kid, because I like being homeschooled, I get better grades :)|`|KDst9z5Naa	It can work if you are dedicated in spending time each day for children to learn. Also , you need to make sure that kids have a safe after school social group for their socialization. On the average , home school kids score higher on Sat's than public schools.|`|Ep9KbDhsaa	It is up to what the parents want. I am disgusted that some people say that home school kids are weird and not developed which is not true. I was home schooled as a child and also went to public and private school. I do think that a child should not be home schooled for all their education. They need to experience a regular school for at least a year. But home schooling was a great experience and so much more educational for the children. I was only home schooled because my sister was undergoing cancer and we could not have any germs from the outside come in our house. I do think that children would benefit from being home schooled for at least a little while. It does not hurt them socially or emotionally because there are programs for home schooled kids to interact with each other.|`|AA11945637	not agree, kids need other kids around them|`|FSyaAnuKaa	No, kids need to be socialized. When they get out into the real world, they're social retards.|`|2liwk8yKaa	They probably get more individual attention on the good side, but miss out on learning to cope with their peers on the bad side.|`|6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	Only if there's a good reason to... that is, if the child is too sick to attend school on a regular basis.|`|mNC4r3EIaa	I think it's fine, but not the best way to prepare your kids for the world, especially if they're planning on going to college. The social situation would be a lot different.|`|14gi4aTvaa	Well I like the idea of it under certain circumstances. Most parents these days homeschool their kids because of the bullying and distractions from education these days.|`|eQaApazjaa	well it depends...i think if parents choose to homeschool their kids just to do it i dont agree with it...because 1. it doesnt help the child at all. they wont have any friends and this will just make college 1000x harder for them! and 2. how can they just be like in their house 24/7? thats so bad    i mean if ur a celeberity then obviously haha and if the kids have problems then its fine|`|WodlreGLaa	I am home schooled. I am 14, I think it is way easier and helps a lot when u move a lot from city to city like i do.  I went to real school from K-9  though, So i know what the real world is like.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	Yes. Children are generally cruel and can ruin others' lives.|`|MTYT7abkaa	Homeschool rocks!!!!!  I have friends people. Homeschool kids are socially retarded|`|BswVoF8Paa	nope, they dont have a good social life|`|Lzyzdo6Kaa	I don't think homeschooling is a good idea, because the kid's social skills will be stunted.|`|CsyIrhqBaa	home school kids are weird|`|Kj8J3clpaa	no! it completely leaves them socially inept for the future|`|miL4wPxpaa	im homeskooled...homie for life.hahaha!    PS:David is hawt  |`|fcba5faee6335c2d386bba63f1fdfd1faa	no cos they dont grow up wiv other kids nd learn wt other kids learn at skl nd i dont mean skl stuff, i mean about friends, bullying etc|`|zFqJpKrraa	i dont agree, because i think they should get out there and make friends; i mean, what kind of social life  are they gonna have if they cant socialize?|`|up363TZyaa	No.  i think kids will learn better in an interactive environment. [school.] their oppurtunities are wider.|`|MxhZgjXWaa	Most end up in jail.

KWV6ZtBsaa	loose some weight and see.  hahaha   hooch?|`|PzmLYUe6aa	i dont think so....?|`|wdvPCU7Taa	I think your voice might be a bit deeper when your heavier|`|yudfOAQQaa	No. I don't think so.|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	not sure.. but i do notice that fat or big people got higher pitch voice and thin people having low voices.|`|QJu73ISQaa	No|`|wnkj0b41aa	Sometimes I guess.|`|F5i78q4Vaa	if you are born "big" then you may have bigger lungs which will give you a more powerful voice, but not necessarily being "fat"|`|K8a3a6PNaa	not unless they turn diabetic or have sort of respiratory problems due to their weight.. other than that then no..|`|gX7KThhoaa	yess!  loose it|`|tMxr2ABraa	it may.. but i wouldn't know. but i never really came across a deep voice fat person. No offense just being honest.|`|z7aYNtojaa	maybe... >_>|`|mnFG19Ukaa	ya actually it does|`|f3039f1a0ced40b7533dda497176af09aa	well yeah|`|ILdgVBLGaa	i doubt it|`|AA11369490	idk|`|G7RCYINQaa	i don't know, let me lose some weight and find out.|`|RQkp7XrJaa	Yes definitely, being taller makes your voice sound different also.|`|7UEkikfiaa	No my sister used to be REALLY fat but then she lost like 50 pounds and she still sounds the same.|`|gFZlhOdUaa	yea but not much|`|GcoLseVqaa	no.  there's this pakistani singer, adnan sami, and he was really, really obese.  everyone thought that his weight had to do with his throaty voice.  when he decided to have a lypo-suction surgery done, everyone was worried that his voice would go along with the fat.  in the end, his voice is the same, and he looks tons better.|`|AA10313901	I haven't noticed any vocal differences based simply on weight, and I've lived in many parts of the country, including Hawaii.|`|7nG3Oykqaa	no,i would know because my math teacher i call her the big fat whale has a normal voice being fat just gives you less of a life. . .|`|1oGRuniyaa	maybe if your throat was fat too|`|3F8bCZ55aa	yes|`|C2sZREuAaa	only if your a fat smoker|`|14gi4aTvaa	It might... some fat people sound kind of nasally, no offense at all, but it's just something I noticed|`|lwDz2bE8aa	if your severely obese   your voicebox has much more pressure on it  so yeah|`|wAm2fsztaa	if the fat rolls squeeze your throat|`|8ZUVToXgaa	It shouldn't....|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	no...?|`|5jqfKDdfaa	I wouldnt think so....|`|hZ9omSataa	it makes you sound hungry|`|I1K6SC43aa	I think Rosie O'Donnell used to sound like Chris Rock.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Nope.|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	Yes, you sound fatter,|`|WcuYfsWbaa	i think it makes it deeper. no offence 2 fat ppl, but they tend 2 have slightly deeper voices.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	ha good question this made me laugh but i think it would make you sound deep or nasaly like u cant breathe or very tired|`|AA12383908	Awww. That is mean.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't think so|`|v4YswWpJaa	no, its the aging, but a girl in my math class in grade 9 literally sounds like a 5 year old....

AA12350537	I believe that we have an ideal path laid out for us but its up to us if we choose to follow it or not, or if we even look for it at all. We may have glimpses of this ideal path every now and again (our hopes and dreams) but fear and wrong thinking most often send us off it, sometimes very far off. It doesn't mean that this other path we chose with our own free  will be full of pain and suffering, just not as ideal as the one laid out for us by God. I believe that there are very few people who manage to find this perfect path, but it is usually the ones who give their lives to God and have mastered the following of their intuition and how to train their minds to acknowledge only the good in their lives and block out all negative thoughts. Of course it's easier said than done until life experience and miracles have taught you enough to be ready to let go of all  fears and doubts and have perfect faith in the spiritual laws that exist|`|4zuTkXW2aa	If someone mapped this out -- we need to have a little chat.|`|wmBK9uASaa	No we make it up as we stroll along our chosen path|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	I make my own map as I go along.|`|9bYEMrb9aa	No. The choises we make creates the map.

We're American, and the legal age here is 21.    It is said that kids who start drinking at a young age often have problems with alcohol later in life.  My brother and I both like to drink, but we're not alcoholics.  However, I did get a DUI 6 years ago, and my brother was arrested for public drunkedness and criminal mischief a few months after my DUI.|`|C6NPYQ3Daa	yeah i'll hold my hand up to that one.|`|jdUmGUV4aa	i have hehe|`|PIUzpnVkaa	i'm pretty sure everyone has...|`|Qo6UWVaeaa	i did...well stil do lol..        ooooh are you a pirate?|`|nFakIvgoaa	I'm guilty.

I don't drink normally, but the ocasional green apple wine cooler and grey goose never hurt ^_^|`|7PbJWEo1aa	I was 4 years old because I stole my daddy's beer and didn't like it and it put me off until I was 16. Only two years under the law!|`|n5G5IIbOaa	Me.  I think everyone has though.|`|BLEYaodFaa	I did!|`|N8GLJpdlaa	i started at like 14 but in my family its custom we drink wine with our fancy dinner's|`|Org2hdfUaa	Me but I've not got drunk.... YET!     I'm 16 and Irish.|`|TjFAewqMaa	of course! doesn't everyone?|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	Meee :D  considerd strange if ye don't in Scotland :L!|`|bl8co4hUaa	My family allowed wine with formal dinners as well, and so I would have half a glass. But that is legal in our state (Alaska) if it is in a  private home and the parent is present and allows it. (The exception being that to allow a child to drink to the point of being tipsy or drunk would be considered child endangerment and therefore a crime.)    As far as drinking without parental consent, the first time I did, honestly, I was 19. (Drinking age is 21.) We mixed Coke and Bacardi and went 4-x-4'ing in a Jeep. We weren't caught, fortunately for us.|`|vF8DsOfRaa	I drank more before I turned the legal age then I have since.  Seriously, I don't even think I am close.  Peace.
8pw8qDjPaa	not everyone can be perfect, our standards shouldnt be set by the photoshopped covers of magazines. and yes physical attraction is important for a relationship but outside looks aren't everything. there's beauty found in everyone. and honestly, some of those celebrities don't look that bad without makeup. they just look normal. and you can't make a judgment based on one bad picture. they can have ugly pictures of them with makeup on too! everyone has bad pictures of them! but its sad that celebrities don't have control of the ones that are posted all over the internet. that website is there to try and embarrass celebrities, so they pic out the worst picture they can find! everyone is beautiful naturally and no one should be forced to wear makeup!|`|FlSCb3dxaa	hell no.  I love my makeup and i don't care what about thinks about how long it takes me to go out.  I always wear makeup when i go out and i take a shower every morning and alot of times at night.      Those celebs even has makeup probably worth over $1,000.  Their foundation is like $250 and mine is only $16.  I wished i had their makeup.  It would be nice.  My mom is 48 and wears makeup every single day and always has.  lol.  I only learned from the best.|`|AA11518036	Some do.|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	Some do, but honestly, some need the makeup.|`|SWK8Xjr6aa	some do some dont|`|daij1eBCaa	Wow, that's a huge difference. But we're used to seeing them all glammed up, if they were just normal people we probably wouldn't think they looked too bad without makeup. Honestly, I feel like I look like crap without makeup but my boyfriend says I don't need it. If a guy is really in love with a girl I think that he should prefer her natural. ?

Hence, they tend to cut off ties once and for all and move on.|`|vfedIVuOaa	We ignore them and get on with our lives, simple as that.    edit: Why do you ask? Is something wrong between you and a Scorpio?|`|izX7ymibaa	I tell them. But I'm on the blunt Sagittarius end of Scorpio.|`|ntj9WfzYaa	To be honest, it's really hard to tell with Scorpios.  All I can say is that stop playing the guessing game, cuz you're probably wrong, and it will drive you insane.  If your Scorpio is acting like he doesn't care, then let it go... because more often than not, he will come running back when he feels like he's about to lose you.  They're little kids that need attention... and if you don't give it to them... they'll come to you to find it.  No worries.|`|33AW5DLdaa	Don't pay much (if any) attention to them when around them.  If they call/text ignore them.  Just forget about them and move on.
ox559iSEaa	Just hope that maybe you and her are not TOTALLY alike, and that you didn't get into the same predicament,|`|eKuvx6f8aa	extremely weird-to the point of being worried about it.|`|6HMgT5LCaa	Wrong catergory.|`|8IvkrcVXaa	good for you|`|Q8ZlzjSqaa	lmfao, you should be worried :P
ja7J2cE2aa	My phone rang when I was out in public.    It's new, so I haven't had a chance to change the ring yet.  Some other lady walking by suddenly freaked out and started emptying her purse to get her phone out, but when she saw me answer mine, she walked over to me and said, no kidding, "Excuse me, that's exactly the same ringtone as mine.  Please change yours."      I couldn't believe it at first, but now that I think about it, it was pretty goofy.|`|mMi19s7Vaa	I was coming out of the store and the door said pull  and i was pushing on it like a retard lol =]    what about you?|`|EzrdyxAiaa	i have over 50 cows get out the funny part was we had about 9 inches of snow so they could not move to fast and was very easy to herd back with the four wheeler!!!|`|0Cpqulbraa	i peed out my apartment window onto some people waiting for the bus by accident.|`|k3QFMb4Laa	My cousin Fell And Hurt her knee.

The thing that sucks the most was that the ball was ment for the other guy.    >:O|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	i went to wipe down the kitchen table and instead of spraying the table i sprayed my face ....... baaah humbug ....... funny enough??  actually that was yesterday ...... still funny though i reckon.    peace baby  ?|`|7cM2oRoEaa	I died|`|cegx6kN2aa	I accidentally ate some old guys sandwich... :)|`|CtzhdZm2aa	I saw my female dog hump my female cat thats in heat....|`|NQuPNHPyaa	I fell on the sidewalk..

Though I have imagined it would be nice to float on my back in the middle of an ocean or huge lake, and just let the feel of the water and my body floating put me to sleep.

Yes, he overreacted (especially the "i'll kick your a**") stuff, but I think what was caught on tape was a bit out of context.  It seems like this was an ongoing problem with the DP and if this man is a professional then he should have learned and I think Christian had every right to tear him a new one.|`|e28P8gWraa	Hes a good actor and less of a douche than johnny depp.|`|moFyK8s3aa	Is it weird that I have that tantrum saved on my computer?

Since I do not know him personally, I cannot make a blanket judgment call on how he behaves from a clip of audio tape.     I have no idea what the context was.......do you?      I want the guy to act and entertain me, not be my best friend. So I like his talent a lot and can not be bothered to spend time pondering him in any context other than that. I have an actual life of my own.    He is literally a stranger to me (just because one thinks they "know" someone in the public eye does NOT mean one does). He has broken no laws as far as I can tell so I will not waste any more time deciding if I like this person who has no bearing on my life other than being in a film or two that I happen to enjoy.

My bro and I, we were tanking shower and just playing together...  he was about 5 years old...  We were playing "Who can catch me"...  While we were playing we were (naked)..."u know, taking a shower"... so accidentally we ran outside of our house...  and all of my neighbors were there on the weekends outside...  and everyone saw me naked...Damn!

It was 5 back then... now, it's barely even a one :D    Another in 2nd grade. I was wearing a see-through costume for Halloween. So apparrently, everyone could see my boobs. That was a 5.     Another VERY embarrassing moment was last year. The classroom moms were taking pics for the yearbook. And so they decided to take a picture of my and my friend eating cake in a party. And so I tryed to stuff cake in my mouth and smile. I looked completely stupid. And now, my crush has the ability to always go back and look at it. It's been a 5 ever since.     Another embarrassing moment happened last week. I got screamed at by the teacher because of a TINY thing. And yet, she screamed at me in front of the whole class. It was probably a 5 :(    Another happened today. I started dancing in front of my crush's friend. It's actually kinda funny, though. It's probably a 3.     That's all I could think of... what's your's??? haha.    btw, I like reading all the other people's answers :D|`|cMLZGtpcaa	There was once I gave my female colleague a lift. Right after she got off the front seat, I realised that there are some brown stain on the seat. Not knowing what it is, I quickly took out some tissues to clean the seat and at the same time warned her that she has been sitting on some stain. She took a look at her skirt and apologised profoundly to me. At the same time, took out her wet tissue to clean the seat.     After that incident, both of us were too embarrassed and we never mention it anymore.|`|8wWPmytSaa	well i was wearing my new cute jean skirt and my sister drove me to school.....well when i was getting out of the car id idnt realize my skirt was up to my waist!!! so i walked but my crush and he saw my underwear. i didnt realize it was up till i walked by the window...to this day he still makes fun of me!!        at least my underwear were cute!!!        pro a 4|`|ypAAqUftaa	My most embarrassing moment was probably when I tripped over pudding left on the floor in the lunchroom at school in front of everyone.    Talk about a bad day:)|`|rHwMf2P4aa	after having intercourse with my boyfriend late one night he threw the condom off and it hit the wall.

They noticed tide was coming in and that my top was undone so as not to leave tan lines. Everyone kind of circled around me, which drew an even bigger crowd. The first wave that washed over me made me cough so bad that I stood up. I see about 75 people staring at me. laughing and clapping and my top still down on the blanket! For years people brought that up. It was a 5!|`|KDCXd3B0aa	When I went into the guys toilets and had to hide in there for ages in a cubicle till all the guys went out.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	omg i was in gym in front of everyone blood ran down my leg i dint know i had my period! omg and one of my friends goes amy omg u hav blood running down ur leg and everystared at me..im was mortified. everyone made fun of me the next day...also in 8th grade science i farted in front of everyone, and the next dat they called me the science tutor..get it cuz i tutted lol i was sooo embarrassed!|`|TuvNlZFQaa	IDK.

I was wearing sweatpants and my sister tripped and fell. As she fell she grabbed my pants by accident and they fell down. Then I tripped over my pants and fell down as well. Not the most embarrassing thing that could ever happen so I'd rate it a 2.5.|`|yT3ZNEROaa	I thought this only happened in soap operas but I called out my ex boyfriends name during sex with who is now my husband.   He never lets me forget either.  He reminds me at least once a year. I was so embarrassed I cried.  YIKES!|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|oRmXuXpiaa	lol!!! a few!! what abt farting so loud in the cinema that 4 rows turned back!! lol i blamed it on my friend!! rate it as a 4 (if 5 is the highest)|`|GcoLseVqaa	when i tripped at my sister's graduation party in front of one of the "aunties", if you see what i mean.  i had gotten called down to meet her husband and her son, and i tripped on one of my mom's stupid decorations, this time a wooden trunk that serves no purpose.  both her husband and her son laughed at me.  anyway, definitely a five!!!

Besides, Michael is white!!|`|8EbINm3gaa	Well it depends on how you look at it.

hzDCBXEyaa	H>JK    Interesting question.  I find that I give thumbs down to those who give a one-word answer (unless the question dictates one) or is a bandwaggon question looking to rally the troops against some unseen or perceived threat like "why do poeple hate____".  Otherwise, I see this as a forum to ask and be heard.  The number of opinions/votes doesn't really come into play for me.  There have been several times that I have been given a number of thumbs down for my outlook, but the person posting the question liked my answer.  Other than that, the only other time I give a negative response to an answer is if it is crossing a line that I have for myself.  Can't define it, just know it when I see it.|`|21J0IIZbaa	I only give thumbs down when the answer have nothing to do with the question.

aJfBtT9iaa	It wasnt that bad. Raw Footage, untitled, theater of the mind    Joe Budden is one of my favs artist out now but i will still not buy his cd lol. i would buy a slaughterhouse cd though.|`|xUhAqctjaa	No, 2008 was a very good year.  It was probably the best year of the 2000's besides the actual year 2000 itself.    Edit: Mainstream wise it was a bad year, but every year since 2000 has been a bad mainstream year.    Edit: Bks, you must be trippin.  All those albums you mentioned have terrible production (crappy @ss beats) which is the most important thing for a good album.    2008 had 2 really well produced albums (Tobacco Road by Common Market and Black Snow by Snowgoons) 2007 had none and neither did 2006.|`|xUxUwloPaa	No, 2008 had some great albums under it's belt.     No, i am not spending 15.99 on a Joe Buddens album.|`|fflLAKvjaa	NO!The best songs came out in 08 if it was a bad year none of them great songs wouldnt be out so i dont know what u's talkin bout 08 was a bad year for hip hop it's never a bad year|`|kx9zeEiFaa	gucci went to jail.... yea it was bad year|`|cs692mzXaa	08 was a great year.    No|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Nah.    Nah.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Yes I do. It was a huge letdown compared to 2007, and to a lesser extent 2006.    2007 had  Below the Heavens  The Undisputed Truth  The Cool  Dirty Acres  Finding Forever  Eardrum  Desire  Graduation  Get Back  American Gangster  Atmosphere Airlines  I'll Sleep When You're Dead  Bayani  Carnival Vol II    That's 14 QUALITY albums. 2008 had like 6 or 7, only one of which (The Renaissance) would've cracked my top 5 last year.|`|BnTYoxUIaa	Yes hip hop was the bad year of hip hop because of Lil Wayne and soulja boy.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	i think hip-hop is in limbo , waiting for some one new to come change the game a bit. hip-hop is in a cocoon waiting to evolve into a beautiful butterfly...i hope|`|OpBFc27iaa	Yeah, horrible year.    2009 will be a decent year for hiphop.

fShlKEfYaa	first make an outline for the thoughts that you want to put in the song. Next Sit for 10 minutes and just write automatically continuously whatever comes in your mind, which might put you in touch with what needs to be in the song. Then take a break, and come back to the outline and auto-writing at a later time to review and re-work it.|`|Su0O55W8aa	stop writing, go and do something else for a while...it will come to you! you're just putting too much thought into it!|`|VfYTGwKraa	i have the same problem right now as well, i read the lyrics to various songs and it makes me think about my situation and i also brain storm it may sound childish but i write what i want to write but, not in a lyrical format.

The people, no. Some of the teachers and people in my grade are really nice. The grades above me are completely ***holes though, especially when your going through the hall to get to another class.|`|cxVmq2kraa	No.    I'm not in love with the people but at the same point in time I know its a part of life.    Just get it done.|`|HWkXDSqkaa	I love it there. Yeah the people can be immature and stupid but w.e  I'm enjoying my High School years.|`|XQOWZbpnaa	some days i do, some days i dont.  some people there are complete bitchholes, including the teachers. and it definitely gets repetitive, like im trapped in there for 7 hours just to do it all again. kinda like im being held against my will, but thats on pretty bad days.    on a good day, i figure theres worse things i could be doing, so i get myself through it. (:|`|f2fdChkeaa	isn't it odd..65% of people in high school absolutely hate it, emphasizing their hatred of the people and their fakeness. then the rest....just don't seem to see it at all.. what's wrong with that? do those people simply not see? how is that possible? how is it possible that there can be two so completely contrasting views of high school? which one is right? are we right that high school is completely f*uccked up or are the people who don't think there's anything wrong with it, right? sometimes you just don't know....

If a girl has huge boobs and wears something that really "shows them", the guys will prob. look at her chest no matter what.  I think its all a matter of how much the girl wants guys to stare at her chest.  Too much clevage means that she wants guys to pay attention at the chest and vice versa.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	A little of both.    I mostly stare at her chest while she looks away.|`|kNnqjlWiaa	when she talks ill make eye contact but if she looks away you know where ill be lookin|`|3YJbVYaHaa	I look into her eyes, but if they are just showing some major cleavage I will probably sneak a couple of peeks!!!|`|SZ0rG2QCaa	i always make eye contact when talking to her, and when we stop talking I check out her boobs and ***     lmao|`|lomuJezCaa	i do both  depends ultimately on the person as with all guys  if he sees shes really hot he'll look at her face first  but if she doesnt look that good but her bodys rockin stares at boobs|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	both but when im talking mostly the face|`|D9WvoaoEaa	omg...i'm not a dude, but the comments that dudes make on this are pretty...well, :/ anyways, go face guys! :)|`|Yn504ivpaa	well i look at the face but every once in awhile i take a look i am sorry peoples|`|UokARxNwaa	both hottie

I guess it just fits better!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Saves on the ink.|`|S3pgtJGpaa	They could have made the signs bigger, but they probably didn't want to spend that much money, so they abbreviated "through" to "thru".|`|R2Rg9ZtTaa	Theyy are shortening  it so it dont take up room|`|4WjB4tHjaa	thru is not the same thing as through    they're different|`|4BoteYDwaa	Another subliminal add, reminding us that we need more teachers.|`|AN98KWr3aa	The purpose for putting 'thru' is so that they don't have to use as many letters and saying 'through'.

I think this is a covert, top secret plot to dumb down america. Thru is the precursor to "lol" and "omg."

I think you'd be lying either way, if you think about it.  But then if you really think about it, you'd be telling the truth.  :S    Wow someone said its a paradox so I looked up that word :P The definition is like confusing me...

Thought I'd share my head ache with ya.  :D|`|doWkvrDNaa	purging the truth|`|eLFrlCmuaa	It depends on the situation.|`|nuLroEjraa	It's a paradox.    The statement "I'm lying" is true because it's true that you're indeed not telling the truth.     Yet you're lying because the statement "I'm lying" really is true.|`|AA12383908	The truth.|`|laLW1Krwaa	ur plying|`|88nljACwaa	You lie and you must die  Mwahahahahahaha~?|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	you would be telling the truth about lying|`|Zrk9Ttruaa	I would check your pulse because when you lie your heartbeat increases.|`|hlNf2tmWaa	If you really were lying, then it would be the truth.

fcPiQDwEaa	I'm like whatever, just like how having hot sex with Phyllis didn't keep Nick faithful, who's to say he's going to keep his pants up and be faithful ever after with Sharon?!|`|GomZ9oYHaa	They will end up in bed snuggling under the covers..|`|dPULl5hjaa	Only time will tell - I'll be watching!|`|AA11369432	They are meant to be.... I hope they get back together for good.|`|tEqcmCv3aa	Were you even watching the show when Nick and Sharon were together? They were always lying, fighting and cheating on one another.  Sharon even put the moves on Victor!|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i hate it. i don't like sharon or phyllis with nick. plus nick and sharon always cheat on each other and by nick sleeping with sharon once again this week, he only proves that he never changed and that he don't care about his marriage or phyllis. phyllis and nick don't look right together, but i am getting tired of everyone sleeping with each other and their marriages never lasting. sharon is a b****|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Phyllis + Nick is 100X the entertainment value than Sharon + Nick.  Phyllis has character.  She gets bent out of shape.  She throws things.  She loves sex.  Yes, she's a psychopath, and she's SO MUCH FUN to watch!    Sharon, on the other hand, is just wishy washy.  Why would she give in to Jack and get married at the drop of a hat?  She didn't have anything better to do.    TX Mom|`|PRDZmeiEaa	I think it BLOWS... And if Summer is Jacks that means Nick lied which just don't sound like him to me so I don't think that story line will happen.|`|ErnyFjVdaa	Doesn't look too good for Phyllis.Then Sharon left that note there,and Nick will proberly read it.I'm with you about Summer maybe being Jack's.Wouldn't that be something?Have a good evening.|`|uDXpoFlbaa	Well said. I agree with you! I like Nick and Sharon together as well. Ummm...does anyone else notice that Nick an Phyllis have been arguing lately? So how was him and Sharon fighting in their relationship any different? Every couple has their ups and down like Nick and Sharon did in their relationship. And their sex life seems like the only thing that keeps these two together.|`|msUIsv8maa	Im all for it.|`|FwU6GL4Laa	I think they deserve each other...I hope Phyllis finds someone who will love her and not throw there ex up in her face everyday its only a matter of time that some other guy will catch Sharon's eye and she will cheat on Nick again.|`|AA11608168	Love it!!  I'm so happy that they will both realize they were meant to be.  With Cassie's death, they handled the healing all wrong.  If they would have communicated a little more and talked to one another, they would still be together!  I still think it will be a little while before we see a complete reunion, but it's def. on it's way!!!  They are high school sweethearts.  They have a past and def. more than just a sexual vibe..they are so adorable together!!!|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	I agree with you 100% Nick & Sharon belong together, not everyone's relationship is perfect, specially in the soap opera world!!! Plus, all those ups and downs make for a stronger relationship! They obviously still love each other! I am loving it too! yay!!!    Nick was out of his mind when he hooked up with Phyllis. It would be great if Summer wasn't Nicks, that way the have nothing connecting them...|`|AA10623143	We're on two different sides of the world as I couldn't disagree with you more.  Nick was always fighting when he was with Sharon, fighting with his mother who at the time really disliked Sharon, fighting to keep his marriage when Sharon cheated, fighting to keep his marriage when he cheated, fighting to remain to stay with Sharon etc.  I have no idea where the writers are getting "the fairytale romance" from.  They had some magical days, but for the most part they had a soap marriage....always fighting.      Nick seemed happier when he was cheating with and married to Phyllis.  Of course that's not the case now, I hate that the writers are resurrecting the Sharon and Nick story.|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I have to say that I also like Nick and Sharon together..  :o)  In a way they have the same connection as Victor and Nikki.  They are meant to be together.    I think that Jack and Phyllis should get back together.  You are right if Summer turns out to be Jack's daughter then Nick lied.|`|939a573d51518cee62321893077ea36baa	I hate it thier boreing. Nick and Phyllis (who people hate even though she has changed some) are way more intersting its like they have lots of fun|`|F93FZyo1aa	i do love it, but then again i got so tired of listening to whiney sharon always on nick about something! he could never do anything right in her eyes. she wanted to blame him for everything.     and nick did lie about the paternity results thats why he never showed it to phillis...so it will come out eventually that summer is jacks and they will probably get back together too.    Nick is HOTT so as long as he's on the screen im happy :)|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	NOOOOO!!!!! Sharon is a whiney brat! As for growiing pains, I've been w/my husband since I was 15 (I'm 38 now) & We've never had "Them kind" of growing pains. ok, sometimes we do forget it's a show & not real but I can't stand Sharon & LOVE to watch nick!  lol!  :)

Yt6TaiYlaa	Well, I thought the same thing when I saw Inkheart. The British people reminded me of Harry/Hermione, like if they were combined it would be that one, Meggie. And it got me thinking. Mo, or Brendan Frasier, isn't even British, and their mom wasn't either, so why was their kid British? Anyway, I think in the first Harry Potter movie is when they say it, since their all pre-pubetic. Even Hagrid.  So I think it's somewhere in a crowded room.  Like Muhammad Alli (Diagon Alley) or the Great Hall.   Hope this helped.|`|wZYkTY0haa	That part stuck in my mind too.  It's in the first movie, on the train, when Ron and Hermoine first met. Ron has dirt on his nose and Hermoine points it out.|`|rQXW9eeqaa	its in the 1st movie when harry and ron are on the train and hermione comes in, they introduce each other then hermione says that they'll be arriving soon, and that they should get their robes on but b4 she goes she says to ron "o and you've got dirt on your nose by the way, just there"

Lil Wayne)    (Kevin Rudolf)  I see your dirty face hide behind your collar.   What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow.  So you pray to God to justify the way  you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie.    And you take your time.  And you do your crime.  Well you made your bed.  I'm in mine.    Because when I arrive,   I-I bring the fire.  Make you come alive,  I can take you higher.  What this is?  Forgot?  I must now remind you.  Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.    Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father.  When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar.  But it broke his heart so he stuck his middle finger  to the world, to the world, to the world.    And you take your time.  And you stand in line  where you'll get what's yours,  I got mine.    Because when I arrive,  I-I bring the fire.  Make you come alive,  I can take you higher.  What this is?  Forgot?  I must now remind you.  Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.    (Lil' Wayne)  Yeah!  Wayne's World.  Planet Rock.  Panties drop,  and the tops.  And she gon' rock 'til the camera stop.  I sing about angels like Angela.   (Rock)  And Pamela.   (Rock)  And Samantha.  (Rock)  And Amanda.  And Tamara.  Mnage  moi, oh.  In here like, "*****, what's up?"  Me-chanic me, I can fix ya up.  I can dick ya up,  I can dick ya down.  Shorty we can go where ever,  just pick a town.  And my jewelry is louder than the engine sound.  Big *** rocks like on the ground,  Dirty like sex that's on the ground.  Weezy.    (Kevin Rudolf)  Because when I arrive,  I-I bring the fire.  Make you come alive,  I can take you higher.  What this is?  Forgot?  I must now remind you.  Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.    Because when I arrive,  I-I bring the fire.  Make you come alive,  I can take you higher.  What this is?  Forgot?  I must now remind you.  Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

Roll and rock rubbin' rap, runnin'  miles like just tryin' to get a flat stomach.  Like Wayne a personal trainer.  My aim is perfect, I bang ya,  period, like the remainder.

asaeVSehaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Her... has decent episode summaries, but be careful not to read too far if you want to avoid spoilers for season 4 (the first few eps of the new season are listed too).    Short form: Papa Petrelli wasn't dead after all, he goes after a formula that can be used to create superpowers at will without nasty side effects, and a lot of people die or lose their powers in the process (just about every new character from season 2 is removed from play).  At the end, Nathan Petrelli has become the new badguy, deciding that his dad's basic idea was a good one, but adding an interment camp twist as seen last night.
AM33tqYAaa	people say the ring? no, a girl pops out of a tv, wow, shoot that bit*h  the grudge? no again, wow a ghost that haunts people, ooh scary    the exorcist is pretty scary, the Halloween series is always good, i liked the Texas Chainsaw massacre, the 1974 version, not the new ones.    IT was scary, now i hate clowns.    if you want some Comedy/horror movies, try the Leprechaun series.|`|AA11008280	Idk. Not much movies scare the hell out of me .. but If I must choose ..    Dolls a 1987 horror flick.. pretty scary if you are into killing dolls    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolls_(1987...    I really enjoy "Chucky" movies, they are funny too.    The Exorcist - 1973   ...  Was great!

4QBvQ9gDaa	A lot of actors have dropped out. Some of them have enough money to last a lifetime and there's some that they are barley making it.

They take classes online or have a tutor on tour with them so they can finish school. So basically they become home schooled.|`|AA11008280	They dont drop out. They are just home-schooled. Internet based.    Just like me .. its really the same as going to a public or private school. I think its even better.|`|0oBLUIGfaa	A lot of them drop out before they graduate, or take university and drop. Some of them will just skip school. Take Ali Lohan, for example.

JzYlcuXzaa	OHH MYYY GOOOD    yes, going forward I think Yahoo should ban any question with the word "Twilight" "Bella" "Edward" or "Cullens" in it|`|BJugETlOaa	I am extremely sick of it, they seriously need to get a life. It is a Movie!|`|zFqJpKrraa	i completely agree. if you dont understand, go educate yourself and read th book or something lol|`|MDWaPmXsaa	I'm tired of hearing of the movie itself, and vampires themselves, period.|`|S4W7FojCaa	How come no one is sick of hearing and seeing Harry Potter?    Why is it just Twilight?   Have you seen the movie?  Read the books?     Then you're missing out, really you are. I used to hate Twilight and thought it was stupid (I had never read the books.). But I saw the movie, and it was good and now I'm reading the books.    If you don't want to see anything about Twilight then avert your eyes in another direction. It's not that hard. It's not like seeing Twilight will make your eyes fall out.    Edit: What about when it came out or whenever a new one comes out (Harry Potter)?     People are just excited about Twilight because it's new. It'll probably die down later on.    Edit: Ok, complain all you want. But how's that going to stop people from asking about Twilight?|`|nci2WOYXaa	Yeah, I agree. I'm tired of people asking the same question over and over again.     When is the dvd coming out?  When will the new movie come out?   Where do you think they are filming the movie now?     Over and over again they ask the same question. Just type in the question and you'll find a hundred other questions just like yours.|`|Hrgp1oC5aa	YES...and thanks for adding to it!!|`|f5NFa55Laa	The only thing that annoys me about it is when one person will post a question and then a  minute later a different person will post the same question.  EX: "When does the movie Twilight come out on DVD".  EX: " Did you hear that Vanessa Hudgens tried out for the part of Leah Clearwater for the New Moon movie"?  EX: Who loves Robert Pattison.  EX: Team Edward or team Jacob?  Oh yeah, one other thing that makes me mad is when people believe EVERYTHING that is posted instead of doing their homework and finding out the truth. People should go to the twilight lexicon and get the real news. They do the research to find out what is true or not.|`|GvlxK336aa	I haven't read the book or seen the movie and i'm already sick of it, i was on hot topic.com and i was looking at their valentine clothes, and like 3 pages had everything twilight.... i just wish everyone would get over it already.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Yes that piece of garbage has been out for how long? Questions about this part, and this part, and do you think this. Ugh, if you have that much of a hard on for it, go waste your money seeing it again. Leave those of us that are sane enough to recognize that movie for what it is. A failed attempt at the concept of love from the wrong side of the tracks.

iMvz42Zuaa	I don't get scared in movies easily. in fact, i've seen at least 50, and I've never been as scared in any other movie as I was in this one. you see disembodied corpses and a man bending in half as his spine breaks. several ghost children are seen, and in one, the girl drops a glass of milk, and it turns into blood as it splatters on the ground. There are several dead 'zombies' that pop out and grab people. knives and drugs are mentioned in order to kill the people. i'd give the scary factor of the movie a 7 out of 10|`|ngDZP9kIaa	well from the trailer i think its gonna be a 7 or 8|`|XCVFEAC8aa	for me it's  3 - for scary  and  7 - for creepy    it's more creepy, then scary! i jumped once and it was fun! lol    over-all, i loved it!

That was hilarious.|`|dShUF6A9aa	That was so funny!!! omg lol|`|ozmqdlEbaa	yesh i enjoyed this one.|`|6ChuLcvraa	yea this one was pretty funny :]|`|IkCCVVv0aa	yeah its funny but i think there is funnier than that.  BTW its funny!!!!!|`|AA10771653	nahh i like the doritos one.|`|H8bhRaPRaa	nope .... it wasnt funny for me....  i love the taco bell commercial     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvAJ2Dvyr...|`|b11ad38e48a245ff6ffa0b1a9d52a2e1aa	eh... i think the giant pigeon one from last year was funnier =D|`|hB7no5bPaa	LMAO omg this was the only commercial that made me laugh the entire game!!!!! hahhaa i loved it|`|opy27yN0aa	that was a good one
5RH9Osdsaa	Yes and it is a terrible feeling.  It can be hard to keep my mind focused, because I become so obsessed with how bad things are.  Then I wake up the next day and everything is different.|`|vcnRwkB8aa	I have, yes.|`|T9wGfw1gaa	YES! I have those like almost EVERYDAY!!!!!|`|FG4hKNUyaa	yes yes yes yes yes lol but most dayz r amazin in my life|`|cBrUd1tLaa	yep, today. it was not a good day|`|6XYrDROJaa	every Monday|`|174hHTXDaa	Today... Everyday..
VPNP5Irfaa	I understand what you are saying  but it's not necesarilly true  most rich people give away so much of their money to help out people around the world  the rich people that are stuck up are usually the celebrities who get all of the publicity  but most of the unknown rich people are in fact very good people and want to help out as much as they can|`|kay9DFbdaa	rich people probably use cunning ways to get rich and poor people are too honest|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I think rich people often feel they have "bettered" themselves with an education or perseverance at a business and that makes them better than the ones who have less. And perhaps if they rub elbows with the poor they may become a target of a lawsuit in some way.  There are some rich people who are extremely kind, had a service job for many years and was always pleasantly surprised when I received such kindness. In the same way some poor people with low self-respect or self-esteem try to feel superior in other ways that have nothing to do with their bank account, such as race or cultural superiority.
Y1aAGPURaa	That was so funny.  I'm LOL.    Here's a lawyers joke I think you'd enjoy:    Why won't sharks attack lawyers?   Professional courtesy.  (hahaha)|`|CFJzBMwkaa	wow  funny|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	ive heard this before but still funny|`|FwJLD1uDaa	O_o     ooookay...|`|gieEWY1Qaa	lmao|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	Haha good description for lawyers!!

And the whole friggin thing is hilarious!|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	cool
f4ehvRQlaa	yeah on youtube. her name is "SweetnessChrissy". shes like a mother ******* next britney spears or something. she gets on my god damn nerves! and shes a ******* ***** *** traitor too. they only liked her because shes showing off as being sexy and ****. i used to like her but now she was a ***** to me and she still is so i hate her! most people that like her is lesbians, pedophiles, and bisexual fagots(i only hate the gays/lesbos that likes her, not any gays/lesbos) and *******(only the blacks that like her, not any black because im not racist either). **** CHRISSY AND ANYBODY THAT LIKES HER!!!!!!! shes a narcissist ***** and a ****.  and just about any youtubers are famous without even becoming a celebrity.|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	i don't understand...    if they're not a celebrity but they get attention... doesn't that make the a celebrity?|`|84crzC80aa	Like that guy who punched the burning terrorists at Glasgow airport?    Whatever happened to him?|`|tokcUJSpaa	Ugh, yes. There is this kid in my grade who basically everybody adores. He's not smart (like a D average) Not cute (oddly shaped face) and over all just not that likable. Idk why everybody is so obsessed over him.|`|7xmr5R6qaa	Like Joe the Plumber, the bald guy who was campaigning with John Mccain in America?
ZT9Zap0faa	1. Farting on purpose, in Public. Sadly, it's not sexy anymore.    2. Laughing, even with a bunch of blacks laughing also, at black jokes. You'll get cut.    3. Calling your boss 'gringo' behind his back. I did that almost everyday, until I looked at my father and felt like a jerk.|`|u7o75zipaa	Just about everything, and it pisses me off.  I don't mind a joke about something - even if it 'insults' me. If it's said as a joke, I don't see the harm. I mean, there are plenty of blonde jokes, but you don't see me getting bothered about them!|`|f5oZRD6faa	Sexual sense of humour...they even blank out the words when you want to say something funny on here=(      It should be allowed, freedom of speech and all!Lol|`|I1K6SC43aa	Anything insulting our incompetent government.|`|XDfrSfrvaa	child-predator humor|`|YVNeeIIIaa	Sarcasm....nobody gets it anymore|`|kt4WbuRkaa	stuff about mentally challenged kids.  by the bye, is this to expose what average people secretly think is funny, as sort of a social experiment?|`|b2WGvF18aa	Anything remotely funny!!!!!!|`|LZqUE9w7aa	race & religious    its not "PC"|`|H9gmJYdmaa	Anything truly funny because someone always finds it offensive.  Ugh.|`|nuLroEjraa	pretty much anything.  no one has a sense of humor anymore.|`|wP7H2hkHaa	The one where I put ******* in my cousin's mouth and ejaculate when he's sleeping.|`|Jfu75ZiGaa	If you want to make a lot of enemies really quickly, I can pretty much guarantee that racist jokes (possibly containing slurs) will work. Especially if you tell them around the people who are of the same race involved in your jokes.    I'm not sure if it's entirely illegal or not, but it's a very good way to get others to hate you.|`|KbhADKrraa	Comedy!!!!! Been replaced by reality humour like Gordon Brown thinking he's on top of the recession......hilarious!!!!! (It would be if we could all afford to f*cking LIVE)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AA10382814	yeah|`|AA12390047	No, they don't keep heavy people from applying to be on the show.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	For sure they do. There is no way people would watch if a 200 lb woman was there competing with thin , fit women.  It would be sad and the woman would feel out of place.   No they would never have a big woman there.  She would be eliminated the first night unless it was a bachelor who was one of the rare ones who likes big women.  Then that would be a very funny show.  They should do it.  Make for  a nice change.  It is very different for a guy to be big,  like Bob and he is accepted but a woman well, we all know that isn't the way TV is.|`|Ukgl64pSaa	WHY?|`|b86b601e857ab3f32e2405d77431eaccaa	No, Bob the bachelor was kinda fat.|`|ClRuPRs7aa	No, I don't think so. I've seen all kinds of body types on that show. It all depends on who wants to go on that show, and it has nothing to do with body types or weight.|`|816d37cef0be9068ccda207a4dc9967daa	Heck Yeah... I don't see no fat girls on that show.. Im pretty sure when the fat girls get off the limo he would be running away!!|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	nope, bob was the bachelor and he was not exactly skinny.  I think they choose who goes on the show based on the bachelors wants, surely if he was into larger women he would have 25 of them to choose from.
h7teU1AMaa	Well i bought you all something and i'm sure i posted it, but then again i may have been drunk and stuck it in a bin instead of a post box :)|`|6e5255ded4ce6695a2dc37936a4b039caa	Jeez when he sees the weather here he might just Fook Off back there ; ) lol  So............how's he taking the news about Colin and Salma then ?|`|jCFWPWpUaa	No, nothing :-(|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Nope|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	No. Hope he enjoyed himself though and didn't get up to too much mischieif.|`|14gi4aTvaa	I've yet to receive one    [:|`|xUOmDc26aa	What?!

nci2WOYXaa	I'm surprised at some of the things of mine that get deleted to. I think Yahoo just gets rid of anything that people report an abuse about.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	It had nothing to do with the subject and it was not censoring..  You were chatting.  Asking personal opinion about something is chatting in most cases.  Anytime you just ask "What do you think...?  it will be chat.    Chat is defined in the YA Community Guidelines (link at bottom of every page). There are specific things listed that you may not think are chat, but Yahoo defines it that way and you have to live with it. You should go to the site dizzay.com and see what a YA type site looks like when chat is allowed.    Just stay away from questions that simply ask people's personal opinion or personal information. Those can sometimes be ok, but most of the time they are chat. Stick with questions that only ask for facts, figures, and data like a teacher might ask in school. You can ask for example Paris Hilton's age, but you can't ask what people thought of her dress. You can ask "What is a good SUV for a big family?", but not "What type of SUV do you drive?".    Chatting is asking questions that can only be answered with personal opinion and to which only you and the answerer will give a hoot. You can tell most of these by the presence of pronouns (I,we,you,me,us) or pronoun adjectives (your,mine,ours). If these are present your question will be chat 90% of the time and if you can not rewrite the question without them, it is chat 99% of the time.     People have different takes on violations, but I hope you will reread the community guidelines for other types of questions that are not allowed and specifically spelled out such as Fill in the Blank questions (link at the bottom of the page).|`|dLoIRwH6aa	When Yahoo Answers remove your question they email you, the reason is because there are people viewing your question that are over the top politically correct minded people that view the word Death as offensive instead of historically correct
r5Mxre6Saa	even when it seems like I've had more than my fill, for some reason, I keep going back for more.  Can't explain why, but it's what I do.|`|c6HfikOHaa	i always want more... modern life has made us greedy|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	Depends on the topic, I guess.    I'm insatiable in the bedroom.

r8s5j6zOaa	that's a start|`|grifjdr0aa	yes, and if you drink good things, you will be wealthy.|`|q2rUW1UEaa	if you eat fish and drink water everyday like I do you will.  Also stay out of the sun and smiling makes everybody prettier/beautiful.|`|eQVD090Xaa	definitely|`|INf502UUaa	If you take care of yourself you'll look healthier, which is more attractive.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	If you eat good food, you'll become healthier.  If you get out in the sun, you'll get a nice tan, but if you spend too much time out in the sun, your skin will become damaged or you'll get skin cancer.  And if you smile, you'll feel better, and you'll look more inviting and friendly.  :]|`|sX78uHhlaa	Well if its healthy i guess idk|`|rw42rC5Qaa	yeah, thet me come back in like a year and we'll see how much bigger your head got.|`|d9cNn9Rbaa	Yes - Unless you are just plain ugly  Yes - Too much will give you skin cancer  Ususally - Unless you have ugly teeth or a fat face|`|q8iDknLraa	Eat meat, whole grain, fruit, veggie, and dairy each day and exercise.    Put on suntan lotion unless you want sunburn or skincancer.    Smile....yes! Noboby likes a grumpy person!;)|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	Well, if you eat healthy food, you will get in shape, and your body will look great, which does make you prettier.    If you go out in the sun, you will get tanner, which people like.    You should definitely smile.  It lets people know that you are pretty inside and out.  Would you be more inclined to date a hot guy/girl who looks like (s)he wants to kill someone, or a normal person who looks really happy?|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	haha...umm... if you smile people are attracted to you...  pretty is a stero type.. yeah... it depends on who you want to look pretty to.|`|zdvnqucsaa	Yes, eating healthy will make you look healthier and more radiant.  It will help you control your weight, smiling always makes everyone look better.  Getting out in the sun is something you need to do in moderation... too little is unhealthy, but too much could be deadly.  If you are going to be out for a long period of time, be sure you wear sunscreen.      Basically if you take care of yourself it will show...and you will feel better as well.

Then when I got mad she went off and slept with the same guy.. only this time the condom broke and she came crying to my sister thinking she was pregnant.. so I got wasted and hooked up with this other girl and now my (ex?)girlfriend thinks that I betrayed her when SHE thinks she's pregnant and I didn't even do anything but kiss the girl.

XD    I don't know. The most drama was probably when my friends were halfassed getting along, and this beyotch named Codi was really mean to a lot of us....    It was a mess. I guess that's kinda vague, but this was back in 2005. We all would chill at my cousin's house, which he shared with his girlfriend. And Codi was my cousin's girlfriend's friend.    She was one of the biggest beyotches ever. Ugh!|`|0QAyPPeoaa	same as u|`|AA12383908	Plenty back when I use to be married to an alcoholic.|`|vqSkOICGaa	an entire year of my life spent in and out of court fighting baby daddy for custody of our daughter. sick.

tumj0xTvaa	limewire can do anything  its free to download (but its pretty much illegal to download anything with it but other than that it can be amazing, don't say I didn't warn you...)    but limewire is one of the easiest and cheapest (but illegal) options    alot of my friends have it, make sure you have a good firewall and virus protection system (like norton antivirus) cause some of the downloads have viruses in them, you can usually spot the ones that do though before you download them by using common sense.|`|IsOp79iPaa	well there are clips on youtube or you can go on google

dDEwO3Cwaa	He isn't my fav but I am a fan of his work.|`|tLI94qWNaa	He is one of my favorite Directors, thats for sure. He is brilliant and just pure genuis.  I love the nightmare before christmasm, sleepy hallow, beetlejuice, big fish, and edward sisssorhands.|`|dR0M50mWaa	I like his work.Work in the movies like Batman,Batman Returns,sleepy hollow and nightmare before christmas is apperciable|`|JxUFDutxaa	He's not my favourite director..but I did like what he did with Sweeny Todd.  I prefer more suspense thriller movies..his movies are just odd.|`|Kn0TpDRdaa	He's not my favorite, either, but I really enjoy his movies. They have an artistic edge to them, and I feel like there's more to look at while you're watching his movies. I know that sounds silly...|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	*scoff* HELL YES. :)|`|LZ07Nm8Uaa	hell yess!!!    I think he has an unique vision and creativity in the whatever he does I love most of the movies he has made.|`|4ymHqPzcaa	hell yes!!!!|`|3eRDHl4Saa	He's not my favorite director, but I'm a big fan of his.  Edward Scissorhands was unbelievable. As was Big Fish.  And although he didn't direct it, The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorites.|`|OZokMUaqaa	he's one of my favorites.... i've grown up watching mostly his movies.... Edward sicssor hands is amazing, nightmare before christmas, charlie wasn't my favorite, but it was soooo cool.... I think he's a geniouse in his own way, he's diffrent and most people don't have the courage to make something out of it. Look at sweeney toddd, that movie was amazing!This was thought by many of my friends to possibly suck (because of the blood and gore and stuff) but he pulled it off like no one else could posssibly do!! I luv Tim BUrton(and no i don't wanna marry him or something like that.....pervs)|`|R2CyLXTHaa	Yes I would say Tim Burton is my favorite director, for sure.  Why? Well in my opinion he is a genius.   His films leave me with this feeling that I usually don't forget.  I love most of the humor, but it's in a way that's a bit to the dark side, which is pretty unique. His film 'Ed Wood' has inspired me in a huge way. Sweeney Todd is an amazing film, and I have to admit the fact that I have seen it over 20 times, and each time I do I always catch on to another part of the movie I have never caught on to be for.   There is a lot more that I could go on about my opinion in Tim Burton as a director, but I think I have said enough. =)    ~Hannah~

MY ANSWER IS NO!|`|A7m8DFgkaa	Yeah, I would.  I think if they're motivated enough to get a job, they should be trusted. (my kids walked our dog's when they were 13 and I trusted them).    Although, they should be charging by the job, not the hour.  I think they'd make more money that way.|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	hell no. and im 13 myself|`|sEFmjAJkaa	Put a micro camera in the dogs collar, I bet the dog sits somewhere, & does not get walked for the full hour......    I don't know.......  make sure you KNOW the person.......  First!      Make sure the dog will be walked,  the ENTIRE HOUR.......  not just sitting on a front step somewhere.......      Have a neighbor or another person near by watching..... to make sure the dog is being walked & is being Treated well, by the dog walker.    I don't know...........  ?????       Have the person by watched...  for awhile, to make sure, dog is in good hands.....      I hope I have helped.....|`|ygg6UqrRaa	Are you CRAZY?  If you LOVE Your pet......

gcRYpydVaa	Have you tried recording it yourself?    I don't like to download so I record most of the songs myself, especially if the file isn't compatible with my iPod or iTunes and you don't have to download any programs.    Click Start, then Programs, and click Accessories.    On that menu, you'll find entertainment.    Click Sound Recorder.    Then, all you have to do is record the song.    When you are done, increase the volume, save it, and there you go!!!    You only have one minute limit to record but to increase it, record it for one minute, then when it is done, click record again, and do that over and over until you have a 10 minute one.    Then, save that as the template.    So, whenever you want to record something more than a minute, all you have to do is open the 10 minute file, record, then cut off the extra time.|`|Uw7TmViZaa	idk limewire i guess|`|83e0d317bb2b739248318df72b7f9d59aa	Mm, it may be because it's not the right file format for your cellphone?

I'm just in from Marin  Can't get it off, but I can get it on and we'll be truckin' 'till the break of day  Here comes the doo-dah dealer on his Hog three wheeler, 250 pounds of sin  He's made your car the main attraction. you wanna beef up his action  But he will cut you, before he would cut you in, the only place to win  Riding out on a rail, feels so fine  Talking 'bout that cocaine express, mainline, taking a midnight cruise  Never lived up in the Northlands, but I been snowblind out in Sandford Dew  Snowblind in Sanford Dew, that's enough for you, snowblind

Take him to the doctors ASAP.|`|jiOohUa0aa	See a certified nutritionist and a Doctor of Naturopathy (for naturopathic medicine and naturopathy therapy).|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	If Dad has only seen Doctor once, he should definitely go back and demand an explanation. If this is not forthcoming then he should ask to see a specialist. Maybe something wrong with discs in back which will cause problems with neck and arms as it can be nerve damage.  I damaged my spine in a diving accident and crushed my sciatic nerve.  It was so painful and left me with a numb leg and foot...I walk OK mind you it's just that I can't really feel my feet properly.  The sciatic nerve is massive and can effect different parts of the body. Watch his intake of food - he may not be eating if he is getting depressed and this could account for his loss of weight.  It's amazing how quick one looses weigh and muscle mass when one is immobile and not eating much.  Pain will also cause him to lose weight as will concern about his own health and desire to be working again.  He is worried about the pain..anyone would - he's trying to protect you I think.  Of course he may know exactly what is wrong with him and doesn't want to worry you.  Have a quiet word with him and say how worried you are..explain that if there is something really wrong you'd prefer to know as the worry is driving you crazy. Parents sometimes keep worries away from children because they don't want to cause them to be worried.  Explain that not knowing is far worse than knowing because at least you will be able to help him by talking about his worries if you know and will have at least have some peace of mind even if the news isn't good.  Hope all will be well with him soon though. But do have a quiet word.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Call the hospital or doctor again. Did you post this question on medical section too?

Peanut butter and jelly totally fits the bill!|`|LDSL0DUiaa	You Are Potato Chips       When you're stressed out, you seek food that is quick and easy.  Life is pretty overwhelming at times, so you prefer comfort food that you can just grab and eat.    You're the type of person who takes on too much, and you don't have a lot of free time.  So even when you have junk food as a meal, you're just thankful that you had any time to eat at all.|`|mBlcD6sRaa	love this link    im a Meatloaf    i dont think so|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Pizza, with anything except mushrooms and chuncks of onions!|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	I'm Mac & Cheese too :)     I like Kraft Dinner,  Wanna make me some?|`|ugzcxnzKaa	Meatloaf and mashed potatoes OR  Grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.|`|0ljM5Ye7aa	same as you|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	meatloaf|`|JReroESmaa	You Are Mac and Cheese       When you are stressed out, you seek safety above everything else.

When you're stressed out, you crave the company of those you love.  Your comfort food is likely to be something you cook and share with others.    In fact, stress often causes you to cook like crazy... even when you're not hungry.  Taking care of people often wears you down, but it's also the thing that energizes you.|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	You Are Apple Pie  When you're stressed out, you crave the company of those you love.

Everyone says there will be a lot more "Edward" than there is in the book, rumors have it! That's all I have to say! hope I helped :)

I just sit and I am mesmerized by the music. They also play all their own instruments and they are really close brothers. They are also Christians and wear purity rings which I think makes them good role models. They can make you think about anything within a 3 minute song. They make me happy.    I hope you like it.|`|m33uUyRYaa	Amazing performers; success is possible|`|BZGWwbWeaa	to all the Jonas Brothers haterz u guy are so retarded u guyz dont know good music.

hKqg0MP0aa	I think you right. I think it was made for the trailer. I love the music too.|`|TGWETA8caa	I love trailer music and soundtracks, I have have a lot of them, that is not something I recognize, so like the other two says, Trailer music specific for that movie.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	I think it was an original score written for the Trailer itself, It seems like a great soundtrack from what we can tell from the Trailer.  Please let Star Scream rip off Shia LeBoufs head.
CuOMzfRdaa	The last person u fought at the end of gears of war 1 was raam but te thing riding on the reaver was actually ethier the queen or skorge one of the queens loyal subjects and they are at war because they see us fighting each other so they dont trust us so they try to kill us and it also may be just for the reason of them being able to make a game!|`|UADLdXBtaa	It was her voice, but the thing you saw at the end was just a theron guard a reaver. You see the queen in Gears of War 2. It's pretty much just a battle for survival. 2 species trying to share a little bit of resources doesn't work too well. It has to do with the imulsion. (The lava like liquid inside of Cera)|`|IqhD4JCCaa	PLay GOW2 my friend and things will be much clearer

hvP2fKDmaa	They usually take pictures and then try and sell them to magazines/tv stations, so it varies. Some pictures can be worth a lot of money, especially if the star is doing something wrong or out of the usual.|`|GCl84SPLaa	There really is no average. They are paid by the photos that they take. That is why they are so aggressive. They could be paid 50 dollars or a quarter of a million dollars depending on the  photo they take. It depends on the news worthiness of the photo. It cost Princess Dianna her life. They are whores.

I don't see her as a role model for anyone...this is still a country where you can buy what you want....Being American means being free to buy the best product.|`|ueAv14FJaa	Yes but miley is just plain stupid..only a stupid 16 year old that doesnt know what to do with all the moeny she has|`|uxvskU7Xaa	at least she got something better for the environment than what she had|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Actually, I would have preferred that Miley bought a pair of roller skates, but apart from that, I would defend her right to buy the product she wants. "Buy American" no longer means quite what it used to mean. Many "U.S made" cars contain parts from other countries and some are assembled in other countries. America has outsourced so many things and imports so much that it's difficult to know who makes what where for any product. America doesn't require my family to support Miley's career (thank God), so I  won't require her to buy American.

Watch your back.  .|`|L5mN1oA6aa	What the previous person said was not 100% true, the sites are probably recording you IPs but they do not have access to view IPs of other sites.

UsGJAmLhaa	I think it was an accidental overdose, purely because there is more solid evidence that points to that conclusion than any other theory. Marilyn had been a heavy prescription pill user for most of her adult life, who at the time of her death was also a heavy drinker with had a habit of pricking pills with needles to make them work faster, and who already had overdosed several times before. In fact, it's almost a wonder she made it to 36 living the life she did. Her husband, Arthur Miller said that he would have to check Marilyn's breathing each night before falling asleep, and needed to call the ambulance on a few occasions. This does not describe a person who had a healthy relationship with prescription drugs in any way. Also, Marilyn had not one but TWO psychiatrists giving her prescriptions in 1962.|`|7HBTvg8Caa	I believe it was a conspiracy with the Kennedy family.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	I always thought there was something suspicious about her death.  There are so many discrepancies with the time line of phone calls and when help arrived.  It also didn't help that the coroner in LA at the time was a fame monger who may have botched the findings of the autopsy.  I have read a number of books on Marilyn Munroe, and I think someone-not necessarily one of the Kennedys, but someone who thought she may put that administration at risk assisted her 'suicide'.|`|1VdQbx3xaa	sweet mystery!!!!!!!!!!!
tZ3jcxvjaa	Nickel was cheaper than silver.  Back when coins where made of precious metals. a dime was ten cents worth of silver.

I cheered when he started torturing the guy who was trying to kidnap him.    The scenes on the plane were amazing.  Those last few seconds, when you saw Hiro sitting there crying and one person who hadn't been unmasked flying out of the side of the plane to his/her death, were so shocking!  I cried out, "NO!" when the "To be continued..." thing popped up on the screen.  It was VERY well done, and it was TOTALLY worth the wait.      I loved it!|`|evGcnF6Caa	Heroes is my favorite series!

He is an athlete, thats what he wanted out of life, and he accomplished this plus ALOT more, what can you possibly say to make him seem like a bad person for this??     yeah, people look up to him, but it doesnt mean he doesnt deserve to make choices for himself and live his life like the rest of us do. That picture was obviously taken in his own home, not out on the town making a scene. geez creepy people, you dont even know him, get off his back and stop saying youre "dissapointed in him".

fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	Watching those episodes won't help you understand what you saw last night.     But here is an episode guide :http://www.heroesfanatic.com/episodes/se...    It is detailed but biased.     One of those episodes is a ridiculous flashback episode that nearly destroys the continuity of season 1 and the other episode just deals with Mohinder being a serial killer and the mysterious plan of Arthur Petrelli. Both of those stroylines have wrapped up now.
IaIs8foRaa	I think Amy and Ricky should  go out! They should because they'll make a good couple, but i kinda like Ben  for Amy, because he is so sweet. but kinda nosy.

I think she is talking about ricky cause when she was talking to him last week she said she wanted to raise the baby with him as friends. there was also preview where ricky said he wanted amy. so we will all hve to wait till monday to find out. I know i cant wait.

AA11516222	The MPAA is an agency created by Jack Valenti so that Congress would make laws regulating the movie industry.  It does its work in secret and there is no way to challege its decisions.  You don't have to have the MPAA rate your film, but then no theatre owner in America will show it.  Another example of how America really isn't the democracy we think it is.  The MPAA doesn't mind violence, but you can't have any sex in your movie, just the opposite of how they do it in Europe.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Film critics (People who get paid by a tv show or newspaper or magazine to sit around, watch movies, and then tell people how good or bad they are).

kt7JRvy2aa	the movie wont end the show, but i read in a magazine and saw an interview on tv that they are going to stop the show after the 3rd season is done filming. so basically  Hannah Montana is done but she said Miley Cyrus isn't. like for example britany spears, when she was young, she would sing teenage songs, but as she got older, she sang adult songs. so really Miley Cyrus is getting to old for Hannah Montana`s 5and6 year old songs.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	i hope it ends soon|`|HwrmAgzuaa	:| i hope not  but I think it will....shes 16 now and probably really ready to move on|`|zFqJpKrraa	god, i really hope so|`|IdBEBBOHaa	Yes|`|HsWkA8jQaa	no its not gonna end. they are still filming season 3 , and they are making a movie for the show.|`|8SLHXHa4aa	I certainly hope so, and i hope she gets a throat infection so she can happily retire.|`|493lDnceaa	I seriously doubt it would end the show because of all the money Disney's making off the show. i don't know for certain, but that would be my best guess.|`|SojKDZffaa	no they are filming season 3|`|AA12269023	Yeah, I'm sorry but I definetly see it coming becuase it's happened with alot of shows like Drake & Josh and LIzzie McGuire.  But at least they're ending it the right way.    Lol, the only evidence I have is the reaveling trailer.  I guess the movie is gonna be about Miley being tired of this double life, and her deciding to just stick with one of them. Which one will she choose?    It sucks, I feel two ways...  Excited that's it's coming out and can't wait to see it and...  Completly bummed that it will be all over and seeing Miley in other roles besides Hannah...  But I need to get over it, all Disney Channel stars move on, and she said so herself, she's not gonna be Hannah when she's 30 or anything...      Got Miley?

0UzfriZoaa	There is this Demi Moore film from 1988, directed by Carl Schultz and it is quite unknown (at least here in Brasil) and it's very moving and interesting. See the plot summary    "Around the world, the signs of the apocalypse--as outlined in the Book of Revelation--seem to be coming to pass in the wake of a mysterious wanderer. Father Lucci, the Vatican Emissary assigned to investigate, dismisses the occurrences as natural, but Abby Quinn, a young American woman, has reason to fear they're real--and that the unfolding events may spell disaster for her unborn child.

WqpRy643aa	HI, I would be happy to help you.  1. Yes, when I was younger I wanted to be as pretty as a model.  Back then I didn't think I was pretty like a model, now I know that I'm pretty, but a "girl next door" kind of pretty and not the model pretty ( which I'm perfectly happy with!).      2. I've always had a fast metabolism and have been skinny all my life.  When I was 8 I thought I was "chubby"(which I know I wasn't now), so I layed off the ice cream.    3. Yes.  I've been call anorexic, I've had people stare at me when I eat (to see how much i eat), people look at how much food is left on my plate when I finished, and one time I was sick and threw up and i was followed around to see if I was gaging my self (bulimic).    4. Yes!  I'm 14 years old, 5'5'', and 90 pounds!  My shirts fit my shoulders too tight in order to fit my stomach, or my shirt fits my shoulders and at my stomach it looks like it was made for a pregnant person.  And I have 1 or 2 pairs of jeans that really fit me correct.  I can't get them to fit my length, thighs, and butt,  Most the time I have to were shorts so I don't deal with the problem.  A pair of size "0" jeans literally fall off when I walk.      So I hope I helped you, I'm going to star your questions so maybe my contacts will answer it for you.  Good luck with your project, I hope you win!|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	no  no  yes, for being skinny  idk my size|`|k0dZeYQ6aa	no  no  kinda...  nope...|`|RyMNLddQaa	1. i wanted to be as pretty but not to actually be a model.  2. i have went on a diet, but nothing drastic.  3. yes. but not in school...  4. i wish, size 12, and find it hard to find clothes that look good on me. trousers are always too long.|`|1a80d7720bf795c4dbe1f3cd4ac0ef83aa	1.

bl8co4hUaa	A young monk was tasked with scribing from their sacred text. Presented with a copy, he reasoned that if copies were made from copies and not the original, any mistakes made would never be rectified. The elderly monk agreed and went to the basement to retrieve the original text.    Hours passed, and the elderly monk did not return. Finally, the young monk went to find him. He went to the basement and heard heartbroken sobbing. It was the elderly priest, holding the original illuminated manuscript in his hands. When the young monk asked what was wrong, the elderly monk wailed, "The word is *celeBRATE*!"  **************************************...  Billy was devoted to his mother and to his cat Princess. One day, he went on vacation for a week and left *strict* instructions with his brother Joe on how to take care of Princess. He was very worried since his brother was rather careless at times.    The day after he left for vacation, Billy called home. Billy asked Joe, "How is Princess?" Joe replied casually, "She's dead." Billy freaked out and when he could speak again, he chastised Joe brutally for breaking the news so coldly.    Billy said, "When I called you should have said the cat is on the roof but you called for help. Then the next day, you could say people are still trying to get the cat from the roof, but she's not coming down. The third day, you could have said, we did all we could, but I'm sorry, she passed away. You should have broke the news gently!"    Joe was humbled. Finally, Billy asked, "How is Mom?"    Joe replied, "Uhhhhhh...she's on the roof?"|`|utGddhnVaa	yesterday i heard that the only hand that beats a royal flush is chuck norris's..it was new to me|`|41479d464ed912b4157bcb71a2bae530aa	i didnt hear any jokes today =[|`|4vvELzRzaa	yo mama is so fat when she walks across the tv screen, I missed 3 tv shows xD|`|yGTJfcF5aa	Guy 1: Your a B*tch!

lotqEZZNaa	Basically, to do it you are using the back of your throat. That is the best way to do it without damaging your chords too much. Warning, you won't be able to do it very loud when it comes from the back. If it's volume you're going for than you probably WILL damage your vocal chords, but not seriously. It is fixable. All you would need to do would be to drink some hot tea, or try a cough drop, or even just go to sleep amd drink lots of water in the morning. Screamo sounds good only in a few situations, so don't over-do it. K? :P|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Screamo is musical genre usually classified as a sound, which came from emo and hardcore punk, in the 1990's. This kind of music uses vocalists, people who scream a lot, instead of singers like most other bands use.    Screamo bands include ampere, circle takes the square and sometimes underoath is considered screamo.    The term is also used for bands that use some screaming, but have plenty of normal singing in the music, usually more singing than screaming. Examples of that include Silverstein, Hawthorne heights and The used    While many types of Music scream, screamo usually has a certain kind of screaming. For example, even rock'n roll had some.

Then you go "flicking" the booger back and forth between fingers, trying the whole time to get it to "flick" it off, but now is just getting spattered and gooey all over all of your fingers and there is no actual "flicking" going on. Now you must bring in the second hand to release the boogy and finally "flick" it to obscurity where it belonged this whole time.   That is what comes to mind when you say "Flick!"

He has that sound like no other.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Country guitarist Brad Paisley is mine.  I mean, he can play any genre well--blues, jazz, rock, surf rock, bluegrass, western swing and, of course, country (perhaps a more modern version of the late Danny Gatton, versatility-wise, that is).    MQ:  Paisley's kick-*** country instrumental "Throttleneck" is my favorite of his, at this point.      Some of my other favorite guitarists:  Jerry Reed, Chet Atkins, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Melvin Taylor, Albert Lee, Frank Hannon, Steve Vai, Brent Mason, Pete Ham, Danny Gatton, Redd Volkaert, Monte Montgomery, Warren DeMartini, Eric Sardinas and so many more!      To whoever said Merle Travis:  Great choice!  If it wasn't for him, Chet Atkins probably never would've been a fingerpicker...and that'd be awful!  Both Travis and Atkins were great and their stuff together was as well!  Also, Merle Travis' son, Thom Bresh, is another exceptional guitarist!|`|EWE5BMLKaa	Bob Casale    Uncontrollable urge|`|Hkoc8A4Jaa	Randy Rhoads.

If all they got is a yo' mama rank they're laughably pathetic.|`|FrWhdRL1aa	6, but I wouldn't really freak out I would just be mad.|`|aVZgY4S8aa	More like 0 for me. My mother and I hated each other with a passion, so if anyone insulted her I would usually say "You're right." That always left them speechless because they'd throw the insult out to piss me off but it never did. If you REALLY wanted to piss me off, tell me how wonderful my mother is! :p|`|6tGYe5roaa	When I first saw this question, I was thinking along the lines of "your momma so fat people jog around her for exercise." In that case, I wouldn't be mad at all.     But after seeing your added details, I'm assuming you mean someone genuinely making fun of my mother. In that case, I would be about a 7-10. It would all depend on exactly what is said.|`|TjttzpPKaa	Usually when someone does a "your momma" joke to me, I respond with "I don't have a momma. Me and my daddy share yours." BUT, now that my mom is very ill (she's 81 and getting her strength back for open heart surgery), I have zero tolerance for ANYTHING NEGATIVE being said about her. Can't do much about it over the Internet, if someone goes that route, but God won't help somebody if they talk about her to my face. So, I guess it's safe to say "10."|`|xxtvhn5Naa	yeah im an 8 too.. i wouldnt freak out and try to kill the guy... but i would still be mad|`|8ryZyVUOaa	4 maybe 3|`|hXdt1lntaa	7/8|`|eZCCSMykaa	depends if they serious 8 if not serious...idk 2|`|U9MOYX0Zaa	1.3|`|Do0AOAIYaa	10 then id go make a porn wit ther momma and put it onthe internet|`|zi06yiu1aa	it depends on who it is. everyone close to us knows my mom is loco! haha|`|021bd3cf9281b6c2a0260dedca7da5a1aa	10      fuhh no no one disrespects my mom|`|NMAfFeNcaa	9 may be|`|ozNXnNQIaa	9.5    I admire my mother. She educated me and all etc. So, I definitely won't tolerate it if someone did insult her. I Will  defend her immediately. If I hate it when my BROTHER talks back to her, why should I tolerate a stranger?|`|YVeZ8K6haa	10. That person would have to eat liquid food through a straw. :)
egY1odZKaa	As much as I like The Beatles I like this song, it exemplifies them.  I think that the Beatles had the ability to perform any musical genre very well.|`|46e2a496285e8eb37e4ada2aac6111b8aa	I'm a complete Beatles nerd because of my upbringing, and they are pretty sweet.    I grew up knowing the song was about a prostitute, but later read that everyone was on here is right, being about an affair John had. That the girl was a 'Norwegian wood'. Norwegian- pine (cheap pine), and wood. Yeah. Something like that.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	John Lennon said he wrote it about an affair.    (I love that song--but then again,I love everything the Beatles ever did!)      (Personally,I always liked the lyric 'Or should I say,she once had me,'Kinda shows who had the upper hand in the relationship.)|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	It supposedly describes a 'one night stand' that John Lennon had. Great track.|`|CEENX0sDaa	i think its overrated hippie junk.

In general, if the doors are marked with explicit signs, I always read and then either pull or push. I never make mistakes in this case.    But if the doors are unmarked, I do make mistakes most of the time!... :)|`|EvDoLydgaa	yes like a dumb|`|M8kNmWuAaa	Yah, its not that funny. the funny part is when you go out and do the same thing.|`|1PahwCFCaa	Too often|`|OPKbGXUFaa	Everyday of my life.!|`|fZY8EkVDaa	Oh yea!!!

0PNDluppaa	Technically, in most polls of this kind conducted, EPs could and most likely would be considered. However, this is not always the case. EPs in most charts are considered singles, or can even not be considered at all.    In answering your question, it depends what Album of the Year poll it is, and what their cut-off point is for defining EPs separate from singles and albums, i.e. 30 mins/4 tracks in the UK, or thereabouts.

RtG5Iarbaa	I usually get inspiration for my lyrics from Nirvana, RHCP, stuff that looks like it means nothing but it's really got a good meaning. I also get inspired by events in my life, and the lives of people I know.    For music, lately I've been trying to perfect a very orchestrial song.. but I usually get inspiried  by Coldplay.  When I hear RHCP I usually feel inspired to play guitar. Or if I hear a gorgeous intro, solo, ect.|`|UnsZKr4saa	I am only a lyricist.  I take main influences from bands such as Dark Tranquillity and Cynic.    On a side note...the user "The Sentence has 31 Characters!" is not me, please do not get confused, thanks :P|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I'm not a musician, but I do write...I draw inspiration from life experience and people that I've known and met.    for life I get inspiration from my family.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	My Mom, Jon Lord, Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, Rick Wright|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I get it from other music.    Anytime I find myself discouraged with the guitar I just sit back and listen to Brian May, Hendrix, Clapton, Slash, Gilmore, etc, and I get inspired all over again to get back at it.|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	Everything really... Emotions... A lot of stuff with nature... How certain people make me feel. Musically, I'm more alternative.|`|4ObhfxoIaa	Can it be for art too? :D    I get my inspiration from whatever mood I'm in or what's going on in my life at the moment or what movies I'd recently watched or what I'm listening too!    I guess you'd say everything influences me.|`|CTQNPj56aa	I draw inspiration from my family (and idols), everyday matters, and things I usualy have dreams about- for lyrics    For any instrument... I like to imagine a story and create a melody/harmony for it|`|komayN73aa	lyrics usually involve my relationships with people (yes usually a girl i get it im emo..whoever wants to point that out can **** them self with a broom) and my relationship with myself    my music is inspired by bands like architects and thrice    for life.....i have yet to find any meaning in my life but i dont really care...im content with just existing.....and maybe ill find that meaning one day|`|KwWwB22Zaa	other bands, personal experiences.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	For guitar, my biggest inspiration is country guitarist Brad Paisley who is just a phenomenal musician.  If it wasn't for him, I never would have become a fan of western swing or jazz.    If I was a songwriter, my biggest inspirations would probably be Tom Keifer of Cinderella who is one of the best songwriters in rock, in my opinion.  Of course, my personal life would also be an inspiration for my songwriting.|`|nYqtw9DWaa	I don't write songs (yet lol )  but with my playing I get inspiration from George Harrison and Pete Townshend, they are my two main idols.  =)|`|sb3PV5seaa	Lyrics & Poems, usually from events, watching people, looking at my sisters photography, dreams I have had,  reading the newspaper, feelings,  debating, and listening to God is a Astronaut and The Album Leaf.    Music, probably from practicing the cello mostly, when ever I listen to Elgar's cello concerto, Kol Nidrie and Franck's D-moll, it makes me feel like composing a piece, but that's for classical music.  Often when listening to a piece of music, I single out an instrument and imagine little melodies and stuff xD  Often listening to Le tigre, The Cure, Joy Division, IAMX, Just Jack, Portishead, Slowdive, Friendly Fires, Bat For Lashes, Cocteau Twins etc, give me some form or inspiration for making music :)      Life?  My Sister, reading really good books, listening to amazing music, practicing, looking at art/paintings, and just living :)|`|Hkoc8A4Jaa	Life experiences.|`|dEy5nIqNaa	Seeing as I do lyric less pieces, I try to paint an image in your head. I use sounds and instruments, climaxes and breakdowns to pass a feeling and a visual. Nostalgia, childhood, pain, ect ect. My inspiration comes from everything from being young and watching the first few seasons of rugrats, to close family and friends dieing. You know you've made good music when you listen to it and it doesn't catch your ear, it catches your gut.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Just the weird things I notice in a conversation or when I look outside.  Life:everyone!|`|dUWqW27paa	Life force. There is a place deep down inside of you called your soul. Go there and you will find what you are looking for.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Well, Kurt Cobain's lyrics inspires the stories i write.     =]|`|89xzNpVaaa	Actually Kurt Cobain inspired me to write songs or poems, but  when i write i think of music, nonsense, and reality.|`|0vm66wlcaa	Jason Becker, mainly.    But also my friends, family.  And that girl I like.  And John Lennon and Max Bemis and Randy Rhoads.|`|c95a1585599e1bb6a610d451c0e66d2caa	Sometimes I'll draw on my own feelings and emotions for inspiration in lyrics and I kinda try to let that dictate chord progression too. Sometimes situations in the world provide good material for songwriting too (that is when I'm feeling political). Musical styles? Anywhere from A7X to Andy McKee.

It is usually set in a mould and served cold. Although traditionally white, blancmanges are frequently given a pink color as well. Some similar desserts are Bavarian cream, panna cotta, and haupia. The historical blancmange originated some time in the Middle Ages and usually consisted of capon or chicken, milk or almond milk, rice and sugar and was considered to be an ideal food for the sick.|`|0G0UFJleaa	It's a sweet creamy dessert, perhaps a bit like a custard or flan. It was eaten more commonly in olden times. I'm sure you could do a search and find more background information and recipes.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	could that be an egg white meringue ?  Maybe.  I'm just guessing.|`|I1K6SC43aa	egnamcnalb backwards.|`|kdSuwt8paa	It is a dessert - made with milk, cornflour, sugar and flavouring, rather like a very firm custard.  You make it in a jelly mould and turn it out.     (You can also get blancmange powder in various flavours but you still have to use milk and sugar to make it.)   It was much loved in Victorian nurseries and as an invalid food!
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	No, I didn't think that - I had heard about Groundhog Day long before the movie came out.    In fact, I just checked it on Wikipedia and it states:  An early American reference to Groundhog Day can be found in a diary entry, dated February 4, 1841.  Wow.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_d...    Now, if only we could believe everything Wikipedia says!  I'm an Australian.|`|fbb9066e2afa9de269b826835c3bb5cfaa	The Yellowdog is right ...One of my early memories was that my Uncle Jerald was born on Ground Hog Day...the day the hog (like a mar met) comes out of his house in the groundat the end of winter to see if the sun is shinning and the only way he can tell is to see if he has a shadow.I love the Movie!!!!|`|ZqHH6C6faa	Believe me, it's absolutely real.    Before the mid-1800s, German farmers looked upon the hedgehog coming out of hibernation as a way to forecast the seasons. When the German immigrants came to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, they brought their traditions with them. Since the region surrounding Punxsutawney had an abundance of groundhogs but no hedgehogs, they simply adopted the groundhog.    Fast forward to the present time. Sure, the groundhog saw his shadow and it is said that there will be six more weeks of winter weather but that it NOT really what Groundhog Day is about. The underlying meaning of Groundhog Day in the 21st Century is to have fun and not take life so seriously.

Que Sera, Sera,  Whatever will be, will be  The future's not ours, to see  Que Sera, Sera  What will be, will be.    When I was young, I fell in love  I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead  Will we have rainbows, day after day  Here's what my sweetheart said.

yOLeRiTZaa	~_~.  Addy-Now I am American too, and I can't answer the accent question, but one thing I have noticed, AND PLEASE I DO NOT want to offend Anyone. This is strictly an observation after viewing or answering Questions...Ya gotta keep in mind, these are where my ancestor are from!!  K?    But it seems that we are constantly corrected for saying the word America, this verses U.S.A. or North America. I have explained that we have simply become comfortable saying America or American. Wouldn't you agree. We just shortened  United States of America. Cu'z see...that's kinda long.  Really kinda no different then the shortening of words here the INTERNET.. Not to mention that YES...We know there is a South America.    Well, just wanted to put that out there, those of you who wish to comment on my answer to Addy please do, I'm always willing to hear one out, and I don't ever get insulted, like EVER. Confused but not insulted.    Thanks Addy, Great Question!!

izX7ymibaa	No, that works. Interestingly its the overall blend of chemistry that makes something work. Aries/Cancer, usually no; but Aries/Libra big yes, Scorpio/Cancer yes yes. But I have found several married couples who are not astrologically compatible by just their sun signs.|`|VCF9os1jaa	I agree. It is fun. Now if you just went with my boyfriend being a Scorpio, and I being an Aries, then most would say, Oh no, Big no. But it works.

AA10672842	The same thing as younger people but they don't complain as much.You see ,older people appreciate the value of every day and we've learned to live it to the fullest. We read, we play and keep up with our grandkids, we take long walks on trails, do volunteer work, we travel, we do fundraising, we hold jobs and yes we even play bingo when we have time.Older people's interests are as varied as younger people and over time we've gained the confidence to try new things without the fear of failing.Oh we may still fail but we;re not afraid to try .Remember old age is not a gift given to everyone so learn to celebrate each new day.Did I forget to tell you that old people like to give advice too.|`|emkT1a6raa	hmm...  well, some are mean and nasty and smell bad.  some are reealy nice, smell like pie, and are so nice [=    so i guess the mean ones plan their plots to be more mean  and the nice ones sew for the homeless :D|`|79b8592899aa3dcb578c630cb4ebe264aa	Thats Funny when I Hear the theme song to  wheel of Fortune I remember My childhood and Going to my Grandparents.My Grandfather Fishes and My Grandmothers a Quilter.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	There are many things for them to do!

And spending months at a time with each other allows everyone to get to know each other on a level they otherwise wouldn't.

lpyWVR2oaa	The good part about this combo is that you come across as a much more emotionally sensitive and empathetic person than the typical average Aries. Pisces Moon makes you more compassionate and sensitive and the Taurus Ascendant also tones down your impulsiveness and gives you a more humble, steady and stable facade.    On the down side, the Pisces Moon is a mutable moon that tends to vacillate too much at times when it comes to decision making. You may be too swayed by your emotions at times and find it hard to come to a solid conclusion. This may dampen the Arien aggressiveness and initiative powers to get things started.|`|g5PdKsA5aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries_(astr...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(ast...   wikipedia knows all lol|`|8ZUVToXgaa	good answer, fiery earth.    interesting. :)

yU6T1q0taa	No; got nailed on the face and hands by about a half-dozen wasps (maybe more??) when I was four, though.  NOT fun.  I was sitting on the edge of a picnic table, and didn't know the nest was there.  Stuck my hand right into it, then instinctively brought my hands to my face when I started getting stings.  I was a pretty sick kid for a few days; it's one of my earlier memories, as you might imagine.    Also stung by a scorpion the same year.

Are you seriously striking back because someone thumbed you down?    I'm a Leo, so don't add me to your "Annoying Libras" tirade.  But honestly now...whatever you find irritating about someone else, you can't just blame it all on their Sun Sign.|`|cq2XIko9aa	no its not true but yeah there is Girl in My faimly and my aunt they both are libra and they have very bad sense of humar and very bad.But my other cousin he is libra and he is sweet but Bad Angry Man.yeah 70% librians are hateble and My Ex Girlfriend was also libra|`|CEEQDSCFaa	what do you think of people that asks why libras ask "What do you think of Libras" that ask questions like, "Why do people hate Libras?"    and then complain about them getting a thumbs down when they dont really know who thumbed them down    i know, crazy world|`|PleLteu3aa	It's all lame. Either way, i'm not fond of Libras ;)|`|bEHRh1lgaa	I love Libras!|`|2VNmxfgpaa	Come on, you know the Libras were asking because they couldn't decide.  And then when they had to choose a correct answer, they couldn't decide if they agreed, so they just gave the thumbs-down.  They felt it was so unfair, unjust and unbalanced!    As I am Libra, I can see all sides of the issue, in fairness to you.      LOL - do I get a point or two for at least having a sense of humor? -)|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	-because they need balance..........if the answer is just a blunt negative, they will take it wrong whether it is the truth or not.  It needs to be balanced out with a positive.|`|13hDE66Oaa	You're focusing way too much on Libras! lol|`|uel6NBOVaa	Well you don't really have any proof that the person asking was the one that gave you a thumbs down, so I wouldn't be so quick to retaliate.     However, if you gave an answer that was rude, biased, and uncalled for against Libras, then it's perfectly understandable that the person would act out against your answer. Sure they asked because they were insecure, but you also asked this question because you were insecure.     Either way you look at it, the whole situation is pretty silly.|`|2IddNqy9aa	libras suck... bottom line    Pisces is the best sign there is... i would know cuz i'm a pisces and everybody loves me|`|PlxknZV4aa	I hate them like I hate Libras.

hOIWPsoxaa	In all honesty, I think that the video was gore for the sake of gore. It just seemed like a montage of clips with no sequential narrative.

u9RwzLPnaa	What, there is nobody named Beyond in Death Note. Must be fan fiction.|`|fJt5zRTXaa	I love Beyond Birthday!   He was introduced in a death note spin off light novel called "Death Note: Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Case". Beyond Birthday is MENTIONED once in the anime.     Here's who he is:     Little is known about B, though he and A (real name unknown) were the first two children in line to succeed L. The pressure of Wammy's House proved to be too great for them, however, as A committed suicide, while B wound up running away at some point.    His whereabouts remained unknown from May 2002 to the beginning of the story, L having tracked cases around the world to search for him. Beyond Birthday came up with a plan to surpass L, as the "World's Greatest Criminal", giving L a case that B hoped he would be unable to solve.     For more information go to: http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Beyond_B...|`|41g6yJLgaa	hes in the book    Death Note another note: the los angelis BB murder case. its a spinoff book about ray penbars girlfriend whose name i cant remember right now|`|yYHCm9A9aa	No, he is not in the anime or manga.  But he is in a book called ''  Los Angeles BB Murder Case.''  I have only seen a few fanfictions.  Here's some information:       Beyond Birthday has never appeared in the manga, anime, or film series to date, but the BB Case was briefly alluded to in both manga and anime. He was born with Shinigami Eyes, which allowed him to see and know when exactly people around him would die, as well as knowing their full names. He uses this ability to pick his victims and kill them when they would have been destined to die. It is unknown how he could have possibly been born with the eyes, though Mello wonders if a Shinigami dropped its eyeballs to Earth (instead of a Death Note). Some have claimed that Beyond Birthday is a cannibal, but this is only a rumor. The novel did not say anything about him eating his victims' remains. Though this could be true, further information has yet to be revealed. During the investigation of the Los Angeles BB Murder Cases with Naomi Misora, B is described to have a jar filled with strawberry jam, in the victim's fridge. Some people also speculate that similar to L and Mello's craving for sweets, Beyond Birthday craves strawberry jam. However, he was only said to have eaten an entire jar one time in Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases and Naomi Misora never witnessed him doing so again, though she herself wondered about the same thing. It is possible that his love of sweets during the entire time with Naomi Misora was a charade as well. Although mentioned only once in the book, it is also implied that Beyond Birthday practices laughing quite often. Also, it is interesting to note that his laughter is referred to by Mello as a "Shinigami's laugh."

OcfL1QNcaa	It was definately interesting. In truth, Naruto didnt teach him fully. He gave him the principles (and, probably, the steps for doing it, such as the balloon/ball training) but, from the manga, we see Naruto instructed Konohamaru PRE timeskip. He is wearing his old clothing.    Konohamaru would have been unable to do the rasengan until after mastering the kage bunshin, a feat he only recently accomplished. Using Kagebunshin lowers the difficulty of the move considerably.    The rasengan's significance is that it is a technique passed down (and up) through teacher and student. Minato Namikaze (aka the fourth) taught Jiraiya and Kakashi (yes, kakashi knew the technique before chidori, which was PRE sharingan, so he actually physically learned it). Jiraiya taught Naruto. And Naruto taught his student, konohamaru. While the power and significance of the rasengan is weakened by so many (proportionally) major names performing the move, it also strengthens the importance that Kishimoto places on 'the next generation'. In this interpretation, of the rasengan being akin to the will of fire, the move is quite significant, and is MORE important than before.    It also seems konohamaru's rasengan is slightly smaller(?) than Narutos, and, at this point in the manga, the rasengan is no longer considered an 'ultimate move', but more of a symbol, now that naruto has progressed beyond its basic form.|`|M8qLP7MLaa	Konohamaru must have learned it in about 2/3 years considering Naruto left him with it before he left with Jiraiya.    It took the Fourth Hokage 3 years to create the incomplete version. I understand that it would take longer for the Fourth, as he was creating it and not just trying to learn a jutsu already invented.     I'm not really happy about it, but I can somewhat understand it. Konohamaru's version was pretty small and not done without a shadow clone after all. But still, not that happy about it.     It just makes the Fourth Hokage look less and less cool. D:|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	You'd think so... but if you really think about it I don't think it will... who all has learned it really... Konohamaru, Kakashi who has the sharingan and years of fighting experience along with training from the creator of rasengan himself! It would be expected of Kakashi to learn the rasengan although it is probably nowhere near as good of a rasengan as Naruto's or Jiraiya's... Konohamaru is following in Naruto's footsteps and I don't think there is any better way of showing that than having Konohamaru be shown the rasengan and at such a young age that means that he is going to be strong! Especially being trained by Naruto! ^.^ Rasengan isn't something that can be learned by many people and it takes someone like Naruto who would never give up! I'm sure Minato as great as he was wasn't able to come up with so many forms of rasengan! so even if every single shinobi masters rasengan none will be equal to Naruto's and the chances of someone mastering Rasen Shuriken probably don't even exist!|`|reNmh3rWaa	It's a basic, incomplete move.  I don't even know if Naruto taught him Rasengan; I think he learned by himself|`|czB9nABWaa	uh? he did. jerk-face, no, i dont think it was cool. but konohamaru needs to stop being so spoiled. since when does he call him brother naruto btw?

UU3AAlkraa	I believe if you signed up for a woman's gym and they then make it a uni-sex gym they have defaulted on the service offered and you should be refunded. As for fatties watching the food channel and soaps, then again you are not being offered the service you paid for. Although nothing criminal there it would be actionable as a civil matter.|`|4SJCYd6daa	Breach of contract on their part.

If they can't even go to a gym to better themselves while watching anything they want or listen to anything they want, that's very sad. Yes...for sure...you should be held to the contract. I guess that Gym didn't realize they had to put down a red carpet for some people.........LOOK before you SIGN next time, now go spread some "joy"..............|`|lhe6cb5Waa	Well, first of all I love The Food Network for obvious reasons  and secondly my poll is never serious.............

As much as i hope Jason purposes to Jillian, cuz i love her too, i think its going to be Melissa. Is it just me, or does Melissa remind you a lot of Deanna? Everything about her yells DEANNA to me..

He's beast.|`|yuqZ6M96aa	there are lots of guitarists i admire, and not so much for their amazing technical speed or any of that nonsense, but because they played their hearts out    but... if i want to hear unparalleled technical prowess, i'll take buckethead over anyone  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW_ZTq5IA...|`|ty3nnq2uaa	Dimebag Darrell  ever heard anyone shredding like him???

Eddie Van Halen - Van Halen: Eruption, enough said.  Jimmy Page - Led Zeppelin: He is a guitar legend and love his riff on Kashmir.    I do like both Slash and Hendrix, but the three listed above me to attempt guitar. I failed epically at that.|`|eQtjnKQAaa	George Harrison  The Beatles  He makes my day a whole lot better and whenever I hear him sing or talk (etc), I smile till my cheeks hurt.

631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	I am like...seriously picking up that you're a Twilight freak lol.  Pleased to meet you, Alicee Cullen :D    You have a LOT of stuff in water and earth signs (everything you've mentioned here), so there's a good chance that you are extremely feminine.  Not just appearance-wise, but also in the way you move, talk, and conduct your social relationships.  You may find that people tend to come to you with their problems, and look for your guidance in many things...and you may have a maternal relationship with my many of your friends...which may translate to you befriending people you view as perhaps irresponsible, scatter-brained, or childish.      But, at the same time you can be very childish yourself, but you feel like you have to hide this part of yourself from others; because they rely and depend on you.    You have a tendency to ignore or represss your anger, and you don't feel comfortable expressing your real emotions to others.  You try to be everything to everyone.    You're probably a very sweet person, full of good intentions...but people may see you as easy to take advantage of.  You're far more shrewd than you appear, though...and will often clam up if you sense someone is trying to use you.|`|2IddNqy9aa	i'm   pisces sun  saggitarius moon  cancer rising  blah, blah mercury  blah blah mars  blah, blah, blah, venus    & your smiley face sign should be like this     :)    i feel that in the near future you will aquire the ability to bend spoons with your mind...    for more psychic visions contact Red at red_lbc26@yahoo.com  i am a legit psychic...|`|izX7ymibaa	I think you battle with insecurity. I think if you love and honor yourself more you will be able to relax. But self love doesn't mean selfishness, so don't feel guilty about it. You need a really strong and stable partner who will help you feel safe.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Only you know best about yourself.       Want to know who you are?

You might want to look into a smaller bass, they make them in 3/4 scale (75% the size of a regular bass).

uel6NBOVaa	It could be your midheaven. There are a number of factors that contribute. You may stress certain parts of the chart more so than others at different times. Also, we are a blend off things so you may be showing a mix of all your influences, and perhaps at work the environment brings out those positive qualities within you. Sometimes it is not only ourselves but the people we surround ourselves with.     I don't know about the Midheaven in Cancer...I can imagine that it seeks comfort and security within work, and perhaps you project those social qualities in order to achieve this comfort? Hmm....I don't know. Is this behavior you only experience at work?     I do feel my Leo MC come into play when I'm in the working world. I often find myself taking the lead and being a bit too bossy with my coworkers. I have an extreme need to get things in order, and I automatically take the position of authority without a second thought. Out of the work world I don't always feel so quick to lead, and sometimes I prefer to keep my opinions to myself...but once I get in that career situation, I'm alpha girl. Not to mention I have my 6th house in Aries to go along with that Leo MC, so I prefer to work alone and be on top.    Edit: Haha, could be. Work may be the natural place for you, and you feel comfortable there. Where is your Moon located? Come to think of it, I'm not all that familiar with your chart.    Ooh Moon in the 6th, yes definitely. Maybe you feel at home with yourself when you can get a good job. Plus you have those positive aspects between those very potent planets.     Moon conjunct Mars in the 6th? also trine Midheaven, with Midheaven in Cancer, the work world probably allows your true and more comfortable self to shine....Lol...Or I'm really just trying to act like I know stuff -_-    I knew it! I'm so good. Haha. : )|`|AA11899483	i have moon in taurus in 6th and moon trine midheaven and uranus and what you described above is like me! :) im so happy at work, especially when i got money on my mind lol, but i like getting involved with my colleagues and helping them, and feeling useful. but i dont always get on their good side, i usually say things which are really honest and hurtful, plus my midheavens in leo, which means i gota be on top. and my 6th house is in aries- my way or the highway lol.|`|32P3hG0Laa	waitaminute... if your MC is Cancer and your Sun & Neptune oppose it then they are in Capricorn, so you're not a Libra... And a Libra would never have a Venus in Aquarius... yet you ID yourself as a Libra... so what's up? Do you mean your rising sign is Libra? That could work with the rest of the chart you're describing...    As for weird behavior... well... what aspects does your Venus make?

Good luck.|`|D0H3SYIDaa	if he is ill give ya tips.    Dont swing when you cant see use it to block.  Dont be scared to fight back.  Dont get rushed.

AIM HARD.    If you do he wont be able to breath hell crouch and hold his stomach. now u just beat him in the head remember all these things must be dealth with fast. If he did throw the first punch say it was "self defense"|`|KH5zRKWFaa	I hope you know martial arts, cuz he's gonna get ya!|`|65637be5b6e62fe9ddf9ceed6a13d85daa	SURPRISE, SUR[RISE, SUR[RISE!

Once he hits you, if he does (and it wasn't in the groin and didn't become unable to defend yourself), then you have the right to defend yourself and you may not get in trouble. Then again... my principal was a pussy and if a kid defended himself, in any case, he usually went with the more popular student and usually got the victim in trouble, because he liked the taste of popular kids balls.   Basically, I can list the immediate options. First, make sure you don't throw the first punch (this is not an option). Now, you can either protect and defend yourself, or you can just let the kid beat you up and (hopefully, in theory) you wouldn't suffer any consequences.   So, fight and perhaps get in trouble; you will also not be bullied by everyone else for being a wimp. Or, you can just let him hurt you and you will probably not get in any trouble; you will be bullied to the fullest extent of your classmates.  Note, you can also report this to an authority figure and prevent the whole thing from happening and people may not find out about this. On the other hand, if you do decide to confront him, look into getting yourself a "cup". And seriously, do not throw the first punch. You can get in a lot of trouble. It is great because you can use it against him when talking to the principal or whomever: "I was just protecting myself, he threw the first punch!" Etc., Etc.|`|qlcY8aKFaa	I found this under donkey punch.  Is this what your talking about.    Just deal with it.  It can't be that bad.

cfdcea076742739e75b363443aad92a9aa	There's a difference between discipline and taking your frustrations out on someone.      Gilbert lost his temper and took it out on Arnie.  Not only because of Arnie, but all the responsibilities he had taking care of his entire family.  Arnie was mentally/physically handicap.|`|AwBVoWOaaa	Well, you have to look it from 2 perspectives really.    Arnie is mentally disabled, he won't understand no matter what.    I wanted to give a better answer like the 2 users above me, but there's nothing more to say.     Great question though.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	I HATED that beating scene in the bathroom! I understand WHY it happened. As the first responder said, Gilbert was under tremendous pressure to fill the shoes of his absent father, and frustration finally got the better of him. However, I have worked in the mental health field for many years and unbeknown to Gilbert at the time, his violent attack upon Arnie would ultimately be in vain and regrettable.   Have you ever heard the old saying that you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar? Well, the same holds true for someone like Arnie. Arnie was obviously a relatively-high functioning child with moderate learning disabilities. By relatively-high functioning, I mean that he could communicate his needs by talking, he could walk, feed himself, toilet himself, follow simple one and two-step directions, etc. Here's the BIG problem: Starting at a very young age, when Arnie misbehaved, he should NOT have been hit. Rather, he should have been given "time-out" and ignored, i.e., not even given 1 to 1 eye-contact until he STOPPED the misbehavior (the anti-social, unacceptable behavior). Then, and only then, would he have received a positive reward, i.e., return of one's full attention (including eye-contact), lots of praise, occasionally food (like M&Ms), redirection to a new and fun activity, etc. Arnie's episodes of acting out for attention would have diminished over time--IF this tried and proven technique of behavior modification had been used.    Furthermore, Gilbert, as well as the other members of his family, would have found that Arnie's anti-social behavior could have been curbed WITHOUT ever hitting him! And when Arnie slapped Gilbert back, he may have meant no malice and was merely imitating Gilbert's earlier behavior.

PnoVaJ28aa	I think they are going to end it! as much as i hate her, i am gonna miss her show! :'(|`|5BlWxijkaa	its called hannah montana the movie i dont think so but mabie but then i would get really sad|`|pqOLekE7aa	I saw it...I def. think it is a very strong possibility that they are going to end it. Only thing i wonder is, that if they are making so much money and i am assuming that miley cyrus is...why would they want to end it?|`|eNzOnSxNaa	well honestly i think it depends on what she chooses to live   i think if she stops being hannah it will stop because theres no point in going on   but if she wants to be hannah they could keep going because they might show her leaving school or something, maybe get rid of the wig and dying her hair, and how she'll be with her friends, etc.  but i doubt that will happen though, because it doesnt seem realistic i guess you could say...|`|BC9nPXG7aa	sadly yes...|`|6pUFu5qxaa	Hannah montanna the movie.  the show will keep gowing, its just for moneyy|`|m2vBJaHKaa	no and who cares her movies are crappy anyways LOL

hEx2hBTCaa	I Like Nickelback alot  but the new cd wasnt that good. best songs on it were Just 2 get high and Burn it 2 the ground|`|TwFlxckRaa	Because they are boring and common and utterly predictable.  Because they sound like every other crappy main stream band on the radio.    Cheers,    Christina  http://www.myspace.com/mikepattonisgod|`|Yy5F0Py0aa	they are a good band,  they have good songs,  and chad kroeger has a unique voice,  i don't understand people.|`|sb3PV5seaa	^^ as above.  Completely mediocre, untalented, and just plain old bish =\|`|s90jW3rwaa	Well, Chad's voice is really annoying, kind of scruffy but so not in a cool way and their sound is very very generic and kinda lame.|`|1vCoaf08aa	I answer this so many times, I'm getting sick of it.    So, I'll sum it up.    Generic, corporate, mediocre annoyances|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	first i need to know why people like them.|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	meaningless lyrics  putrid music|`|UnsZKr4saa	Boring and unoriginal Post-Grunge.  Annoying singer, mediocre instrumentalists...|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Lots of their songs sound too similar to each other and there is not a variance in their sound from album to album like there is in 90% of other bands.|`|f9yE6qAuaa	Hahhaahhah  yea what other person said.   Mainstream, genetic  and bluh! But I was diggin this song the other day on the radio and it actually was one of there songs. I laughed to myself cause   I would make fun of this group all the time. LOL|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Not everybody does. I enjoy a few of their songs.|`|Y5XRdMlfaa	Coz they're crap|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Ever heard a goat dying?|`|t7U9rliVaa	Hate is a strong word...|`|DbtS5jzEaa	pop rock, tiger man       ROARRRRRRR|`|4ObhfxoIaa	Because they suck.|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	i dont know why they are aLL very nice guys|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Haven't you listened to them?  Cause you would know why.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Mainstream, generic, bulsh it|`|hOIWPsoxaa	You don't really need an answer to that. Just have to listen to them.|`|sEUnAmv6aa	i like a few of their songs|`|dEy5nIqNaa	I have heard a goat dieing.|`|DZ5b77Lfaa	They don't think about their lyrics. They are very trivial.|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	Listen to the lyrics. The new songs are all about sex. It's one thing if a band is able to make songs about it with some form of subtlety, but Nickelback doesn't even try.    Introducing the new singles:    Please Take A Dump on My Chest  and  Please Pee On Me In The Shower.|`|8cDd70dSaa	Because all of their songs sound the same and they're all crap.|`|5etFAmrsaa	Their early stuff was good, but their new stuff sucks!|`|CEENX0sDaa	they seem like rednecks|`|RKMWeMk9aa	They're basically Creed Jr.|`|EpOU7vGYaa	the singer made my baby sister cry  not jking   i h8 nickelback. but some losers do|`|jEHLz8fraa	Too easy to listen to (for hard rock & heavy metal fans). I enjoy some of their songs though|`|qAfnWKQCaa	They are boring. Not hard, abrasive or fun.

GbN8eek9aa	They probably sell putty that is safe for mouths in acting or coustume stores  Good luck :)|`|30RlXHX3aa	I'll give you the link, there is a video on youtube of how to make these vampire teeth and you make a mold of your canine teeth but I would say just make the mold of all of your teeth.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZvSgEA48...
tHEBPDenaa	I love the show. The kids are so cute. Obviously they're only doing it for the money... why else would you broadcast your life? But think of the quality of life their kids are having now because of the show... They have a big, beautiful house, they get to go on great vacations, and they'll probably all be able to pay for college or university when the time comes... If they didn't have the show, those kids probably wouldn't even know what a vacation is. Yes, there are drawbacks to having your life broadcasted on tv but I think that the experiences and opportunities for the children far outweigh the negative aspects.|`|FbZcM1nlaa	I think it's a good show. The kids are adorable, except that Maddie girl, she's a brat. But I also think they're  in it for the money and Kate can be bitchy. But hey, if I had 8 kids, I would get stressed. And as far as the money thing goes, she has 8 kids, it's not like she blows it on a day at the spa or something.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Sure we would lose it if we had that many kids, but Kate gets more help than they let on.  They have a cleaning lady, somebody who does the wash & fold the clothes, what could she be doing that she;s losing her mind?  When you see he out wit the kids in the front she is always yelling at Jon to do whatever with the kids.  She is always in the chair or standing hold her coffee barking out orders.  Of course she is exploiting the whole family for money and nice things, nice trips, but I would do the same thing.  I would also have somebody doing my laundry & cleaning my house!      I don't know about the Aunt Jodie thing though, but why couldn't she get paid, it's not hurting anyone.      The fame wont last forever!|`|yhO62JALaa	Aunt Jodi has her own life with her kids and she didn't want to exploit her children to the hectic scenes that you see on the show.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	they are in it clearly for the money, who wouldn't be.|`|bMHlZlC6aa	Personally I think the show is great. I watch almost every episode and I just love them! Their kids are soooo cute! Yeah maybe they are making money off their kids but its not really just their kids its their entire life. From the show it doesnt look like cameras affect them in a negative way as much as it is positive. They arent shy around the camera so they could be movie stars when they grow up if they wanted to be. I would say they are very very lucky. :D|`|8cDd70dSaa	I love it. It's one of my favorite shows. I don't question their motives or whatever. I just really like the show.|`|16BAkagYaa	Its an interesting show, but it has some flaws. Personally i think the mom is a *****, but she does hold 8 kids together constantly. The parents are endorsed highly! Anywhere from gap to disneyland they are constantly getting free stuff, i dont think its a bad thing since they have 8 kids to put through college!|`|bb3cf58d0a41e036a4683f2d46088ebfaa	the network wanted to pay aunt jodi because she was on the show so much and kate said no way, so they just stopped showing her (apparently, that's according to my mom who got me into watching the show) i think jon can't stand her, she's so mean to him, but if he wants to stay that's his business. :) all in all, cute kids, alright show. :)|`|AA11404443	I love the show and never miss an episode. I think they do a great job with the kids.  I love the fact that she makes them nutritious organic meals and not feeding them lots of junk food.So what if they get money from the show, that's the kids college fund. If i were in their shoes and was offered a show i would do it to if it meant that my kids could go to college and do thing like go on vacations and travel.

I love how they were trying to capture Sylar, but Sylar was like "B*tch Please" and just destroyed them all.|`|C2GKvY4eaa	I dislike cliffhangers, and I guess they're also trying to allude to Hitler with Nathan of some sort, lol. Yes. It was great other than the cliff hanger.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	i laughed.  this show went so far downhill after season 1.  season 1 was soooo good.  i hope they can bring it back up.  there's a lot of potential.  they just need to bring in better actors and writers.|`|owko7Jczaa	I wish it wouldn't have ended like it did. Other then that i think it was a good episode, it wasn't the best they've ever had but it wasn't bad either.

d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	Compatibility is based on two things in astrology. Number one--each person's individual charts and how well this chart shows they get along with the majority of people.    Second thing it's based on, but that's not as important, is the composite chart. Good comp there will make you sorts want to be with someone even if they have a lot of inner issues (shown by natal chart), however, you will most likely be way happier with someone who is not compatible with you but has a harmonious natal chart than someone who u r compatible with but has a conflicted natal chart.    Also there are some people who will not even interest you at all, no matter how easily they get on with others. This happensvwhen you very few aspects in synastry with them. It is better to have positive aspects in synastry but imharmonious ones are definitely better than nothing. Synastry is what you feel about a person before you have really gotten to know them, the composite chart shows how two people feel once they have gotten to know each other well.|`|agTCqkLDaa	For my boyfriend and me, I'd have to say it's definitely our sun signs; however, I'm pretty sure your love sign has a lot to do with it too :)|`|izX7ymibaa	You really need to look at all three. The best indicators for love compatibility are harmonious Sun/Moon aspects, and Sun/Ascendant aspects, and Moon/Moon aspects. Harmonious aspects are water/water, water/earth, fire/air, air/air.|`|7KrXBpkpaa	it is based on the element's relationships.

B24W8w43aa	Anorexia. It wasn't intentional.|`|edzU8VJiaa	The grapefruit diet.  You eat 1/2 a grapefruit before every meal.  I lost over 2 stone the first time I tried it (but I was VERY dedicated).  I am just over 5' and went from over 10 stone to under 8 stone within 5 months.    The grapefruit helps to fill you up so you don't feel hungry after eating the rest of your (small) meal and there is also some digestive mechanism  which grapefruit has an effect on (look it up on the internet - this diet has been researched and found effective; but it HAS to be fresh grapefruit).    Eat little carbohydrate (potatoes, cereal, rice, pasta, bread) but LOADS of salad/vegetables/fruit.    Exercise every day (you can do calisthenics indoors) and keep lots of carrot sticks, celery, fruit, nuts, seeds, low-fat yogurt etc. for snacking.    You have to be careful, though, because grapefruit can interfere with some medication - so if you are taking any, check with your doctor before doing this diet.|`|AA10977006	Weight Watchers.

Hate is a very strong word that is tossed around to much.|`|iiThYzRpaa	she along with the other "fake pop" kids, put disrespect to the true artists..the ones that make you feel emotions from music.|`|KxeuOuLLaa	Just another kid born into the spotlight.    Stop obsessing over her.    You may not be directly thinking it, but at the back of your mind you are actually jealous of the fame Miley has achieved in such a short period of time, even if her music is terrible.|`|5BlWxijkaa	muah|`|KTj9g2mGaa	me!!!!!!!  she is so concieted and cant sing for crap.  americas in love with a soon to be porn star!  gahhhhhhhhhh!
0IKwusdgaa	if he is a good cap - he is testing you to see if you really like him  if he is a bad cap - he is definetely a time-waster and nobody's worth and nothing to do with his sign or anyones, bad thing for you, you cant read his mind if hes good or not :P     One thing for sure, he did or is or will think about you in some point and will think about what he should do or if you really like him and even more if he likes you - but is good at not showing that..    Caps are confusing to people but to them, people are like a test because they have trust issues even if ure with them for years cos they want 'security' which may look like possesiveness.They dont want to waste thier time being with someone who will reject them. But whatever the sign - theres good and bad so you never know....like i said about cap, im a cap and i have trust issues so i never label anyone as trustworthy or not - exept my mum.|`|Pew3CdCjaa	hmm... this is cap...  I think you are too serious about how he say stuff like that...  I am cap lady...for me, virgo is too much into analysing people why???    sorry...we didn't mean to confuse people but we do in a big time.  Maybe he didn't think that serious. I think he just joke about it.  In relationship, capricorn is very secretive and very serious. you have no idea.. I think if he say like that then he is really joking...  I do joke alot as a friend but if I see someone or serious about someone then, capricorn don't joke about like that though.    so i think you just read too much into what he said.. I think he can't remember what he said serious next day... also when capricorn is busy then, you don't talk that much for sure!|`|elVDYy7eaa	Damn right you are.|`|jAkTbmswaa	You know Capricorns are very odd in my opinion xD    I liked this Capricorn male for awhile, and I was sure that he liked me as well. Boy was I wrong! I still don't know what he was thinking D: One minute he was over here the next he was over there. (must have had cancer in his birth chart somewhere) Ah such mind games! And such a womanizer as well :/ Though it doesn't always have to do with the sun signs. The moon and ascendants are also very involved in personality and behavior. All I can say is that if you're really interested in him just be upfront and serious about it; ask him how he feels. If he told you you would have to wait in line, however, he's still wanting to play the field and he's not worth your time.      A kooky Aquarius|`|CEEQDSCFaa	you didnt do anything wrong, hes not annoyed but he needs to get his **** sorted out, capricorns plan their whole lives ahead of them the day they were born, he just doesnt want to screw it up|`|3WItFAwlaa	He told you to wait in line??  WTF??   You need to decide if that is acceptable or if you you have one ounce of self respect.  You should be mad at him not the other way around.  Please try to grow a backbone.  Nobody deserves to be treated like he is treating you.   Walk away.  Now!|`|HZxX9ke8aa	he is probably trying to be nice and humbly rejecting you. take the hint before getting embarassed or something. and if he is serious about "keeping his options open" go figure how it could be, living a romance with him if it's any possible.|`|IRQvzk5saa	Thats foul....who says that?  Cap or not....he sounds like he needs to get his head out of his @$$.      This is nothing to do with him being cap, just forget him.      He knows he wouldnt have liked it if a girl that he liked told him that, but he "thinks" he's the ish....that was retarded what he said.  Cut him off
jdVxsK4yaa	it makes me mad 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	It's whatever. There are more important things to worry about.
4Ct2FpjOaa	He was just caught at a bad moment.  People need to lay off.  It's not like every other normal person doesn't make mistakes.   He won gold medals. And he is one hell of a swimmer. But that doesn't mean he is perfect.|`|k39bNUgeaa	Who cares    You people are making a big deal about this    it isn't bad|`|kHY0eMVraa	Its funny :)  I seriously don't think anything is wrong with it.  Most people smoke weed these days anyway...|`|M0598bvzaa	it doesnt bother me|`|l69tjl0paa	Go Michael Phelps!|`|0oBLUIGfaa	He can do what he does.  It's not like it'll affect him the way Vanessa had her problem with those photos, right?  I guess it doesn't look nice. But he's already apologized and the world won't fall apart. People aren't going to stop with the endorsements just because of this news.  He's too good of an investment (in my opinion).|`|9a3fC9mOaa	It's normal, smoking pot is A LOT less harmful than drinking, smoking cigarettes, and a lot of other legal things|`|UsojaTuuaa	i think its ridiculous that people think its a big deal.  wake up everyone-people smoke pot. leave him alone. he must work so hard to be able to do what he does and probably gives up so many things to be in the best shape for the olympics. i think he deserves a little pot|`|WxnVn9Staa	idk thats his bussiness|`|YPrU7uSfaa	I was laughing for 20 minutes when I heard that.  I knew he wasn't that great...

7HBTvg8Caa	I think you could. Stores will probably be stocking up on that DVD in anticipation for it to sell like crazy. However, if you're a big fan of it and would be devastated if you didn't a get copy right away I'd preorder it to secure your chance.|`|AA11008280	If you are a HUGE fan, than you MUST!!    But really you cen go buy it at wal-mart. The company already knows its a huge hit so they are going to have plenty in stock.|`|SFZq3ullaa	it will probably sell out, its really popular  be safe   pre order    i always do with stuff thats uber important to me.. that way it shows up on my door step the day it would come out in stores and i dont have to wait in lines... or be disappointed if it sells out...|`|b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	Pre-order it if you're worried about it selling out.  Also, pre-order on Amazon instead.|`|VwccuEFHaa	lol at the post saying your not a fan if you dont preorder the dvd!!!    dvd's are dirt cheap, your paying for the money and work that went into making the movie.  They pump out dvd's like freaking crazy.  You will have absolutely no problem walking into walmart and getting a copy, every release of a blockbuster has plenty of copies (usually scattered all over the store).  Even the dark knight (biggest movie in years, and right before christmas) had waaaay more copies than they knew what to do with.  Pre-orders are a thing of the past.
gJhwH335aa	If you want more elements for logia fruit, you can separate them into categories like Oda did.    - Sand is derived from Earth elements.  - Darkness, and Light are derived from Space/Aether elements.  - Ice is derived from Water elements.  - Smoke and wind / weather is derived from Air elements.    There's a lot of new element you can exploit if you separate them into several categories instead of giving all the ability to one single elements. Here's some example I can think of    Earth can be categorized as Nature elements. With Nature, you can separated them into organic elements and organic elements can be separated into chemical elements.     Chemical elements can be put into Air categories. With chemical elements, you can give the user an ability to manipulate the density of gasses in the air. For example    - Carbon dioxide can cause dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness.  - Methane can form an explosive mixtures with air    Also, by having gasses as part of the logia type, you can also separate them into highly toxic gas or non toxic gas. Much like Zoan type that has been separated into carnivore Zoan, omnivore Zoan and herbivore Zoan according to Chopper. The separation can determined which type are more dangerous than the others.    You can also explored Nature elements by creating and put them into Plants categories. There's variety of plant species you can choose from. Some plants has the ability to reproduction or regeneration. Some have the ability of adaptation which is the ability to change over a period of time in response to the environment. Plants also possessed the ability called Rapid plant movement. To make it more interesting, there's a few plants that categorized as carnivore like for example, the Venus flytrap.    There is no limit for creativity especially if you do a little research about a particular and specific subjects. Those example I gave you is based on the actual fact. All you need is adding a little twist of creativity into it and convert the basic structure of fact into a fiction. I'm sure Oda can pull it off because there's a reason why his fans called him a genius. ^__^|`|io4WrL0qaa	I think there should be more, but it really depends on the author...  Air/ Wind  weather should count|`|3N2ElzcQaa	You can't use water since its a weakness (in one of the OP movies, a woman had a woman devil's fruit, but it doesn't count).    I'm betting there's more Logia fruit. It depends on Oda.    Would weather count. Because that's what Luffy's dad has.

Shark Boy and Lava Girl was a huge disappointment after seeing Spy Kids. Also, I despise Disney sequels. They just had to make a Jungle Book 2!

99VD0Tv3aa	Behringer?! That's crap, I'ved owned two and they both are weak and wear out quick. If you want a great amp (and yes the amp does matter) spend the extra and go for a Line6.

There's a link for you.|`|dWj3SnrSaa	well the amp doesn't so much matter, I'd recommend getting very high wattage, and I find Behringer to have the best, probably pick one with a gain channel and maybe get yourself a boss distortion pedal

It's mainly a romantic/comedy, but the plot is amazing :D   You can watch it here in HQ, english dub and with none of those strange advertisements here: http://www.jetwavetv.co.cc/VideoList/Our...    The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is HIGHLY recommended.   You can watch them on youtube in REALLY high quality in english dub over here:    http://ca.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=7...    Lucky Star is a great anime to :D And I recommend to all the anime fans out there, you can watch it in english dub here:   http://ca.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A...|`|d2bdUWCSaa	Bleach, Inuyasha, Ouran Highschool host club, Hellsing. Try reading manga as well there is a wider selection of them.|`|1lkxpqAIaa	Fushigi yuugi  inuyasha  escaflowne  fruits basket|`|gE89xUCfaa	If you enjoy a blend of action and romance, I can think of no better anime for you than Inuyasha, as it has both. The story revolves around a half-demon named Inuyasha from the feudal era of Japan, who meets a girl named Kagome from the present day through a magical well which transports her back in time 500 years.    The anime series lasts 167 episodes, has an engaging storyline, interesting characters, fights which are long enough to be epic but short enough not to fall prey to 'Dragonball Syndrome' (in which fights can last for 5+ episodes).     The animation is great quality, and the show features many well-designed characters, Sesshomaru being a personal favourite.    On the downside, the anime doesn't complete the story - the budget ran out at 167, and for the rest, you must read the manga.     Other animes you might like:  Yu Yu Hakusho (old, focuses more on action, but very good characters)    Bleach (again focuses more on action, but it does that extremely well)    I would recommend One Piece, but the dub was done by 4Kids. The subtitled version is infinitely better.    Have fun ^_^    You may like to look at this site for more anime: http://www.themanime.org/reviewlist.php

If your work involves handling money or caring for vulnerable people, how can you be trusted in your job if you tell lies to get time off so you can indulge yourself?    Maybe you don't have a 'position of responsibility' yet, but this is the time to start practicing the integrity you will need when you are trusted with more. Bernard Madoff's crimes probably began a long time before his ponzi scheme became famous.    Of course, if you're in a place like England where massive snow dumps have closed just about everything, then going skiing might be the best way to make the most of a bad situation.

It ended with Pete being an idiot and crashing the plane which should kill everyone but will undoubtedly leave all the major characters in tact. Also, no one knows how Sylar survived. And no one wants another storyline about Sylar's issues with his parents.     Also, Pete and Matt both changed their powers.

They are using there texting language in SCHOOL... WTF.... yeah it is always a time and place for everything... And I do not think that SCHOOL Is one of them not even when you are TYPING like on Answers... hell talk in complete sentences and spell your words RIGHT hell you ONLY HAVE A SPELL CHECK NEXT TO IT...|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I agree. It's hella annoying to see people type like that sometimes....I'm glad that I don't know anyone that types like "lyk" that on IM at all. It's embarrassing.    But mostly on Yahoo Answers, I hate certain questions like:    What's your favorite song or What's your most embarrassing moment?    The first question is kinda hard to answer because there are too many songs that I love. The second question just gets asked way too much and I don't really have too many to share so I just skip them altogether. But I swear, I see these questions, almost EVERY DAY....x_X|`|raUjKchLaa	A bunch of future lawyers, they are not.

"Falling in Love" - DeNiro and Streep.  Brilliant.    Maid of Honor is cute too as a current romantic comedy and a quick fix.    Anne of Green Gables entire series, it takes awhile to get the comedy, it's a tease with other wonderful performances inbetween.    If you are not watching the PBS version of Pride and Prejudice, that, in my opinion is the only one of any true merit.  Maybe because I saw this 6 or so hour brilliant portrayal of the book before I saw the other recent 2 hour flick.  If you haven't seen it (Darcy is played by the Brunette love interest in Bridgettes Diaries).  My husband and I share few viewing interests, but we always like to watch it, and we've watched it at least 40 times over the years.

But your pitch during the shouting parts was good. =) You were on tune. Just work on your control when your voice gets soft and breathy--your pitch was off a few times, and your trills/runs/whatever they're called sounded a little bit off during the soft parts, too (mainly the Ohh Ohh Ohh part in Genie in a Bottle).

0GhkcU65aa	When you're screaming, you don't have to be too loud, that's what the mic is for.     When you're doing it, try out screaming some vowels but don't concentrate on listening to yourself while doing it, it can make you get the wrong technique.     To get the sound right, just as with singing, keep your back straight.     Unlike singing, do NOT scream from your gut, it damages your vocals.     Remember to drink water a lot while going at it.    Don't practice for longer than 30 minutes. The guys who do that in bands have had a lot of practice to go at it.    Smoking gives you a raspy voice, but doesn't help you scream, so don't smoke (too much) if you want to get it better.    Record your voice and play it back to see the problems and the good points.    Get a mic, turn it up and see how that goes. You might need a little distortion to get the right sound you want.    If you're trying to sound like a certain screamer you know, listen to their tracks carefully and try to emulate it. If not, scream in your own vocal style.    Do NOT inward scream (that is, sucking in air slowly with your airways almost closed to make the sound), damages your vocal cords.    Finally, good luck, you'll get it eventually with practice :)|`|18K7ucsEaa	I'm still experimenting with screaming too. I wanna learn how, but I've heard that it's pretty easy to damage/rupture your vocal chords if you do it too long the wrong way, so I'm kinda weary about it... anyways here's a guy's lesson that he explains how he does it pretty well and it helped me out a bit:    http://profile.ultimate-guitar.com/z4twe...    hope it helps!~

1FBpObhpaa	Astrology is a standard for your relationships?  Personality, how you are treated, friends, initiative, financial stability, and past relationships are much more important.|`|vPlTBQ7kaa	Ya. 4 the beginning!|`|XfjoDHo2aa	With Aries, you deal in practical, concrete matters. Aries is a great teammate when combined with you in real estate and property matters. Aries touches the part of your solar horoscope that is connected with your home and with projects, which affect your future security. Aries opens up to you ... talks to you ... but you can count on Aries in the future rather than immediately. That is, if you are seeking long-range results, Aries is your person. But not so if you are seeking the immediate, if you are looking for quick or flash results|`|fldXZ1BMaa	In my experience - No it doesn't work and they are not a good match... trust me i loved my Aries ex so much i wanted to spend my whole life with him and in the beginning everything was perfect but in the end we were just too different.. He always thought he was right about everything and he used to always avoid sorting anything out and it used to frustrate me BIG TIME he was very laid back but he never used to understand that unless we talked things through and sorted things out i didn't feel right and to me i felt like we was avoiding things and things just got worse because he never ever listened.  Aries men are very laid back and they aren't always too serious unlike us caps my boss is also an Aries and i am with him every day in a office and after a while we started to clash too and i wanted to leave my job.    Capricorns girls and Aries men is complete disaster they are just too different in the end.    Sorry to be so blunt ..

LddkW0JFaa	She's stuck up. She does what she wants and she won't listen to anyone when they try to advise her. For example, she hangs out with the husband of the lady who wants to adopt her kid and she doesn't understand how that might look bad.  She feigns na?vit by acting and talking silly all the time.|`|zNPGaZRHaa	****, funny, annoying|`|wz3S190haa	shes random, almost everything that comes out of her mouth is random, shes funny,that goes along with the randomness...she kinda reminds me of myslef...im not prego though but im random and i play guitar|`|YG4lsPTDaa	her eggo is preggo|`|6hk1R7Aqaa	She is outgoing, but shy in a way.

She's wise beyond her years in many ways, yet at the same time, she's a bit naive in some situations (as evidenced in her relationship with Mark).

7b785af8d1983d840827831f0028c949aa	Personality: As long as she's not a complete... B-I-T-You get the point. If she's funny and more outgoing, all the better.    Hair color: No preference.    Height: Preferably around my height. A little bit taller or shorter is fine. But I'm Asian, so 5'5" or an inch within that is cool. Taller or shorter than that, it's fine as long as her personality is what I described.    Weight: She'll definitely weigh more than I do. I'm like.. 95 lbs. I'm quite underweight. And no, I don't have an eating disorder. But anyway, I don't mind curves. I don't mind average, but I do mind anorexic skinny. If she weighs less than I do, I'll make her eat. Damn, if she weighs less than 110, I'll make her put on some weight. I'm not even asking for 20 lbs. Just 110 or 120 is my minimum. I'm not looking to date a stick, y'know?    Eye color: No preference.    Ethnicity: No preference. Though I'm not trying to be picky or racist, but dark African Americans just aren't my type. But again, who knows? I may end up dating one. I'll see what the future holds.|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	looks like Megan Fox.  acts like Hilary Duff.  kinky like Angelina Jolie.  smells like Doritos.  plays football like the Steelers.  curvy like pasta al dente.  eyes like emeralds.  tall like Yao Ming.

"I love that show".
KifasiMraa	Do you remember any key phrases?  I know a lot of country songs, but this description is so vague...      ...is it "Corner of my life by Bill Anderson?  ...I'm not looking for a sweetheart just a gentle  lady friend Someone I can softly turn to when I  need to now and then When my head gets kinda  tangled and my soul is layin' bare I reach over in  the corner of my life and I find you waiting there  You're a number I can phone you're a letter I can  write You're my water when I'm thirsty in the  middle of the night You're a warm and tender body  you're a woman not a wife And just knowing you has  brightened the corner of my life [ac.guitar]  There's a special kind of feeling when we're  simply touching hands There's a special kind of  comfort knowing someone understands I'm no knight  in shining armor I'll never carry you away But  you're filling up the corner of my life in the  nicest kind of way You're a number I can phone...  I can count the way you've brightened all the  corners of my life hmm hmm    ... or it might be I CAN'T BE YOUR FRIEND ANYMORE  Recorded by TIM RUSHLOW in 2003    This might come as quite a shock  But I've given it a lot of thought  This thing that's come between us can't be ignored  I've taken all I can  And this is where it's gotta end  'Cause I can't be your friend anymore    And I can't be accused  Of not being there for you  How many times have you shown up at my door?  I hope you understand  That this wasn't in my plans  But I can't be your friend anymore    And it's killing me to know you  Without having a chance to hold you  And all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside  You can run to me, you can laugh at me  Or you can walk right out that door  But I can't be your friend anymore    So baby, now it's up to you  Do I win or do I lose  Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor  Well take me as I am  'Cause I wanna be your man  But I can't be your friend anymore    And it's killing me to know you  Without having a chance to hold you  Yeah all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside  You can run to me, you can laugh at me  Or you can walk right out that door  But I can't be your friend anymore  We can't just be friends anymore|`|wnbz5gNzaa	Call a country station and ask...Sorry, I don't know that one.

Lnw6ZYMoaa	You should probably talk to your bus driver first and ask why she's so rude to you. I know it doesn't say it on the little ten rules thing, but you actually aren't supposed to have Ipods or cellphones on buses because you're still technically "on school property", bogus I know!   If she doesn't give you a good explanation, then I would report her.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Be honest with yourself, are you two being loud and trouble makers on the bus?      I know when I was younger and rode a bus, the kids that caused trouble had to sit up front so the bus driver could keep an eye on them.      You could turn her in, but I doubt they will do anything about it, as they will agree with the bus driver and take the bus drivers word over yours.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	look just let it go and move on !  you have to remember she has to do this everyday and she is  responsible for all of the kids on that bus! and that bus is hard to drive when you are being disruptive!|`|LpedVLedaa	I would, quite honestly.  Some adults are bullies to those underage because they are insecure inside.  Don't take crap from anyone, you are better than that.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	You can try.  I don't know if they'd help you or not.  But at least, maybe they could get her to explain her reasons.|`|nQZEJz5yaa	wow.. yeah u should|`|qMeKso0Paa	i would talk to the bus driver first then rat her out.

For example, int he cell phone situation, you should have calmly informed her that there are no rules restricting the use of cell phones on the bus. If she insisted or threatened to tell on you, all you would have needed to do was stay calm (don't give her excuses to report you!) and stick by what the rules say and what they don't. Do not let her intimidate you any more.     If she continues to abuse you or threatens to tell on you for "disregarding her authority", then by all means go to the office and talk to them.

KBBonf97aa	I did a lot of research before deciding on the Digidesign M-Box Mini, which comes with the current version of Pro Tools.  My computer runs Vista, which isn't yet supported by Digidesign, but I checked all the musicians' message boards online and found out people were able to run Pro Tools in Vista without any major issues.    Musician's Friend has customer reviews that are really helpful in deciding which interface and software are best for you.  I was going to use a PreSonus interface that came with Cubase software, but Cubase won't run on Vista.  My brother, who owns a recording studio, talked me into going with the M-Box Mini because it comes with ProTools.  He says it's just a good idea to use ProTools software because it's considered the industry standard.  With my home setup, I'm able to record things to my external hard drive and then send them to him for mastering, since the systems are completely compatible.    If I were you, I'd spend some time tooling around musiciansfriend.com and looking at the recording packages available.  I got my M-Box Mini from an online seller for $275 (Musician's Friend has it for less than $300).  If you want monitors and microphones, there are a lot of bundled packages available for a few hundred dollars, as well.  Once you look around at what's available you'll be able to narrow down your choices to suit your needs.  But I think my brother is right about going with ProTools if possible.  I've known a few bands who've switched from Garage Band and Cakewalk to ProTools, since the latter is the only one used in professional studios.  And it's still very user friendly.  Good luck!|`|hOIWPsoxaa	I personally swear by Steinberg's Cubase and M-Audio products.    I would recommend looking into software, audio interface, midi keyboard and monitors. Your requirements would dictate the total price.    Do the research because there are a few companies out there who do starter packages for home recording. It will be worth it.    I am currently thinking of getting a personal loan just so I can upgrade my home studio! Ha ha! I'm talking thousands though!|`|a316d640be92cd32172dd30962544623aa	Since you said software, I would assume you will be using a computer, PC perhaps. I would recommend the presonus 8 track if you would ever record a drum set. If not, then any interface would do for a one or two mic set. For software go with Cubase or Logic. Logic if you don't plan a big project (easier to use and about the same quality).

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Paper Boy (1994)  aka The Paperboy  IMDb review: **SPOILERS**  The plot involves sadistically evil paperboy Johnny McFarlane (Marc Marut), who just wants to be loved. He kills his elderly next door neighbor because he likes her daughter, Melissa (Alexandra Paul), and just happens to need a new mother. He knows that she will have to come to her mother's house for the funeral. Melissa does return, bringing along her daughter, the bubbly young Cammie (Brigid Tierney). The paperboy proceeds to worm his way into their lives with hilarious results, but he soon wears out his welcome. Meanwhile, Melissa and Cammie are getting acquainted with a handsome newcomer (William Katt). Johnny continues to kill various people in the neighborhood, including his own father and Cammie's babysitter.  Also in the cast are Krista Errickson, Frances Bay and Barry Flatman.|`|pqOLekE7aa	Do you recognize any of the actors or actresses in it? If you do you can always go to IMDB.com and look at the list of films that the certain person is in. I don't know if that helps at all. if you say one of the actors i could look it up.

KYdg8tpUaa	I think they are hilarious..and i don't see a problem with her OCD..if she didnt have schedules and everything mapped out to a "T" the house would be complete chaos with kids running wild with no structure..there is nothing wrong with her keeping her house as clean as possible, if she didn't it would be a total wreck! I say God Bless her she is a wonderful wife and mother and those kiddos absolutely adore her, that will in no way effect them in a negative way..i think it will be a positive factor and give them great skills in the future, they are disciplined,structured,respectful..and as for Jon i he loves her even when shes being too controlling, i think she is just so used to having to keep the kids in order, she forgets to let that down when it comes to jon, but he understands and you can tell he just blows it off..they love each other to death and that you can see..they are adorable! The Duggars on the other hand, it seems like they are TOO CALM, like one day one of them is gonna snap..lol..|`|6vOQydWAaa	She's only like that for her children. she's doing what's best for them in a way.

lw1lrsstaa	yes they are, but pisces is ruled with both jupiter and neptune  though the two signs do not compete with each other, theyre said to be the most friendly signs  im for sure they get along because im a sagittarius and i get along with pisces fine, never been against one  also theyre both mutable, meaning they can adapt to change which makes it even easier for them to get along|`|8tFJa6LMaa	Before Neptune was discovered...Sagi and Pisces are both ruled bu Jupiter but positively and negatively. Scorpio and Aries have deep rooted jealousy and mistrust for eachother and the other Venus pair Taurus eventually is cheated by Libra as Virgo by Gemini but Virgos leave a deep dent in Gemini|`|2IddNqy9aa	im pisces sun & i dont know the answer to that astrology is confusing    Circa Survive is the best band EVER!!!!!!!!!!|`|izX7ymibaa	nope. Pisces is ruled by Neptune, and Sag by Jupiter. The two are not related at all, and in fact, aren't harmonic with each other either.|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	Actually, Pisces is ruled by both Neptune and Jupiter. A really good astrology website would be able to tell you this as well as an astrologer. But, I don't think this connects Sagittarius and Pisces in a big way, but this is only my opinion and I may be wrong. I'm a Sagittarius and I don't feel connections to the Pisces that I know. I do get along with them very well, but then again I get along with almost every sign in the zodiac depending on the individual. Just remember that not all Scorpio's and Aries get along with each other. You have to take into account the person's natal chart because were far more than just our sun sign. Everything really does depend on the particular individual.
ZIq2IzOmaa	Hot Topic only has stores in the US.    However you can head to www.Hottopic.com for ordering online.     Or if there are major cities in your area, there are probably local stores that carry brands like Lip Service and other alternative clothes. Supporting local stores like this keeps your money in your area and your favorite fashions available nearby.     If you're looking for band shirts, there are plenty of music merchandise sites with an even wider selection than HT.     If you desperately want to give Hot Topic your money, you can also try www.shockhound.com which sells rock merchandise and music. The site mostly carries trendy new bands, but if that's what you're into its worth a looksee.

m4PtEEDNaa	...if you are talking about the old, clunky and broken down 'grindhouse' theaters, which were right smack in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, and played triple kung fu movies, or triple horror movies for only a couple of bucks, I regret to say, they are not there anymore.  Last year, around May, I attended a horror film convention at the Staples Center, and I had to walk a fair distance from the hotel to the convention center.  In walking through the seedier part of downtown L.A., from the hotel to the center, I had hoped to find at least a couple of my favorite 'grindhouse' theaters still open; I was dismayed to find that they are pretty much all closed down.  In fact, for the most part, they were hastenly/sloppily boarded up, and nothing had been done with the facilities.  They were mere decaying corpse-looking theaters, with broken marquees, and street bums sleeping beneath the marquee awnings.  I had to stop for a moment, in saddened nostalgic reverence, and think fondly back when there were about a dozen exploitative and broken down, albeit open-for-business theaters, all bundled together within a nine-block area, with the lights twinkling in the darkened and traffic-strewn streets...horns honking...sidewalk barkers yelling at passerbys...and the wildly exploitative marquee lettering on the boards....."Can You Stand the Terror??  Now Showing...."Maniac"..."The Toolbox Murders"...and..."Don't Go In the House"....Three Movies for Two Bucks!!!"...    ...sigh!!!  Oh how I miss those old theaters, with the cut-up seats...the urine stench of the auditorium....the food-and-drink stained screens...the stale, month-old popcorn...the sticky floors...the flat, warm soda...the moldy, moth-eaten drapery.....these were the only theaters where you could see the wildest movies ever made; you wouldn't see these crazy and over-the-top flicks at your local family-friendly AMC multi-plex.....No Sirree!!!|`|En0r0UQ3aa	Academy 6 Theatres.

ThKkn5fKaa	There is a relationship between mathematics and music.  After all, Pythagoras himself basically invented the study of acoustics when he realized that strings of different lengths would vibrate at different pitches when plucked.    But you're going to see very little if not zero algebra in music.  Music itself is very mathematical, but more in a geometric sense than an algebraic sense.    The quadratic formula is x = negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 a c, all divided by 2 a.  Simply put, it just can't really apply to music.    Music, particularly 20th century classical music has often been graphical in nature (composers would often create their own pictures or symbols in score in order to achieve a desired sound), although not specifically incorporating an actual graph.  Heck, a bunch of music has been written by using a system known as serialism which incorporates a 12 x 12 matrix of pitches.  Just no algebra here either though.    Props to you though for thinking outside of the box.  I'm sure most people would just apply your assignment to engineering or something.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	x equals negative b plus or minus radical b squared minus 4ac over 2 a.    ... have at it.     (I'm sure I've never done that.)|`|dpYMlxA4aa	If you really want to get into mathematical systems used in music composition I suggest reading Formalized Music by Iannis Xenakis. It has some very detailed explanations about various mathematical formulas and their application in music. it ranges from geometry to calculus.     Conlon Nancarrow was another composer who used a lot of math in his compositions. He would use a variety of formulas and transcribe them onto player piano roles, to do things like a fugue stretto displaced by pi or e.    As far as the quadratic equation specifically as a compositional device I wouldn't be surprised if a modern composer used it, but I don't know any pieces off the top of my head. If you take it indirectly there are many operations done in electronic music that use the quadratic equation, things like applying reverb, or a phase vocoder.|`|hOIWPsoxaa	I have seen graphical scores and other crazy stuff from composers such as Messiaen (who notated bird songs and had mild synthenasia!), but I have never heard of using quadratic equations.

NrtmgvPoaa	according to imdb.com it aires Mach 2009.  The secret society/gentleman's club was something that Bart was invloved in, and Elle took over another girls client list and mistakingly sent the invite to Mr Bass, not knowing Bart was dead, so it was given to chuck. Chuck went to the address and got stamped (must be like an entry pass or something) when Elle realised it was Chuck who was there and not Bart she drugged him and took him to a hotel so he wouldnt remember anything about it the next morning. Also, she didnt want anyone to know that she had let in an 'outsider', or someone that shouldnt have been their. So now Chuck wants to find out exactly what happens at these 'meetings' and why his father was involved.

aw2xkdSbaa	a Marshall JCM 800 (50 or 100 wt). this was the most common amp back then.|`|ZnJ2Y5cAaa	I have seen Guitarists i know get a Metallica sounding tone from Marshal amps but seriously go to Guitar Center and try em out they let u test the amps so find some good amps but Marshal is always good|`|crJTV0lmaa	I heard the Orange Tiny Terror gives off a FANTASTIC Kill Em All tone.  Its definitely worth trying.|`|Yv5RYcmvaa	The Rock man is the perfect amp, but I am not sure if they are easy to find.   Designed and manufactured by Tom Shultz (Lead guitar for Boston)  You should get any sound you want out of this thing!|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Marshall or Randall. Probably Marshall. Kerry King uses Marshall. So does James Hetfield of Metallica. Kirk uses Randall. So does Dimebag.(Not 80s thrash but who cares?)
UJgm729faa	ohhh I know "The ballad of jack and rose" I saw that on HBO!!    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357110/    Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives on the site of his abandoned island commune with his 16-year-old daughter Rose (Camilla Belle). Jack has sheltered Rose from the influences of the outside world, but now Rose's emerging womanhood poses troubling questions about the days ahead. A man who has lived a life motivated by environmentalism and other altruistic causes, Jack now rages at those who do not share his concerns, like developer Marty Rance (Beau Bridges), who is building a housing tract on the edge of his property. When Jack invites his girlfriend Kathleen (Catherine Keener) and her sons Rodney (Ryan McDonald) and Thaddius (Paul Dano) to live with them, Rose feels betrayed and the situation quickly becomes precarious. Rose acts out wildly, creating chaos. As everything flies out of control, Jack finds himself trapped in an impossible place and is forced to take action.     hope this helped!!!

Mlfd1CVeaa	They have alot more clothing makes and unlike skate 2, they all have their own special features like real clothes would. As on the first Skate, all they had were short hoodies, long hoodies, short t-shirts and long t-shirts with just diffeent logos on. Skate 2 has been really well on the clothes.    As you may know, a big new feature on this game is getting off your board to get up those annoying stairsets you just wish you could gap. Off your board you can jump, throw your board, caveman and much more. It will keep you playing forever.    The level design on Skate 2 is just amazing. This time you get features like going into buildings to discover secret parks, u get very creative lines such as rail to rails down big stair sets etc. Not only do they make a bunch of awesome lines, they leave many objects lying around the city which if you are off your board, you canpush around to make your own insane lines. On this game not only will you be doing big gaps, you will be doing gaps over water falls, maybe over a whole skatepark! This game's design is nothing like the first. We are not just talking long boring roads. I really don't know how to describe the New San Vanelona. They have been so creative.    New tricks. They haven't added a rich load of new tricks, but they have added enough to keep your hands glued to the controller. You get: handplants, bonelesses, footplants etc. Just alot more ways of busting those amazing ramps.    The replay editor is way more advanced. Maybe too way. But at the end of making your skate video, it's all worth it. You don't choose angles on this game. You make them! You get three types of cameras: the game camera (normal game view), tripod camera and a follow camera. In your skate viedos, you won't just be watching it all from one angle, you can change throughout the clip to make it an ACTUAL skate video.    It may be hard to believe but I do have alot more to say. But I have to stop sometime so get it and find out that the game is much better than I have made is sound.

2jrtHt4maa	One night a husband and wife are getting hot and heavy so the husband reachs for the lamp and turns the light off    "Why must you turn the light off everytime we have sex?" she asks    "Just because, dont worry honey" he replies    After a while the wife turns on the light to see her husband making love to her with a dildo. In utter shock she screams at him,    "What are you doing?!?!?! Is this why you always need the light off? You better explain yourself right now!"    "I'll explain this if you can explain to me about our 3 kids?"                ****************************************...      Within a village there is one white man amongst over 200 african villagers. The chief's daughter gives birth to a beautiful young girl who just happens to be white. The chief is absolutely irate,    "My daughter just gave birth to a f**king white child? What the f**k have you been doing!"    He replies: "You see that field of white sheep down by the river?"    "Well yes of course I do what's your point?"    "There's only one black one" the man says raising his eyebrows.    "Fine, I won't tell if you don't" and with that the Chief never said a word.|`|RLs0skyNaa	>what does idk stand for  >I dont know  >OMG nobody does    or    There was a plane with four people. A pilot, a soldier, a retarted guy, and a girl with a bag. The pilot says, "Ok the plane is going down, there are 3 parachute bags and one of you are going to stay, Im going" and he grabs a parachute bag and jumps out. The reatarted guy says' "I..I..I am..am..not..not..staying.." and he quickly grabbed a bag and jumped. The soldier with all his heroism says' "You take the last one" and the girl say "No there are 2 more, the guy jumped out with my bag!!"|`|5n6s0vUyaa	These are messed up ones though.    Have you ever eaten Ethiopian food before?    Neither have they    Why shouldn't you play UNO with mexicans?    They always want to steal the green cards.|`|POqwp3Fiaa	A women on her deathbed called her husband and instructed him to look under their bed and open the wooden box he found. He was puzzled by the 3 eggs and $7,000 in cash he found in the box, so he asked his wife what the eggs were for.    "Oh those", she replied, "every time we had bad sex, I put an egg in the box".    Not bad, the husband thought to himself, after 35 years of marriage, then he asked, "But what about the $7,000?"    "Oh that", she replied, "every time I got a dozen I sold them."|`|3341a3cb1622a1542336e0690a7c6ad3aa	why di dchicen croos the road?    get to other side      why did dino croos road?    no chicken yet|`|LO3BMobRaa	1) This young boy walks in on his parents having sex and gets pissed. His father however just laughed at him, so the the boy walks down the hall into his grandma's room and starts having sex with her. His father walks in to check on him and sees what's going on, and yells, hey man WTF. Then the son says uh hun you see it's not so funny when it's your mama is it?    2) There was this sailor and this soldier that had both died in a war at the same time and they both arrived in Heaven at the same time. St. Peter came and gave both of them their wings, but he warned them that if at any given time they had any inappropriate or unclean thoughts, their wings would automatically fall off. Just as they had put their wings on, this beautiful angel shimmed passed them with a nice smile and smellying real flesh and clean, and the soldiers wings fell right off. Then when the soldier bent over to pick up his wings, the sailors wings fell off.    3) There was this stripper at this bar who was notorious for her split that she did at the end of each of her acts. One day she got ready to do her act, and right before she went on stage, a cat (guy) spilled a drink on stage and it didn't get mopped up too well. So this time when she got ready to do her split, she lost her balance and hit the floor so hard that it took two hours and forty five minutes to break the suction. You should have heard the round of applauses she got when she hit that floor (LOL).    4) There was this couple that had been married for ten years, and for their tenth year anniversary they decided to go back to the same hotel they were in ten years ago for their honeymoon. They went back to the hotel and even got in the same hotel room they were in when they honeymooned.They drunk champaigne and everything was just perfect just as it was ten years ago when they got married. They where starring at each other from across the room in their robes, then they took the robes off. At a given signal they ran towards each other, but since they had been drinking all that champaigne they missed each other and the cat flew right out the window like two flights down. The bell man came rushing outside because he heard all this noise. The man says get me something to cover myself with i'm naked here I need to walk through the lobby so that I could get back up to my room. The bell man says you don't need nothing to cover yourself with, if you want to get back to your room, you can just walk on through the lobby because ain't nobody in the lobby. The mans says what you mean ain't nobody in the lobby, the bell man says ain't nobody in the lobby because everybody left to go upstairs to watch 'em take this chick off the door knob.    5) A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of b---s who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of b---s who are getting on, get your --ses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks." The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language." Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today." As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the --*ch in the kitchen

hEx2hBTCaa	Im a big horror movie fan 2 and it realy depends wat ur scared of.  If u want a scarry supernatural one try the EXORCIST very disturbing.  For gore and freaky looking stuff see THE HILLS HAVE EYES  For one that messes with your mind try PSYCHO  If space stuff scares u try ALIEN(the first one)  If u like surreal movies see MIRRORS  If u like  balls out gorefests try SAW 3|`|KjY2pANcaa	poltergeist|`|NRs72Afxaa	Jeepers Creepers, Halloween, and Friday 13th. always scared me.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	The Wizard of Oz. Those munchkins freak me out. They look fake. And don't even get me started on the flying monkeys!|`|AA11565658	I sincerely doubt your going to find a moive that scares the living piss out of you.     But if you do please let me know cause none of those movies freaked me out even in the least. also the movie "It" is not at all scary unless your afraid of clowns.|`|PRogPOrlaa	Depends what your thing is...     I myself hate the dark... so darkness falls scars the living crap out of me.. but clowns, dolls, i can deal with all that. Oh And ZOMBIES. I frigging hate Zombies....|`|jfEOIeSIaa	I'm the same way and recently the strangers scared me to death.|`|BiNCwoOiaa	I hate watching scary movies so i really dont watch them so i guess the scariest one ive seen is "It"|`|Npi4QR7Maa	(REC)|`|V9uMoELzaa	Anything with miley cyrus|`|rnnCWhnLaa	How about The exorcist... (the first one, of course)    couldn't sleep that night|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Here's some that are pretty scary:  The Orphanage  The Exorcism of Emily Rose  Let's Scare Jessica To Death  The Last House on the Left  Amityville Horror|`|xuThaCvRaa	That's easy, just watch the "Faces of Death" video's. These movies have been banned in some countries around the world.|`|ci64gIZ8aa	"Se7en" may be the scariest movie I have ever seen. The idea is very original and intense. The movie is not boring for a second. You will be entertained the entire time. This movie is definitely not for most people, but if you like violent and thrilling movies, this is a definite see. This movie came out a long time ago, but it is up there as one of the best movies in the past 20 years. Kevin Spacey plays an astounding performance as "John Doe", the serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a purpose to murder. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as well play excellent roles in this great movie. This movie is one of my absolute favorites and I could watch it every week and never get tired of it.|`|oJqxaDRSaa	Not to many movies to scare the piss out of you!  My favs are Alien, The Exorcist, and Salem's Lot

0UHI7CoRaa	Southall, Middlesex.     There are a huge number of places you can buy Sitar's, it is encouraged that you try them out first and the beauty of the community there is you Absolutely have to haggle for a good price.    Potabello Road Market, London, on a sunday is also another excellent way to get your hands on one before buying.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Hmm, I don't really know. I thought they were made in India so that's why you can't really find them anywhere but online. Maybe an Indian district of a large city (Kind of like how there is Chinatown or Little Italy).
AA12353869	The obvious one is 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away' from the 'Help!' album. Just for the record Paul McCartney did not play the flute on 'Penny Lane' - it's a piccolo trumpet played by a session musician. The 'flutes' on 'The Fool On The Hill' are actually recorders played by Paul McCartney; The flute sounds on 'Strawberry Fields Forever' are actually created by a keyboard instrument called a mellotron which utilised tape loops of actual instrument sounds.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Dude the Beatles are just a band dont cream yourself|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	Penny Lane - Paul McCartney plays flute in that song.|`|tx2lX6Rfaa	strawberry fields forever.|`|8RflQ9DVaa	'Hey, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away' off the 'Rubber Soul' album.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNMhPQoEb...

GOOD LUCK!|`|RfOGNRPwaa	In all honesty, there's a crap-ton of people out there in the same boat as you. What I've come to find over the years of trying to get rid of unread manga  is that it's easier to sell it to friends haha. Also, if you advertise it in your cities newspaper, you might get some calls in town and can arrange it somewhere there. Ebay has a lot of people selling, and a lot of them for dirt cheap, also packaging and all that is a real hassle. Good luck though!
AA10344136	Friday, February 13 8pm / 7pm central.....and it's about damn time, too!!  It seems to be a hip trend in "hot" TV shows now: Take a over-long "vacation" off the tube; producers snug thinking it won't hurt their show.    Personally, I think the trend can bite producers than help their show ratings.  Then again....I think TV overall needs a major overhaul, but that's too long an explanation to go into here.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	The show hasn't been renewed yet for a third season.  The ratings for season 2 have not been good so far, and the fact that they're moving it to Fridays is a bad sign.  It will take a while to see how the second half of season 2 does in the new time slot, but the odds of a season 3 happening are slim.  They'll make an official announcement about renewal at some point this spring.
CVMwMjEvaa	season 4 will continue april 17|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Sorry, it's been canceled.  The final episodes of season 4 will air in April.

Don't be too disappointed though.  I've never seen the Chuck show before and although it had some funny parts - the story was really stupid and unrealistic imho.  And the 3d effect was marginal - nothing like theatre 3d movies with polarized glasses.  Lame.  Regular HDTV on a nice widescreen almost looks more 3D than these glasses did.
8yE2sYGeaa	Thundercats?    Cheetara?

lzTUEtppaa	It was an okay episode. It was pretty intense, I'm not a big fan of Dan so when he and the teacher got busted on the picture it was sooo good. Blair is the best character. I don't want Dan and Serena to get back together, I hope they stay broken up. They have a sibling in common, for god's sake! That's so gross. Chuck and Blair are starting to bore me. I'm glad they're interested in other people now, they should take a break from each other and maybe get back together.     I hope Nate and Vanessa break up. They're annoying.|`|TGV834WJaa	i'm okay with nate and vanessa...they don't bother me    i hope chuck and blair get together! there was like 5 episodes about them and now they don't even talk...i'm so confused!!!! i love them together!    i like dan and serena together no matter what! and they just got back together so its dumb for them to break up (isn't this the 3rd time??) and dan moved on WAY fast! i thought he was more loyal/romantic...and ya that teacher is a ****    i bet the secret will be important but its a dumb plot if you ask me...its too staged          i hope dan and serena get back together and stay together for good...but they've gotten back together 3 times so i bet the show won't do it all over again...    i hope they do!!! i love the chuck/blair episodes!!! and i hope chuck says i love you back!!     i don't care if he finds someone new (unless its me! haha) i think him and jenny were ok    no! georgina's time is over. if she came back, everyone would just ignore her. she's annoying and evil    i thought this episode was stupid. the whole "cult" thing is so unreasonable, and staged. and the dan/ms. carr thing is WAY innappropriate and dan is so rude...he had just broken up with serena!! and that teacher is a HO! and i just didn't like anything about it...oh well! hopefully they get back to the good stuff. (like chuck and blair etc.)    xoxo~
SYZtC1gOaa	The trumpet's range starts at a low F  and runs up to a high G. There are about 53 notes the trumpet can play.|`|3Be9jGO2aa	Ohhh, good question :)    Let's start with how much your body is willing to take :) There are trumpet players out there like Fergusen (Who died last year, and I met!) that can play as high as possible. It's truely up to your breath control on what you can do. My daughter can play very low, and very high depending on her.. weariness, willingness, and bored-ness :P    The number of notes the TRUMPET can play is infinite, the number of notes you can play is dependant on you. :)    ~DS and Kat|`|mIfBrm0Daa	The typical range covers two and a half octaves, from F  below the staff to the high C above the staff.  However, some great trumpet players have had ranges of seven octaves, from three Cs below the staff to three Cs above the staff.

Vkff8N8Taa	You can buy the Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set, It's pricey, but it's so worth it because it has so much stuff on there that was never released before, including blues improvisations.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	There are other Jimi albums that are more heavily blues based - some of them out of print stuff thrown together by anyone who happaned to have any recordings of him shortly after he died.    During his life, he sign with anyone who had a dollar and a pencil, so there were (and probably still are) a lot of unheard stuff still about.    One studio album that is instrumental, underrated, and very bluesy (in a Hendrix sort of way) is Nine to the Universe.|`|xBiLoU8Laa	No its one volume cd but if you want get your bf other hendrix things|`|SoyiS9IKaa	Unfortunately there isn't.  It's one of my favorite albums.|`|0CeBJDNOaa	try  on rhapsody there was a lotof his music posted there|`|RE6BBaeSaa	There are also some rare recordings of jam sessions outside of his official discography that are mainly blues (non-psychedelic blues) one of them is with Lonnie Youngblood.
6i6Ig2GMaa	Sadly I have checked all my usual websites where i watch movies and youtube looks like your only option without downloading software. However, the movie is on a playlist, use the link below, and there is a play all option above where all the videos in the list are shown. This will make the parts of the movie automatically come up when the previous one is done. There's still a little break, but you don't have to go search for the next part this way. Hope it helps!!|`|bMHlZlC6aa	Its a movie????? I love that book!

Pt1AMaAdaa	Here are some truth questions, which I always think are more fun than the dares. You might want to have everyone write down the dares before you start and draw them out of the bowl.

jgho4hBCaa	Thought it was one of the funnier comedies to have come out last year.  Paul Rudd is always good at producing a laugh and Sean William Scott was rather funny also.  Also had great supporting characters.|`|Dr2JjGIfaa	loved it! easily the funniest film of the year (2009) so far (:    sean william scott aka stiffler! is one of my fave actors n, wasnt let down by his role in this either! (my 2nd fave character in this film)    my fave character was bobb'e j thompsons (the kid who wheeler is his 'big') my fave bit was when he was won over by 'kiss' lol (being all gangster like 2 rockin out to kiss made me laugh)    is it just me or did anybody kinda feel sorry for mclovin's character when he thought he had won that battle thingy (forget its name) only for esplen 2 run out from the bushes n 'kill' him lol (in my opinion they made up for it by letting teh geek get the girl ((right at the end))|`|FHYjZx1Kaa	I saw this movie last night and I loved it!!!    It was hilarious, I was laughing out loud at it. Luckily it was just me and my boyfriend, and a couple of other guys on the other side!  Yeah I felt really sorry for Augie but he was happy it was her. And she apologised straight away. That little dude was mad!!!! If that was my kid I just don't know what I'd do!!! Hilarious though. Really.

SFZq3ullaa	well personally i find him annoying but i can see how he would be considered outside the box so here is a list of good leadership qualities found in barney  (wow i never thought i would say that let alone put it in writing..)    he is a TEACHER OF CHILDREN and children are our future  he teaches kids to love and respect themselves as well as others  he teaches and leads by example not just by saying to do it  he teaches children other languages (like spanish and american sign language)  he of course teaches kids on their level through visuals and song and dance.. (much like politicians lol)      hope this helps  good luck on your paper|`|kPalo5Kiaa	how he loves me and wer just one big family i think he's trying to lead the world to peace on earth at last, sort of thing|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	That is such a good thing thought Barney is a good example a leader who change the thinkin of young children. i think you should go for it.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	I have 2 young kids and know a little about Barney.  Some people say he's scary and he used to gross me out and make me change the channel.  He's just too purple and sweet or something.  Well, Barney starts out as a figment of your imagination, from a stuffed animal, and turns into this giant fuzzy purple dinosaur when you ask for him to help you or play with you.  The idea is that anybody can do more if you just extend yourself, use your social network of friends and resources, and use your imagination.  He teaches about socially appropriate behavior, dealing with feelings, empathy, helping others, using your imagination, and meeting challenges with curiosity rather than frustration.

dc7aface6d00f7d092ef793ad0219c26aa	Because their last name is Jonas and they're brothers.|`|AA12121940	Its a quadratic formual of all the letters of hteir names and the realation to mammels to plants.    CAUSE THEY ARE BROTHERS OF THE JONAS FAMILY.    GOSH IT DOESNT TAKE A GENIUS TO FIGURE THAT 1 OUT|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Because their last name is "JONAS" and they are BROTHERS, thus they are called the Jonas Brothers!|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Because they're BROTHERS and their last name in JONAS.

DMuD4pNCaa	Vocal: Tokio Hotel for sure.  Prom: most definitely Tokio Hotel|`|1UOIoOzKaa	This question is asked way too much!  Tokio Hotel are a better band for many reasons, they have a wider fan base. They sing in two different languages, and they have better albums than the Jonas Brothers. Not only are they big in Europe, they are breaking into America! Which takes to guts if your from Germany!   Jonas Brothers are only famous from Disney, which is NOT something to be proud of, they use other bands music and they are not original.

Veet I think it is?|`|BsAQE1Hyaa	Erm....wax? I suggest if your going to go get it waxed and it's the first time, you go to a salon, they will make a better job of it. And if you don't know what your doing it can hurt hell of a lot more, getting it done professionally will minimise the pain and will probably make it last longer - the smoothness that is. If you just want your bikini line doing, then just get some bikini line strips from the chemist or something, like veet...they aren't too expensive. But if your wanting to get it all done, I think you'd be better off leaving it to the professionals. Hope this helps and good luck :D x

jPR5rVltaa	Covers are never as good as the original. But I think new singers do it to boost their careers. People like Jonas Brothers and that Miranda person must have done it because they were new artists and those songs were already popular. Therefore, by covering a popular song perhaps people are more likely to buy it because they liked the original... However, Run by Snow Patrol is one of my favorite songs and Leona ruined it with her awful vocals and besides, Jonas Brothers succeeded (in my view) in making Year 3000 a little less annoying- at least they sing in their normal accents.|`|U8prLz8Baa	I think it's stupid to release covers so soon.  Get your own songs people.    It just so happened that as i was reading your question, Scotty Doesn't Know came on my Itunes lol.    I definitely think theres a lack of originality these days with some artists.|`|2308f20102f23791e696d293e30462a0aa	nothing's wrong with covering, as long as the result is original (for example Marilyn Manson's covers of Sweet Dreams, Tainted Love, Golden Years)    Miley Cyrus and the Jonas s**k big time|`|LuK19ZFPaa	who cares  doesnt miley sirus like **** **** ******* on her toes while some girl **** **** ******* with her tongue|`|5eGs0wKPaa	apparently all these singers are pretty young and must be having trouble thinking up their own ideas. maybe they need a wake up call|`|NC67WVlEaa	I suppose they're attempting to bring new life to the song by covering in a different genre..... too bad, they aren't succeeding.  Or perhaps, they just can't write their own songs.

Have you heard any Comet Gain? a side project started by bass player Jon Slade, with a much more "indie" sound. Even harder to find on youtube, unfortunately, but I'll have a look....    *edit: here's The Fists In The Pocket... filmed about 10 mins from where I live as it happens :)  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=kVbikXOYHr...

Only thing it failed on were some demos I'd only found on myspace before, but it was pretty much perfect.    Putting my radio mixtapes to shame... :)|`|gDxMoBl9aa	I'll check into it Cap, thanks.

Lzyzdo6Kaa	I wish I knew the answer to your question.....inner peace has always eluded me.  (I'm on meds, and still don't have inner peace.)  As for meditation, I'm not averse to it, but I never have a moment of solitude, so that's out for me.    I don't agree that one needs to suffer.     I suppose if all of your problems (or what you perceive them to be) were eradicated, inner peace would follow?    Hell if I know.....but if you find out, lemme know!|`|aae8ae776fbcfc2b34e5c924e4df0b45aa	Meditate is usually the best key.  u can always find something you love to do such as listening to a music that builds some kind of good feeling inside of you OR try enjoy yourself in a positive and safe way.   Try live life to the fullest and enjoy every moment to have. Use your time wisely & i believe everything will be alright... gdluk x|`|YbFVdqbnaa	its on ebay|`|MtjR6yT2aa	Meditate normally|`|14gi4aTvaa	Are you depressed?|`|J9fxTGwKaa	wave scarves around in the air!!!
qLvhoRpsaa	Well Justin,   I am from such a town with such a movie house and your idea sounds great. Living in a smaller town where I cannot go shopping or to the bank without running in to at least one person I know, is the type of place I am. We like that about out town and actually try to not allow too many newcomers move in if we had are way. Our newspaper is about 20 pages and half of that is advertising. We are located within 25 miles of a very large city (Vancouver, BC, Canada) but most of us prefer our little town.   What you are thinking of doing would be something that myself and other people that live in my small town would appreciate. Let's face it, the "small town vibe" is getting harder and harder to keep and those of us that love that, want to keep it that way. We also like to have cool community ideas such as yours. I say "Go for it" and you might save someone the horror of wasting a movie ticket on a crappy movie. People will also want to spend more such as snacks and treats when they have the smaller town feel to it. The more you personalize your theater, the better. Good Luck. Peace:)|`|0NkrNStxaa	Yes that would be a good idea becuase I often  look for movie reviews before I see a movie. This would be a quick and easy way to see movie times and ratings!|`|647e04ec98f14cb0162f876543076705aa	Yes, that is a very effective marketing tactic. It works well because the thought is that you watch all the movies you get, making you seem very saavy.|`|nJwSUv8vaa	For me personally it would not have any influence over what movie I would see.  I watch movie trailers on TV and then go to IMDB to see the score/votes users have given and read the posts on the movie's board.  I rely more on a broad spectrum of opinion about what is "good" vs. one single person's opinion.    Also... keep in mind if you recommend a movie as good and someone comes out and HATED it... they might ask you for their money back... since you recommended it and all ;)|`|5kcO165naa	I'd just like the website to be up-to-date.  My little theaters website is pathetic.    Though, I'm a little more informed then the average person. I've got my radio shows and podcasts giving me weekly suggestions on what to see. The average person might appreciate it though. So, why not?     Chances are, however, the people who constantly ask you for your opinion are probably computer-boob adults who wouldn't know where to look anyways (like my parents). You'd still have to tell people either way.

There are always people that are 100 times worse than you that get in no problem.

AA11784965	Pete, Pete, Pete - you ARE but a mere youth!! Leave it to ME to do the capturing, ok? Anyway, here's what you need to know about:    TWILIGHT - the author of this series is NOT the second-coming of, nor in any way, shape or form can compare with the author Anne Rice. I know this to be a fact & I have not even read one of the Twilight books.    JONAS BROTHERS - are NOT the next best thing since sliced bread. Period - that's all I can say on that subject.     Okay, I'm done - gonna go out & cruise the skateboard park with my six pack of Corona, find me a boy-toy! See ya!!|`|dxVpLM38aa	that thier lame get your bong out and listen to somethinels.|`|8ku6ox0Taa	The Jonas Brothers SOOOOO MUCH BETTER|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	They both SUCK!!!|`|LAGM6I2vaa	The jonas brothers suck.And twilight is a good movie but the books are better. 'Breaking Dawn' is the best of all four books.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Twilight is more for women. I'm 22 and really really like the Twilight books (the movie was LAME so don't bother). It's not like it is a very original story, but it's very well written and very easy to read, and that's why it's so popular, I'm guessing.    Jonas Brothers are not cool no matter how old you are, so don't worry. You're not that out of the loop.|`|d5KjFHwkaa	all you need to know... is that they both suck lol|`|87yovKYlaa	you should know nothing about them unless you have a 12 year old daughter. the movie was ok, but nothing to write home about, and the band is pathetic. if being forced to listen to them or miley i take miley any day. that is how bad they are.|`|oa3kVDFyaa	sorry but the Jonas Brothers are not cool!!! No matter what any one says!!!!!|`|zXxQWGI6aa	I've never seen Twilight, but from what I've heard and the trailers, it really sucks.    The Jonas Brother's really suck. Their the worst band in history. Stick to listening to the music that they played on the radio during your youth. It's way better than most of the music now.|`|5WN6G6kyaa	um jonas brothers...yeah no one listens to them...except 8 yearold girls and if that was your youth then by all means recapture it.    Twilight is ok. Girl loves Vampire. Vampire loves girl. They end up together. She becomes a vampire. oh and there's a werewolf that likes the girl but oh well he ends up w/ her daughter. if you want to know details then read it.    and ik that being an adult is not cool but you just have to grow up when your grown up and if you want to recapture your youth look for the fun in everything. or if you want to go for the teen years look for the bad in everything. w/e u want.|`|DtP7rwenaa	lol.what do you mean "what should I know"?Why dont you try wikipedia?it will help you=]  The Twilight movie rocks \m/.go watch it  Try to download some of their music they aren't so bad.  And dont feel bad about your age.You are still young.Just be yourself and do what you like to have a good time.|`|wEpwWVhJaa	As far as I can tell, they're both about the subjugation of female empowerment in teens.

NY2fpmvPaa	Always making up some ridiculous story to my parents of where I would be that night.    My first year in high school.     Going over to this disgusting trailer house that some of the senior guys lived in and partying over there. So gross. What were we thinking? Getting drunk for the first time over there from drinking one beer. And the guy we had a crush on when we were in 5th grade was there (he was a lot older than us by about 6 years) was hitting on us every time we went over to that house. It was gross.    Tanning outside in February (we live in Idaho. One year it was like 65 degrees and we thought it was a good idea to tan).    Drinking egg nog from my friends grandma's liquor cabinet and mixing it with root beer.    Sitting in lawn chairs at the end of my street with my friends at 3:00 in the morning. Just sitting there.    My first real "date". Later found out that he is my cousin.    Getting high by the pond and making up the "ping pang pong bong" unit.    Going trick or treating and the guys we were all dating made up this story about "hobo island" and took us there. Scary!    The guy that I was dating tried to unbutton my pants when we were kissing once and I got really scared and went home and cried to my friends. LOL. I guess at least I was scared to do it!|`|Myrftx3Zaa	i'm 15 so yeah|`|fyyfPEemaa	I'm fifteen . so. yeah. when i was fourteen i couldn't wait to tun 15. because of my quincenera.

XhRLCFz8aa	Hm. Well the V2 is easier to type and it doesn't feel all light. If you like stuff feeling light, then get the glyde, it's a little smaller and lighter. Personally I don't like the touchscreen of the glyde, doesn't work that well - but it does look better.    I say get the V2. It's a good phone. I think the glyde is a couple hundred, minus you upgrading.

sYqSMmWoaa	Well, any decent film requires multiple viewings to grasp the full extent of its message and content. Citizen Kane is certainly no different. It is considered the greaest film of all time in most circles because it is the most ahead of its time film ever made. i mean, it was made in 1940 but the film made use of extraordinary shots and camera movies that are staples today. The cinematography was revolutionary. No one had explored depth of field like welles did in Kane, and it has been replicated only a few times since. The contrast too, was something that had not been explored yet in american cinema. Then there is the content. Kane is essentially an allegory for the life of William Randolph Hearst, who vehemently attempted to defame Welles and kept him from earning his best picture oscar. all in all, the whole back story behind it and the technical achievements Welles mustered were what made Citizen Kane a landmark film in its day, and the fact that the formula it established hasnt yet been improved upon is why it is the greatest movie ever.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	You may need more than one viewing, but before you take that viewing, see "RKO 281," sometimes called "The Battle Over Citizen Kane."  Liev Schreiber (CSI, Manchurian Candidate, etc) plays Orson Welles, and James Cromwell (Babe, E.R. L.A. Confidential, etc) plays William Randolph Hearst.  This will give you a better idea of how Welles went about making the film, and what Hearst did to try and destroy it.
AA11784502	Hello ,  Yes , into an anime film ;  "Murasaki Shikibu Genji Monogatari (movie)" ;  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  "Genres: drama, romance   Themes: Historical   Plot Summary: An animated adaptation of Murasaki Shikibu's eleventh century epic Genji Monogatari (The Tale of Genji), which is considered by many to be the world's first novel. The film follows the life and many loves of Genji, the Shining Prince, and his love-life is as fraught with tradegy and heartbreak as it is with passion and romance."  Also , for perusal ;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_gen...    =^,,^=|`|2VeQdw03aa	r|`|dfjIBHe3aa	The Tale of Genji is an eleventh-century book, considered the world's first novel, which has been adapted many times into  other media.  There are at least five manga, and as as noted, an anime.  There are also several live action adaptations, including one by the great director Kon Ichikawa.  There is also an Opera.  I'd read it if I could.  Then I would see the Ichikawa film if I could.  The anime is really not as illuminating and I would make it my second or third version of it.  It's a masterpiece -- believe me it is.
PakkKi2vaa	I think listening to positive upbeat music will cheer you up, and then you will be able to get over the sad feelings. I don't think that music is a heartbreak band-aid though.|`|e072343e7902fefe7d84517fac44f23baa	yes
9GLg9Mb5aa	It really depends on the time and date you're looking for, local rates, size of the theatre and how many people/how long you'll need it. I recommend calling the following numbers for more info (and maybe even your local Regal cinema).    "Groups of 25 or more can request tickets for a regularly scheduled film of your choice at any Regal Entertainment Group Theatre location, including Regal Cinemas, United Artists Theatres, and Edwards Theatres, as well as any IMAX? location.

I hope and pray that she continues singing.

However, you have stomach pains, seek medical assistance.|`|jr9iEmuoaa	Your gonna die in 7 days.|`|paRqMN9xaa	No! As long as it was from the jar, its fine! (;|`|s62PS0Xgaa	no u are fine|`|bKpVffKWaa	no dont worry|`|0PgdLh9Uaa	no, 3 of my friends had peanut butter and it takes 4-8 hours for the salmonella to kick in....      they nvr got it....      so chances are u arent since its just peanut butter not peanut butter crackerss.|`|YG4VMafEaa	I heard it's only the peanut-butter in Snickers bars, crackers and Reeses peanut butter cups, but not the kind in the jar. If you used the kind in the jar, you should be fine.|`|s6hhRtQuaa	Sorry, you only have 48 hours left.|`|hpb7uO6faa	if the peanut butter isnt that new, but hopefully not too old, your fine|`|AA11506028	If not then you should be flogged for putting peanut butter on toast, that is just despicable.|`|aR0bJqCdaa	http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/s...

I think it's the peanut butter in cookies and processed food that is the problem. But if you suddenly turn bright green, seek medical attention.|`|RmIeoU7raa	I'm sure you will be fine|`|sJBFukoZaa	There was a recall on Peanut Butter? But you probably aren't doomed.|`|BV2e9M5saa	Yes    Run for your life!|`|9edde60f57512a8d890a31fcfa19e63daa	I think regular peanut butter is OK.  Its just products that come with peanut butter on/in them thats the problem (ie, granola bars with peanut butter)

AA10289523	Batman The Dark Knight Returns , is one of the best novels you will ever read enjoy|`|SDvs99Ccaa	Im not sure, but the dark knight returns is one those "what if"comics right?|`|5EzGvzlTaa	The Dark Knight Returns is an elseworlds tale, which means that it is not in continuity, so basically, no other batman comics relate to it (except the sequel, Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again.)  There are no comics that you need to read before you "jump" to The Dark Knight Returns because there isn't anything to jump over.  The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again stand alone.|`|aJgIo6j5aa	I would suggest The Killing Joke, The Man Who Laughs, The Long Halloween, Death in the Family and Arkham Asylum    Not that they're essential to understanding the Dark Knight Returns, but those are all great novels telling us about the first encounter of Batman with his archenemy Joker, the Joker's very origin, featurimg other vilains and Batman's sidekick Robin as well and are just helluva fun  to read!    Perhaps you wanna learn more about the Gotham City and Batman universe before jumping to the what-if story...|`|5p8mJ7S6aa	i dont think so. but you should know a little history about robin.
viUCibKIaa	Nah, the only remake they did was Crank That, other than that their songs are original like ASL, WTFWJD, or Sex Ed Rocks [:|`|7761a0e82f2aca8d02650411bc0f2fafaa	Nah, they just remade "Crank That".     They have original songs off their album, "You Can't Spell Slaughter without Laughter"...and of course, there's "Sex Ed Rocks" =D|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes they did
Xblu0Meaaa	IF YOU CAN GET EVEN LIKE ONE OR TWO LINES FROM THE SONG I CAN FIND IT...CUZ YEA YOU DO HAVE THAT PROBLEM THAT IT IS PRIVATE AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW HIS LAST NAME OR EMAIL...I TRIED...GOOD LUCK!   :)|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Its private.|`|ixOE0onnaa	www.music this is the thing here^
yqe0I5zpaa	I really liked the movie as well, the scene when the daughter is taken and he is telling her to calm down, his face is just amazing, great acting. I couldn't believe some of the action sequences, Neeson has once again shown us why he is one of the best actors of his generation.|`|eHUXcYZhaa	I thought it was absolute rubbish. Really horrible storyline.|`|nPM23Xq2aa	I WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE SO BAD BECAUSE IT LOOK GOOD|`|56bNLJykaa	The director is quite bad so I didnt bother seeing it|`|rSq790ksaa	I thought it was pretty cool but the ending was unrealistic. If I were kidnapped, drugged and traded as a sex object I wouldn't leave my dad for a second, especially if he was able to save me like that. I would be so paranoid and yet at the end the girl just walked away from her dad like it was nothing.     Otherwise it was good.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I went to the cinema to see it and thought it was a really good film.|`|wUAUKlKkaa	It was pretty good like - i thought the girl actress was a bit crap though. I'd give it an 8 out of 10|`|OW9bnsNWaa	OMG!!!!!!!!! i loved this movie! i saw it twilce and it was AMAZING!!! def one of my favs|`|VcyJryXdaa	it honestly wasnt that good. thought it was gunna be wayyy better|`|lmvG5Sj1aa	LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  It was great to see Liam Neeson in a role like this and he did a great job with it too!    I want to get it when it comes out on video!!|`|k3Gzg3Kaaa	I WANT TO SEE THAT SOOOO BAD!!!!! I am going to see it soon :]]]
l1pewZpaaa	Seriously? He's only an inch taller!      You're tall and he's just average so tell him to stop being insecure|`|UMsJd9bDaa	If he ever asks, "How's the weather up there?"     Spit on him and say it's raining.|`|AA11609168	Tell him to stop flirting with you....say it loud and infront of other people in a 'fed up' tone.  HE will turn bright red and stop|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	tell him he's an idiot and your gonna punch him in his face the next time he "comes down to your height"|`|WUCh1DEdaa	oh stop overreacting  he likes you|`|e29AeC1Qaa	ignore him and he will let you be.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Let me stand next to him.... im 6'    Probably shut his a-s-s up quick|`|lbB4lq6Daa	wow, ur not that tall! im about 5'4 and a half and its good being tall =]    tell him that he is super short for a guy|`|UA6mt9ESaa	thats stupid he sounds like kinda a idiot|`|tcsgHDAgaa	just tell him how you feel. if he's a true friend then he will listen and understand your feelings|`|QLe4U0baaa	Pull His trousers down then when he bends down to pull em back up call him a !midget|`|bljBwqCaaa	tell him he's only 1 inch taller than you, which incidentally is probably the same length as his penis.   good luck.|`|aQSo5KMzaa	Don't bother trying to change him - short guys are always like that whether they are 13, 33 or 63. They can't stand being short!|`|rVzsV76aaa	lol. Let me stand next to him today and ill show him who is boss lol|`|AA10934282	smack the little shrimp around
BulOiEr3aa	did the rest go: "i ain't scared, i ain't run"? if so it might be No Matter What by T.I.|`|7761a0e82f2aca8d02650411bc0f2fafaa	If it was T.I., it might be "Dead and Gone" with Justin Timberlake.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt_qnb8wL...
wrgjbQKIaa	yea i recognize it|`|k3Gzg3Kaaa	nopee.. sorry|`|qi7N1ouoaa	I ain't quite sure ....|`|5bYpbodUaa	Are you talking about a Lifetime movie that has Kate Jackson in it? She was a nurse at a hospital and steels a baby.  Can't remember the title of the movie though.|`|0oM61Epqaa	hahaha im pretty sure its a lifetime movie...ive seen it...but i dont remember the title sorry|`|4EflpUK8aa	Sounds like the plot line to every soap opera out there
3wjKko3kaa	no - their new song (cover) is Desolation Row (Bob Dylan) and they just did an exclusive Kerrang! interview that said they were recording again and Gerard posted a thing on their website sayin that it always rains when they start to record n he ses get ur umbrellas ready so...|`|QMveJrziaa	...we can only hope|`|e2J4r10Raa	I hope so, they are one of the worst bands ever...in my opinion.|`|zXxQWGI6aa	hopefully|`|f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	I can't imagine a band would break up solely because of that. Their lawyers can settle that, I'm sure it happens enough that they're equipped to deal with it. The band has faced lawsuits and threats of lawsuits in the past.|`|uMseesTAaa	I hope not :(|`|1MLIYilNaa	Haha, your friend is a liar.   Or they are getting this information from a very unreliable source, because it's completely false.|`|8f2703ece647b367ecdfbc82a21c3b13aa	The band is not breaking up. They did a cover of Desolation Row for watchmen. They had permission for it, and they are taking a long break. Gerard is having a kid, Frank is on tour with his other band, Leathermouth, and Ray got married, but they're getting together to start writing again soon. I'm part of the MCRmy, and Gee wrote us a blog the other day telling us they were all going over to Mikey's house to start writing again.|`|7b1T1lyMaa	NO THEY ARE NOT!    they did a cover of a bob dylan song for amovie. it was completely legal and all good. they got permission and bob dylan himself even said that he thought they did a good job.     so no. theyre not.    edit-----    girl. get over yourself. he wrote a blog on his WEBSITE. he did not personally write to you or mcrmy.
yfXpPXlMaa	I'm going to refer you to the book, 'The Screenwriter's Bible' by David Trottier. You can get it on amazon. It's got everything you need to know about formatting, setting out your story, characters, selling/marketing etc. Well worth an investment.     Once you've got your story polished and you need to write the actual screenplay, you can either use a standard word processor or buy some screenwriting software. Software is quite expensive (160) but if you're looking to do it seriously, it'll save a lot of headache as all you've got to do is type. It sorts the formatting out for you. Final Draft is a good one.    There's well too much information to write so I'm sorry I couldn't give you any direct tips, the book is fantastic. Really worth reading.    Good luck!|`|rSq790ksaa	There are many programs you can buy or schools you can attend that can teach you how to properly write a screenplay.     As for learning how to format one, I know how you feel, it can be hard. I recommend downloading movie scripts from movies you know really well that way you can read the script and then watch the movie and be able to see how movies translate from script to a film.     As for selling your scripts when you finish, consider getting an agent. Production companys will be more willing to work with you if you have an agent and if your script does get picked up, your agent will make sure you get don't get screwed over on your pay.    Good luck.
oOSNI3wbaa	uh no. 4 and 5 are not the beginnings of anything. they "flashback" a few times during those movies but they are not the beginning. just watch them.|`|0yGuaZ6raa	The doll is explained in the 4th film. If you watch the other two, the first three make more sense.
qIaBOtltaa	it takes me like two days to answer mine. (i just think about what i'm going to say, but most of the time i forget to check it.) :-)|`|TjwgBFCzaa	I check my e-mail once a week.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	That's about average unless they have a huge crush on you.|`|AA11656632	I answer email 2-3 times per day|`|AA11412715	I check my email almost every couple of hours. I am surprised at how many people don't check their email. I am a student and when I have questions that need answering I am pretty upset when people don't contact me back that day. I really think people should access their email NO less than once a day.|`|YSdwkhHRaa	It's usually within hours, if not minutes, giving respect to the fact that  most everyone I email lives in different time zones.    I keep my gmail tab open, and there's 595 things in my inbox. As soon as it says (596) I usually go and check it.|`|a2b5549c80fdb444d8075ce8c9c9d17baa	i never check my email so i never return emails|`|G6Uy43coaa	I emailed a guy about three weeks ago....a friend and he has yet to respond so...I guess he is busy.|`|gijJtZTWaa	I reply as soon as I get them. However, I do tend to check my email every two-three hours (if I'm on the computer, that is). Some people just probably don't check their email as much, or don't go on the computer all that much, either. As far as my experiences go, it really just depends on the person. Some people will reply within hours, while other's it takes days...even weeks. I guess it just depends.|`|ANKJdJgxaa	LOL... I'm just the opposite, I always forget to return phone calls, but the moment after I've read a email I'm replying to it. I read my email everyday, and because i tend to ignore the ringtones from my phone, must people now it's better to contact me by email. I guess because I don't have to say much in a email.  and I guess some people would rather have long conversations with you on the phone|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	i reply quickly latest is at nite wen i go thru all my emails|`|ks2oieV0aa	Yeah, I do that too.  xox|`|U8R2o1P3aa	Im terrible that way lol.  I never check my email... even when i do, i never respond right away anyway lol so i take foreveer|`|FBz0iIUXaa	i reply as soon as possible.|`|LIoUKhFoaa	depends on who youre emailing...      business people and teachers usually reply right away.    kids dont check email as much as things like facebook though, so a couple of days usually.|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	Poll: Within a week.|`|f4iszDZuaa	As quick as Rosie O' Donnell's sex lasts...........|`|9dAcLvijaa	some peole cant always respond first thing|`|dXDroPtfaa	I check my e-mail constantly..So Within 24 hours!
YzPACLKJaa	Well one guys beats another almost to death and then finishes the job with a butcher knife. If you're good with that it'll be fine. That movie is incredible and nowhere close to the violence in any horror movie released today.|`|SKFIjyoVaa	not if they have a problem with drug abuse, swearing, some violence    no nudity tho|`|yqe0I5zpaa	The movie is rated R for strong brutal violence, pervasive language, drug content and brief sexuality.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	IDK, depends on their maturity level. I  dont remember there being much sex in it, but the language was bad and the drug use...come to think of it I wouldn't let my 14-15 year old see it just yet.|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	isn't that one of the highest ranked movies for using the f word or am i thinking of casino?|`|oOSNI3wbaa	why not? i was younger than that when i first saw it. as long as they are mature enough to understand that its just a movie then yeah, why not?
zy5qcc0Raa	info@sixgosselins.com    their website is   http://www.sixgosselins.com/    Hope this helped!|`|Dkk5HwbEaa	try here: http://tlc.discovery.com/tv/jon-and-kate...|`|djuRlggeaa	letters@sixgosselins.com|`|qEn157Ppaa	All those addresses are correct, but I tried to write to them last week and their inbox is full. I think they are real busy now traveling for book signings and still settling in the new house, and I am sure there are a few other speaking engagements and publicity deals we aren't aware of.  Oh yeah, and taking care of the kids keeps them hopping, too.
Yc9uPziVaa	er.. where they in Dodge County?|`|HNfxDq24aa	I'm sure it's a famous line from a movie, but i can't remember|`|7LUeUkLxaa	you have to get out of town before they catch you.|`|cdaf0CGxaa	That saying goes back to the pioneer days in Dodge City Kansas. That is what the cowboys and gamblers would say when Wyatt Earp was hot on their trail.     "Man we gotta get the he!! out of Dodge"

To contain the threat, acting authorities brutally quarantine the country as it succumbs to fear and chaos. The quarantine is successful.
