20090219210042AA7pRDr	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Home and car buying advice?	Hi,   1. Is it true that if you're buying a new car for cash that you get a rebate (cash back).   I'm asking because I'm trying to decide between buying a $3000 used car and saving to buy a new one in one year or buying a new one with $5000 cash back ('08 suzuki xl 7: paying $23000 instead of $28000) and pay it off in 12 months.      2. what is the best way to get a reliable cheap used car of about $2500 to $3000 that will not need repairs for 3 years.      3. Also, can one buy/finance a home with only two years of credit history, 6 months of employment history with salary of $7000/month, a credit score of 750?      Summary: 'Should I rent an apartment and buy a $2500 used car now and get a new home and car in 3 years or should I just go ahead and get the new car now and home because (a) if I rent an apartment, after two to three years, I would have payed over $20000 in rent (that would have gone into paying for the home) (b) if I buy a $2500 car now, after two to three years, the trade in value will be close to zero, I might as well get a new one now and pay it off in 12 month.   I need suggestions.      THANK YOU.

As I was coming out of next school, there was a car in front of me preparing to turn left. It started to make it's way out of school and on to the road when it realized it couldn't make the turn safely and applied the brakes in the middle of the road. By then, I was too close of a distance to stop. I hit it in the back bumper going 5 mph. She hopped out her car and examined the rear bumper. There wasn't any visible damage and went on her way.      For future reference, what do you do after an accident? I know that if the damages exceed $1000 you're suppose to exchange licenses/insurances and call the police. But what if it's something small?      Do we just exchange name and numbers and contact each other at a latter time or am I legally entitled to hand over my license and insurance? I just realized how unprepared I really was and would appreciate any help.      I reside in Toronto, Canada

20090219110318AA6XW9J	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Motorcycle smells like gas?	I recently just bought a 07 Ninja 250. The tank was pretty much empty when I bought so my friend put in Premium gas even though I believe unleaded is fine for it. But so far everyday it smells like gasoline where ever it is parked. I've had it outside overnight and the next day it smelled of gas. I asked him why it smelled like gas and he said probably because he topped it off (not overspilling) but now i've ridden it and had the gas go down. So question, why does it smell like gas? Is it because there is a hole somewhere, or because he used premium gas instead of unleaded?

20090219113423AAMHiA6	Cars & Transportation;Boats & Boating	Anyone know about "No Sand Primer" for bottom painting a boat?	Looking to recoat bottom paint for this season. It has been painted only once (boat is 2 years old) and is in fair condition with no chipping. Hull is fiberglass and gelcoat is in great shape. I have seen the no-sand primer from West Marine and like the idea of applying a primer over decent older paint and then going over with two coats of CPP antifouling paint. Would much rather do that then to start stripping old paint down and spending much more cash and time. If anyone has any thoughts, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.

20090219164739AAwCWkC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is it that my Van won't start sometimes?	I have a 1995 Ford Windstar and sometimes it just decides that it does not want to start until I get the box containing the relays.  I used adjust them; pull them out and put them back in and it would start.  Today I hit the box and pulled the relays in and out and it started after 4 attempts.  I almost gave up; it usually takes one. Or sometimes if I wait until the next day or many hours later it will start.  It seems to have a mind of it's own what is going on?      It also has a problem with cutting off if I push on the brakes to hard it will cut off. It drives better on the freeway because, there is not so much braking required.  A friend of mine who happens to be the mechanic believes that this is due to the injectors; a leakage of some sort but he is clueless about the relay box: he swears that we need a fuel pump.      I would appreciate any feedback that you may have.

20090203111403AAqnFst	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Truck wont start sometimes, cranks but no start?	Ok so it has been doing this for a couple weeks now, only every now and then. Its a 1991 S-10 blazer 4.3l. I think the motor isn't getting spark sometimes. I have no idea how to track it down though. Here is what it has been doing.      I left the bank drive though, and right as soon as I got to the stop sign the truck just dies, right before I stopped. It didnt bog down and die it just completely died. Then I went to start it and it fired back up and ran fine.   Then   Today I went to a person house to pick up valve covers, truck ran fine all the way there, after I got back in my truck and try to start it, it would crank and not start. It wouldnt even try. I could smell fuel, but got NOT A THING from the motor. I played with a coil wire and still nothing.... I sat in my truck for about 5 minutes thinking about what it could be then I tried starting it again and it fired right up.   Then   I went to my girls house and hung out wit her for 2 hours, I went to go leave and started the truck....ran fine, put it in reverse and it moved 5 feet then just completely died out and and would crank but not start. I tried cranking it for a while and nothing. I messed with the coil wire again looking inside to to see rust...and there is none. Finaly after 10 minutes had passed, I tried starting it and it fired right up.   When I pulled in my driveway tonight the truck lost power completely for about .25 of a second then ran fine. Like it lost all spark then got it back.      I NEED HELP WITH THIS!!! How can I figure out what the problem is or try and track this down???      I hooked a spark plug (gapped to specs) to the coil wire and cranked the engine and got orange/blue spark.      I also checked the primary wire (either the primary or secondary) that goes from the distributor to the coil and it looks ok too.      I was told from a friend I called that it could be the Ignition control module. How can I check that??? I dont have an ohm meter.      WHAT COULD THIS BE!?!?!?!?

At times, I have to leave early to drop my sister off to school...I take the Q36 [Jamaica] to get to Hillside Avenue. Then there I transfer to the Q1 [Bellerose] to take my sister to school. Afterwards, I go to my boyfriend's house. I usually walk ALL the way to Springfield Boulevard [93rd Ave? i think] from Braddock after I get off the Q1, and walk down ALL the way to Jamaica Avenue. But I could take the Q88 or Q1 [Jamaica] or Q27 all the way to Jamaica. I hang out at his house and then we leave. We take the same buses [but going the other way] to Hillside again and walk to school...I then take the Q43 and transfer to Q36 to get home.      So all in all, I take two full-trips [with one transfer] in the morning, and when I go home, I take another full trip [with one transfer]. I only have a half-fare [i know, sucks for me]. But the real thing i wanted to ask is how many times can you use a half-fare student metrocard?
