Daq9gituaa	Excerpt from Social Security:<br>  <br>  Will part-time work increase my Social Security retirement benefit? <br>  <br>  If you return to work after you start receiving benefits you may be able to receive a higher benefit based on those earnings. This is because Social Security automatically recomputes the benefit amount after the additional earnings are credited to your earnings record.<br>  <br>  (The above applies to full time work also along with the cost of living index)|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	It all depends on the benefits formula.<br>  <br>  SSA uses the top 35 years of work history to determine your benefits, with a formula that takes inflation into account.<br>  <br>  If you did not work a full 35 years before getting SSA benefits, then continuing to work can fill in a $0 year and get you higher benefits (not much, though).  If you did work, the amount is only changed if the new pay is greater than one of your old years after the inflation is taken into account.  <br>  <br>  My father was so successful in retirement that he knocked out several of his earliest working years and got higher checks.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	yes.<br>  <br>  prior posters have it only partly correct.  The part about normal retirement age is correct.<br>  <br>  However, in November of 2009, you'll get a notice telling you what your 2009 SS should have been if the SSA had known about your 2008 earnings.  In December, you'll get a catchup check for this year.<br>  <br>  And in January of the following year, your check will go up to the COLA increase over the amount calculated in the November notice.  Thus, your December check may be larger than the one next January, but the January check will be larger than the one from the previous January by both the COLA amount and the addition for having worked another year.<br>  <br>  The same thing will happen every year after that until the year after you finally cease working.<br>  <br>  [PS:  Medicare part B deduction will also go up, based on different rules, so the actual check amount is not perfectly predictable.]|`|qBCGH52haa	Your SS payment will increase by the Cost of Living as set by the Social Security Administration.<br>  <br>  If you have not reached Normal Retirement Age, when you do, the SSA will also stop offsetting your SS payments by your income.  If you have reached NRA, you will see only the COLA change.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I should have added that your payments may also increase if the amount you are earning while collecting SS affects your average income based on your high 35 years.|`|9JccdA9Uaa	I think that your lucky to be getting anything in SS.

It is owned by Azim Premji , who is one of the richest Indians in the world....his group of companies covers everything from cosmetics to information technology......As a matter of fact , the father of Indian BPO , Raman Roy , is with Wipro.....it all started here......Consistently its BPO operations have been doing good and though in IT they may not be the best in india now(like infosys and TCS)....they were certainly the pioneers. I understand your skepticism in the wake of Satyam ....the it company that went bust....but just a little more reading would tell you why it cannot happen to Wipro.....the very fact that they are a huge group of companies and the way Indian economics relies on stability .....tells you that this company is here to stay. However i would still ask you to research more on other aspects of the job....like facilities and perks and whether family is given an accomdation.....Wipro operates in all major cities and are located in mostly the most urban part of the city ....So i am sure you would not have issues of healthcare and schools. But yes do check on the medical scheme still ....As i mentioned these are things you would normally check when you get any job ....but just a bit more in-depth....in case you have any other queries ....feel free to mail me ....i have a couple of freinds in wipro

You do not have to claim/report EE bonds in your child's name or your name for "financial aid", "student loan" purposes.  All 529 plans, CDs, etc will be picked during the income verification process.  If you had $50,000 in a 529 account or in a CD for your child, this would be deducted from any financial aid you would have received.   <br>  <br>  However, EE bonds are commonly misplaced, mismanaged, etc.  You could have $50,000 in EE bonds and exclude it from your child's financial aid application.

VQlXF8Ucaa	Hello I am a money lady.  You really should think about taking on a partner and I say this because sometimes it is like being in a bad marriage.  Also, you really don't need that at all.  <br>  <br>  You will need a location I presume and a business license which you can get from the local Commissioner of Revenues Office.  You can buy Quick Books Pro which is relatively cheap and keep track of all your money matters in that program.  It is fairly easier than alot of accounting programs to use.  <br>  <br>  Peachtree Complete Accounting has a place where you could even keep track of your assets, and it does depreciation for you.  It comes with instruction books.  And then at the end of the year you would print your financial reports from these simple programs and take them to an Accountant in your area to do your taxes.  It really isn't that hard.<br>  <br>  This is why they have Accountants, Accountants keep track of businesses financial records.  So talk to one in your area and see what they say.  In addition, there are accounting firms that hire bookkeepers and they will send them to your business to do your books for a fee.  You could in addition hire a bookkeeper, that is really all you need.|`|Vq8Szjs9aa	There is a website that will allow you to search for a business partner.  It is www.partnerup.com.

If you're going to pursue it, then make sure you thoroughly check the person out (especially if they're handling the finances).  Also, make sure you compose some type of agreement and have both partners sign it so there is no confusion as to compensation, share of losses/profits/expectations/procedures for sale of ownership/etc.|`|e9w9o6W6aa	i can be your guy i can handle your money properly. i have unique skills in money magement and know  some degree of small business. if you to contact me, email is midwest341@hotmail.com
9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Well this will be coming from a CPA, so the source is relevant!  Accounting is a great field to get into as long as you go get your Bachelors degree and try and pursue your CPA license.  Anything less, such as only getting an Associates degree, will land you a clerk or bookkeeper position making at most $40,000.  Math is actually not a big deal for most of accounting as the only math we really use is basic 6th grade math.  We use no algebra, calculus, geometry, or trig.  You just have to be good with numbers, which is actually a VERY different concept.  The profession itself is very secure as it is pretty much required by every company that is in existence.  The stability issue that you may have is with the employer.  If you work for a small business, obviously that is more likely to go under than if you worked for a Big 4 accounting firm or a Fortune 500 company.  It is a profession where the more you put into it, the more you will get out of it.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	My mom got a degree in accounting, but she wound up working as a bookkeeper.  You can get a bookkeeping certificate in two years that would be much less expensive.  You are right that having bad credit could make it difficult to get a job in finance.  Accountants have to study statistics, which is a very challenging math course.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are looking for a fresh start.  It would be good to focus on something you can do after the shortest time in school (and the least additional debt) possible.  Physical therapy could be good, but if you're going to go back for that type of work you might as well study to be a CNA.  That job pays extremely well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

"  Son, if you can't find a job that fits your needs, create one of your own".   I did just that, I started mowing lawns, washing store windows, or just general cleanup around businesses.

hMNOBYHCaa	Reputable lenders will not lend you more than you can afford.  Get your mortgage from someone you've heard of before like BofA or Wells Fargo.  The bottom line is that it's YOUR responsibility to make sure you can afford your payments. <br>  <br>  First make sure you have adequate funds for a downpayment and closing costs.  Put at least 10% down, but 20% is better.  FHA loans are safe bets too if you just can't make a bigger downpayment.  They can be a hassle for the seller, so some seller won't accept a bid using FHA.  Your rate might also be a little higher.<br>  <br>  When you apply for a loan, make it clear you are only interested in a traditional fixed rate loan.  Don't get anything fancy, like a 5/1 ARM or 80/10/10 or interest only or anything other than a regular old fixed rate loan with one mortgage.  <br>  <br>  Then hang on to your job.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You will know what your monthly payment will be when you sign the mortgage documents.

They may have lower rates but you will pay dearly for that lower rate.  Always look at the APR.  That tells the story.  It should be close to the interest rate.  If not, you are paying way too many fees.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	They are not the actual lender. They are a broker, similiar to a middle man.

This turns your affiliate link from <a href="http://www.ilovemymoney.com/affid=1234" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilovemymoney.com/affid=1234</a> into <a href="http://www.mymoney.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.mymoney.com.</a> <br>  <br>  This is particularly useful with Clickbank hoplinks because, believe it or not, some people will actually remove your Clickbank ID and put theirs in its place.  This is called linkjacking.<br>  <br>  Once you've registered a domain name with Go Daddy, log into your account, Click Domains then click My Domains. A list of all the domain names you registered should pop up.<br>  <br>  Check the box next to the domain name you want to forward to.<br>  <br>  Click on the Arrow that says Forward.<br>  <br>  Check Enable Domain Forwarding.<br>  <br>  Type in the URL you want to forward to. <br>  <br>  Check 301 Moved Permanent <br>  <br>  Click the tab that says Masking<br>  <br>  Check enable masking. <br>  <br>  In the masking description, put something like:  the best bread since sliced bread.  Whatever describes your domain.<br>  <br>  Masked Title:  The name of Your Domain e.g. MyMoney<br>  <br>  Masked Keyword Meta Tag:  Tags related to your domain e.g. money, make money online, cash, etc.<br>  <br>  If you don't enable Masking, then who ever sees you domain will be forwarded to your ugly affiliate link. <br>  <br>  (2) Free Website Link Forwarding.  You can repeat the exact same process for a free website.<br>  <br>  Free websites out there are: geocites, google sites, freewebs, weebly, blogger, wordpress, etc. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that most free sites have advertisements on them and won't be removed unless you upgrade so check first.  Weebly is very easy to use. <br>  <br>  When you're ready to forward the freesite's subdomain to your top-level Go Daddy domain name, simply repeat the domain forwarding process. Like you would do for an affiliate link.<br>  <br>  These domains are simply "Parked" at Go Daddy, but they are not hosted on Go Daddy unless you buy the service.<br>  <br>  Some people will want to get their own webhosting to reduce the chances of them get shut down for spamming free sites, but if you do marketing right and don's spam, then you should be okay. <br>  <br>  It's up to you.  If you're starting off, paying $10/year per domain name is certainly cheaper than paying $135/year for webhosting.  However, if you anticipate getting hordes of traffic immediately, then you may want to consider just getting webhosting service. <br>  <br>  Also, if you plan on uploading files, PDFs and pictures, you're going to need webhosting.  Files need to go somewhere.|`|TzScqQxCaa	You could build a website for free with Microsoft Frontpage or any other free HTML editor and host it on freehostia.

Sozc3MyFaa	I doubt it.  In the MA program I teach at; the students get 2 hours of lecture then 2 hours of lab (at the school) where they learn the procedures.  In the clinical rotation (which is in a clinic or an office etc) phase they are expected to already be proficient with the clinical skills, not just learning them.  No clinical rotation is expecting to TEACH you clinical skills from the beginning.

PdxMOlcaaa	Try asking your question in this link.|`|Cv7TWRhyaa	I think you can.  I know many nurses with DUI's on their record.<br>  <br>  This is probably why:  California Board of Registered Nursing, the state’s nurse licensing board, allowed sex offenders, drug users and convicts to retain and renew their nursing permits.<br>  <br>  “Effective immediately, upon renewal of an Registered Nurse [RN] license, the Board will require licensees to indicate if they have been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony during the last renewal period,” posted the California Board of Nursing on its website. “Convictions must be reported even if they have been, dismissed, reduced, or expunged.” <br>  <br>  The California Board of Nursing website added that violations of section 11368 of the Health and Safety Code (forged or altered prescriptions) must also be reported and that all traffic violations (under $300) involving alcohol, drugs, injury to persons, or providing false information must be reported.<br>  <br>  Investigators at the LA Times and Propublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization, reviewed and analyzed more than 2,000 cases involving complaints and disciplinary actions on nurses since 2002.<br>  <br>  The investigation found that in 115 recent cases the state did not pull a nurses license until that nurse racked up three or more criminal convictions.<br>  <br>  “In some cases, nurses with felony records continue to have spotless licenses—even while serving time behind bars,” reported the LA Times and Propublica.<br>  <br>  One of the nurses highlighted in the Times and Propublica investigation was a FilAm who is currently serving a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to siphoning Medicare out of more than $3 million.<br>  <br>  Fil-Am nurse Haydee Parungao admitted in 2006 to billing Medicare for “hundreds of visits to Southern California patients that she never made, charging for visits while she was out of the country and while she was gambling at Southern California casinos.”<br>  <br>  “Yet according to the state of California, she is a nurse in good standing, free to work in any hospital or medical clinic,” reported the Times and Propublica.<br>  <br>  The Times and Propublica also found that the Board of Nursing continued to renew a man’s nursing license after he was imprisoned for attempted murder; a nurse who was charged with a DUI and suspended license; and a nurse from Calimesa who, according to the investigation, was in good standing “despite a felony conviction for lewd and lascivious acts with a child.” (www.asianjournal.com)

ymqWa8GNaa	The proposal put forward is for the government to take 36% of Citi's common stock, and all preferred stock to be converted to common.  This makes sense, as the government is not going defer to other's ownership, and makes it less likely for common owners to bail out on the stock.  Preferred holders will not be happy, but such is the risk of continuing to hold a financial stock that is scrambling for survival.  <br>  <br>  The government is not aiming to maintain ownership of bank stocks.  This is their best opportunity to remain viable.  As to when they would experience regrowth, that is anybody's guess, because Obama clearly does not get it, is headed in the wrong direction with his broad spending policies and liberal intentions, is risking further damage to our economy.  Very, very sad, and the far greater risk. This is why the market is down, because no one has any idea what the rules for engagement are, are withholding their investment funds, and Obama only continues to add more confusion with his incongruent statements and profusive press conferences|`|P4gEmKaGaa	If is the keyword here...<br>  <br>  IF citigroup is nationalized, which I highly doubt it will be based on several statements, the government would pay a large discount to what the current stock price is. My advice is to sell any Citi stock that you man own and think about moving to a more stable company, my suggestion, and a company which I own shares in, is Morgan Stanley. The stock price took a big hit today along with other big name banks but Morgan Stanley has staying power. I am also bullish in the credit card sector. Visa, again another company which I own, posted strong earnings in a time when others are suffering. Visa has limited credit exposure and is a more global company than MasterCard. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Citi has struggled mightily and even with government help it will be a while till they recover. My suggestion is to take your funds out of Citi and move to a more stable bank such as Morgan Stanley. In MS your money will earn a decent dividend (decent compared to Citi's), and the potential for growth is there. <br>  <br>  If you want to avoid the credit crisis, look at Credit Card Giant, Visa (V). I own some shares of V and I'm holding on to them even through these rough times. Visa is a strong company which does not take on credit risk the way banks do, they are simply a transaction vehicle for the banks. MasterCard too is a good company, however the stock is pricier and Visa has more global coverage.

That said, keeping costs down at a company causes the company to be more profitable, and more profitable companies reward their CEOs more.<br>  <br>  Needing mansions or expensive cars is not the issue.

If you work at a company with a CEO that doesn't require a high salary, they probably aren't very good. <br>  <br>  The real problem is that publicly traded companies (or venture capital or private equity companies) focus entirely on the needs of the investors. In a small percentage of companies, they realize that happy employees and happy customers generate more profits.

Lender use the FHA 203k loan program in partnership with state and local housing agencies and nonprofit organizations to rehabilitate properties.

It's certainly an area to investigate and, last time I checked, qualified lawyers working in the field were picking up salaries in excess of ￡35,000.

It's much more difficult in this day and age.  Getting an MBA is still the best way to start.

You are liable for taxes and the amount you bid.<br>  Example  Reserve price is 225k  You will not get the house unless you bid 225k anything less and the auctioneer pulls the sale.  You need to give the auctioneer 10%  bank check.  Then your real estate lawyer steps in.  You are buying that house as is, not negotiating.  Suggest you see the County Treasurer and get a list of homes being auctioned and check them out before the date.
hl4kkvXhaa	I hope you ignored the spam Google and SMC blatherings...lol.<br>  <br>  OK.  You want to look into an education in film editing/writing.  Take classes in communications to teach you how to use verbal, written, and media communication to your advantage.  Take writing classes and English classes to improve your skills.  Take visual communications classes, art classes, and classes in graphic design.  Art and writing classes and workshops whenever possible, even if they don't fit your intended goal will help.  For instance, a story teller's workshop will help you learn to piece stories together in ways you won't learn in other types of writing classes.  Also, do a lot of reading...and know how to spot latest trends in writing and illustration.<br>  <br>  Many colleges now offer services to help you design your degree to fit your career goals, and I suggest you take this very seriously because getting into writing for television can be a lot different than writing novels, short stories, etc. because you not only need the writing skill, but also the illustration skills, and the communications skills to put this all together.  Make use of the service, and also look for a college that offers career services upon graduation because they can help you find a niche that you might not find on regular job searches.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If the situation is not remedied in a reasonable amount of time, consider contacting the Clerk of Courts in your county to place your monthly rent in an escrow account set up by the state.<br>  <br>  When you have an escrow account set up, you will pay your rent to the courts until a hearing is set or until the repairs are made to your satisfaction.<br>  <br>  Also, if you would like a more immediate approach, contact the landlord frequently until repairs are made.  If you call one time and a repair doesn't happen, the landlord may not know that the issue was never addressed.  If you are living at a community and not renting from a private landlord, try to contact the management company and/or owners.  <br>  <br>  Again, keep documentation of all contact with the landlord regarding requests for repairs.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	Your insurance agent? that is of course if you have renter's insurance.|`|25e0c280da6dad2a9e01aa347df1e70aaa	If the Manager doesn't come to fix the problem, then you should contact the person who owns the building.

Some states require that the security deposit be held in a separate account and require it to be paid back at the end of the lease term, usually within 30 days of moving out.<br>  <br>  Amounts of security deposits vary from state to state but in some states there is a cap put onto the maximum amount that a landlord is allowed to charge in security deposits (In Michigan, the maximum deposit allowed is 1 1/2 times the monthly rent).

Made $250 bucks on a bat and glove on ebay that I purchased inside a bat bag for 5 bucks (I just wanted the bag for a friends son, didnt need the contents).  <br>  <br>  You could also look up sherrifs auctions in your community as well.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Foreclosures are for houses.  You might be able to buy 'repossessed' furniture at an auction.  Storage units also auction furniture from abandoned units.<br>  <br>  Most likely, anyone who is being foreclosed on would sell their furniture at a yard sale or on craigslist.

You and the friend entered into the contract.  They expect you to pay if she doesn't.  Actually, they expect you to pay because they know she can't or won't.  That's why they required a cosigner.  NEVER cosign for anything for anyone-EVER.  <br>  She may not be able to sign another contract unless somehow she now qualifies.  She might be able to find another cosigner.  Or, you can find out how much it would take to break the contract.  If all else fails that might be your best bet.  She can stop paying at any time and your credit will take a hit.  Oh yeah, they will also start calling you day and night.

O1jigUYSaa	Take a look at your W-2.  Much of what you're asking depends upon how much was withheld at the state level and if they withheld too much or not enough.<br>  If you're an independent contractor (1099-MISC...block 7), you get to declare you expenses...however...since nothing was withheld from you pay as taxes unless you paid via voucher...you'll owe.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	That is impossible to determine from what you gave.  Refunds are based on taxes that you paid during the year, NOT income.  They are also based on credits and income adjustments.  Income is just one of about a few hundred factors that determine how much your refund is.  It is possible to make that much and not get a refund at all.  Do some research on what a refund actually is next time!|`|AA10469473	I'm not sure you understand just what a refund is.  Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.<br>  <br>  A refund isn't some sort of bonus the government gives you for working.  It's like if you went to WalMart and bought $16 worth of items, but gave the cashier a $20 bill.  You'd get a "refund" of $4, but it's not them giving you something, it's just getting your own money back.
y4SUDnpaaa	You need to ask your bank, they don't all have the same fees. Yours could be just for maintaining your account or overdraft protecions.....these are just guesses. You should check out Credit Unions, they have no fees attached to checking or savings accounts.|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	Generally a maintenance fee or service fee is because of the type of account you have or if you signed up for a special program with your bank.<br>  <br>  Example for savings. Minimum balance of 300 and 3 withdrawals per month. 3 dollar fee for going under balance. 1 dollar for every withdrawal after 3. <br>  <br>  I would check with your bank to see what type of account you have and what are the requirements so you do not get a fee. Almost all banks have free accounts so if you cannot meet the requirement switch to the free account and generally you can get back your maintenance/service fee back in the process.
sI3krJULaa	What is your question?  You need to have all of the income statement and all of the balance sheet in excel, then put those industry ratios in the same spreadsheet, at the bottom.<br>  <br>  Now, using cell references (e.g. =B5*K12), calculate those same ratios for Billy Bob Incorporated.  Look in your book, the formulas will be there.  Then set up a third column that gives you the difference between the industry ratios and those you just calculated.<br>  <br>  Using the comparison between what the industry standard is and your company, evaluate how your company is doing.  For instance, if return on total assets for your company is less than the industry standard, then say that, and explain what that would mean for the company.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :0)

This is true even for authorized users on someone's account.<br>  <br>  However, if it's a store charge card, then your mother has to add you as an authorized user on her account, with the store's central credit department. Merely handing you the card or writing a note to the store's staff and handing you the card is not enough.<br>  <br>  In both cases this is all to protect the account holder. Though it does seem to be a bit much at times, it is needed with ID theft becoming a greater and more prevalent threat to one's privacy and financial security.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Get your own card and start building your credit.

They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month.

If you have done volunteer exp that might be enough.<br>  <br>  You can sometimes take a course on being an office assitant, but it shouldn't really be nessary if you have good typing skills already.<br>  <br>  Mostly you need a clean cut image, professional clothes, good typing speed, clear communication and a can-do attitude.<br>  <br>  I got my first admin job from an agency, they can be helpful in placeing people without exp.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CAkVYHeMaa	yes volunteer work does count as experience as such, and yes colleges do have administrative assistant jobs but I would advise that you talk to a college if you do have the relative experience through volunteer work, as having the qualification on paper is more valuable, if that is the case, if you are living in the uk, local colleges do a fast track course that considering you have had experience in administration, they can offer you a free 16 week intensive course that will enable you to get a qualification and enable you to apply for a job in this sector<br>  <br>  email me if you want more info <br>  <br>  good luck|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Yes<br>  Yes<br>  Yes<br>  Go to HR and apply|`|1yyfXr7oaa	If u wana earn money online working from home<br>  then u can joint the online money making programs<br>  listed here<br>  <a href="http://earnmoneyonlinecash30.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://earnmoneyonlinecash30.notlong.com</a><br>  work part time n with time your income will<br>  be more than full time|`|FnDEZ811aa	f
PXMqXwflaa	Your concern is a common one for first time buyers. Don't panic.  It's something every homeowner has to deal with.<br>  <br>  While it is always a bit daunting to see how much interest you will pay out over the life of the loan, that's the way mortgages are underwritten to make them affordable to home buyers while profitable to lenders. Also, keep in mind there are tax benefits from the mortgage interest you'll be paying during the time you own the home.<br>  <br>  Don't let it stop you from buying the home you want. It's a great time to buy! Just make sure you've got an experienced realtor looking out for your welfare. Good luck.|`|VV0z3bRWaa	When applying for a home loan your credit report will be reviewed and you may be required to provide a number of other details, including: Employment and income records, Tax Returns for the last few years List of assets, List of liabilities and what you owe, Your budget showing monthly living expenses so that you can demonstrate an ability to pay.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/homeloans.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/homeloans....</a><br>  <br>  With this information you and your lender will be able to determine the kind of home loan and size of the right mortgage for you. In some cases, you can obtain a pre-approval or pre-qualified certificate, which shows how much you can borrow so that you can then shop for homes in an appropriate price range.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	Without specifics to illustrate what you are saying, it is difficult to answer your question.

Thanks to you changing your mind the owner lost of month of advertising the house for rent.|`|RZzMse3Haa	You paid the deposit to hold - you backed out - you lose said deposit.  This is standard practice.  Everything else you posted is completely immaterial and has no bearing on the situation.
MmTe8W8uaa	The bank sells (or tries to sell) the home.  If the house sells for more than what you owe (plus the cost of the sale), the bank gives you the difference.  If the house sells, but for more than what you owe (plus the cost of the sale), the bank gives you no money, but reduces the amount that you owe by the amount for which the house sold (minus the cost of the sale).  If the house does not sell, then you receive no money and continue to owe all the money.<br>  <br>  In all three cases, it does not matter whether there was a downpayment or not.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	If you lose your house the bank then sells it to someone else.<br>  If the price is more than your mom owes, the difference is given to your mom.  Example:  Mom owes 100k  House sells for 150k after expenses the bank would give your mom 25k|`|eZDoQPg8aa	I'd be wary also.  They might have gotten money back if the house was sold and the proceeds were enough to cover the mortgage and all the fees......|`|aKEK24o4aa	no you don't get money from the bank.<br>  <br>  When you lose a house that means you have not been able to pay on the mortgage, therefore you owe the bank money, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  btw: the only way you get money on your home is if you sell it and there is equity left after all payoffs have been made.|`|RZzMse3Haa	You are right- that is not true.

AA11065140	1.  No.  I've been doing my taxes online for years now, and I'm thrilled.  H&R Block's product is very easy to use, and their prices are quite reasonable.<br>  <br>  2.  It really depends.  Technically, you can file as "married filing jointly" or "married filing separate".  Try processing the forms both ways, to see which gives you the best deal.  There probably won't be a huge difference.|`|AA10469473	nanas_lil_guy is confused.  A married person does NOT file as head of household, and it DOES make a difference whether you file a joint return or file as married filing separately - joint is almost always better except in pretty rare situations.|`|O1jigUYSaa	In general, you're better off filing joint.<br>  There are isolated cases where married filing separately is good.  You and your husband make the same money is one of them.<br>  However, you don't get to use any of the credits if you file married separately.<br>  Good luck.|`|l23ttRePaa	You can file with Turbo Tax if it's not a long form and is free. The more detailed your return is the more it will cost depending on the site you choose. Our family has been with Turbo Tax for a number of years now.<br>  <br>  As for filing married or a separate return really makes no difference but your husband will most likely be filing Head Of Household. <br>  <br>  Depending on how much you made you may have to pay in or you may get a refund. <br>  <br>  Check into it further and also go to the federal tax site, it will answer most of the questions you may have on the subject.<br>  <br>  The best to you whichever way you choose to go.<br>  <br>  Have a great evening.|`|wlXt7T1waa	I would say that in 99% of cases it is better to file married filing joint.  If you file married filing separate, two things happen: <br>  <br>  1.  You become ineligible for certain credits you may have otherwise been qualified for<br>  2.  If one of you itemizes deductions the other one automatically is required to and will have to use $0 if there is nothing to itemize.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with filing online yourself.  Try www.irs.gov and see if you qualify for the IRS's FreeFile this year.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

guLbTHeDaa	Most serious prepaid credit cards can have online statements just like any other cards.<br>  It is also wrong to say that prepaid credit cards are debit cards, they are two VERY different things.<br>  To have a Full visa prepaid card you just need to be 13 years old with a SS number, while to have a debit card you must open a BANK ACCOUNT and for that you will need your  parent's help..<br>  <br>  As to this question we don't know who issued it so we can't say anything for sure, for instance if it is a mickey mouse gift card from the stores that can't be recharged you might not be able to see any transaction for it, but if it is a normal prepaid mastercard then yes, there will be a link to a site with a password and a full range of services connected with it, including a list of all transactions.<br>  <br>  This is an example of a prepaid card that is NOT like a debit card in that it doesn't require you to have a bank account, it doesn't require you to be an adult and it will provide you with online statements etc etc<br>  <a href="http://finance.ebookorama.com/PrepaidVisa.php?id=ggcku" rel="nofollow">http://finance.ebookorama.com/PrepaidVis...</a>|`|0yqQg9CXaa	It sounds like a prepaid visa gift card - not a prepaid credit card.<br>  A prepaid credit card would be called a debit card.<br>  <br>  It's a visa gift card.<br>  Charges will not show up anywhere.<br>  /
pt6wIlS1aa	It really depends on the landlord or complex. If it's a long-term rental unit, they may provide only basic furniture and window shades or blinds.<br>  <br>  If it's a short-term rental unit, they might also provide linens, basic kitchen items like dishes, pots and pans, and small appliances. <br>  <br>  Some, usually the higher-priced ones, provide pretty much everything. if you know where you're moving and you're not sure, just call and ask what's there.<br>  <br>  I've lived in a number of furnished apartments over the years, from my first college apt. where it was just the furniture and window treatments, to one in a private house where it included dishes, TV, stereo, even books and records, to a couple of corporate stay apartments where TVs, coffee makers, etc are standard. They usually supply small samples of soap, dishwasher soap, laundry soap, etc to get you started.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Have you found the furnished apartment you want to rent yet?  If so, call them and ask what exactly is furnished in the apartment.<br>  <br>  Better than a bunch of us guessing what may or may not be there, as every apartment probably comes with the basics: couch, bed, nightstand, table etc...but maybe the place you choose also comes with more?|`|OAKuDqXXaa	Furnished apartments generally include a bed, couch, tables, and desk.  Some may include a microwave.  That is really about it I think.  You can check with the apartment management if you are really interested.  But paying for a furnished apartment is usually not worth it, unless you are only living there for 6 months or less.  You can rent a small truck and tow a car behind it.  Or you can buy new furniture when you get there.  Paying to use furniture that isn't yours and you don't get to take with you when you move out is not a good investment.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	If you are less than 59.5 years old, be aware that there is an immediate 10% tax on the amount withdrawn from your 401k, so your $5000 is now $4500.  (I'm assuming that you don't meet the medical hardship requirements that may hold off that penalty...)<br>  <br>  Then, since it is not a loan but a withdrawal, the $5000 in your 401k (assuming a traditional 401k and not a Roth 401k) is considered as income to you for the year.  So, the $5000 will bump up your yearly income/salary by $5000, and you'll be taxed on the added "income" by both federal and state.  (You pay into the traditional 401k with pre-tax dollars, so when it comes out you have to pay income taxes on it).  The withdrawal could bump up your tax bracket...   So, come tax time, expect to pay somewhere around 20-30% of $5000 in taxes (so about $1000-$2000 in taxes).<br>  <br>  After all that, your $5000 withdrawal only nets you about $2500-$3500.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you have the opportunity cost of taking money out of this savings account, where the full $5000 could be earning you money.  (You could be getting a few +% if your 401k funds are safely in money market accounts or CDs, and you won't be losing money...)  Also be aware that a 401k account cannot be touched by creditors, such as if you go through bankruptcy, but the cash that you take out can be...<br>  <br>  In general, it is a poor choice to take money out of your 401k fund when you are not in retirement...|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	If you are under the age of 59 1/2 the penalty will be 20% and the federal taxes that will be due another 20%. There is no state tax.|`|O1jigUYSaa	10% penalty on the withdrawal.  Plus whatever the impact is for you in declaring it as income.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Income tax at your highest marginal rate plus $500|`|d331dd95c4a1ebbb6ed4bd0996d3a0b6aa	20-25% conservative estimate|`|wlXt7T1waa	You will have a 10% early withdrawal penalty as well as income tax.  Most people fall in the 10% tax bracket, so you should have 20% withheld at the least.  I do not know what your income level is, so you may want to have 25% withheld to be safe.|`|bNBpwCEOaa	Federal taxes are about 33%.|`|AA10469473	10% penalty, or $500, if you are under age 59-1/2.  This is in addition to income tax - that depends on your total income for the year but is very likely 10% or 15% - could be more or less though.
swTjhCznaa	NOOOOO...  It's easy<br>  <br>  Are you in the USA?  If so, search the state you wish to establish the company--the secretary of state.  Just type in "[state] secretary of state".  Search that site for the appropriate filing papers.  There will be a filing fee of about $150-200 depending on what state with which you file.  Then search for an "Operating Agreement."  Just type "sample operating agreement".  You should be able to find one and add your own stipulations and conditions.  <br>  <br>  Very easy.  It would cost $750-1000 (plus filing fee) to hire a lawyer.... RIP OFF!!!!|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	The tax # comes with a business license purchased from your state department of revenue.<br>  <br>   www.legalzoom.com is the place to form your LLC inexpensively|`|Vq8Szjs9aa	I've formed several LLC's and Corporations so trust me when I tell you that you are wasting your money using any online LLC formation website or an attorney.  Go to your state's government website, click on the "doing business" (or similar) tab and file the docs yourself.  Simple, quick, inexpensive and eeeeeeeeeeasy.<br>  <br>  Several words of caution, though.  You said you have a corporation (".....I am now working on forming an LLC for my Virtaul Services Corporation.....") that you are converting to an LLC.  If that is true, you will incur some tax ramifications and will likely want to consult a tax attorney before proceeding.  If it is not true, then no worries.  Also, some states do not allow single member LLC's.  If you are going to be the only member of your LLC, you will want to check into this first.<br>  <br>  The EIN (tax ID for your entity) does not come from your state department.  It comes from the IRS.  That too is a simple online form that you fill out at www.irs.gov.  It's also free.<br>  <br>  Most states will require that you have a registered agent when forming an LLC.  This simply means a "party" that is responsible for receiving correspondence from the state throughout the year as it pertains to your business.  However, you can serve as your own registered agent (for free), so long as you have an address where the government docs are being sent to.  I recommend a mail box rental from MailBoxes, etc/Pakmail, PostNet, etc.  You will not be able to use a PO box for your registered agent filing.  Lastly, you shouldn't use your home address as the general public will have access to that information.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Do-it-yourself.

They are the easiest to obtain credit from.  Also, my son who was not a student, got his first card from American Eagle Outfitters.  It was only a 100.00 limit, but once he paid on time for 6 months, he was approved for a Capitol One card.  From there, he obtained much more credit.  It's all about paying on time and growing what you have.<br>  Good luck!!

I was a computer programmer, trainer, community college instructor and now administrate non-credit online programs. <br>  <br>  You said you're interested in Education, but don't want to necessarily use your technical skills..or teach. So I assume you're still interested in using your project management skills. You could work towards being an Administrator or Manager at an institution of  Higher Education (for a community college or university). You could then specialize in either the "credit" or "non-credit" or the "continuing education" part of the college. <br>  <br>  You could also specialize in:<br>  content development (instructional design and development);<br>  educational research and policy analysis;<br>  educational psychology; <br>  instructional technology; <br>  school adminstration; or<br>  manage a specific department you're interested in and/or have experience with (as a program coordinator, program director, an assistant dean, dean, or vice president);<br>  or focus on training and development, and continue to work in the corporate world.  <br>  <br>  I'd look at some Masters of Education programs near you to see what courses look interesting (I'm taking my masters all online)...but with project management skills, you can manage/administrate a lot of different types of programs at colleges and universities, without getting another degree. Since you have IT experience, many colleges would be interested in you, since so many programs require computer and internet expertise. <br>  <br>  Community colleges don't require a masters or doctorate for as many of their administrator positions as universities do, so you may want to explore the positions available to you in your area first. But, community colleges often pay a great deal less than universities, so if you decide you like what you're doing, you could then explore getting more education.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|d00f07fee843d6f28d0e6390574cc993aa	electricians/ school project managers|`|f204f9a2a08b07906da7fcc16e34e34daa	principal, asst. principal, IT department, if there is one

For instance, if a joint bank account owner goes through a divorce, his spouse could claim a right to some of the funds in the account. Even if the joint owner who deposited all of the money could prove that he contributed all of the funds to the account, he might have to go to court to stop the spouse from getting the money.<br>  <br>  One of the basic features of a joint account is the "right of survivorship." This means that the money left in the account after one joint owner dies automatically goes to the surviving joint owner.|`|Kzo3Uscpaa	Joint bank accounts are just that, two people can put money in, two people can take money out.

9Wi2eNInaa	Managers at the retail level have nothing to judge young employees by other than their crappy resumes.<br>  <br>  You need to stand out a little. By calling the manager you are doing something that the other 99% won't do, so you WILL be noticed.<br>  <br>  Managers like to think people have some initiative and kind of like someone a little better who appreciates a job<br>  <br>  I think your parents are right on<br>  <br>  I was a retail manager, and most kids scared me to death, so usually I preferred retired people who cared about their work and wanted to feel worthwhile regardless of the actual task. So if your a kid and want a job, believe me, no manager is going to think your a stalker. They are so used to kids who don't give a crap they are dying of thirst for a slightly ambitious upbeat kid<br>  <br>  It only takes a minute for a manager to hire someone. If he hasn't hired anyone yet it might be because everybody looks the same to him and he just fired a same old same old, or didn't show up for work and isn't in a hurry to find another loser. <br>  <br>  You stand out, and your chances are far greater of getting hired|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You cannot guarantee that a message was delivered so, while it could be too late, it's worth a call saying you called and left a message before, but hadn't heard from anybody.<br>  <br>  These kinds of places have high turnover, so even if he didn't hire you, one of the people he did hire might not work out.  So call!  That's how I got one of my all time favorite jobs.  I called to follow up just when they were regretting their choice.  They let the other person go and hired me, and I kept the job for three years.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	1.) Going there showed your interest in the not only the food, but working there.  You are a dedicated customer.<br>  2.) Calling and asking IS THE RIGHT thing to do.

Don't worry it happens all the time!|`|AA10772154	I have hired people who after an interview came to see me personally as a follow up.

He sees lots and lots of customers all the time...and it may have just looked like a customer waving goodbye.  And since you didn't speak to him - it certainly doesn't count as "contact".<br>  <br>  4) You have absolutely nothing to lose by calling...except possibly losing the chance to get hired.|`|RM4DqEAUaa	i think that you shouldn't call  because i eman you were jsut there it owuld seem liek you were coming to look and see if there was anybody new there working already. and jsut cuz its the 25th deosn't mean its not the end of the month!

In a year or so your two hospital related items will fall off your credit record which will help also.
2N6oTOLQaa	The new stimulus that passed earlier this month does not involve any checks. There are various parts of it that might increase your unemployment or social security benefits (if you're receiving something like that). Plus the tax rates will be a little lower so your employer should take a little bit less out of each paycheck ($13 per paycheck on average). But there won't be any direct checks like last year.<br>  <br>  What you heard about not getting money this year if you got it last year is in regards to the recovery rebate tax credit on the 2008 tax forms. This is a tax credit that works like a 2nd chance to claim the stimulus money from the payments in 2008. People who received the stimulus payments in full can't claim this credit because the credit is just a 2nd chance for those people who didn't get their stimulus for one reason or another.|`|AA10469473	Close.  If you got one last year but qualify for more based on your 2008 return, you'll get the extra.

The stimulus is just a collection of spending proposals to "stimulate" the economy, which does not mean people will be getting money directly unless that's one of the items in the package.

They can put you on a schedule and the late people may move in without something they need. If you are calling too early they will tell you when to call again. They will need a deposit unless you are with that company already.  Call way ahead to have your  now service shut off. If you are moving on Monday ask to have turned on Monday early. If you are moving out on a monday  ask to have it turned off on monday late, Be sure you have what you need because moving into or out of a cold or hot place wears you out.
JXYMtYFDaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

qBCGH52haa	Info on "Established Business Relations"<br>  <br>  What about an established business relationship?<br>  <br>  A telemarketer or seller may call a consumer with whom it has an established business relationship for up to 18 months after the consumer's last purchase, delivery, or payment - even if the consumer's number is on the National Do Not Call Registry. In addition, a company may call a consumer for up to three months after the consumer makes an inquiry or submits an application to the company. And if a consumer has given a company written permission, the company may call even if the consumer's number is on the National Do Not Call Registry.<br>  <br>  One caveat: if a consumer asks a company not to call, the company may not call, even if there is an established business relationship. Indeed, a company may not call a consumer - regardless of whether the consumer's number is on the registry - if the consumer has asked to be put on the company's own do not call list.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The only way they are exempt because of an existing business relationship is if their calls are in regards to the services you already have with them.

For eg. If you say that the product you produce meet certain qulity tests, you carry out on each of the item and check its quality and also go for sampling methods, etc.  If you are  providing services like food chains, airlines - you can always audit by checking whether services are provided in time, quality food, customer complaints, etc.. <br>  If you are talking about operations, you set some standards for your operations and meet them.  Normally there are few third party agencies like ISO / TQM etc.  help in auditing and meeting your quality standards.<br>  For personal quality,  you are the one to set your own targets / goals and audit them your measuring scales and lead a quality life.<br>  <br>  I hope the above answers your Q

You should always incorporate your business because it limits your personal liability, provides tax breaks, and enables you to set up different types of retirement plans.  401Ks are offered by employers to employees.  Your best bet would most likely be a traditional or Roth IRA.  Again, check with your local advisor.|`|AeTciMA3aa	The best suggestion anyone can give you is go to a professional investment company Like Charles Schwab, Dean Whitter, or one of the others.

Taking advice from anyone other then a professional could end up costing you big time in the long run.  I hope this helps.

In addition to everything else we want to rent a small, but good selection of DVD’s and Videos. Someone we spoke with said we could just go to our local record/video store, buy them and then rent them. I don’t think this is true and that we need some sort of license to do this. What do you say?”<br>  <br>  The answer is that “there are no special licenses or copyright requirements for renting videos for general home use. Note, though, that they are licensed “for home use only”, but you’re renting them “for home use only”. Now if someone turns around and shows that video to a large group, they have violated copyright law, but you haven’t (unless, of course, you knowingly rented it to them for that purpose, in which case there might be a problem). Ultimately, though, it’s up to them to get the license, not you.”|`|xhOw5yTmaa	As a manager of a major video store chain, I can tell you that there are no technical legal issues you have to worry about with studios. The FBI warning only pertains to making money from showing the movie without the studios who own the film rights receiving royalties (i.e. public showings of the film in which tickets are sold, but royalties are not paid). <br>  <br>  You might want to also contact companies like RentTrack that way you won't be spending more than needed to purchase movies. These companies offer contracts on a "rentailer" practice of being paid back from the amount of times the movies are rented, instead of having to purchase the movies all at once. <br>  <br>  And not to discourage you, but please understand that there are a GREAT many disadvantages that you'll face with running a video rental store. First and foremost, piracy will be the hardest hit to your business. Secondly, don't underestimate your competition: Netflix is a dragon to slay. Late fees can make or break your business and clientel. Watch your discounting and monetary losses: meaning free rentals seem like a great gimmick to get customer into your store, but at the end of the day, you'll find that you've given away more free stuff than you've made money. <br>  <br>  My best recommendation--coming from 5 years of experience--is to talk to the video stores in your area, and even apply for a part-time job with them. This industry is one of the hardest to stay on top of. Best of luck to you!

Best of Luck!!|`|ed49a27250511d7c217c83dec62b67d2aa	my job did me the same thing to before they cut anymore find a new job
phKTKDRvaa	maybe certain commercials arent appropriate for disney channel|`|17fb5e9de77686a65cd19f7b51afea48aa	no. but's it really isn't a big deal.|`|AA10640308	well thats something iv'e always wondered also.. i guess maybe they think some commercials are inappropriate for children so they stick to their own  company..|`|FCWntPqNaa	Essentially its because they don't have to.  And because they don't have advertisers and thus don't have to appease any out side source when it comes to what they air they have complete control over the schedule and content of the channel.<br>  <br>  Any channel that has outside advertisers is somewhat at their mercy.  If an advertiser that has a large contract decideds they don't like a show they can threaten to pull out which in tail could hurt the channel financially.  <br>  <br>  Disney bypasses this problem.  They are one of the few that can simply because they own everything involved in making their channel.  All the cartoons, movies, and TV shows that appear on Disney are owned by Disney.  The commercials are for their products and other media services such as DVDs and websites.  So in the long run they probably make more money since they don't have to worry about outside interference.|`|LNhTEVtgaa	Disney Channel is it's own sponsor. They do not endorse other companies. Once in a while you may see a McDonalds commercial in use of Disney being a part of the advertisement. If you only see Disney, you'll only watch Disney and use items with Disney, visit DisneyWorld/Land and watch Disney made movies. There hoping consumers only Eat, Breathe, and Live Disney.

zznOPIgCaa	One of the best job search web sites out there is   indeed.com    The things that I like about Indeed are that it is really user friendly and that it takes all the job listing from several sources and brings them all together.   You can also do a google with entering the name of the state where you want to work with the word employment after it. (Florida employment,,,, Texas employment)  I'm an employment specialist and if I can be of any further help please feel free to contact me at   skibum0109@yahoo.com.

Its courtesy to follow up but sometimes the people doing the hiring aren't all that educated.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	It is rude to not follow up with an interviewee within a short period of time. <br>  It is odd that all 5 companies would fail to do so.<br>  If you have folowed up with letters or email, and still hear nothing, it is safe to assume you are not being considered. <br>  But look on the bright side, who would want to work for a rude company anyway?|`|zznOPIgCaa	Four weeks is a bit long.  If you have a phone number call them and find out if the position has been filled.  Just for future reference, you should never leave an interview without asking two questions and those are; "when do you anticipate filling the position" and the other is "may I have a business card"  With the first one you will have an idea of when, and not leave yourself waiting weeks just to find out that it has been filled.  Also if they don't know or think that it will be a while, then ask the interviewer if you can periodically call back and check on the position.  The other question is so that you have a card with the person's name on it and the phone number so that you can call them back.  The other thing that you have is there address so that after the interview you can send them a thank you letter.  I'm an employment specialist and if I can be of any further help feel free to e-mail me at   skibum0109@yahoo.com

D8ddXEBuaa	Money set aside into an FSA for daycare expenses is limited to $5,000.  This $5,000 will save you around $1,633 in federal taxes if you are in the 25% tax bracket.  You have to decide if your tax savings from the childcare FSA will be greater than the federal child and dependant care credit.  The federal child care and dependant credit is only $600 for one child and $1,200 for two or more children.|`|oYa4ubyiaa	The maximum for a flex plan is $5000.  And these are pre-tax deductions.  The maximum child care credit is $6000 post tax.  <br>  <br>  And actually, because the $5000 flex plan is a pre-tax deduction, it sames you more money at tax time.

Cuando empece en esto esta pregunta me hice y para contestarla y comprenderla invertí como 25000.00 en cursos y practica de algu?os a?os.<br>  <br>  Yo te aconsejaría primero: define que quieres certificar con ese sistema de calidad (k producto o servicio)<br>  2, determina la norma que más se ajuste a eso que quieras certificar con tu sistema. (Lo más común y comercial es la norma ISO 9001:2000) <br>  3. Entiende que todo sistema se maneja por procesos. Identifica cuales son esos procesos que engloban eso que kieras certificar.<br>  4. Empieza a documentar.<br>  (LA CLAVE PARA IMPLANTAR SISTEMAS DE CALIDAD Y ES LO QUE SE REVISA EN LAS AUDITORIAS ES: COMPROBAR ESO QUE ESTA ESCRITO)<br>  Puedes hacer procedimientos o instrucciones de trabajo, y los formatos que serán los que te serviran de base para comprobar eso que dices en tus manuales, procedimientos o instructivos.<br>  <br>  Vas a tener que leer mucho al respecto.<br>  Te recomiendo para empezar: ISO 9001:2000 Guia practica de normas para implantarlas en la empresa de Jesus Monta?o Larios de Editorial Trillas.<br>  Tambien ve consiguiendo un juego de normas originales de las Iso 9001:2000, la compras en el IMNC (buscalo en Internet)<br>  Y definitivamente deberás tomar un curso, te recomieno los que ANCE ofrece, tambien checa internet.|`|c7Qd8aiyaa	Dime k nesecitas, trabajo en una empresa petrokimika y nos rigen las normas de kalidad ISO9000/2000, te puedo ayudar???
