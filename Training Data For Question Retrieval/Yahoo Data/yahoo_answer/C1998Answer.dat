AA10816118	Your old A/C is using 220 volt service. Most newer A/C's dont use 220 Volts. In the old days that was the way to go because most of the parts required that much voltage. Best bet is to pick up a real heavy duty extension cord from either home depot or your local hardware store and you should be fine.

QlAa4qEIaa	This is a feature on many digital cameras including compact cams, it allows you to operate faster shutter speeds in low light  conditions.  It is best for low light situations where you don't want to use a flash e.g. shooting glass or other reflective surfaces or low light situations where tripods are not allowed (or unavailable).  The downside however to using higher ISO settings (anything above 400 really) is that it creates a significant amount of "noise",  those pesky little color speckles .  By using editing software like PS the amount of noise can be reduced but at the cost of losing image sharpness.  If it can be avoided, it's best to stay under ISO 400 and use ISO 100 whenever possible, your images will come out much cleaner, especially when printing larger sizes.|`|KodRTvtEaa	If i'am correct the iso feature lets you control your shutter speed manually.|`|g0fmOefEaa	bhavneet s, The ISO setting on a digital camera mimics the traditional film camera where ISO refers to the sensitivity of the film to light. The lower the ISO is, the lower the sensitivity to light and, most importantly, the lowest level of "granularity" in the picture. <br>  <br>  If you set your camera setting to ISO 800/1600 you should be able to take picture without flash in low light situations (Inside the house, at night) but be aware that the "quality" of the picture will be affected, it is also referred to higher level of noise or pixelasation. Hope this help
NWhz0pvfaa	Turn the mode knob to Tv (stands for shutter priority and turn the roller knob by the shutter button.  In this mode, you set the shutter speed the camera sorts out aperture for a good exposure.|`|QlAa4qEIaa	The Digital Rebel is a great beginning SLR and can really help take your photography to the next level.  The best thing you can do is to put your camera on M giving you the greatest control.  This allows you to control both the shutter speed (by turning the click wheel near the shutter release) and the aperture (the size of the camera's opening).  This will not only allow you to get a proper exposure, but will allow you to achieve various "effects" such as a sharp subject with a blurred background.  Learning the relationship between shutter speed, aperture, and depth of field (how far you can see "in focus") will prove an invaluable asset in taking photos even if it is just holiday snapshots.  Here is a blog with a great article on understanding shutter speed if you're interested...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://photodoto.com/index.php/2006/04/16/understanding-exposure-shutter-speed-aperture-and-iso/" rel="nofollow">http://photodoto.com/index.php/2006/04/1...</a>|`|dfUTRsYtaa	Read your instruction manual,

In fact, there were so few that each call was routed by hand by operators.  In the old days you picked up a phone and told the operator who you're calling.  Even today, in my grandmother's small town, people only have 5-digit phone numbers.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to make a call in 1905 you'd do so through a pay phone.  These were frequently in the back of drug stores, bars, hotels or restaurants.  If you wanted to call locally you'd say something like "Pennsylvania 6-5000".  The "Pennsylvania" part was what prefixes are today.  (PE=73, so the number would be 736-5000.)  They marked the geographic location of the person you were calling.<br>  <br>  Long distance calling wasn't very affordable and was even impossible at times.  It was so infrequent that in old movies they'll say things like, "It's Jim--LONG DISTANCE".  It was less expensive to send a telegram over long distances.
MowOCI4haa	I'll give you two scenarios for finding a public telephone in that era.  If the town had a hotel, usually the hotel would have a telephone for the use of the tenets in or near the lobby area.  Another would be the location of the community switch board or the location of the local community telephone operator.  They had one phone installed for the public use.  <br>       In the early days of telephone service, it could happen that some people in a community were served by telephone company #1 and the person or business across the street were served by telephone company #2 and the couldn't connect with each other.  Competition existed until one company bought the other or one went broke.  <br>       There are many good sources for data like which you are seeking.  good luck to you and may the good lord take a liken' to ya'.|`|LEO4i4Yjaa	Hey u answered my other q and i did the same q because no one was answering my q and i just want to say that i think that was sorta mean what u said but i don't mean to sound mean but if i do sorry. <br>  <br>  P.S.Idk
d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	Its been here for a while mate.<br>  Hope you have a windows computer, here's what i did:<br>  I performed a successful tethered jailbreak on my ipod touch 2G one month ago using the RedSn0w tool for windows 32 bit, and I have used Cydia and Installer flawlessly. I rebooted or turned off the ipod a few times since (just to see it was possible), and everything is going great. Here is the site of the guide I used:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/gui-jailbreaking-ipod-touch-2nd-gen-application-for-windows-released/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  This is the best GUI method out there, and really easy and quick (I used codename: Cynw00d). Follow the instructions carefully, and you should be set. The links of where to download the app are there. But you'll need the firmware ipsw file its self. I used the latest version of firmware for the ipod touch (5H11a) and it works great. Here is a trustworthy site where I always get my ipod touch firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  So thats it! Thats all you need to know! I will say this, there is this one step in the app where you need to select the firmware that you will patch to jailbreak. The first time I did this, I didn't highlight it. Everything wil seem okay, but a later step won't work. So don't forget to highlight the firmware you wish to use for the jailbreak when the app asks you!<br>  <br>  ~ilz|`|xoNYatuiaa	search google for "quickpwn"|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	You can jailbreak the ipod touch already. try <a href="http://www.redsn0w.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redsn0w.com/</a> to read about it, then use the Jailbreak Helper at <a href="http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141302/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/show...</a> to jailbreak it.<br>  <br>  It is a bit long and a bit complicated.

AA10594501	Let me guess. You have Comcast Digital Cable. One of its "wonderful" features is that it needs its own box at EVERY TV.|`|RyvKws7Laa	If you split the line before it hits the comcast box, you might be able to still pull it off.  You just buy a splitter from any radio shack or whatever.  Continue the feed into the box for the main TV.  Then run the other line straight into the other TV.  But, and this is important, the other tv, that doesn't have the box, needs to have a built in digital tuner.  In theory you will then get the basic set of channels fed to the second TV (and can change the channels independent of the other TV).    But the secondary set won't have any of the fancy menus (guide, PPV, VoD, etc).  I don't know Comcast's setup well enough though, so don't know if they've found a way to prevent that kind of setup from working.  But I know a lot of cable co's don't bother, so you can get away with that.

akvrwpywaa	No.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with buying a CRT (tube) TV.  CRT's often provide a better picture overall than LCD televisions.  They offer greater contrast and deeper blacks, have much faster response times, are not bound by a native resolution, have been proven to last longer if taken care of, cannot suffer from dead pixels, AND cost less.  Sure, they might be bigger and heavier, but you'll probably be watching your TV much more often than you will be moving it.<br>  Just because something's the latest doesn't mean it's the greatest.<br>  And most new CRT televisions have a digital tuner, so you most likely won't need to buy a converter box if you want to watch air broadcast.|`|QjS3zl3Yaa	Well I guess there is nothing wrong with getting a tube tv but they are out dated and heavy. I recommend you go with the LCD if you have the dough. <br>  <br>  LCD TV:<br>  <br>  Advantages: -<br>  -Light Weight, not big and bulky<br>  -Better Picture Maybe HD depends.<br>  -Digitel you wont need a converter box for watching tv when all tv goes digitel.<br>  -Gives out ALOT less radiation so will give your eyes a rest.<br>  -You can wall mount for a better look<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  -Cost, some lcd are expensive<br>  -Rare cases of dead pixels were you get little black dots on your screen but it is extremely rare with lcd tvs, its more common with small lcds like mp3 players and such<br>  <br>  Conclusion:<br>  Even though you spend the extra dough you get what you are paying for and if you are using it for tv than later you wont have to buy a converter box.<br>  <br>  So get a lcd its deff worth it trust me :)|`|spaMZZiVaa	Like someone said before the only thing that matters is what you're going to be watching. If you DO NOT subscribe to a satellite or cable provider  and therefore rely on over-the-air broad cast then getting an LCD would probably be best since, like someone else said, they can at least pick up digital signals without the need of a converter box and the digital picture would be better than a analog or digital picture in a tube TV.<br>  <br>  If you DO have satellite or cable then a TV (depending on brand) may be a better deal. Tube TV will last longer than any other technology in the market today. But also are the only ones still affected by magnets.<br>  <br>  I know Sears has off-brand 32" LCDs for $399 and like a 19" Samsung and Sony for around $250.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Nothing wrong with buying a tube if that's all you want and need.  However, I hesitate recommending a CRT TV considering they're so out-dated.  But if you didn't have a Blu-ray player or HD cable you'd be wasting an HDTV anyway, so stick with the tube.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	It has to be tonight?  Will you turn into a pumpkin if you don't?<br>  <br>  tube type TVs are just fine.  This will probably be standard definition, not HD.  Make sure you check on that.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for tube type standard definition TVs, I highly recommend looking on craigslist.org for a used one.  Lots of people are making the switch to HD big screens, and are selling their not very old TVs in that size for a lot less, probably $50 or less.  <br>  <br>  Save a perfectly good TV from the landfill and save a lot of dough in the process!|`|RyvKws7Laa	The tube will work just fine still.  Its just going to be big and clunky is all. But it will actually give better picture quality than an LCD.  Though at $200 I imagine you're getting an SD one not an HD one.  The LCD, even small sizes at least can support HD signals.  Though that may or may not be an issue for you.

t562uTmMaa	Yes you can connect to the internet on your cell phone. T-mobile and others have a flat fee for this. Internet access is harder than voice calls and requires a lot more bandwidth. You should go to the website below. They do a better job of explaining this than I can, but there is a fee for this because without the extra bandwidth, internet access would be slower than dial up.

3CJAUyqPaa	It depends what you want to use the camera for. "Better" is a relative term.<br>  <br>  The GL2 is still considered prosumer (or low-end pro) camcorder. The manual controls - focus, zoom, iris, audio level control, white balance, among others - are easier to get to. The large lens and large imaging chips (when compared to the smaller lens and imaging chips used by consumer cams - whether HD or not) will do a much better job in low-light situations. The lens set up makes for easier depth of field applications. The integrated "handle" makes for easier/steadier "run and shoot" video capture.<br>  <br>  If a consumer HDV cam and a GL2 are used on tripods next to each other under ideal light, yes, the consumer HDV cam will provide a much clearer video image - after all, HDV captures 4 times more video information than DV. And, if you use a Canon HV30, it does 24p and 30p capture that the GL2 does not do. The GL2 has been available for many years and is still considered a workhorse under many conditions.<br>  <br>  But your comparing these different categories of camcorders is like comparing a 2003 Cadillac CTS to a 2009 fully loaded Malibu.
AA11050946	As you say, the Omnia is a PDA and mobile phone. As such, it's very much in need of serious setting up and is not as straight forward to use, either out of the box, or even after a few weeks of constant tweaking. However, as you can load a variety of skins and applications, and pretty much make it into what you want, it's a gem. But, only if you're pretty good already at twiddling with your home PC, because that's all it is, a mini PC - needs love but will reward.<br>  The Renoir is an out of the box diamond, but is not a PDA and hence can't be configured to your own personal taste (beyond the limited options that they give you, that is).

0AUTZt5Aaa	OK the PS3 IS selling, here is a bit of math to prove it.<br>  <br>  The Xbox 360 has sold around 29 million units in 39 months<br>  The PS3 has sold around 22 million units in 27 months<br>  <br>  360 average a month: 743 000<br>  PS3 average a month: 814 000<br>  <br>  Just because it sold more total units doesn't mean it is better.<br>  <br>  FYI: The cheaper thing is usually worse than the more expensive thing. It is like saying the Honda Civic (360) is better than the Bugatti Veyron (PS3) because it sells more.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	1.  It's too expensive.  Not a good thing when we're in a recession.<br>  <br>  2.  Most people aren't sold on Blu-ray.  Once Blu-ray becomes the standard, then the PS3 should do better.<br>  <br>  3.  Not enough great exclusive games.  Metal Gear Solid 4, LittleBigPlanet, Valkyria Chronicles, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Resistance 1, 2, Uncharted, Ratchet & Clank, Heavenly Sword isn't going to cut it.<br>  <br>  4.  Losing exclusive rights to games that were exclusive to the PS2:  GTA IV, Resident Evil 5, Final Fantasy XIII, Tekken 6, Tales series, Ace Combat 5.<br>  <br>  5.  360 games got downloadable contents, while PS3 gamers are still waiting.|`|mb3ooc3uaa	Mainly the price I think. When the PS3 was released the starting price was $499 and $599. I don't want to pay that much for a gaming console. People say it's worth it cause it has a blu-ray player. Guess what, I could care less about blu-ray players. Then you could say it doesn't really have a big name exclusive game. When Halo3 and both Gears of War came out, I saw ads on tv for those all the time. The most commercials I saw for a PS3 game was for Haze, and that game I think bombed. I only saw one Killzone 2 commercial. This is how I think of the two consoles. The 360 is geared more towards online games and PS3 more single player. Gaming is online right now, so that might be why as well.|`|pl2SocVKaa	don't feel down on it we will have an epic comeback coming up led by god of war 3 and others plus a price drop so we will get back to the winning ways|`|AA10690306	I would answer this factually but the Playstation  Trolls are going to "Violate" any answer I make anyway.

PS3 exclusives are good, *In my opinion*<br>  <br>  I think too many people base themselves off reviews and dont go out and try them .Uncharted was awesome.|`|BMConIedaa	1. Price.  They have the most expensive console on the market, at a time when people don't have a lot of money.<br>  <br>  2. Lack of compelling exclusives.  I haven't seen anything in Little Big Planet that a Wii couldn't do (albeit, you'd have to tone down the textures a bit, but Nintendo is proving that raw horsepower does not equal success - innovation can, though), and MGS was really just an esoteric movie with some playable scenes.  Even Square-Enix decided to develop a port of FF13 for the 360 because the PS3 just plain doesn't have the market share they'd like it to.<br>  <br>  3. Blu-Ray.  Not enough people are sold on it.  The PS3 may be the only truly future-proof Blu-Ray player, as the standards for what is a compliant player keep changing (the original spec wasn't much more than a Hi-rez DVD player, now a 2.0 compliant player requires an internet connection and a sizable amount of memory for blu-ray-based games and other settings), but a recent study shows that people don't really care about it very much (link below).  It is also a HUGE part of the price component, as blu-ray laser diodes are still VERY expensive.

EMmGFqgJaa	Here is a good explanation of what megapixels are for.<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an interesting article about megapixels in the NYTimes.<br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/technology/08pogue.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/techno...</a><br>  <br>  I'm not sure how you can tell if you can take good videos with the camera. I think if the pictures come out good than chances are the Video will come out good too. To find this out you should read reviews of the camera you plan to buy. <br>  <br>  Most cameras have very little built in memory. Most people buy memory cards. If you buy a sony camera you can only use their expensive Memory stick duo memory. Most other cameras either use SD cards or compact flash cards. Memory sizes range from 1gb to 64 gb.|`|61596a50ed67539e16d2e7b98be48c8baa	Just google "What are megapixels for?" and you will get the answer.<br>  <br>  I'm biased and have have stuck to the "Canon" brand of point & shoot digital cameras. They take great pictures and videos.<br>  <br>  I rarely use more than 2gb, but camera these days can hold as much as 16gb. My Canon uses 16gb SD flash card.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	I also recommend Canon as being very good to excellent where image quality, features and performance are concerned. You will find most newer models now all start at about 10-12MP or even more. <br>  <br>  This is much more that your average snapper needs...and sometimes more megapixels can be worse to have (especially on compact cameras with their small sensors), but it can be very useful if you want to print out enlargements and also allows for generous cropping.<br>  <br>  Video recording capability in digital cameras, is getting much better now. A number of new models announced even have high definition (HD) or Full HD movie recording capability.<br>  <br>  A fairly standard resolution and frame rate that many cameras have is 640x480 @ 30fps. This is generally good to very good quality video (also depends on the camera make).<br>  <br>  New models now allow HD (1280x720 @ 30fps) and Full HD (1920x1080 @ 30fps) recording. The plus is of course, better quality video and the downside is large file sizes, so you would need to use memory cards with plenty of capacity.<br>  <br>  As an example of video file sizes on different cameras...<br>  <br>  Canon SD1100 IS (8MP) records at a top resolution/frame rate of 640x480 @ 30fps. Movies recorded at this resolution, use approx. 1GB of memory for every 8 minutes of video. <br>  <br>  Canon SX200 IS (12MP) records at a top resolution/frame rate of 1280x720 @ 30fps. These high definition movies use approx. 1GB of memory in only 5 1/2 minutes.<br>  <br>  Canon SX1 IS (10MP) records in stereo and has a best resolution/frame rate of 1920x720 @ 30fps. Because these videos are in full HD, file sizes are approx. 1GB of memory per 3 minutes of video.<br>  <br>  So, you can see that it depends on your camera's video resolution (and also the camera make) as to how large a capacity card you may need, but if you intend to take lots of videos, it would probably be best to have at least a couple of cards (maybe 4 or 8GB each).<br>  <br>  good luck...

0aDp45MCaa	I vote you get the LG Scoop or the Samsung Propel. <br>  <br>  I am trying to decide if I should get the Scoop or the Samsung Alias.<br>  <br>  My best friend has the Propel and loves it but she says the buttons are kind of small and hard to push.<br>  <br>  Another friend of mine has the Scoop, and absolutely LOVES it!!! She says its the best phone she ever had. <br>  <br>  Start saving your own money for a phone, or offer to pay half yours bill every month. <br>  <br>  Also, if you have respect for things you already have, your parents are more likely to let you have something else (A.K.A.- a phone) <br>  <br>  Point out good things to them about you having a phone. That's what I did, and I think that's what made my mom let me have one. Whenever we were out and my mom's phone was either dead, or she forgot it and she needed to call someone, I would say " If I had a phone you would never have this problem again. You could use mine" idk, if your parents say this but before I had a phone, my parents were always telling me to get off the phone after I talked for a long time. You could say, "I wouldn't be on the home phone so much if I had a cell".<br>  <br>  Good luck!! I hope you get one soon!|`|B0yW8XUUaa	I have the Blackjack II, its pretty cool. When I first bought one I had some problems with it, so I had to get a new one. I know quite a few people have problems with keys falling off, the speaker not working, etc,  but you can return it to the store and get a new one. No big deal. Other then the problems, the phone is easy to use and great for people like me who text non-stop. The phone is extremely big or bulky like most of the phones that have full keyboards. One thing I don't like about it is that when you put it on vibrate you might as well have the ringer on because it is extremely loud and annoying.|`|dC7nixE6aa	You should get the lg scoop!!  There really great for texting!!!! I actually have a purple lg scoop and they ROCK! lol|`|YgTJfxHyaa	I would advice anything besides getting the Samsung BlackJack II. Because there have been multiple problems with it, such as keys getting stuck or falling off, dust gets under the screen and cause visibility of the screen in the sun to be very bad.

So create a folder named PS3. In that folder there should be a folder called SAVEDATA.

EMmGFqgJaa	Go to settings, then control panel, then systems. Go to the hardware tab and select Device Manager, then select your CD/DVD drive.

lQao8Wt0aa	Once the lens is twisted it can't be "popped" back into place.  Most independent repair shops won't touch it because Kodak doesn't make service or parts information available for an economic repair - it'll have to go to Kodak for service or a refurbished model at practically new prices.  Or better yet, get a Canon, Nikon, or Sony camera that can be repaired by independent shops at a reasonable price.|`|JZsPsslAaa	Get tothe nearest service center to replace if there is waranty or otherwise purchase new lens arrangement.<br>  best way is throw that away and bu sony-w220.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	$150 to have it fixed<br>  or think new
TbTO5SXlaa	Take the lens hood to a real camera shop. They should have a filter removal tool that will separate the filter and hood. Unless, of course, you cross-threaded them. If you did and damaged the hood you'll probably be buying a new lens hood. Lets hope that isn't the case.

At 720p and an optimal viewing distance of 13ft you're looking at 66".  Those are going to be some monster sets though.<br>  <br>  I think if you hit the 60" mark though, you'd set yourself up pretty good in around the 13ft mark.  17ft is a big distance though.  Then you might need the super large sizes.  But again these are the "optimal" distances.  You could just go and measure it out in a store and see what you think is okay for your own taste.

Read it several times, and practice in between.<br>  <br>  Attend a class, read some books, read/watch online tutorials.<br>  <br>  The major camera manufacturers (like Canon, Nikon, Olympus etc) all have very useful sections on their website for learning about photography.<br>  <br>  Understanding at least  the basic principles  will enable you to make the most of your camera, and will make a HUGE difference to your images.<br>  <br>  There is a good chance that the camera is perfectly fine.

TbTO5SXlaa	Unfortunately, your lens is really too short for good pictures of the moon. You need at least a 200mm focal length and 300mm would be even better. At 55mm the moon will be a tiny white dot.<br>  <br>  Although you may find this difficult to believe, you can get good exposures of the moon at f16 with a shutter speed of 1/ISO. So if you're using ISO 200 set your aperture to f16 and your shutter speed to 1/200 sec. This is nothing more than an application of the old "Sunny 16 Rule" which states: "On a sunny day, set your aperture to f16 and your shutter speed to 1/ISO." The moon is, of course, in bright sunlight. <br>  <br>  Its usually a good idea to take 3 pictures: 1 @ f16 @ 1/ISO, 1 @ f16 @ 1/ISO and -1/2 EV and 1 @ f16 @ 1/ISO and -1 EV. By underexposing you'll likely get a little more detail in the moon. You can compare the 3 exposures and decide which you like best.<br>  <br>  I suggest always using a tripod whenever possible.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	As Edwin states, you need a longer lens. With a long lens, using a tripod is helpful. If you have the remote for the D60, use it as it reduces camera shake. If you don't have the remote, use the 2 second timer which will open the shutter when your hands are off the camera.<br>  <br>  I'll add in that you want to shoot in manual mode as your camera's light metering function will usually overexpose the shot. You need to preview the image in highlight mode to be sure you don't have, or have minimal, overexposed areas.<br>  <br>  Also helpful, take photos in RAW mode. You will need to adjust the contrast in a photo editor, like Photoshop. You will need to turn off sharpening also as this will apply a bright ring to the edge of the moon which looks funny. If you take the picture in RAW mode, you have the option of controlling the amount of sharpening in the post editing process.<br>  <br>  Some silly shots I took using a 500mm lens and a Nikon D40.<br>  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/qrkpub/NatureOlio#5279137734010109378" rel="nofollow">http://picasaweb.google.com/qrkpub/Natur...</a><br>  <br>  The first shot is JPG and shows the sharpening evil on the perimeter of the moon. Second shot is RAW where I controlled the amount of sharpening in an image editor. Third shot is the actual frame as it comes out of the camera. You can see that a 500mm lens really isn't long enough for the moon. All shots taken at ISO 200, f/8, 1/160 sec. The moon is a very bright object!|`|fv7XW4dHaa	I'm just here to see the answers, i have a D60 as well.

To be sure, buy one at a Nokia Store (plus you might get a free gift pack cause its kinda a new phone).<br>  <br>  You can send files via Bluetooth cause it has bluetooth. The 5800 XM camera is 3.2 (3.15) Megapixels and you can take IMAGES with flash. Also, the 5800 can take standard definition (not high definition) videos (640x480) without the flash turning on.<br>  <br>  If you are getting the 5800, make sure you only use it for internet, productivity (hey, its a smartphone with Word, PowerPoint, Adobe PDF, Excel viewers), multimedia (pictures, video, music, etc.). It's not built for games though, and its kinda slow because of the ARM11 Processor. That processor is typically for Non-Touchscreen Smartphones.

It basically shows everything you have that you can access through iTunes. <br>  <br>  If you want to have an "Audiobook" folder, you have to make a new playlist (under File), and then add the tracks you want to that playlist. This won't take them off the Music folder, though.

8EmeNHyjaa	I would go with Panasonic LX3 with great a F2.0 24mm Leica DC Vario-Summicron lens.The image quality is certainly better.The macro capability of the camera is really excellent|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I am a serious amateur photographer. I want a camera that will perform in all types of situations. The G-10 is a successor to the prior top end range finder digital cameras in the Canon line. It is more expensive than most range finder digitals but I think it is well worth it. <br>  <br>  The new model offers a 5X Optical Zoom (28 MM lens). It allows full control of ISO and White Balance and a number of other features that can be toggled - like Image Stabilization. Plus the image quality is up to 14.7 MP. I normally shoot with a 40D SLR but there are times when I simply do not want to carry along lenses and the other equipment. I first used this on a trip to Veracruz, Mexico and tried to push the limits of the camera. I don't like flash photography except in exceptional circumstances. With the available controls I was able to get the shots I wanted. That included some macro shots which would have been chancy with any other range finder camera. The G-10 has a large view finder to be able to see what you shot. <br>  <br>  Highly recommend.<br>  <br>  Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom<br>  Price: $409.95 <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Powershot-G10-Digital-Stabilized/dp/B001G5ZTPY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236433087&sr=1-7&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Powershot-G1...</a><br>  <a href="http://buy-cheap-canon.co.cc/canon-powershot-g10/52" rel="nofollow">http://buy-cheap-canon.co.cc/canon-power...</a>|`|rxepaX6Iaa	I recommended <br>  <br>  Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5ZTPY?ie=UTF8&tag=yahanswer-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001G5ZTPY" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5Z...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The third-generation PowerShot G10 is a stunning successor, loaded with uncompromising specs like 14.7 megapixels, a 28mm wide-angle lens, and Canon's new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for notably improved face and motion detection.

UtHnh0aHaa	It is hosted on a German server. My only concern would be how fulfillment and payment will be made.<br>  <br>  Payment is only using standard channels - one of those is Paypal. I would recommend that if you have a Paypal account, post an inquiry and ask them to state the legitimacy of the site. They have very strict rules about how money is transferred in a world marketplace.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Cheers.|`|sUjarF0kaa	It's a legitimate site. They drop-ship the products and do not fulfill it themselves and you receive the items in approximately 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  If you do plan to bid, however, keep in mind that it does cost to bid and each auction has winners and losers. It's good to go in with a solid strategy.
VMVW3E7Aaa	"Sound Tribe" ??? I assume that is a concert?<br>  <br>  First of all, you may not be allowed to bring a camera into the venue, I'd check first.<br>  <br>  Next problem is that concerts are a low light situation, usually also coupled with much movement as well as a fair distance from the subject.<br>  <br>  All up, that makes it EXTREMELY challenging. The only hope of half decent concert photos are good DSLR cameras and even for those you need very good and very FAST lenses.<br>  <br>  Little P&S cameras can NOT keep up in that situation, least of all if you're not right in front of the stage.<br>  <br>  If you can't have a good camera with you, at the very least make sure you learn how to you use what you have, so you can make the most out of it. Read your manual several times, attend a class, read some books on photography - it will help a lot.<br>  <br>  At the very least, figure out how to turn off your flash, because all THAT little thing will light up are the heads right in front of you.

It's not really old, but in the digital SLR world, with new bodies coming out every month it seems...<br>  <br>  It uses compact flash, can I doubt it can write to the card very fast considering that the 40d (the only one I remember off the top) writes at a max of 11MB per second, and that's a 2007 body.<br>  <br>  So, get the cheapest card in whatever size (compact flash or CF) it can't make use of the faster UDMA speeds like 233, 266, 300x etc. So if you can find a deal on some old 80x or 133x cards, go for it.
