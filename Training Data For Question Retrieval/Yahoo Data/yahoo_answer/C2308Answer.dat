bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu acho que você deve seguir o curso que tem mais a ver com o seu perfil e que mais te desperta interesse. Entre esses cursos que você citou, eu escolheria Administra??o, embora eu também ache Publicidade e Propaganda interessante.<br>  <br>  Empregabilidade:<br>  O curso de Ciência da Computa??o oferece uma ótima empregabilidade, visto que a informática tem avan?ado muito e existem poucos profissionais formados nessa área. Administra??o também oferece uma boa empregabilidade, porém muitas pessoas têm se formado em Administra??o nos últimos anos e, creio eu, a tendência é que o mercado de trabalho para um Administrador fique saturado daqui a alguns anos. O mercado de trabalho para um publicitário está bastante saturado e a dificuldade para conseguir emprego nessa área é grande.<br>  <br>  Nível de dificuldade do curso:<br>  O curso de Ciência da Computa??o é o mais difícil entre os 3. Administra??o n?o é muito difícil e Publicidade e Propaganda me parece ser o mais fácil entre os 3.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!|`|HrMURB0jaa	você quer saber mesmo  eu digo ciência da computa??o e uma boa va em frente e boa sorte|`|HvbTOdx6aa	com certeza é ciencia da computa??o, administra??o e publicidade tem muito profissional na área e tá muito difícil de arrumar emprego, já ciência da computa??o tá faltando profissional para trabalhar na área, tenho vários amigos que s?o formados em computa??o e est?o muito bem empregados, ganhando muito bem!!!!!|`|CUhnKxn5aa	escolha ciencia da computa??o! é um otimo curso e abre muitas oportunidades .. o mercado está carente desses profissionais.|`|fmjhMWVaaa	pqp bem variadas as op??es, depende demais, o que vc realmente gosta de fazer?<br>  <br>  pq entre esses três tem um abismo de diferen?a.

Com as cotas, metade das vagas em universidades federais ser?o destinadas a estudantes oriundos de escolas públicas.<br>  Para entrar na universidade, os estudantes têm que prestar uma prova chamada VESTIBULAR, na qual eles devem responder quest?es sobre diversas disciplinas (matemática, Língua Portuguesa, história, geografia, física, química, biologia, Língua Estrangeira etc) e escrever uma reda??o; ou seja, eles devem responder uma prova de conhecimentos gerais. A única coisa que mudará com a aprova??o das cotas é o fato dos estudantes que cursaram os Ensino Médio em escolas públicas terem mais chances de passar no vestibular, mas isso n?o tira o mérito deles, pois apenas os estudantes que tirarem as melhores notas ser?o selecionados.<br>  Eu sou totalmente favorável às cotas, pois a qualidade do Ensino Público no Brasil é muito inferior à do Ensino Privado e os estudantes egressos de escolas públicas têm menos chances de passar no vestibular do que os egressos de escolas particulares.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!

btn32O2Iaa	What about one of the programs offered by those high reputation organizations that you mentioned except at half their price because you can contact the local orgs abroad and skip the middle people?<br>  <br>  Homestay Spain is the most preferred student exchange program in Spain, and is the best lifestyle immersion experience available to those willing to learn Spanish culture and lifestyle. Santander, the capital city of Cantabria located on a beautiful bay and flanked by numerous beaches, is home to this exciting program. Santander is known for its cultural refinement, and an atmosphere typical of old Spain. Inhabitants spend hardly any time at home preferring instead to enjoy the beautiful weather and temperate climate of the region. Life is lived “on the street”: strolling along the pier; spending the whole day at “El Puntal”, a sand island you may reach by public boat; going for a coffee at one of the many “al fresco” terraces; or spending the entire day at the beach with friends and family. These pastimes reflect the relaxed Spanish way of living in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.<br>  <br>  Spain is a wonderful choice and the program www.beautifulspain.com, one of the best if not the best of the programs offered abroad world wide. Location is a safe and most amazingly beautiful beach resort in Northern Spain.<br>  <br>  Host families are extremely well screened and very loving. This program gets returnees year after year, so great it is.<br>   <br>  Cost is really reasonable considering everything included (as long as you sign up with this program through their web site as there are organizations that sell the same program for much more so high quality it is).<br>  <br>  This program is considered the most complete exposure to a foreign country because as they say it is true that it combines CLASSES (art, debate, street talk, folklore, among others) with FUN and EXCITING ACTIVITIES such as Latin Dance Classes, Bullfight, Boat Excursion, etc…, FULL DAY OUTINGS to places of historical and cultural interest such as prehistoric Altamira Caves, Guggenheim Museum, Roman Ruins, "Capricho de Gaudi", Roman Route Hiking adventure, etc... are also ALL INCLUDED IN THE PRICE while living with a local, loving and carefully selected HOST FAMILY. I know this program allows you to choose from several host families (the type of things this program does, no other program would ever) in order for everyone to be happy.<br>  <br>  It offers you the possibility of enrolling with a friend with whom to share same host family home, or for you to stay alone at host family. Many host families count on children of your same age.|`|df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	I'll tell you this story. <br>  <br>  When my son was nine we lived in Virginia.

I called my friend and made the simple offer "Let's swap kids for a while".  <br>  <br>  We talked it over with their elementary schools and they thought it was a cool idea.  We didn't actually swap.  I sent my son to Vermont to live with his son and family and they went to school together for a month.   When the month was over the two flew to Virginia and lived with my family for the next month. <br>  <br>  When my son was in Vermont they built an igloo and went snowshoeing and visited friends.  When the other kid came to Virginia we visited the capital in Richmond and the museums on the mall in Washington.  It was a good experience for everyone.

No one HAS to do that.<br>  <br>  However, if you live in the US or want to come to the US and participate in the traditional semester or year exchange, you MUST be 15. That's part of the federal law governing exchange programs. Some programs offer shorter summer or a couple of week exchanges for younger people.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a lower cost program, try Rotary. That's one of the best, and the cheapest program. You will still have to be 15.<br>  <br>  And, I can tell you, you better learn politeness if you want to get a spot! These programs are very competitive and your attitude needs a bit of adjustment.

o3IsrUP8aa	There is not a lot of information here to work with.  I don't know where you are moving and if the questions pertains to the town or to transitioning to the college experience.<br>  <br>  Meet with a tour guide and ask questions, go to the orientations as well.  I might even go as far as calling the chamber of commerce and asking them what places of intrest for college students exist.<br>  <br>  If it is the college experience.  Try and find out who your roomate will be if you are going to have one.  See if you can get some contact information and send them a welcome basket or offer to go to lunch or dinner.  That way you'll get to know that person before hand so the move will be less stressful as you are getting ready to transition to so many other new things.  Register early, check out ratemy professor.com and check out your professors.  I might even e-mail a few of the professors just so that you can start early in buidling a good report with them.  Also find out where on campus you will be parking and where you have class.  That way when school starts you're not looking aimlessly for class or walking in late setting a bad first impression.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps Good luck|`|AA12021966	Laptop and printer (even if the laptop will only stay in your dorm room)<br>  <br>  Get one of those shower totes for the bathroom<br>  <br>  Find out what kind of bed sheets you need (whether you need extra-long twin size or regular twin size).

uZaGBeYbaa	Your biology, chemistry, physics, and calculus courses will prepare you as an introduction to the college level courses you will have to take in college to apply for medical school.  <br>  <br>  If you take AP courses and get credit from your college, you will still need to take other biology, physics, inorganic and organic chemistry, and english courses to apply for medical school, which would be at a higher level.  If you are truly interested in taking these advanced courses to improve your education, then good for you.  Just make sure that you do well in these courses since most people who apply for medical school will only need to take the introductory courses.  However, if you do well in your advanced courses you will have an advantage over other applicants.  For the MCATs, introductory college level inorganic/organic chemistry, physics, and biology courses will suffice for the exam.<br>  <br>  I took the Calculus AP exam in high school and passed out of my math requirement for college and didn't have any problems when applying to medical school.  <br>  <br>  If you wan't to take other courses at a community college like microbiology and it doesn't interfere with your high school coursework and grades, then do it if you are truly interested in the subject and want some exposure prior to taking it in college (if at all).  Don't do it for the sole purpose of medical school since you will have to learn it again anyways in medical school. <br>  <br>  Right now, I would just concentrate on doing well in your high school courses, SATs, and being involved in extracurricular activities so you can get into a good college.  Don't worry about medical school yet since you still have a while to go.  You may even change your mind when you get into college.  It happens a lot.  Some people even change their minds in medical school and beyond.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Sounds like a good plan.  Med schools recommend you take your premed classes at the highest-level university you attend, so that means not at community college and certainly don't plan to use AP credits to get out of premed courses.  The AP classes should just prepare you to ace those courses.

5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	Probably, based upon your question, I can verify that you are not spending much time using your dictionary.  You are not convinced that you need to ascend to a very high academic altitude.  But, many other students experience empathy with you on a daily basis.  I find most students to be lazy and unwilling to pick up the dictionary.<br>  <br>  Using the dictionary would be a great way to demonstrate that you are an activist - not a pacifist that could care less about education.  Ask your librarian for a good dictionary. Of course, with the Internet - and the laptop - the dictionary now enjoys a great deal of mobility.  You can use it in the middle of the vast population of great cities or suspend(ed) in outer space.  <br>  <br>  I would love to fracture your apathy about words.  If I could transfer my zeal for writing and words to your dormant mind I might even be able to inspire you to write an autobiography about your transformed attitude about education.    I would spur you to action, encourage you to keep a journal, aspire to fame and a luminous career.  You might end up doing something great (messing around with astrology, by the way, would be a ridiculous -- and I mean a very ridiculous thing to do).  If you learn to love education, love words and your dictionary as much as I do, you may become so famous that you wouldn't have to write an autobiography about yourself - heck I'd write your biography, if only to prove that as a teacher I had such a profound influence on your life<br>  <br>  You're welcome - but if you turn this in your teacher will know good and well you didn't write it.<br>  <br>  P.S.  This posting is tangible evidence that every word can be used easily in a sentence - it took me about 4 minutes to write this up.<br>  <br>  Dang dang dang, I keep having to edit my answer.  Does that mean you get like a gazillion emails?  I didn't use the word durable - but I can't do all your work so good look that baby up in the (durable) dictionary sitting on your shelf.|`|7Gp1FRwaaa	As I was flying my plane, I wanted to verify my altitude with the control tower. The Controller answered with tangible empathy in his voice, that I was closer to the ground than I imagined. <br>    Being a pacifist, I naturally hated being drafted into military service. That was where I was able to learn to fly though, and the plane proved durable. It was there that I met a lady librarian. She had problems with mobility, although there are many in other countries, who's population has a large number of invalids. It was her hip she broke, while she was trying to suspend herself from a wobbly ladder, extending her reach too far. Actually, her hip suffered a fracture, not being entirely broke. After being in the hospital for two weeks, they decided to transfer her home. She lay dormant there for weeks, reluctant to move, while she read an autobiography of her favorite movie actor. He starred mainly in action movies. She had been subscribing to the local newspaper, or journal, as she referred to it. She would read it of an evening, under her luminous lamp, by the nightstand. Her favorite section had to do with astrology, and the horoscopes. I told her that those things were ridiculous, but she just ignored me, and told me to go on watching TV, a program that was discussing a biography of a teacher, who assigned writing assignments based on lists of words.|`|8TVYDSB5aa	1.

o3IsrUP8aa	Stay patient.  As cliche as this sounds, you will find problems like this no matter where you are in life.  It happends in college all the time as well.  Teachers get burned out just like students especially if they act as though they don't care.  Try sending an e-mail asking for the specific changes in class that you would like to see.  Tell the teacher that you think that it might add interest and respect if you were allowed some open discussion time.  You will probably need to be proactive in this and prove to the teacher that you have done your homework and aren't looking for the teacher to basically read it for you in class.  If that doesn't work try speaking to a principal.  Mostly know that these situations happen and that you need to be strong though it is hard.  I promise though it may seem as though you might never get out it will be over before you know, and you will need that information again.
8yE2sYGeaa	It is a typical, wholesome girl, untainted by the ways of the big city. Sweet, innocent and kind|`|6DFhlt4daa	average girl, regular girl <br>  <br>  The stereotype of the girl next door is often invoked in American contexts to indicate wholesome, unassuming, or "average" femininity; this is contrasted with other stereotypes such as tomboy, valley girl, femme fatale and slut. She is the female counterpart to the "boy next door." To fall in love with the "girl next door" is an archetype of romantic fiction and a key plot element. Unlike the femme fatale, the girl next door does not have hidden plans of her own, partly because her character is open and straightforward, and also partly because her intentions would not need to be concealed. Unlike the princesse lointaine, she is seldom much richer or of much higher social status than the protagonist. The girl next door is most likely someone the protagonist has known for most of his (or her) life, but in the past could not appreciate the depth of his feelings because of his age.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	it means you have that sweet innocent look<br>  <br>  the girl next door tends to be your friend, she tends to be sweet and someone that you wouldn't think of having sex with when you are young...but it's appealing to people when they get older|`|EKj4PH76aa	like a hot girl.|`|3TeMrO38aa	ur neighbour

dlXqtD99aa	It is not correct.<br>  <br>  Stones - Noun, Subject<br>  Carved - Adjective (Or a verb)<br>  With - Preposition (Prep Phrase<br>  Her - Possessive Pronoun (Prep phrase<br>  Name - Noun (Prep Phrase)<br>  <br>  But honestly all you have is a subject. So even if you did say this, it's just a sentence fragment.<br>  <br>  Since "carved" can be both a verb and an adjective, it is unclear whether or not the stones were carved by using her name (perhaps her name has stone-carving abilities, who knows) or her name is carved into the stones. <br>  <br>  I feel the most correct phrase is probably: The stones with her name engraved thereupon. Or one that is closer to yours: Stones with her name carved into them.<br>  <br>  What is the subject? The stones. Which stones? The ones with her name on them.<br>  <br>  This way the prepositional phrase serves to identify which stones, as opposed to a possible way that the stones were carved.<br>  <br>  Another reason why this sounds weird is that even though adjectives can go before and after the nouns which they modify, in modern English, adjectives usually go before the word they are modifying.<br>  <br>  Take for example this sentence: The water blue in the cup red.<br>  <br>  Grammatically (syntactically) this sentence is fine. But colloquially, no one is going to understand what the heck you are saying.<br>  <br>  That is why having the adjective after a noun: "Stones carved," As opposed to "Carved stones," makes "carved" seem like a verb instead of a noun because English is a Subject, Verb, Object language.

Then you can ask either after or during class. Also, sitting at the front is important for staying focused. Your teacher will be more receptive to your questions, and the more connected to the material and teacher you are, the less day dreamy you'll be. <br>  <br>  One last thing, everyone has times of the day that they pay attention best, use those windows for your most challenging classes.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	In a college level math course you're supposed to have gone over the material and know it before coming to lecture.

abyHvk07aa	As a special education teacher I'm very confused by some of what you have been told. Not having any more info. then you are sharing I will state that maybe there is something this staff knows that I don't. However, I would suggest this. Ask the school to consider a 504. It provides specially designed instruction to help a child be successful without necessarily changing curriculum. This is frequently used in our district for children with diagnosed ADHD. Medication is not required although depending on the case may be something worth trying. Personally, I have seen it work wonders and I have seen it turn kids into zombies. Each child is different and should be viewed as such. Although a normal IQ coupled with low achievement is usually used to diagnose a Specific Learning Disability (SLD) it is not the only criteria that indicates a need for an IEP. Behavior can be an indication for one in which case an FBA (functional behavioral analysis) can be done by the team and a BIP (behavior intervention plan) can be created. I work with a student with Aspergers who is also in the gifted program and has an IEP for both which includes language, behavior, comprehension and social skills along with the areas of enrichment. One does not negate the other. I am not familiar with the symptoms of NF1 but if they interfere with his learning I would say you have a strong case for receiving support regardless of his IQ. I suggest recontacting the school and asking more questions. Write down their answers and let them know that you are taking this seriously and will be contacting an advocate to find out what your alternatives are. I do not advocate a hostile approach as it is in your best interest to have a team that is working together and most teachers truly are looking out for the best interest of your child. I do however, recommend a firm and fair approach to make sure everyone is doing their job. Best of luck to you.|`|anHLJesKaa	Special Education and IEP's aren't just for students that are academically delayed.  They are for any child who has a condition or disability that gets in the way of his performance in school.  Children who are medically fragile qualify for an IEP, children with Asperger's also qualify as do children children with mental health issues or behavior issues.  Your son should have a full assessment based not only on academics, but sensory issues, behavior issues as well occupational and speech issues.  Without a full assessment his needs won't be fully understood or addressed.|`|54llCWDTaa	I'm in 10th grade this year and still in special Ed, Special Ed is suppose to help those that are constantly fighting to stay caught up in school and who need the extra help. But if he is really good than I think you should let him go to a regular school like Me, another boy I know, and quite a few others That go to the same exact school as me. So Like I said up there I think you should let him go to a regular school.|`|0l1yibjyaa	Low academic potential is not the only qualification for special ed support. A student may receive those services for a variety of reasons. In elementary school, I was in and out of special ed because I'd do well then revert back to misbehaving. In middle school, for grades 6 to the later portion of grade 7, I was in regular ed in a high-end magnet school. Towards the ending of seventh grade, I was placed back in special ed transferred to a public school (the previous school had no real support for special needs students) because of misbehavior and my ADHD. It was a mistake because I was placed in a self-contained general ed classroom, for students with excessive behaviors and learning disabilities. I stayed in this self-contained classroom until middle school graduation. When high school came, I was re-enrolled into private education (where there were no special ed services) however it only lasted a couple of days. My mother disenrolled me from the private school, and about a week later I found myself at my hometown's only public high school: EHHS. Because I was attending a public school again, I was re-identified as having special needs. Learning sometime around here that my problem was more than ADHD alone, it was also Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism). The first two years were very stressful. I earned a total of 6 credits, and had so many behaviors to the point of nearly being committed to a psychiatric hospital. The hardest part of that experience was knowing how different I was from everyone else, and feeling a sense of discouragement from it. As bright as I am, I could have been an AP student graduating early. Now, I will have to complete an extra year of high school which I take full responsibility for. Anyway, that's my life story of being in special ed. The school cannot deny your son special services because of his intelligence as long as he is misbehaving and having problems.|`|p4Es1AmKaa	If your son has an ADHD diagnosis, then he will qualify under OHI (Other Health Impairment).  This will qualify him for extended time on tests (ACT, SAT, etc.) as well as an alternative placement for taking tests (one on one with a teacher).  If your son has other behavioral issues, he can qualify for an IEP under a behavioral disorder (BD) qualification.  Other than meds, some people really believe in a diet change, "Gluten-free" diets are a big thing with students with special needs. If you google "Gluten-free diet" you will get a lot of information.  There are also other holistic medicine and doctors out there who do work with Ketone levels in kids. <br>  <br>  IEP's are not just for academic reasons.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	Super Smart can receive special ed and an IEP--who ever told you that they can't is wrong..<br>  <br>  many people with autsim, dyslexia, emotional and behaviorla problems are super smart and eleigible for an IEP<br>  in categories such as Other Health Impaired, Emotionally Disturned/Behavior disorder, Specific Learnign Disability<br>  <br>  <br>  You can consider a 504 plan which is accommodations withinteh regualr ed class for children with disabilities/health problems-<br>  <br>  part of this should include a behavior plan---the school shouldhave a behaviorist that can do a FBA (functional behavior assessment) and write a BIP (behavior intervention plan)<br>  <br>  <br>  Itis possible for a child to be both Gifted and talented as well as need special ed|`|pvezh17Maa	If you can't get on an IEP, try for a 504 (part of federal PL-142) to get special considerations for your son, especially for the ADHD.  Unfortunately, they might require that you at least try medication for that condition.<br>  <br>  Also, contact your state's board of education and try to talk to an advocate.  They might be able to give you more information on a course of action.  States have books available (Ohio's is free for first copy) that outline all the info you might need.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
721304c80de56710adba6c3a8fdc5f7daa	What is problematic about your speech is your repetitive use of "It is. . ." again and again and again. It is really distracting and will make your speech read more like a simple list, rather than a developed argument or idea. I know you can''t use the word, "honesty", but that is part of the challenge. Using "It is. . ." is an uncreative sneak around the task. You need to get more creative. <br>  <br>  You also mixed up the words with, "This has many saved lives. . "|`|YMehaPY5aa	Don't use so much "It is..." in your speech. It makes it a bit boring. Also you have some run on sentences. "And .... and" Maybe join/ disconnect some lines together. <br>  <br>  For example. You may change it to "Being loyal, fair and just.

Some diseases are caused by having an incorrect number of chromosomes. Down syndrome is caused by having one extra chromosome (chromosome #21) so people with Down syndrome have 47 chromosomes. Most cancerous cells carry many extra chromosomes and some are even polyploid.<br>  Polyploidy ("poly" is Greek for "many") is a special kind of ploidy. It means there are extra SETS of chromosomes not just some extra chromosomes.

BycbT5Reaa	High school is not about passion. High school is something you are required to go through. You will like some classes. You will hate others. You will be required to take some classes. You will be able to choose others. And at the end of five/four years (depending on what grade you start high school in), you will graduate.<br>  <br>  You aren't expected to love all your classes. Your teachers will love you if you do, but they're used to teaching a group of apathetic kids. In general, apathetic kids lead to apathetic teachers. They'll teach you what you need to know, but only a few will make it dynamic and interesting. You know know who those teachers are because you will enjoy their classes. There are also going to be certain classes you personally find interesting (English if you are a reader, social studies and history if you like history, math if you're good with numbers and like puzzles), but don't think that you should love all classes. I know I don't, and I have a fairly good attitude toward school - I can't imagine if I woke up every day going, "I HATE SCHOOL!"<br>  <br>  I'm in grade 12 now and am prone to senioritis (slacking off because grad is so close). In semester 1, I got a 93 in English, a 73 in Math, a 97 in Psychology, a 78 in Biology, and an 80 in French -- pretty obvious which classes I enjoy, huh? (I did have the slackest teacher EVER for Psych though; that's why it's so high. That class was fun but a total joke academically.)|`|8hbSL82oaa	lmfao you say passion WAY to much but you might as well take the honors classes since you have to take those classes anyway so no its not bad not to have passion|`|KsQnslENaa	Its great that you are taking honors classes or AP classes. Its great that you do. You won't necessarily enjoy every class that you take, but as long as these specific classes are linked to the type of career or major you want in college then you should be fine. I don't enjoy half the classes I take in high school, but I know they will take me somewhere. Colleges like to see that you challenge yourself, but remember also do classes that are fun and exciting and that you enjoy them. Because you definitely don't want high school to be boring. It's a great experience. Don't burn yourself out so quickly. I hope this works [;|`|nSSQkEiCaa	There is nothing wrong for not having passion in the classes you took. Everybody likes different things in life be it music, martial arts, sports, electronics, computers, train, animals, medicine, marine life, air piloting, politics, etc. Do they all end up having a passion for each and every single subject? Of course not. <br>  <br>  Luckily, you are still young right now and you don't really know how useless most of the classes that you're force to take. If you did know, you'll even lose more interest in your classes.

NcH1FetGaa	During the 1960's, program innovation and social analysis bloomed concurrently. Especially during the mid-years of that decade, many new social enterprises were spurred by the confident analyses of social scientists. The 1970's, however, have ushered in a period of program evaluation and public retrospection. The emphasis no longer is on building a record of program initiatives or on projecting the cost-effectiveness of prospective federal policies, but on looking backward to measure what has been accomplished by means of the activities already undertaken.<br>  <br>  The difference between analysis and evaluation is tied to the policy-making context within which social science operates. The uses of analysis are most in demand when underutilized slack resources are available, when there is a great deal of confidence in the efficacy of public action, and when policy-makers want to forge new program initiatives. When these conditions change, the dominant tone of both social science and public policy shifts to evaluation. The drainage of resources, confidence, and the will to innovate thus account for the recent rise of evaluation.<br>  <br>  hope this helps

yGOmMQP7aa	Remember AGI and Gross income are different.  The fafsa wants your AGI, not gross....directly from your 2008 tax form.  <br>  <br>  The AGI you put on the fafsa already has all of the deductions you have mentioned taken out.  Hence why its called "adjusted", so you do not need to subtract anything from your AGI number when you get it off your tax form.  I would suggest you do your taxes as soon as possible, this will make completing the fafsa much easier and you won't have to go back and make corrections when you discovered a mistake in your estimates.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you might meet the definition of a displaced worker according to the form.  Make sure you  mark yes on this question.

3e6fbfc82a7caf3d52c9abda29f0e79daa	Think about it this way: If you get all A's in the regular classes then you will have a high GPA.<br>  <br>  If you fail all of the AP classes, it will just look worse on your transcript and your GPA will be lower.<br>  <br>  Take what your interested in.  If you at an interview for some college and they ask why you didn't take AP classes, you'll say that it was because you were interested in the business themed core classes.  Also, if you have already taken a business, it will show that your dedicated to it, which is also something colleges like.  AP classes are hard.  If your NOT interested in them, it will make it 10 times worse,  I promise you.<br>  <br>  Also, you can take AP classes in college.  When your supposed to.<br>  <br>  However, if you really think that the AP classes are right for you, email a few teachers or talk to them after to school about the workload and curriculum and the AP tests at the end of the year. .  If you have an hour of homework each night for each AP class, homework from other classes, AND you do activities outside of school, you will get burnt out really easily.<br>  <br>  Do what is right for you.  Dont take an AP class just to look good.  Colleges will know that you did.<br>  <br>  Also, AP classes are usually really hard to get out of.  My school pushes AP classes like you wouldn't believe.  I decided to take AP World History and I literally went into the principals office balling my eyes out just to get out.  It took me about two and a half weeks to convince them that this was not the right class for me.<br>  <br>  Oh, and teachers WILL make the classes sound "easy".  Ask some upperclassmen what the classes are really like.  They will usually tell you all about the class.  If you do this, ask a bunch of people to get a good, general idea.<br>  <br>  It really all depends on who you are.

xvxtQwV5aa	First off, ALL websites start with http:// , that just tells the computer it's an internet address, basically, and not a file address on your computer. <br>  <br>  Now, I would recommend you do your homework and research this  "college".. I'm currently trying to find an online college to enroll in and I have found that not all colleges are really colleges.Did you check if this is an accredited institution?  If it's not accredited, you will not graduate with a degree, only a "$5,000 piece of paper". I found a site with a checklist that I have been referencing in my own search. Here is what they say:<br>  <br>  ? Ask: Accredited schools will tell you if they are accredited. Moreover, they will tell you in what states they are accredited and which educational governing bodies have accredited them. If you still have doubts, check with the institution that accredited them and make doubly sure. <br>  ? Verify: Accredited universities will be recognized by the Council on Higher Education Accreditation and will be listed on their website at www.chea.org. <br>  ? Research: Check with the Better Business Bureau for any listed complaints at www.bbb.org. <br>  ? Look for Their Operating License: Every institution of higher learning must have a charter for operations in a particular state. (Even big-name schools like USC need permission and a license to operate.) When in doubt, take a look. If they don’t have one, then they are operating illegally, and you need to steer clear of them. <br>  ? Financial Aid: To qualify for Federal Student Aid (FSA), Tuition Assistance and the GI Bill, an institution must petition the federal government and demonstrate its accredited status. If the school doesn’t pass muster, it doesn’t qualify. So, if Uncle Sam won’t pay for you to go there, chances are there’s a reason, and that reason is generally lack of accreditation. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you, it has helped me a lot. Congratulations! for deciding to take control of your future and better your life. College is not an option these days, I'm just glad I realized this while I'm still young. Good luck to you!|`|B0jOXMA4aa	It means that your information is not valid.

pBu9Qi5Haa	I like to think of philosophy as something that anyone can do and should do, but your case is specified towards the degree.<br>  <br>  Being skilled in thought is all that is essential to being a good philosopher. One must be open to all arguments and be ready to change their views if a clearer truth is presented. Don't hold onto mistakened truths as if they are all that define you, but that doesn't mean a person cannot hold their own beliefs. The list can go on, but you probably know more than me about the basics.<br>  <br>  I don't see how pursuing a degree in Philosophy would be much of a difference.

Three years later, I'm acing all my AP classes (I'm taking five this year) and he is a bum and my father won't be seen with him. I, however, will be applying the the best colleges on the east coast.  So anyway, take classes that will challenge you. Honors and APs. Join a couple clubs or sports, stick with them throughout high school and become a president or treasurer, etc. Colleges like to see dedication and leadership. Community service is a huge plus. I do about 6 hours a week. Keep your GPA high and study for your SATs junior year. I can't really think of anything else at the moment, but it's never too late to start planning.

1vAhSqdVaa	The AP bio, chem, and physics classes are more difficult than traditional or honors classes, so most people take for example regualr or honors biology one year and then AP bio the next year. That's why your friends are taking AP chem. You should be aware that AP Bio is significantly easier than AP chem or AP physics and that all three are looked at as equally difficult by colleges. Also there is a lot of advanced math involved with the last two so if you are not sure whether or not you're up for the challenge you should take AP Bio first as a test run and maybe regualr or honors physics at the same time if possible. That way you can take either or both AP chem and physics your senior year when colleges do see the course you take but have to make a decision on whether to accept you or not before your final grades come out. Most of my friends went that route. I took honors earth space, honors bio, honors chem, and then AP Bio my senior year because I am awful at science.|`|jBhFaZW8aa	Your junior year is your most important, but this does not mean colleges don't look at the classes you take your senior year. They do. I took AP Bio my senior year, and colleges were perfectly aware that I was taking it.  Depending on when you apply (early decision or regular), colleges may or may not receive your senior first-semester grades, but they will know which classes you're taking. I would definitely take AP Bio, but I'm biased because I took it. :) I never took physics, and I only took regular chemistry (although it was honors chem), and I got into every college I applied to. Then again, my major isn't in the life sciences (it's in the social sciences), so taking the others really wasn't important. As the person above me said, AP Bio is easier than AP Chem/Physics, based on what my friends in high school told me.|`|Zg4s4wRzaa	I would advise you to NOT take AP Chem if you also plan on taking the AP Chem test. Even after studying from school textbooks and AP study aids by Princeton Review, the AP Chem test was still a killer. I received a 4 on my AP test, but  I honestly don't think it was worth that much time, especially during a busy year. If your junior year schedule is hectic, do not attempt to take AP Chem. I would recommend AP Bio for your junior year and AP Physics for your senior year.|`|lSnHR3mTaa	Hey, I'm a sophomore too, and i too took biology my freshman year and i'm taking chemistry now. I suggest that you take AP Chem next year and AP Bio your senior year, like me. Honestly, physics and AP Physics are entirely unnecessary. Ultimately, when you choose the college that you want to attend after being accepted you will have to send them updates of your transcript with your senior grades because they have the right to revoke your acceptance. With that, don't fall for senioritis!|`|hJirszAraa	You can take all classes during your junior and senior year. Who ever told you colleges doesn't look at senior classes, they are wrong. Colleges really see what you are doing during the toughest year, junior year, and they still want to see if you are preparing for college during your senior. In other words, if you take all three classes during your junior and senior year, it doesn't matter the order you complete them on. UCs will see you attempted the AP classes.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  -Lance|`|KEvBMlvaaa	your senior classes will be counted for colleges. it wont be on the admissions transcript you send but you will provide the college with a list of your current classes and then they will give you credit based on the weight of the class.<br>  personally if i were you i would take AP Chem. i am currently in AP Bio and i hate the class. i havent learned much. (of course your school could have a better AP Bio teacher than mine) but take whatever you are interested in taking. that way you wont get distracted and not do well because you dont like the class.<br>  good luck :)

Your sentence begins with  a verb and continues from there... but you're not saying anything. <br>  <br>   "Today circus animals are being treated with much more respect than the 1930s and the ASPCA are always alert" and ready to investigate complaints about the healthiness of circus animals" <br>  - this should be "Today, Circus animals are treated more respectfully than they were in the 1930s, and the ASPCA is constantly available to investigate possible animal mistreatment." <br>  <br>  I don't like your last sentence; it is not your job as the writer to assess the effectiveness of the author.

Ftkr9jqYaa	You are right.  The common impression given by an uplifted middle finger accompanied by a tucked in thumb is the well-recognized, "F u c k you!"<br>  <br>  The contrary interpretation of a hand with middle finger extended and thumb out is, "Let's f u c k."  Obviously, leaving the thumb out is usually a mistake and miscommunication, made by someone who doesn't know the distinction.

It was a big adjustment during the first year (almost entirely because it is a virtual school and EVERYTHING is online) but it is an excellent school. The teachers are very helpful and the guidance counselors go out of their way to make sure things run smoothly.<br>  <br>  I have two younger sisters (one in the OHVA middle school and the youngest in elementary) and they also love the program. All three levels cover so much more than "regular" public schools.

My teacher puts it that "a comma isn't strong enough".

NevFFHf4aa	1. 7.9x10^-4<br>  2. 1.35X10^13<br>  3. 2X10^-6<br>  <br>  If you are confused, the easiest way to do it is move the decimal the number of spaces in the exponent. If it is negative, move to the left...positive, right. Then perform the operations. Move the decimal back so one number is to the left of it and the number of spaces you move it is the number that goes in the exponent.|`|Ds4xCthSaa	ok here is what you do,.. the power after the 10 tells you how many spaces to move your decimal. For example,.. 4.5 x 10^4 would be 45,000 all I did was move the decimal over 4 spots. So then you find out that 3x10^8 would be 300000000. Multiply that together and that is your answer. For number 1 just move your decimal over till you come to the first real number. For example the answer would be 7.9 x 10^-4. If the power is a positive number you move your decimal to the right, if the power is a negative number you move the decimal to th left. For number 3 you would take 1.8 and move your decimal over 3 places to the left. so that would make it .0018 x 900. if you multiply those together that will be your answer<br>  <br>  1.     7.9 x 10^-4<br>  2.     135000000000000<br>  3.      1.62|`|7PqwM6QXaa	1.) 7.9x10^-4<br>  2.) 13.5x10^12<br>  3.) 16.2x10^-1<br>  sorry if theyre wrong, i havent done these in forever|`|xvr5nK9aaa	1) 7.9 x 10^4<br>  <br>  2) 1.35 x 10^13<br>  <br>  3) 2 x 10^-6

dx3jXzuxaa	Since home education can, and does, take many different forms, it is nigh impossible to create a specific list of positives and negatives. Each situation is unique and different, and very few even approximate the image conjured by people outside of the home-school community. And then there are some issues that can be positive from one point of view and negative from another.<br>  <br>  For example, there is a rigid practice of age based segregation in the public school system, which believes in the philosophy that that faster students in the class help pull the slower kids along,while the teacher teaches to the average student. This is missing in a home-school setting where there are usually only 2-4 kids, and they're typically not the same age. Negative from the perspective of class interaction, positive from the point of view that the individual student is getting the teacher's whole attention. <br>  <br>  The "socialization" question is always a conversation starter, but what does it mean to "socialize" a child? The home-school community will argue that the age segregation is unnatural and fosters a false sense of social interaction; one person even told me it violates the Geneva Convention. Home-schoolers typically involve their children in a plethora of different activities, clubs and groups to foster social interaction. Many of these groups have political or religious focus that mirrors that of the parent(s). This can be seen as a negative if the process deliberately prevents the student from seeing opposing viewpoints or is used to indoctrinate. (The same argument can be used to argue that the public school system is a social indoctrination tool, so the sword cuts both ways.) Then, there is the negative aspect of driving all of the children to all of these social activities and events. It can get quite burdensome at times. <br>  <br>  Resources are another potential area where a home-school situation can, but isn't necessarily, be inferior to a public school education. Schools typically have libraries, textbooks, computers, and laboratories that can't be duplicated in a home setting. This is only a negative if the parent isn't resourceful and cannot find substitutes. For example a parent can involve the student with a community theatre group instead of participating ina school play. (Many, many opportunities there)<br>  <br>  The lack of organized sports can also be a drawback to home-school for some. Many areas are now allowing home educated youth to participate in high school and Junior high school programs, but many others do not. And in some areas, the home-school community has either fielded their own teams or has created their own league. <br>  <br>  Finally, the time and money commitment of home school can be a major burden on the family. Although it is possible to "Home school for free" it isn't easy to develop the resources, and someone has to do the teaching. <br>  <br>  This should give you some things to think about as you work through your paper. In the final analysis though, it is the educational and life skills outcome that matters the most. Statistics indicate that home schooled students out perform their public school peers, but there are inherent biases in the stats.|`|YCmvBc05aa	The following article describes the positives and negatives of homeschooling :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/673209/is_home_schooling_an_option_for_you.html?cat=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The only negative aspect of homeschooling is having to deal with ignornace, for instance those that make assumptions that homeschoolers do not socialize, can not attend college, etc.  Actually, the opposite is true.<br>  <br>  Statistics show that homeschoolers are better socialized-they experience real world socialization, not the artificial and forced socialization found in schools.  They also have more time for social activities, because they are not stuck at a desk for 7 or so hours a day, adn then sent home with homework.<br>  <br>  The reason that you are not finding any negative information, is because there are no negatives to homeschooling alone.  There might be sporadic cases of neglect, abuse, etc. where homeschooling was involved or those involved claimed to be homeschooling but that is not a negative of homeschooling-no more than, say, it is the fault of public schooling when a child is neglected or abused in the home.<br>  <br>  Do you really "totally agree" with something that is complete nonsense?  My children are 11 and 9 (I also have a one year old).  Both play baseball, basketball and are in Scouts.  We are involved in a homeschool group which gets together for P.E., play dates, and academic and social gatherings (spelling bee, Valentine's Party, etc.).  They attend church, we sometimes frequent a youth worship center that works through music.  They are in 4H.  <br>  <br>  They also socialize with the elderly lady in line behind us at the grocery store, the baby in the waiting room at the doctor's office, the teller at the bank...socializing is not limited to school, and it certainly should not be ONLY with those born the same year you were and living in roughly the same neighborhood.  The real world is nothing like that, with the possible exception of a nursing home.  <br>  <br>  And, for the record, I was always told I was NOT at school to socialize, and when yo uget down to it-there is very little time for socialization at school.|`|LsAArkUyaa	The socialization stereotype is an ignorant assumption made by people who have no idea what they are talking about.<br>  Most homeschoolers belong to groups that have numerous activities from clubs, to classes to social gatherings.<br>  Homeschoolers on the average are involved with more clubs and extra curricular activities than there public school counterparts.<br>  <br>  The reason you can only find positive things is because in general there are no negative effects. You will only find isolated cases of negative incidents.<br>  <br>  ETA: The article that penpress linked to is speaking about virtual public charter schools. Public schools do not provide curricula, computers, printers, virtual classes etc to homeschoolers. The author (who just happens to be PenPress) of the article has no idea what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  No homeschool parents are not required to have a degree. Considering that homeschoolers routinely score extremely well on standardized test, the lack of degree has no negative effect on the education of the children.<br>  <br>  ETA: I can not speak for religious homeschoolers, but want to point out that private Christian schools are not required to teach evolution or anything else that goes against their religious beliefs. Therefore using the religious argument against homeschool is moot unless one wants to also stop or change the laws that apply to private school.<br>  <br>  I also want to point out that in most states, private school teachers do not have to have a teaching degree or any formal teacher training.

K0FabRAIaa	I began homeschool because my 12 year old dreaded - rather hated - school. She had lost all interest in the simple joy of learning. Her gifted status was rewarded with extra and harder work, in addition to the tedious busy work - sometimes while the other students were in recess! huh?? <br>  <br>  Now I embrace her interests. She follows a basic/core curriculum, at her pace (which is often ahead of her public school peers). One of her lessons yesterday was on the Gettysburg Address.This lesson was intended for grades 9-12, but she understood and enjoyed it. She is able to dig deep into subjects of interests instead of being bogged down and bored out of her mind with busy work. <br>  <br>  Thank goodness I realized the benefits of homeschooling before my 8 year dd became bored of school. She still loves to learn, and I'm amazed at the levels she takes her studies too. Just yesterday, I had her go through a second grade math workbook just to make certain she knows what will show up on the state assessment test, and she looked at me like I was giving her kindergarten work! <br>  <br>  For the record, I do not plan on being their only teacher when they reach high school levels. When it is time for physics, trig, etc. they will have qualified teachers; however, I am perfectly competent to teach them until that time.<br>  <br>  If my kids want to return to the public school system, I will not stand in their way. I support and respect their opinions. <br>  <br>  I do not have anything against the public system. I do not homeschool for religious reasons or any other common misconceptions. I homeschool because my children wanted to try it, and I wanted them to enjoy learning about the world we live in. <br>  <br>  My daughter dreaded public school at such a young age, and that was a very bad sign to me. My dd wasn't picked on - she was school president, and had a lot of friends. She was just bored. Since I was in the position to homeschool, and she asked me to, I was willing to give it a try. We all love it. As far as the "socialization," issue, they both have many friends.<br>  <br>  I have to add another homeschool plus. Younger dd loves music and drama. She now has the time to pursue these interests. When she was in public school, just making it to piano lessons was a hassle because she felt like she never had any free time. Now she practices piano, is trying to learn guitar, and has even gotten involved in a play.<br>  <br>  Plain old pleasure reading also suffered during our public school years. There wasn't any extra time. Older dd loves to read, and now actually has the time to enjoy it.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	Well obviously you have not looked at all the statistics.  All those many hours of training and studying are failing you.  Most of those hours are in crowd control anyway and you are even failing there.  Half of your class is drugged into compliance per your demand so you can continue with your outdated photocopied busywork.  Stats show homeschool moms with barely a high school diploma are outperforming you by leaps and bounds.  Colleges are recruiting her students instead of yours.  After 12 years of schooling her students are still self motivated, still love and are excited about learning.  <br>  <br>  What is illogical is that you are still spending all that money, wasting all those training hours, have an enormous budget, have all kinds of technology given you and are still statistically behind the homeschoolers.|`|jtmXnJf4aa	I understand you are not trying to be insulting, but insinuating all homeschooled families are inferior to traditional schooling certainly comes off that way. With that said...<br>  <br>  - I only have one student, whereas you have two to three dozen. I can use a Teacher's Edition just as well as you can, and because my class size is a lot smaller than yours, I have the opportunity to branch off into related subjects much more readily. <br>  <br>  - I do not have to worry about Johnny PITA interrupting the class every five minutes, or Sally Tattle Tale once again telling me Johnny PITA is flicking boogers at her. If my student has an issue, needs to use the bathroom, is hungry, is lost on a subject, etc., I can start and stop whenever is needed, without the delay resulting in lost focus time.<br>  <br>  - If my student would like to take a day off, for whatever reason, it's no problem. We can work at night, the next day, in the car, at the store, on vacation, or any other time where he will be at his best and brightest. This includes setting his own sleeping schedule, which teens need nine hours.<br>  <br>  - My student does not have to conform to "Industry Standards" - no uniforms or hip clothing requirement, no crapola lunches, no gang fights, time wasted on switching classes, etc.<br>  <br>  - If my student is just "not getting it", we can move onto something else and come back to it later. <br>  <br>  - If, after I have gone to the best of my ability and he's still "not getting it", we can seek out someone who is an expert in that field.<br>  <br>  - If my student wants to learn something, anything, even if it's not what other kids his age are studying, we can get into that as well, spending as much time on the subject as he likes.<br>  <br>  I trust this answers your question.|`|krgtMHx7aa	It's teachers like you who made me decide to home school.  If you are a teacher I am sure you realize that all a "teaching degree" is is a degree in crowd control.  I wanted my child to actually learn to think and have problem solving skills, not just learn to recite standard answers.  If I was unqualified to teach my child then he should have been taken away from me at birth.  Did I send him to school to learn to walk, talk, potty train, tie his shoes, dress and feed himself?  No I did it, and he does quite well.  He learned the difference between right and wrong; and the difference between opinion and fact.  He learned how to think for himself and not just to blindly follow what is popular.  At 16 he was a high school graduate.  At 19 he is a manager at his job.  He is also a licensed certified storm chaser and has certification in computer science.  I think for being so unqualified in your opinion that I have done a very good job in raising and education my child.  Maybe you should learn to think outside the box and realize that there is no one size fits all in life.  Some kids do just find in public school, and others get lost in the system.  My son was the latter, and I cared too much about him to just let him fall through the cracks.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	uh youre not a very good teacher.

Public schools in the United States were started mostly for the poor immigrants and factory workers who weren't able to teach their children at home; it was not meant to be a system for everyone--only for those who had no other education available to them.  <br>  <br>  I was trained as a teacher, but I found the training to be mostly useless and a waste of time.  I was teaching children long before I was trained; my mother claims I was a born teacher as I was teaching my little sister to read once I'd figured it out myself.  And I improved my teaching more by reading on my own, listening to other teachers, and by trial-and-error.  Parents can easily do that on their own, especially when they aren't having to deal with a large class of children at the same time, but rather with a few individuals that they already know well.<br>  <br>  You may not be trying to be insulting.  But you are certainly succeeding.|`|BXALhzvtaa	A better analogy would be between a professional chef and someone cooking at home. Running a commercial kitchen requires all sorts of management skills, knowledge of health laws, yada yada yada. If a chef turned around and claimed that people without years of training are fools for trying to cook at home we would laugh in his or her face! <br>  <br>  It's clear that your training has only included that subset of educational theory and research which fits into the traditional schooling model. That's all you need to be a teacher of course, but it does not qualify you to pass judgement on methods of education which you know nothing about.<br>  <br>  If you were NOT trying to be insulting I just hope you don't teach English because insulting is exactly what you were. Little clue, using the word FOOL generally comes across as insulting.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	We do not go to the dentist daily, to have our teeth professionally cleaned.  We take care of the majority of our dental needs at home-brushing, flossing, etc. and only visit the dentist if there is a problem or a checkup.  Educating my children is no different-if there is a problem, we will seek outside help, and it will not be that of the government (just as I do not go to a "public" dentist assigned to me based upon where I live).<br>  <br>  Not to be insulting, but as a homeschooling parent, you should be wondering why homeschoolers do a better job without all of that training, and while spending much less than the local public school does.  I find THAT completely illogical.<br>  <br>  It seems to me as if you are insecure, and I understand that.  Your job is at stake!  But do not worry-many public schools are now trying to cash in on homeschooling by starting virtual schools.  They get the same funding, but with much less overhead.  <br>  <br>  Can YOU provide my child with a truly customized education?  Can YOU take my child and work solely based upon his/her strengths and weaknesses, and teach in the style that best suits his/her individual needs?  No, even with all of your training and studying you can not because you have 29 or so other students to focus on.  My child does not fit into a cookie cutter, so I choose to homeschool so that they are not pushed ahead or left behind because you have to teach to the average student in your class.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	You undertook FORMAL studies for years and years. We undertake INFORMAL studies for years and years. Both you and I can learn a heck of a lot during years of study. The benefit you have is that your years of study were accredited so you get the recognition. Oh, and you get paid for teaching too, lol. Definitely a benefit ;)<br>  Why do I homeschool? Plenty of reasons, but ultimately it comes down to responsibility and control. If I send my kiddies to school, I have the responsibility, but little control. I can't exactly waltz into the school and make them change their maths curriculum or whatever. If I have my kiddies at home, I have the responsibility but I also have the control. I will be aware of any problems a lot faster, and since I'm the decision maker, I can get about fixing them straight away.<br>  If it makes you feel any better, most homeschoolers don't think schools should be banned, they just don't think school is the best decision for their family. It's nice to have choice.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Different reasons for it. My boy has a mental illness and the kids really broke his spirit. After a talk with the Doctor we decided it would . better to get him out of that environment. I didn't push him anyway but talk to him.in a year he got his GED, which boasted his spirit. Over the last 4 years he has taught himself with the use of the computer and doing really well. He watches the game shows like Jeopardy and amazed what he can answer.  So to the cool kids who chose to be unkind to the  less fortunate and make fun of the ones who have have problems.  some day you will pick on the wrong person and if you send him/them over the edge. and you wonder why they kill innocent kids just remember  the blood could be on your hands. Next time think.
AA11043457	It is more of a danger for the teacher than the student.  The teacher can be charged with sexual harassment or if a grade is low then suddenly the student can claim there is a problem or another student can claim it is a problem when it involves another student.<br>  <br>  If you are attracted to an unmarried teacher then you are better to wait until you have already taken the teacher's class and are no longer in that class, and then see if  you can get acquainted.  It does happen. Happens a lot in night school.  The older the student, the less of a problem it is.  The big problem is that the students can be attracted to a teacher because of a subject or because the teacher is good at their job and it can be misunderstood.  And the teacher, as the older person can be an aggressor with a younger person, especially if the student is much younger.  It is not a good ethical situation as there should be no indication of improper behavior.  <br>  <br>  Many colleges will  have fraternization policies.  That is to protect the students, but also to protect the school as well to insulate it from lawsuits.<br>  <br>  This is something about which  you need to be careful but moreso when you are in a class.  If you are in a situation where you are both sort of interested, you might say that you would like to pursue a friendship when the class is over.  That way you have a timeline and if the other is interested, you will get together.|`|GBpLZ2REaa	Colleges do have rules about that- professors are not allowed to have relationships with a current student of theirs.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I always thought it still was not allowed, minor or not.

This interferes with the teacher's job to educate all students.<br>  <br>  It's legal, but it might threaten the teacher's job.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the student might actually be older than the teacher. Not all college students are young.|`|wDkiCzEiaa	It sounds like you're a student and that you're rather cavalier about your ability to mess with the teacher's career -- "can claim sexual harassment if they want to."

It's more of a risk for them because of their job, but as long as you're both mature it should be ok.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Sorry but at any level, teachers need to draw a line between themselves and their students. It is their ethical responsibility to consider a student's educational needs above their own needs for personal satisfaction.<br>  <br>  Another issue that comes up is that there will always be an imbalance of power in the relationship. The teacher is an authority figure, so that will always impact the relationship. This another reason why it is considered unethical.<br>  <br>  I would certainly have my doubts about getting into a relationship with a person who is not ethical and has poor boundaries. These are signs of other personality weaknesses.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	It is against the rules for faculty members at just about all colleges (I find it hard to believe that yours has no such rules - are you sure you checked the faculty handbook and the sexual harassment policy?), because the relationship is unequal, which makes it sexual harassment, and because it is unfair not only to the other students.

When even if you think you don't want to be with them, after so long without them, even if you've both put on the facade of moving on, you can't take it anymore and will do anything to be with them, and they will do the same.  Love is when they smile, and whatever the case, it makes you feel a little lighter inside.  Love isn't that insatiable desire we know as lust and confuse with love.  Love comes after that.  Love is when the fire dies down but the warmth is still there. You can see love in laughter that never gets old, in anger that always fades, in a simple kiss on the forehead years after you've been together.  Love isn't perfect.

mm7ABdlXaa	As far as the chatty chatty... my solution is to not fight them.  I always give my kids an option - "We can do this now, or we can do it at recess/lunch."  Then they can choose.<br>  I also often say, "I'll start when you're ready."<br>  I know the dynamics of every classroom are different - but it works with my kids.<br>  The hardest part is keeping my voice normal and not trying to talk above them.  The second hardest part is waiting.  Two minutes can seem like an hour sometimes!<br>  Anyway, when I say,  "I'll start when you're ready" the kids start policing themselves - there's a lot of shushing and they settle down pretty quick.  None of them want to stay in for recess/lunch and do school work.<br>  I'm also pretty firm when students are speaking - I reinforce my expectations by interrupting when I have to - like - "I'm sorry Abby, I couldn't hear you over another conversation that was going on, would you take a look around, make sure your audience is ready and start again."  Or, before the speaker starts I'll remind them what their job is - to listen, and who should be speaking - the speaker.<br>  Sometimes I feel pretty gruff, but we have a lot of fun too.<br>  I think classroom management is fluid, and it will always be a concern for every teacher.<br>  Good luck!  Keep truckin' - you'll find your groove...|`|ORonhAuvaa	Consider teaching and rewarding the behavior that you want to see. Most teachers are never taught to teach behavior, but it is something that you must do. If you don't teach the routines that you need to use during instruction, then you will be fighting a losing battle.<br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions:<br>  1. Write a list of routines for every lesson that you teach. These include handing in papers, entry into the classroom, checking for homework, taking attendance etc. Then plan to teach and then role play each routine. Students can really take advantage during these times if you don't have routines and procedures.<br>  <br>  2. Make sure you have your rules posted. For each type of lesson you will be teaching, write the list on the overhead or have on a card at their desks. You will will want to include the rules for talking, how they will signal that they will need help and movement allowed for each lesson. Teach, demonstrate and then reward the student for demonstrating these behaviors.<br>  <br>  3. Have work on their desks every time they enter the classroom, be it in the morning, after lunch or whenever. It should take from 3-5 minutes, is something they know how to do and that will hold their attention. This creates a completely different atmosphere when kids come in. Instead of milling around getting in trouble, they walk in with a purpose and are given points for getting to work. This also allows you to come in and do what you need to do without a thousand kids distracting you.<br>  <br>  4. If you plan to use cooperative groups like Kagan stuff you must teach cooperative group behaviors. I have had teachers tell me a million times that their groups can't work together. I ask them if they have taught group behaviors and they look at me like I grew a third eye. Use your table team system to reward good groups.<br>  <br>  5. Have a hierarchy of consequences posted in your room for violations of the rules. You might give a warning, a time out in the room, a time out in anther room, a phone call home and then a referral. See if your school has any policies regarding this. Do not hesitate to follow though. Do it now.<br>  <br>  6. Put the students in row teams or table teams. Let them choose the name of their groups. Post the names on the board. Tell them that their group needs to earn points to gain recess and/or a treat at the end of the day. Be sure to make it enough points so you can give lots of points.<br>  <br>  7. Announce the behavior that you want to see: "I am giving a point to table teams that have their social studies book out and are quietly looking at me." Or, "I will dismiss groups that have put their books away and are quietly looking at me." This way you are not giving attention to misbehavior.  Also, you are using peer pressure to get children to do as you want.<br>  <br>  When I see teachers who are having a tough time with behavior, inevitably they are giving most of their attention to students who are misbehaving. They don't make use of proximity praise that works very well in the elementary classroom. Change this around and begin specifically praising children who are behavior as they should.<br>  <br>  Instead of telling students what they are doing wrong, tell them what you will do. "I am letting kids go to recess whose team has 8 team points." I am letting kids go to recess who have completed all of their assignments." This is much more powerful.<br>  <br>  Some teachers use a a card system with green, blue, yellow and red cards. Some of them can make this work, but it is a negative system. However it does how a child visually what standing they are in in terms of their behavior. I much prefer giving team points and ignoring as much misbehavior as I can. You can use both in combination with each other. Just don't allow yourself to go back to attending to misbehavior. <br>  <br>  You can develop a star chart to use as a behavior management tool if team points don't work for this group. Have each student's name with a line on a poster sized piece of paper that has been laminated. Use a Vis a Vis pen or erasable marker to write stars on the chart. You will prompt the star behaviors in the same way that you prompt point behavior with table teams. "I am giving a star to students who are working quietly." Don't ever be afraid of giving too many stars. It means that you are using more positives than negatives.<br>  <br>  You don't need to force your authority on students. The keys are to set up positive behavior management systems and teach and reward the children to do the behavior. Also, routines and classroom management systems allow for much better behavior.<br>  <br>  When you first start any of these systems, do not hesitate to call parents if kids decide not to comply. This will make its way around the other kids and they will respect you more. <br>  Always follow through with what you decide to do and make it fair. Give warnings, praise kids doing the right thing and then proceed through you consequence hierarchy.<br>  <br>  Finally, doesn't it defy logic that we teach all the other subje|`|AA10188961	Are you just yelling or do you have a punishment lined up? You've got to mean business and let them know you the authority to line them out.   Once they know you don't have to go for back up and that you're not scared of them they will begin to respect you.  <br>  Forget about all of the bargaining and bribing them they teach you in college. When you get control/respect then you can have fun.  If you are constantly begging them for their attention, that is what you will continue to do.|`|i0R3OxgCaa	Firstly try to remember what it was like for you in fifth grade when a sub. came in? second they know you are only a sub. so their not going to care too much what you think of them if you want their respect treat them as equals not subordinates.<br>  <br>  Try a fun exercise at the beginning of class to get their attention not P.E. but a thought provoking exercise.|`|AA10409832	You get what you expect.  One thing I would do would be to level with them.  Take a few minutes at the beginning of a class and tell them you know you're only a student teacher in their eyes, but that you have a lot to offer them, if they would only pay attention and give you some respect.  Tell them how much you respect them, telling them how and why you respect them.  Make sure you look them all in the eye.  Tell them that you have some good classes to present to them, but they are making it difficult for you to show them.  Tell them you need their attention and would appreciate the same kind of respect that you give to them.  Tell them that you want to be a good teacher, but they are making it difficult, and discuss the respect factor again.  See how that works.  Yelling and trying to assert yourself will get you nowhere if your students don't see you as an authority figure.  Try getting into their minds by talking to them about the above.  If that doesn't work, you need to discuss this issue with your supervising teacher.  You sound like you care about yourself and your students.  We need more teachers like you in education.  Too many of our young teachers just want to collect a paycheck.  That is so wrong.  Good luck to you and I hope that you succeed with this class.  Don't get discouraged.  There will always be good days and bad days no matter what career you're in.  I hope for the best for you.  God bless you.|`|AA11043457	I am not a teacher but used to be a union rep for teachers.  There are some things you can do.  First, talk to your mentor teacher about this question.  You might go over and close the door and then speak to the class about getting out books and opening them to page whatever -- that way you are taking charge and giving them an assignment.  Try to learn the kids names and speak to one who is still talking at that point or ask a question to the one who is keeping on with conversation.  Doesn't sound like they are bad kids, but just enjoying one another's company.  You are smart to look at this early as discipline and classroom management is one of the biggest reasons new teachers lose jobs or quit.  So you need to get the attention and control early on.  Te do push student teachers and subs so expect that.<br>  <br>  You may be able to give assignments and start the reports on the "subject" you assigned them.  Sort of let them summarize part of the lesson if they are up to it.  Give them a few extra points if you have that flexibility for their participation.  Be fair with it.  See if there are volunteers for the next class or do that once a week and have kids summarize the week and do reports or have the person be ready to answer questions and the rest of the class to ask the questions.  But the person up front should be a volunteer and should know the subject.  <br>  <br>  The big thing is to have some means of letting them know that time for class is here and you begin.  Shutting the door could be a trigger.  Telling them to do something and walking out in front of them is a way of getting attention.  You can ask a student a question about homework or the lesson (to distract them from a conversation) or call on those who are chatty - let them talk to the entire class on the subject.<br>  <br>  Use your mentor teacher.  If you don't click with that teacher, find someone with whom you can relate and ask them ways they do whatever it is you want to do.  Let them know that kids aren't wild or anything but you want to know how to pull their attention right away so no class time is lost.  Let them know that you respect their opinion.  You might be able to observe other teachers, too, and that helps.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  It sounds like you are doing a good job.  Oh, by the way, another thing that helps is to get to know the kids, and to send out "success cards" to the parents of kids to let them know something that went well at school.  If you are a member of the NEA (Student group) at college, they may be able to provide you with some "Success Cards" and your membership in the SNEA may count toward the NEA membership dues as well.  You can probably design your own at home on the computer by putting some teaching symbol on it - a desk or something or an apple and then mark it Success or Good News or something and have lines to write on and a line for your signature.  And make sure there is a student name line.  And tell the parent what went right at school that day.  it doesn't matter what grade it is, parents love to hear good things about their kids and they are more supportive of you the teacher if there is any dispute between you and the student as they know you like their kid because you send nice notes from time to time about their kid.  The kids get appreciation at home because of that note as well and so they think more of you.  They know you care and so they work with  you a bit better as  you like them.  It is funny how just a paper pat on the back like this can help.  Now it isn't easy to pat kids on the back and sure can't hug them so a note home to parents (and mail it, don't send it with the kid) is a pat on the back.<br>  <br>  Learning  should be exciting and fun.  Or I always thought so.  I wouldn't mind being a perpetual student.  I think maybe I am.  I graduated from law school at 50.  And I'm learning scrapbooking now.  I need to take a few computer classes, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|qsCj0S7daa	Try rearranging the students to sit next to others who they might have less is common with and will therefor talk less. Do you think their may be too many things stimulating them? Try to keep distractions to a minimum by ensuring only the books and supplies needed at the moment are around. Try putting other books that they do not need on a shelf away from the children and just passing them out when you are teaching the subject. Keep transition times to a minimum to give them less time to start a conversation. finally, sometimes kids just need a breather! give them a 10 min break to get it all out of their systems! :)|`|uC1MHjK7aa	I am currently a high school student and I remember quite a few things my elementary teachers would do to make our class quiet down. They seemed to work pretty well.<br>  <br>  1. First layout the consequences to the class. Make it short and to the point. Like the first warning is just a verbal warning, the second time you call parents or something and the third time you go to the office. Once they understand the consequences it might be a motivator to keep their behavior under control.<br>  <br>  2. Layout the rewards. If the class does well all week they can bring in snacks and drinks on Friday or something. Or they can have extra recess or things like that on Friday. This way they will have more motivation to control themselves.<br>  <br>  Different ways to signal the class needs to be quiet:<br>  <br>  1. Tell them that when the lights are turned out everyone is to be silenced and frozen. Our teachers did this with us a lot and it worked pretty well. The teacher didn't have to yell over us or anything. Plus when you can't see the people your talking to, you tend to stop talking and usually when the lights go out whatever you are doing stops instantly because of the drastic change and you will get their attention easier. <br>  <br>  2. When the class starts talking a bunch tell them that if you waste your time you will waste their time. Break out your watch and tell them that however long it takes them to be quiet, it will be deducted from recess time or lunch. Kids usually stop pretty quickly when they hear their recess time is being taken away. After a few times of this when they see you looking at your watch they will get the hint and shush up quickly.<br>  <br>  3. On the main board in the class room have a small box drawn at the corner. Everytime during the day that the class becomes too disruptive you put a tally mark in the box. Once they reach a certain limit like say 5 tally marks, something gets taken away like part of recess or something. When they see you put a tally mark up they will start to quiet down. Also you could do this as a goal for them. If they get less than like 10 tally marks during the whole week they get extra recess time or get to bring snacks in on Friday. <br>  <br>  4. When they get unruly you can tell them "I had a fun lesson planned for you guys but if you continue to act this way i'm not going to be able to do it and you guys can do boring worksheets or book work instead. It's your choice" This one works pretty well also.<br>  <br>  5. Make some fake paper "money/dollars" print and cut a bunch out. Tell the class that whenever you see a student that is being on task or has good behavior they will be given some "dollars" as a reward. At the end of each six weeks you will have some prizes at your "store" and they can use their "dollars" to buy prizes with. We did this in 6th grade and everyone loved counting their dollars up and being able to buy stuff with "money" you earned. You can also come up with a creative name for the "money" too. Like "Super Bucks", "Class Cash", "Bonus Bucks". Or use the school mascot like, "Mustang Bucks", "Coyote Bucks" etc. This was my favorite method for good behavior. Also we were given our "bucks" when we turned in papers that had to be signed by parents on time, or if you brought in home work on time, or if you got an A on a test or something. They didn't do it every single time, it was kind of like special bonuses in a way. So if you did your homework then you would always be able to get those extra bucks if the teacher decided to give them that day or not. <br>  Also the bucks are good for doing class games as well. Like you could have 5 students line up at the board and give them all the same math problem or something. Who ever solves it first and correctly gets bucks. You can be really creative with the bucks and it's really fun for the kids and they will want to participate more in games like that too. <br>  <br>  Those are about the main ones that worked for us when I was in elementary school. Good luck and I hope some of these help from a student's point of view.

AA10407542	I think the answer is in your question.  I am not saying that leggos are completely out for 3 and 4 year old children, but the purpose on the mentioned (leggos.com) is to build SOMETHING.  There is usually a “model” for what is expected as an outcome for building and this is why I would lean towards this activity not being with where these children are developmentally.  Can they re-produce what is shown to them?  Im sure some can but many cant.  When you mention the aspect of “play” I would do just that.  It is ok to allow the children to manipulate the leggos completely on their own.  You might introduce a story before about home, building, etc. but its not mandatory.  I want to bring up another aspect of development and fine motor skills.  At this age, the ability of snapping smaller leggos together could be a challenge…..could be a frustration.  The lesson should reflect something that encourages investigation, cognition, negotiation, creativity, fine motor……. If the children either have a unattainable goal, or task that is frustrating, it could hinder this process.  Are there any other manipulatives you can get your hands on?  If there are, you might consider bringing these in too for an experiment of your own observationally.  See how the children respond to a manipulative they can actually work with.  I would say that if you think your children do enjoy playing with the leggos…….put some out, and let them figure out where they want to go.  These are actually great!  I would say it’s a blank canvass for them to snap and build something that THEY envision.  Don’t over think this one and be confident that although you are not directing the children what to do, by allowing them to direct the play, you are meeting huge developmental needs.  You’ve got this one!|`|0YRFCzYaaa	make a massive tower<br>  houses are quite easy they can make their own<br>  cars - then you can race<br>  make it fun, simple and exciting.|`|dBpmyIduaa	To begin with, you may have to demonstrate how the blocks join together.  You may have to spend an entire lesson letting the kids explore different ways to join the blocks.  I would let the children lead the lessons.  Just begin making something and talking with the kids.  Ask them what they would like to make and help each of them with their creation.  Children this young do not always know how to play cooperatively so they will probably want to make something different from the other children and they will most likely want to work alone.|`|Ke9cILe6aa	I am glad that you are not teAching an English class!

Is there any possibility that it could have been her ears or her teeth which has now turned into a habit of waking up and wanting you to console her? What about colic? Also with her condition breathing might be uncomfortable. Has anyone suggested inclining her mattress so she is not laying flat? Does she fall asleep in a swing, car seat, or other position that might give you a hint into what makes her comfortable. Her medical condition complicates things but if you have checked everything out and can install a camera in her room to watch her, you might want to try letting her cry and soothe herself. I know it's hard, but it usually takes only 3 nights tops. Constantly picking her up could be perpetuating the cycle. I went through this with my own children everytime we ended a bout of illness. They learned very quickly that mommy came a running when they didn't feel well and getting them to "unlearn" that was always a chore. Good luck!

Hang items of the same mass from the paper clip.  (Heavy washers work well.) Measure the length of the rubber band. Plot number of items vs. length of rubber band. <br>  This one is nice because it also includes an intuitive y-intercept.<br>  <br>  Plot height from which any sort of bouncy ball is dropped vs. height of first bounce.  I like tennis balls.  Basketballs get pretty noisy in the classroom.<br>  <br>  Take sips of water from a graduated cylinder or some other finely marked measure of volume (Those push-tube measurers work well.) Plot sips vs. volume.  This is fun because it has an intuitive y-intercept, and intuitive x-intercept, and a negative slope.<br>  <br>  Drop a ping pong ball from various heights and plot height vs. number of bounces.  This messes with kids heads because they get a flat graph.  Above a few inches the ping pong ball reaches terminal velocity.<br>  <br>  I haven't done it, but I've seen a description involving a plank of wood with one end on a bathroom scale and one end propped up on a text book.  The variables are the distance of the person along the plank and the reading on the scale.<br>  <br>  I suppose you could do a rather simple one by weighing text books on a bathroom scale.  And you could use different types of texts to create different slopes.<br>  <br>  I like these because they include units in an organic way and they produce messy (read: real-life) data.  So we're drawing best fit lines, not just plotting points from an algebraic formula.<br>  <br>  It occurs to me a physical science or physics teacher might be a good source of basic data collecting that produces graphs.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GPdUBsaqaa	When I was in middle school my teacher had us "fly" down the hallway - widestretched arms like airplane wings, and all chant together as we went around corners - going right around a corner saying "Neeeeegggggative slope" and going left around a corner saying "Poooooossssitive slope"  - and when your arms are flat, going straight, you have 0 slope, but when your arms are straight up and down, you crash (no slope).|`|vjst7SKvaa	Just Come up with a competitive game or make a funny instructional video

g2wswnelaa	I can help you with this being I applied to FSU in 2006 coming from Long Island, New York (Sachem High School, GO ARROWS!). I got accepted with a 3.73 unweighted and 30 ACT score. Florida state university is raising its standards at this point with incoming freshman. My year we were the "smartest" incoming freshman class, but 2007 was smarter, than was so , and so on. You need to get that up first as a sophmore if you work hard enough you can. I'd say you will need at least a 3.4/3.5 and 1100 on the SAT. Dancing is good to add to the resume, as well as teaching. Make sure you keep everything up though because it won't look good if there is a stop date. Try and take more difficult courses such as AP and Honors when offered, most importantly take your core class (english, math, science, history, foreign language) for as long as you can. I did 4 in all of them and its not that grueling, the reward is well worth it down here at FSU. No more cold NY winter!|`|bkw69HoHaa	You'll be an out of state student, you will therefore be at a disadvantage as far as trying to get in. A 3.2 will not cut it. You need to buckle down and raise that GPA, you need to be in honor societies, you need to take AP and honors courses, a school sport would not hurt you. You also need to get a good SAT.<br>  But to be honest, if you applied today, you will not get in. Your GPA is going to be the hardest hurdle you have to jump over, get it up to at least a 3.8. Unless one of your parents went to the school and donate lots of money.|`|BJo2SB4vaa	Keep your grades up, it looks good so far. Get a decent score on your SAT and you should get in

Z5g7hCXraa	Here is a list of my favorite curriculums/workbooks that I've used:<br>  --Explode the Code, an inexpensive set of workbooks, teaching phonics from kindergarten age to about grade 3/4.  I've used this one for three kids, and they enjoy it.<br>  --Rod and Staff's preschool books are good for reading readiness and seatwork.<br>  --Dr. Suess's ABC for letter recognition and learning sounds<br>  --magnetic letters for playing with.  Kids will naturally ask you, "What's this?" and you say, "That's T, like t-t-two."  As they grow up, you can use these to build words on the fridge while you wash dishes!<br>  <br>  My four kids are all reading now, and I've homeschooled them all.  Be patient and sensitive toward your child's development, because they can learn to read only when they are ready.<br>  <br>  This is what you need to work on first:<br>  --following directions and sitting still (wow! that can be tough sometimes!)<br>  --fine motor skills, starting with coloring and cutting whatever they want<br>  --difference between numbers and letters "numbers tell how many, and letters make a sound"<br>  <br>  Sing the ABC song, with the letter sounds, as you point to the letters.  I used the back inside cover of Dr. Suess's ABC.  Make sure you use short vowels and a hard c.<br>  <br>  Regarding the age of the child, think how differently your children learned to walk.  They're ready when they're ready, not when a textbook says they should be.  Be alert, and seize each little, brief teaching moment as it happens.  Two of my children were more aware of numbers before letters, and were well into grade 1 math before reading really took hold.  The other two naturally read, almost teaching themselves.  So much depends on the individual.  If one child is taking longer than your friend's child, be patient.  You don't want to teach him/her to hate reading.  Make sure you spend lots of time on something that they're already good at.<br>  <br>  There's so much to say on this topic.  I hope this helps you.  <br>  Key words: patience, individual development, mother's intuition|`|dx3jXzuxaa	We started with "Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons."  Then added "Hooked on Phonics." The kids also loved "Jump Start Phonics" and some other phonic CD-ROM's we've picked up here and there.  Usborn has a set of flashcards that has all of the phonemes, and that really helped too. The real key is to work with your child consistently until they've mastered the basic skills.|`|GueT6tRlaa	When I taught my kids how to read i wrote the alphabet on a dry erase board.

Be friendly, talk openly, smile, don't swear, etc.<br>  <br>  It depends on schools, but for tutoring, the supervisor might ask you for a recommendation from a professor on the subject you are likely to tutor.|`|W3CEYkebaa	Depends on what your school requires, and the department you want to work for.

There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program.

If looked at rotated, you'll see it looks like a couple eyes above a large frowning face. I'm sure I don't need to explain that a frown is generally a show of sadness or other negative emotion.|`|kB7pHahLaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  If it's like this:        :D<br>  Then it's a super-happy face.<br>  <br>  If it's like this:        D:<br>  Then it's eather a shocked face, or a sad face.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	As the first poster mentioned, private schools as a general rule don't have slots set aside for specific geographic areas.  This is in contrast to public schools which have ratios set up for the maximum amount of out of state residents they can take in.  This is as state-sponsored university systems take a large chunk of their funding from state general fund appropriations (state taxpayer money).  MIT as a private school most certainly will not care if you live right next door, it is irrelevant in the admissions process.|`|i2sdMDUGaa	Private schools hardly consider where you live for admission. As long as you have the GPA, the killer essay, the high SAT scores, murderous AP classes, and extracurriculars. <br>  <br>  <br>  Both M.I.T and Stanford are hard to get into. So apply to both. <br>  <br>  Besides admission, location is still important. If you live at home, it will be easier because you have less to worry about. That way you can focus on you studies, and save tons of money too.<br>  <br>  And, also, have some safe schools. Stanford and M.I.T are really difficult to get into.|`|0BtPNwwmaa	Colleges like to say that they have students from all 50 states so if you are applying from a state far away with a low population you do enhance your chances (e.g. South Dakota).  Massachusetts is a densely populated state and so most colleges get plenty of applicants from there so not likely to be an advantage anywhere.

trKgx3Ukaa	I know of people who are in their fifties going to law, medical and chinese medicine, to list just a few. There are others who were mechanics, just like you, and re-invented themselves as mechanical engineers with a degree and have found themselves jobs easily because they had not only the theory, but also the practical experience and so made better engineers. <br>  <br>  One person who is now a lawyer ( graduated at age 55) was not able to find a job as a lawyer in a private firm, but she is working part-time for a non-profit legal service and has her own law business as well. <br>  <br>  The fact is, it's not too late to re-invent yourself. You have two options:<br>  1. sit around and just lose time with nothing to show for it, since you cannot find a job, or<br>  <br>  2. use this free time to build on your existing skills by enrolling in engineering for example, or do a law degree. <br>  <br>  The latter course of action sounds far more sensible to me.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of going back to school and learning new skills. Do it one course at a time to start with and get a feel for being a student again, and build confidence. Then, you might just get a real blast from your success and launch into it full time.  <br>  <br>  You are not unique in this regard. Many others have gone before you, some much older than you, and have never regretted their decision to move forward. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|xvxtQwV5aa	You are NEVER too old to continue education. I encourage you to go for it. You can try to get financial aid, grants, or loans to pay. Check with an admissions clerk to discuss your options. Once you're taking some classes, you can try to find a job in that field, even if only as a secretary position or something of the sort, anything in the field. Until you can get a job in the field, I would recommend just applying at every place you can find to get a job. Even if it's McDonald's, don't let it hurt your pride. Remember, it's a temporary income source until you find something better and -- A job is better than NO job these days. I hope you decide to go back to school and don't let anyone stand in your way or tell you you can't because you can This is your chance to start over and college is the first step to providing yourself with a better life and a<br>   better retirement. <br>  Good Luck ! and Congratulations! for considering college as an option because it is, even if you're 39. It's never too late to take charge of you future.|`|6orvOtT6aa	It is a good idea for you to go back to school right now regardless of your age.

That's what I am. The only real SAT prep I had was I took the test in 8th and 9th grade for practice because I got chosen or whatever.<br>  I think it depends on your studying style. For a normal test, some people study weeks in advance. Those people would study years ahead of time for the SAT. Some people, like me, study for tests the night before (a couple days before for midterms and finals), but that is what works for me. So for me I would probably start studying about a month before. <br>  The SATs arent that hard, and for the math you won't even know some of the things when you are a freshman if you are in geometry, and I think it's best to learn them in school before studying them on your own.|`|tt08Ve96aa	13-14|`|HADJO7Epaa	Early sophomore year because it gives you enough time to study and prepare but doesn't turn one into a mindless bubblefilling robot at a young age!|`|PFm1dI55aa	Freshman year of high school, so they can see their schoolmates taking the test.

HADJO7Epaa	I took World History SAT II without taking the AP test and found it not bad at all. However there is (at least when I took it in Dec 2006) a greatr focus on Ancient History than modern history and major events like WWI and WWII. You should do well on it if you took AP! I got a 620 and I took it after a year of honors.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

iGxZvP3aaa	This is a pretty good way to find out which schools are good teaching colleges, and to find out information in general.<br>  <br>  Contact several schools in the area/state you want to go to school.  Tell them what you want to study and that you are interested in their school.  In the conversation ask them what are some other schools who offer a good teaching program.  Do this with several schools and you will probably see one or two schools get mentioned often by other colleges.<br>  <br>  Another route is to contact school districts and ask them which colleges they like to see on an applicants resume or which schools they recommend for their faculty who are working on a masters.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GPdUBsaqaa	You can use the US College Report rankings - they do rankings for the Top 10 teaching colleges, Top 10 architecture colleges, etc etc.  But honestly you don't need to go to the "best" teaching college - teachers are so badly needed in most areas that a degree in teaching is plenty to get you a job....some states are more competitive, like Connecticut or Virginia, so how badly you need a "Best" college depends on where you want to teach.|`|xDahhvwoaa	Depends where you live.

6IXrgxqSaa	Eugene I hope my explanation can help with your project. <br>  Leaders, economists, bankers of countries around the world start to see and say that the cause of the financial crisis is a problem with the trust between people and a mutual effort is necessary to make progress but they don't have a clear way to correct the problem. So they themselves are in fear of not knowing how to get out of this mess, not to mention there old egoistic ways and systems that worked before to benefit themselves are gradually falling apart in a big way.<br>  <br>  To overcome further deepening of a crisis we have to acknowledge the existence of a crisis at the global level. This is coming more clear each day but not everyone feels it as such yet. The global crisis is not only in economy but also in education, collapse of the family, disease drugs, terror, uncontrollable social systems, the threat of the use of nuclear weaponry, ecological catastrophes, and more. <br>  <br>  The reason behind all these ill effects we sense in the world today is man's ever growing egoism (to make efforts only for selfish benefit with no concern for others). That being our egoistic inner intentions and relations with one another in humanity.<br>  <br>  The crisis reveals more and more each day how interconnected and interdependent all of humanity is. Like one global village. Or you can say like cells in a body. In that case the correct diagnosis is the body is currently unhealthy. So until humanity is educated about the integral global system we live in and incorporate in our lives a method to correct our egoism the crisis will only continue to grow in many ways. <br>  <br>  I included some links that I hope help you with your project.Good luck.

I had never been to NY before, but I found out that I love NY and now I'm going to college there in the fall! I met a ton of amazing people I still talk to too!

One day the student asked his instructor how long it would take to achieve the rank of black belt.

The instructor responded that it would take eight years.<br>  <br>  Even more puzzled, the student then asked how long it would take to advance to black belt if he practiced eight times as hard and eight times as long every day. The instructor responded that it would take sixteen years.<br>  <br>  The student, feeling very frustrated at this point, asked why it would take longer to earn a black belt when he was trying harder and practicing constantly to earn it. The instructor responded "If you have one eye constantly on the black belt, that only leaves one eye to focus on what you are currently learning."<br>  <br>  The point to take from this is don't get too caught up in thinking about the next belt after the one you are preparing for, but to keep your focus where it belongs and be the best at the level you are currently at.

v5SXqxo0aa	I don't know anyone with those qualifications, but I do have public school friends who took Conceptual Physics and just 5 classes senior year when both Honors and AP Physics were offered and made it into Yale early action. She did take Calculus BC senior year, but the point is that you do not need the hardest class available, as long as you pull off what you do have with A's. I know of several other such cases.<br>  <br>  If you make straight A's (or at least a 3.87+ unweighted) with at least 9 AP classes, Harvard should not be a problem no matter what math you take, especially if you are not planning on majoring in mathematics. If you do not (3.7+ unweighted), then Cornell, Brown, and U Penn should still be no problem.<br>  <br>  It is definitely possible to make it to the Ivy's from public school, so don't worry about that. What I'm cautious about is how you say you will take loads of extra currics. Colleges don't want that- no college, forget Ivy's. Ivy's want to see passion expressed to the highest levels physically possible. For example, if you are a violinist, you should be playing in premier or university symphonies by Junior year, such as the San Fransisco Youth Symphony.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. If you do plan to major in math, take a math course over the summer at community college so that you can skip a level at school. You want to have at least AP Calc AB.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The ivies leagues turn down thousands of valedictorians, straight-A students, and perfect SAT scorers every year.  You need high grades and test scores to get in, but those alone won't get you in.

It would be a waste of money around $40,000 a year, and it will probably be around $50,000 a year once you graduate from high school.<br>  <br>  So it will be a big investment. Also don't buy into the hype that you will make more if you graduate from an Ivy League, because that not true.<br>  <br>  The only people who would make more are the people whose families are already rich, or they have a good networking system.<br>  <br>  Keep all this in mind, while looking for good colleges.<br>  <br>  Toodles.|`|lSnHR3mTaa	First of all, even if you do participate in LOTS of extra curriculars, that doesn't mean anything.  Choose one or two to be in that you really dedicate yourself to and work yourself up in the ranks.  Colleges look for dedication and leadership.  You will also need a niche, a hook that colleges will like. For example, playing the viola in chamber orchestra or the baritone in concert band.  First year calculus is calculus AB and it is also an AP; therefore it is AP Calculus AB. Many people only go as high as AP Calc, and enter ivy leagues. It is already an advanced class considering most public high schools only require Algebra 1 level math to graduate.  In addition, make sure you have extremely high SAT scores. They are definitely an influential factor.

cXs3GOwPaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  A footnote can be many different things.  Determine what style your teacher wants.  It should be on the assignment, given in lecture, on your syllabus, or perhaps written on the board.  Chances are, it is MLA style if you are in public high school in the United States.  The Modern Language Association is one commonly cited authority for academic writing style.  The American Psychological Association (APA) or Chicago Manual (often called Turabian after the University of Chicago Secretary that so diligently edited Ph.D. candiates' drafts for umpteen million years) are two other sources.

Several are from Africa, including Tunisia, Cote d'Ivoir, Niger, Nigeria, etc. I also know a girl who came here from Qatar.   I am making assumptions here, because I don't know how their grades were before they came to college. However, I would assume that you would stand out among other applicants, simply because courses in many foreign countries tend to be more rigorous (from my understanding).

It would more than likely take at the very least 7 years with everything.   <br>  <br>  I would really really suggest majoring in just one of those.  There's not a lot of point in having both anyways.  You will only end up doing one of them.  Try out pediatric nursing for a little bit, and if you don't like it, then switch.

However it's also longer hours, much more stressful (sometimes dealing with life/death situations), and is very physically strenuous. You may have to work weekends and holidays.<br>  <br>  Teaching doesn't pay near as much (though the pay isn't as bad as some teachers complain it to be), however the hours are more favorable, and you get decent vacation (you have to do some training during the summer, however you get maybe a month or so off). It's also not as physically strenuous, and you get weekends and holidays off. <br>  <br>  Both jobs have comparable benefits packages.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that's some help to you. I will tell you this though, if you choose teaching, you have to do it because that's what you want to do. You have to enjoy it to make the pay cut you would take worth it. I teach, and I love it and I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Kinda strange for a 22-year-old guy who said he'd never be a teacher just two years ago ;-)

wZSvNggVaa	I'm really happy that you have decided to put your butt on gear and starting to realize that these choices you make will affect your future! <br>  <br>  You're still in time to make it into UCLA. What you will need to do is the following:<br>  <br>  1. Get the best grades you can! Get a tutor if you need to catch up, ask for extra credit to raise your grades, and give your studies 100%. You can do this! You just need to do the work!<br>  <br>  2. In Junior year, take your SAT's. This summer, get some SAT Prep books and you will do fine. If you can afford to take a course, go with the Kaplan course which is guaranteed to raise your grades!<br>  <br>  3. Extracurricular activities! Join clubs, do social community service! Anything! Join the Key Club! Whatever fits you best but keep yourself busy!<br>  <br>  And last but not least, ENJOY yourself! These are the last years of your High School career and you want to remember them by having a lot of fun! Give your studies a lot of time, and then you will develop studying habits that will allow you to balance yourself between hanging out with friends and studying!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|xvxtQwV5aa	James C said everything I was going to say.

Try some AP classes to get the extra point. 91% of their entering freshman have a 3.75 GPA and higher  and were in the 10th percentile of their class.<br>  This should not be discouraging though. Being able to speak a second language, athleticism, clubs, and community service makes an application very appealing. <br>  You can also strive for high test scores, aim for a 2200 for the SAT and 24-31 on the ACT.<br>  <br>  Also, community college isn't as bad as it has a reputation for. It's affordable and after two years worth of credits, you can enter any college or university in your state.

AEAxZEveaa	I don't know what it's like where you live, but I'm in Indiana and here each district does the picking process differently. I wanted to go so bad and where I'm at the people just pick people randomly, like people they know. They didn't go through the school or even ask people to apply. I kept waiting for them to announce that they were accepting applications for it and that time never came. THEN I heard that this girl I went to school with who was a C student and had a drug problem got picked, basically because her mom knew the lady that picked them. She didn't even go, she decided at the last minute that she wanted to stay home and hang out with her boyfriend. I was so mad because I wanted to go so bad and she just threw it all away. <br>  <br>  My point is, make sure you contact the people who do the selection process way in advance and figure out just how they pick them in your area. My high school boyfriend got to go because of his GPA. He went to a different school though. Just make sure you do your homework. I'm still mad about it 10 years later.
nZpSM7ngaa	JESUS is APUSH that hard!??!?!!??!  you have to take that class again,  colleges dont count classes at D or lower,   so summer school for you,  you have a good GPA as long as you fix that,  and you can make it maybe into a UC,  but your SAT score let you down on that also.  whats good is that you took a lot of AP classes,  and you need about 80 more community service hours.  oh,  if youre planning to major in linguistics,  apply to UC Santa Cruz,  i think they are either number one,  or in the top 5 top linguistic schools in the country.

You need to see what is causing this and fix this as soon as you can.<br>  <br>  As for getting kicked out, this really depends on your College. Some will cut you some slack but others may be a little strict. You need to contact your adviser or a counselor and ask them for advice. Mainly you need to concentrate on your studies. Make this your #1 priority. Remember, the choices you make today are the ones who will make you into the person you will be.

Maybe you could read some books more, get familiar with words and letters. It seems to me that your grammar isn't too bad. You made a little error on "right" and wrote "wright," but that's okay, haha. Try getting into drawing so your hands get more comfortable with writing. It just takes a bit more practice and focus.

You know that for every successful actor/actress there are thousands of starving ones.  Acting is fun but I think a lot of people do it because they want the attention and the significance they feel from it.  Those are bad reasons to do anything. Enjoy acting but pursue another career.  If you're good at acting you'll get discovered.  Otherwise you are smart to look at it as a hobby and interest but not a direction for your life.

She maybe able to get more resources since her father has lost his job.  Or she could apply for scholarships now at the college so maybe that could help.  She should be talking with her college to them know her EFC (family contribution) has changed and is in financial need.  At least that is what I think.  Schools don't require a dollar ammount in equity on the application process.<br>  <br>  Speaking w/ financial aid shouldn't affect her negativly if she needs the resources.

His loan debt is less than most cars. It sounds more like you are wanting to start your marriage. That is supposed to last forever. It's never too late to start forever - but if you make this happen without making him complete his degree I give you 5 years to divorce. It's not about the degree, it's about giving up. If you make him give up on completing college (even switching to go to school near you is giving up), how can he follow through with the commitment to you and a family.<br>  He is in his sixth year of college and still doesn't have the commitment to finish? He has 5 years with you and is not with you everyday like he is with college but he is commited to that? You are his safety zone, if he wants you he needs to earn you - tell him to finish his degree ASAP, set a deadline. Tell him he has one last chance at that deadline or you will move on - it is time to earn your wife. You deserve someone who will work with you and for you. He seems to be looking for another mommy who will let him take the easy road to failure and give him a hug for giving up.<br>  <br>  It sounds like he will prettly much do whatever you want. But if you encourage him and MAKE him do this to earn you and your love (don't you deserve someone who really wants to be with you?) it will be a much happier and longer marriage.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, this was about student loan debt..That amount should be paid off in 8-9 years by any WallMart employee. But a bad marriage lasts forever. Don't rush a lifetime, $150K or $200 in debt is manageable, but rushing your entire life because of 6 or 8 months is just stupid.

Trust me, if he moves, there will always be resentment and I guarantee (unless he's the above average person), gonna come back up in an argument.

Though moving was the right choice, there is still that "irk" there within that makes me wish I stayed at my old school. That usually pops up every few months, especially when money runs thin. <br>  <br>  In all, I say let the man be  a man.  He'll probably love you more if you support him through the hard times, and when he does move, it'll be easier to make the transition.

Unfortunately activist groups pull on the heart strings, they use improper descriptions of certain tests, they leave out things like that an animal was under anesthesia, and they play on the fact that people don't understand what they're seeing. They also use very old and outdated photos and videos before the current animal welfare guidelines, and they make a few bad people out there as the representative whole of researchers. There's bad people everywhere, unfortunately some make their way into labs just how they make their way into schools. <br>  A lot of people also forget, or are not told, how animal research actually affects animals. We are able to perform surgeries and cure cancer in our pets b/c of animal research.|`|tLO9DN2Waa	I'm definitely against it. I don't want to sound harsh but have you seen videos of animals being tested on? Or how about the conditions that they have to live in while they are in their lab? It's extremely cruel and hard to watch, but its eye opening.<br>  Yes, testing them for medicine has helped humans so much, and I'm so grateful for all of the technology that we have, but it really is terrible. And some of it is unnecessary- some places test on animals just for the sake of it, even when there are alternatives. And some testing, sure it helps humans but its vicious and inhumane There are some things I've heard: cutting kittens' heads open while their alive, sewing baby monkeys' eyes together (look up: Britches), cutting off tendons of dogs' legs to test for protein, slamming and operating on baboons' heads... it's terrible, and don't think it can be justified, understandable maybe, but not justified|`|8mWbEFCAaa	Even though it can help in making medicines, brutality toward animals is still brutality. You can't change it whatsoever. Think about it this way. If a man was about to die because he needs a new heart. Does that mean we can go outside and kill anyone we want just so we can get a new heart for him?<br>  <br>  Animals still deserve to have rights. What if WE were those animals who are being tested upon? How would we feel about that? Terrible, right?<br>  <br>  Humans are also animals, too. Just because we have more intelligence and abilities than other animals, that doesn't mean we can pick on the weaker species.
6ofwdeBHaa	Ok, I have always wondered the same thing.<br>  <br>  Here is what Wikipedia says.<br>  <br>  The name of Turkey, Türkiye in the Turkish language, can be divided into two words: Türk, which means "Strong" in Old Turkic and usually signifying the inhabitants of Turkey or a member of the Turkish or Turkic peoples,[10] a later form of "Tu–kin", a name given by the Chinese to the people living south of the Altay Mountains of Central Asia as early as 177 BCE;[11] and the abstract suffix –iye (derived from the Arabic suffix –iyya, but also associated with the Medieval Latin suffix –ia in Turchia, and the Medieval Greek suffix –?α in Τουρκ?α), which means "owner" or "related to". The first recorded use of the term "Türk" or "Türük" as an autonym is contained in the Orkhon inscriptions of the G?ktürks (Sky Turks) of Central Asia (c. 8th century CE). The English word "Turkey" is derived from the Medieval Latin "Turchia" (c. 1369).[11]<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|98XPkvSqaa	They call it Turkey because it's the place where the Turks settled.  It  has nothing to do with the bird turkey. The same name is just a coincidence.|`|6Tpa4MXSaa	"Turkey" is the English name for "Turkiye" which means "Stronger" in Turkish.<br>  <br>  In actuality, I think of it as similar to the way "Germany" is home to the Germans.

AA10067221	1.) Cultural Evolution:<br>  Culture, it would seem, is a catalyst, speeding the course of evolution toward an uncertain future.<br>  What’s more, not only does change on Earth continue, it has recently done so more rapidly than a lifeless Nature would have. Humankind itself has now become part of that change—altering it, selecting it, accelerating it. <br>  If any one factor has characterized the evolution of culture, it’s probably an increasing ability to extract energy from Nature—but not merely to capture energy, rather to store it, to transfer it, to use it more efficiently. Over the course of the past 10,000 years, humans have steadily mastered wheels, agriculture, metallurgy, machines, electricity, and nuclear power. Soon, solar power will emerge in its turn. Each of these cultural innovations has channeled greater amounts of energy into society.<br>  The ability to harness energy and thus order our daily lives are defining characteristics of modern society. But energy use is also a source of rising disorder in our surrounding environment—global pollution, waste heat, social tumult, among other societal ills. Ironically, the need for increased energy and natural resources so vital to our technological civilization is also a root cause of many of the sociopolitical problems now facing humankind at the dawn of the new millennium.<br>  <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/co..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/co...</a><br>  <br>  __2. -Cyber-bullying: (cyberbullying is defined as "willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.") Cyber-bullying has grown as a means of threatening, intimidating or harassing others over the past several years. It can take many forms, including posting private or embarrassing photos of someone, developing websites to rate people’s appearance, creating hateful blogs about someone, stealing electronic passwords, or spreading lies. This controversial issue explores the arguments of censorship, the freedom of speech, the definition of 'willful harm/harassment' and about whose responsibility it is, either the parents, teens, internet police, etc., to protect young on-line users from cyberbullying.<br>  <a href="http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php</a><br>  <br>  __3. -The Pursuit of Perfection: This controversy is regarding the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, beautiful, etc. In addition to the potential for individual harm, there is an absolutely certain cultural harm related to the mass pursuit and glorification of physical perfection. In her 1992 bestseller, The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf describes a $33 billion "thinness industry", a $20 billion "youth industry", and a $300 million "cosmetic surgery industry" and admonishes the commercial forces propelling women towards never ending external improvements. The marketing of plastic surgery to a younger and younger clientele only intensifies a conspiracy that requires women to be evaluated by homogenized perceptions of beauty instead of more integrated and realistic virtues. Why would any of us want to live in a world that requires all of us —from 14-year-olds to 50-year-olds — to have Britney Spears' breasts, Reese Whiterspoon's nose and a 4-year-olds' crease free forehead? All women are the losers in this game and we are already in the fifth inning if 20-somethings are scheduling Botox injections and teens are requesting painful surgical procedures as presents. <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma..." rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma...</a><br>  <br>  4.)---Feeling "left out in the cold," literally---<br>  A new study indicates that social isolation makes individuals feel physically cold and in need of hot foods and drinks. <br>  According to a study published in Psychological Science, getting the cold shoulder is more than just a metaphor. Feeling cold is part of the social rejection experience. <br>  The study found that individuals feel a considerable drop in room temperature when socially excluded; they literally experience being left out in the cold. Findings show that the choice of hot soup and coffee over warm or room-temperature foods and beverages in such conditions may be a coping mechanism for loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness not only induces anxiety and depression but also activates brain areas linked to the experience of physical pain. Psychologists concluded that the psychological world can bias an individual's sensation of the physical world, suggesting that emotional feelings are tied to physical sensations. <a href="http://current.com/items/89312310_feelin..." rel="nofollow">http://current.com/items/89312310_feelin...</a><br>  <br>  5.)---Gossip helps to glue society together' says study---<br>  Lots of gossip is good for society and helps people to trust each other and to be more charitable, according to a study recently published. Research has shown that reputation is the reason that (unlike so many other creatures) humans help strangers and unrelated people. Reputation is important for the evolution of human cooperation, through a process called "indirect reciprocity", summed up by 'I help you and somebody else helps me'. <br>  A team of researchers wanted to find out how much gossip can be relied on as a good guide to reputation and how much it can be abused to destroy a reputation. They found, in experimental games in which students could write comments about other people (a form of gossip) that the ability to tarnish others is diminished, the more gossip there is. Is gossip really good for us in the real world, or does it breed all kinds of problems and worries?

Don't listen to what other people say about the teacher and go in there and have your own experience.  The teachers goes by what the book says, so if you read the book, then you should be fine.

I say that because there are not too many labs that you do in AP Biology. AP Chemistry consists of Alto of labs so you will be working to solve problems and to learn. <br>  I also think that if you like the teacher for AP Chemistry you will be more willing to learn and will also be more interested in the content.

The combination of natural and synthetic hormones coupled with vigorous physical training is designed to stimulate cell growth and division which in turn increases muscle tissue, strength, and stamina. (Wikipedia entry here) <br>  <br>  The seeming benefit of rapid muscle growth quickly diminshes when compared with the drastic negative effects of steroid use. The exhaustive list includes: scars, acne, insatiable sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-sensitive areas, deepened voice, elongated vocal cords, increased appetite, remodeling of physical bone structure, increased production of  red blood cells, damaged liver, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping and Jaundice. A male's penis size can permenantly alter from growth or shrinkage while developing breasts, premature balding, and testicular pain. Females are prone to the development of male-like features (Santella reference here)<br>  <br>  Several variations of Anabolic steroids exist both orally (Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, methyltestosterone, Primobolin and Winstrol) (Santella reference here) and intravenously (Triamcinilone, Betamethapone and Prednisone). (Santella reference) Teenagers frequently acquire these steroids from dealers on their school campuses or over the internet while others are purchased over the counter from the local health food stores. Part of the attractiveness of the steroids is the ease of purchase <br>  <br>  Teens often site increased athletic ability when asked to justify the use of steroids as well as a desire to 'fit in' or 'be sexy.' (Santella reference) With the in-human body growth and increased physical capabilities, males are statistically more prone to abuse steroids than females. A shocking 14% of 12th grade athletes were caught using steroids and 13.3% in the 10th grade. (Santella reference here too)  In an effort not to disclose discriminating information upon purchase,  these steroids are referenced by several code names: Arnolds, Stackers, juice, gum, candy, pumpers and pops.<br>  <br>  It's not that great...and I can't believe I just typed all of that out

You'll be hearing a lot more in few days.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	gosh you just sit and wait they will get rid of the guy that is what they will do you can't lay a hand on student let alone a teacher.|`|ukI1ZMhXaa	Wow, <br>  You should probably wait it out. <br>  <br>  You don't want to leave your friends cause of one psycho teacher, right?|`|mWci5WUBaa	What I would do if just ignore him and if he trys to grab you again i would say go **** your self! lol|`|bifGJ4Veaa	the school will handle it, i'm sure.  tell your parents what happened.|`|VOSQpgb3aa	wait.<br>  don't just leave a school, its best to just wait and see what happens<br>  <br>  ..but it depends how long you've been there for and if you have many friends there.|`|1WQTxqUmaa	Um, pretty sure they are going to get fired.

lQIKWXDuaa	Ok. I know student who skipped two years of college course by taking colleges course when they were in High school. Then they completed college within one year. That is because they went to school for the summer, fall, spring and summer. So it is possible. It all depends on whether or not your college is strict or flexible. But it has been done before. Just make sure you complete the pre-med requirements which are: General Biology (I&II),General chemistry (I&II), Organic chemistry (I&II), General Physics (I&II), Calculus ( I & II), English Composition (I& II). TO make yourself competitive take Biochemistry, anatomy & physiology, Statistics. Also you will need to do well on the medical entrance exam known as the MCAT. You will also need clinical experience so volunteer at a hospital, red cross, etc... Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ss|`|gDxjINbQaa	OK.<br>  1. Pre-med is the BA you do before entering med school.<br>  2. No you can't. You can certainly get advanced standing and skip some courses, but the earliest possible I have ever heard of is a year of undergrad.|`|WCBSGuplaa	Pre-med is the term for the subjects you will need to take when you go on to college.You must take them along with other required college courses and any electives you want/need until you graduate college, It wouldn't hurt to take a business course while you're at it so you will have a degree in something when you finish college. You may need it to get some sort of work if you don't get accepted to medical school right away. After college pre-med the hard part begins.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	ummm... no.<br>  <br>  and the fact u asked this proves youre not smart enough.<br>  <br>  not to mention, i should take your name down, cuz any dick that wants to speed through medical school should not be allowed to practice.
1yGDFTieaa	Yep, you should go.  Since the interview is next week, you have time to pop to the library, borrow a child development book and read up on the basic, yet important facts and information.    With practitioner jobs, they don't bother interviewing you if they think you aren't capable of the job.|`|1J2OwIUgaa	I strongly believe in people being educated in this field!! If you can not answer these questions right off the top of your head this isnt the job for you. You are lucky they told you these questions, in my experience they ask questions like this without telling you. If you feel this is your calling to be a preschool teacher then go to school and get your education. The problem with people is that they think that anyone can get a job working with children when there are people like me that work their behinds off to get a bachelors degree to get a good paying job in the field. If it was an other job would you be donig the same thing, going to an interview for automotive machanic if you dont know how to work on a car. There is no differene, so... NO you shouldnt go to the interview.|`|R7mnEUOZaa	You still have sufficient time to research the answers, be up front at the interview and say you are inexperienced but have bags of enthusiasm.
1Qw7W7uQaa	you should write about the towns history and leisure facilities in your introduction.

RbdPDXQNaa	I agree that buying a prep book will be helpful, make some flash cards and practice...practice...practice.  I did this and it was good; however, when I took the test a lot of the vocab I learned was not on it.  Fortunately for me, I also studied latin roots (look online or common ones).  I was shocked how often they came up on the test.  Knowing the latin roots helped me more than anything!  Good Luck!|`|m7lHSV7waa	Buy a GRE prep book like from Princeton Review or Kaplan.  Both have sections for vocabulary prep and and have a section of words used on the gre and their definitions.  I found that learning how to take the vocab section and learning the words in the books greatly helped me when I took the gre.  I increased my vocab score by 50 points just learning new words.    Learning new words often takes a while to do and you have to keep at it.

LVPNuEsLaa	The equilibrium point is where D(x) = S(x).  This occurs at x=1, which indicates 100 units.      Both formulas provide a corresponding price (a "demand price" which people are willing to pay and a "supply price" which reflects production and distribution costs).  When you plug in x=1 into either equation you find out that the D(1) = S(1) = 9.  Since the unit is thousands, the price is $9000 at the equilibrium point.
i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  I don't know much about WW1 but In WW2 it was more than just the world against Nazi Germany.  The Nazi Germans had allies with extremists in  the greater Muslim world and raised SS troops. There were concentration camps, Jews were put to work building Trans-Sahara railroad, tortured and murdered. <br>  <br>  Besides the extremist Muslims and Nazi Germans, Japan allied with Nazi Germany and attacked America's Hawaiian Pearl Harbor in the Pacific. Italy allied with Nazi Germany and French Vichy gov't allied with the Nazis and after France was liberated they prosecuted the Vichy collaborators.<br>  <br>  The Nazi Germans and the Japanese were brutal, neither were going to surrender.  We had to ground and pound them into submission. There were alot of casualties, millions.  The West won that war against fascism and I hope we learned our lesson not to wait so long to respond to a threat  Western allies were many I will just list largest ones US, Britain, Russia and China. If you view the last link provided it shows how many casualties per country, civilian and military.<br>  <br>  While Hitler's troops were "checkmated" by allied forces and surrendered not everyone was captured and dealt with, and the extremist Muslims that allied with Hitler weren't even "checked."  Hence you see the hostilities still today we have neo-Nazis and Islamofascists running about.<br>  <br>  Germany and Japan are some of the West's most faithful allies now.  If you note, I make distinction between Germany and Nazi Germany, as the Germans have risen above that occasion.   Europe and the West is currently in great danger again, now  from Islamofascim, they are like Hitler fascists but with a "religious twist."

4c7QomPoaa	If you don't pay it, they will hound you and anyone else they can to get it.  Believe me, sadly I know only too well.  I fought them and fought them about the amount they "required" from me each month, since it was more than I was making at the time.  I offered to pay them less, and they refused.  I sent them paper after paper, even sending them an inch thick packet of information to verify that I was still going to school. It didn't matter a bit to them.  Eventually they garnished my wages and, all though they settled for far less than they "required", it comes out of my paycheck before I see it.  And to add to that, they take my fed return (which was over 1k last year) as well as the "stimulus" payment sent out later.

Purposes of the Examinations    Regents Examinations are achievement tests that are aligned with New York State's Learning Standards. Prepared by teacher examination committees and Department subject and testing specialists, Regents Examinations provide schools with a basis for evaluating the quality of instruction and learning that have taken place. They are used by school personnel to identify major learning goals, offering both teachers and students a guide to important understandings, skills, and concepts. The examinations also provide students, parents, counselors, administrators, college admissions officers, and employers with objective and easily understood achievement information for use in making sound educational and vocational decisions. Passing scores on the Regents Examinations in English, mathematics, science, and social studies satisfy the State testing requirements for a high school diploma.|`|gb9REJN4aa	I think you're fine.

hE5UmCcRaa	Pitching is being used in the same sense as lurching, rolling, or moving to and fro. Similar to how a ship might pitch. Obviously the keep of the castle is a solid building, therefore describing it as "pitching and restless" seems quite unusual. It might have a less literal meaning depending on the context of what comes before it or after it.|`|8078b060eeeeedad269ae982e11dfc38aa	Used as an intransitive verb pitching could mean   to encamp  to take up one's position; settle  to fall or plunge headlong  to incline downward; dip  to plunge forward; lurch, as when off balance    I believe the sentence is referring to the characters in the story rather than the castle keep.  Perhaps the characters are tied after a long battle or flight from danger and they are feeling weary or tired or even frightened.  Therefore they are feeling somewhat shaky and trembling - feeling ready to fall down perhaps.

I'm either going to be a business major or economics major. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|ceRqmrMLaa	Business administration is being in charge of a part of a business or a whole business.

AA11590905	I like it. It sounds biblical or taken from some ancient text or something.     My interpretation goes as follows:    Why do we start our meals with starters? Because they are small and satisfying. Gradually you move on to bigger dishes like main course and such and you start enjoying it more. Similarly, its small things in life which add up to make bigger things like happiness possible for us.  And if you get a job, you start from the bottom most step of the ladder and not from the middle of it.   Its the rule of gratuity. Things go step by step and only then they make sense.

If you don't want to take AP Physics, just take other AP science class. AP Physics will be helpful if your future major/career will have something do with it, but I don't think that not taking AP Physics will lower your chances in going to the universities you've mention. You can choose another AP class over it.

7uedTD6Iaa	In my school district we will skip students ahead grade levels, but it doesn't happen often and there is a process to follow.  The county sets up the guidelines, but it is the school's decision.  First, the child needs to be tested and must be performing at least 2 grade levels above their current grade in order to skip ahead.  This is because many students in 2nd grade are above level.  Ideally, the teacher should be differentiating her instruction.  Any students in the 2nd grade who are performing above grade level should be receiving advanced instruction.  This could be met by the material that is read, concepts that are taught, or how the 2nd grade material is extended to make it more rigorous.  Therefore, performing 1 grade level above is not enough to skip ahead, or else there would be so many kids in every grade who could skip.  Secondly, there is a whole packet of information to be filled out.  It is kind of like a questionnaire/checklist kind of thing.  The following factors need to be considered when skipping a grade (academic achievement, social development, physical development in relation to grade level peers, personality, etc.).  <br>  <br>  The fact that your daughter is the same age as 3rd graders is not enough reason for her to skip ahead.  It has to be proven that she is much more advanced than her current grade level, and that skipping a grade will be socially, emotionally, and academically appropriate for her.  <br>  <br>  Now, here's the good news.  I just did a quick search of your daughter's school district and they most certainly do accelerate students.  Here is a link to your district's bylaws and policies.  There is a whole section on grade level acceleration.  There are requirements that must be met and a procedure that must be followed.  My advice to you is to decide if this is what is best for your daughter.  If it is then print out these bylaws and bring them to a meeting with your daughter's principal.  Tell the principal you'd like to begin the process.  That should take care of anything!<br>  <br>  For some reason it won't let me copy and paste the direct link, but I found this page by going to your school district's home page <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sylvania.k12.oh.us/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sylvania.k12.oh.us/index.html</a><br>  <br>  Then clicking on <br>  <br>  >district information<br>  >district policies<br>  >district policies (again)<br>  >students<br>  >academic acceleration<br>  <br>  And there it is!|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I think that if they let you do this then they would be obligated to do this for any child who was not at the right age level. I would have just said that your child was in ______ grade when you enrolled. They would automatically assume they were in that grade. Also, I don't see what the big deal is. Even if your child is advanced, there are also advanced students in every grade level. My son did kindergarten 3 years because of where his birthday fell. When we moved to public school I could have said that he was in 2nd grade instead of 1st. He was very advanced and was often bored in 1st. But, in the long run, we didn't move him up because it would disrupt the linear fashion of the educational system. There are certain things that are taught at certain levels and the child would end up with holes in their education. We are happy with our decision.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	I don't know the particulars of your state/town. Make an appointment with the principal and/or the superintendant of the school that she'll be attending. Bring any evidence you have of her achievement, age, reports, portfolios etc. They will be wanting to make sure that she is reading at age level, (not grade level) and that she has been taught the maths concepts that she'll need to achieve at 4th grade before they move her. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ORonhAuvaa	You were probably talking with a secretary when you called student services.<br>  <br>  Try this instead. Call and ask to speak to the gifted program. Tell them that your child will be coming to school next year and that you would like her to be tested for gifted. This person will tell you abut your districts policies and procedures. <br>  <br>  In spite of the naysayers, gifted student education is part of the federal requirements for receiving federal funds. Though not a part of special ed, because the children receive extra funds, it is often administered by the special ed department.<br>  <br>  If your district has full time gifted services  at a particular a school (ask this when you call,) then it would be important to enroll your daughter there so if she is tested gifted, she doesn't have to change schools. If nothing else, she can be in a gifted second grade. They may see at that point that she would best be served in 3rd grade.<br>  <br>  Most schools would like to assess your daughter, so even if you run into a stonewall now, after enrolling her, they may become more accommodating once they see that she knows the work and is emotionally mature enough to skip a grade. Skipping a grade is a school level decision in the same way as holding children back.<br>  <br>  If people at the school district are rude to you, ask to speak to a supervisor or director. Don't let this put you off.  However, don't expect the school to skip her without ever having seen her perform. <br>  <br>  By the way, a teacher or a parent is allowed to request a screening for giftedness, to be followed by testing if she passes the screener. Don't take no for an answer, but do all of this once she is at the school.

xvxtQwV5aa	Being a lawyer is mostly paperwork, research, divorce court, criminal defenders, and most of the time every one already know's what's right and what's wrong, you just have to prove it. <br>  <br>  I'm a manager and am about to go back to school to get my associate's degree in business management to better my pay and be more qualified than my dumb boss. In management, there's a higher demand and more opportunities, in my opinion. Just think, every business needs a manager and you could be one of them. A degree gives you an opportunity to choose one you like. As far as being over people, if you don't want them to feel less than you, talk to them with respect. Don't treat them as a second class citizen. Treat them as the person they are but still maintain authority and be clear about what needs to be done.|`|5AWiQdWDaa	Business managers not necessarily have to act like assholes in order to be succesfull (maybe you′ve seen "The Office" too much). <br>  It seems you could be a good psychologist, since you seem to care for the feelings and emotions of others.

ORonhAuvaa	If you work in the early grades or special ed, try McCraken Spelling Through Phonics. It is one of the most effective ways to teach early spelling and reading at the same time. You can get the book on eBay or Half.com.|`|pgFD4n1Caa	I use the words their way curriculum. It comes with an asessment and places kids in developmentally appropriate levels where they are studying basically words with similar spelling patters - how to distinguish between the er/ar/or ending for example.<br>  <br>  Some teachers in my school pull from a standardized graded list plus words from that the kids have missed in their writing along with words from the current topic or theme. This proved too difficult for me.<br>  <br>  I've tried a bunch of different curriculums and really - words their way was the best.|`|iGxZvP3aaa	I've never taught spelling.  I've only observed my sons' assignments and my students' assignments, plus I'm full of opinions.  Hopefully thoughtful opinions.<br>  <br>  It seems to me coordinating spelling words with words they are encountering in their other reading is useful.  But probably very work intensive.<br>  <br>  Tying things in will holidays and seasonal words is very popular with my grade school-aged sons.<br>  <br>  I don't see in what way grouping word families would be helpful.  I could get all the spelling words but just putting the correct lead consonant in front of the common ending.  I work mainly with upper levels.  Maybe this is appropriate for younger grades.<br>  <br>  I am quite impressed with a high school level spelling test I've seen that includes frequently confused words.  So you must learn the difference between presence and presents and the like.

One for indoor in our own homes and the other mask for outdoor where we try to hide our grief.<br>  <br>  Life is about smiling and pretending that every thing's ok, holding back the tears. It doesn't have to be that way - crying is healing and we should never be so concerned for what others might think - you are entitled to your sadness. <br>  <br>  The message in your quotation is true - we often have to smile and pretend that everything is ok, to hold back the tears and put a different face on life.<br>  <br>  We do this because we have to return to work and our colleagues can't cope with our distress and ask questions that usually require a 'I'm fine' answer.|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	No. Because they're stupid.|`|HCzZClfvaa	Yes; I love quote like these.<br>  <br>  One is "I'm going to smile like nothings wrong.

You can think very well, it is easier for you to solve problems and in a correct and timely manner. <br>  <br>  What was the break down of your scores? Each are broken down into their own separate IQ score which gives you an idea as to where your weaknesses and strengths lie. If you scored above 140 in any area you are a "gifted" thinker in it. <br>  <br>  If you scored an overall IQ of 135 than there should be some sub scores that range from high-average to gifted, and by analysing this you'll gain a better understanding of how you think. <br>  <br>  You're smart.

tTg1XU8faa	1.) The graph is translated 3 units down.<br>  <br>  The two links say that the image has either been moved or deleted. But here are the basics: If the graph is translated sideways horizontally, then the x coordinate of the point is changed; if the graph goes to the right, then a value is added to the x coordinate, and if the graph goes to the left, then a value is subtracted from the x coordinate. If the graph is translated up and down vertically, then the y coordinate of the point is changed; if the graph goes up, then a value is added to the y coordinate, and if the graph goes down, then a value is subtracted from the y coordinate. So in conclusion:<br>  <br>  Horizontal move = x coordinate<br>  + = move to right<br>  - = move to left<br>  <br>  Vertical move = y coordinate<br>  + = move up<br>  - = move down

iNbU61GDaa	In order to study medicine it would be best to take Ap calculus, AP Bio and AP Chem. AP calculus is pretty challenging but it boosts your GPA if you do well and work hard.

XFxEfHYzaa	IQ's do not get higher as you get older. They stay the same. <br>  I don't think your score is particularly high, although from what I understand, IQ tests aren't always culturally appropriate and therefore are not an effective means of testing a multicultural population.<br>  <br>  So I wouldn't place too much importance on your score either way.|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	If you took the test meant for your age group, you'd be considered average.  IQ tests are rated so that 100 is the mean (or average) score, if you score within (I think) 10 points either way, you're normal.  btw, I think the minimum requirement for Mensa membership is 132.|`|3AVHxNNTaa	a true iq test should not show better results with age.|`|5b9WDmmNaa	Eight points lower, and you would be technically retarded. <br>  <br>  No offense.<br>  All though I'm sure none was taken.|`|UtDRpUoWaa	No <br>  90percent of the people have iq less than 100 or around it so you are normal <br>  For a genius it is around 140 and how many test you give you cannot improve your iq score unless you dont cheat i have 132 so im above average so i lie in world's 10 percent of people <br>  Hope this helps|`|PtoieF7Caa	100 is the average it means you correspond exactly with your chronological age.<br>  A lot of people score higher than that with scores usually ranging between 115-125 but there's no actual proof of that, it's just what i've observed.<br>  My score is 154 average, with a 2 point variation between tests but I scored only 80 on one test, the reason being because I took the test on a lack of sleep and during an illness.<br>  Unless you took an official test in the peak of condition your score cannot be fully reliable.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	It means that your score is average. 95% of the population's IQ falls between 85-115. So, if anyone is trying to make it seem like you have a low score you do not. IQ is based on the bell curve, which means that most people will have an IQ of 100 with a standard deviation, +/- 15, on either side. <br>  <br>  A score of 98 means you have no mental handicaps, and that with hard work you can work your way up in any profession. It just means that you may take a bit longer than some others to grasp concepts.<br>  <br>  Still, if you took the test from an online source than disregard the score. Online tests only test knowledge and not IQ. If you did take an online test go to your high school and ask them for contact numbers to set up a real IQ test.
QM7EVWrxaa	Well, the average for just about any age is 120, so no, that's a poor grade. But don't worry! that doesn't mean your dumb, you probably took it when you were tired or weren't thinking properly.

ooRa2vKpaa	One thing that changes with time is fashion, something that sometimes defines who we are, it is a type of technology that changes and gets better every time. Fashion in the 1950s was different and unique in its own way and was known for its style.|`|CsqMw9xtaa	1. Use spell check<br>  2. "An era is defined in history by a multitude of factors, but one thing people always remember them by are the people who made that time important and, of course, what those people were wearing (due to pictures, videos, paintings, etc). Personal fashion choice can say a lot about a person, so when an entire group of people from the 1950s wore similar clothes, it can be said that fashion says a lot about the era."<br>  <br>  You have to make fashion seem more important than just "clothes" :)<br>  Good luck. That's a fun topic to mess around with.<br>  <br>  Find similarities and differences between the clothing of the time period, and then you'll find similarities and differences between the wearers of the clothing as well.<br>  <br>  Also, if you can, try to explain how fashion in the 50s evolved from that of the 40s and then transitioned into that of the 60s. There are reasons for stuff like that, and it would be good information to make your claims.|`|dSIrXuUFaa	If your paper is going to have grammar equivalent to what I just read, you're going to get an F.

qBGMrzttaa	Becoming a Physician Assistant is a great career choice! In high school you should take all the science and math classes you'll need to get into a good university. You can definitely get an undergraduate degree in nursing if you want, it would be great preparation for P.A. school since you'll have clinical rotations where you will have a lot of patient contact, however, you might not meet all the prerequisites for P.A. if you only follow a nursing curriculum. Nurses usually don't take all of the sciences needed to get into P.A. school. A lot of people will get a biology degree, or something along those lines. You should also focus on getting some good patient contact experience by finding a job in a hospital or clinic once you are old enough. Volunteering is also required by many programs, and that is something you could even start doing now if you wanted! Most P.A. programs are now a Masters degree, the pay is good, and there are many jobs out there (and probably still will be in 10 years). <br>  Good Luck!!

ejj2N3uaaa	Is his performance during school hours satisfactory? If it's only his work at home (completing homework, studying for tests, etc.) that is keeping him from making the grades he needs, consider sitting down with him and setting up a schedule in the form of a contract. Set aside a certain amount of time (whatever is necessary) per night for him to devote to studying/reading/homework. If necessary, ask his teachers to send a daily homework assignment checklist home so that you know exactly what he is required to do each night and he can't "forget" to tell you. Discuss what is important to him, such as playing a sport or being in a certain group, and explain that in order to earn that privilege (either from the school, based on its rules for grades, or from you), he must stick to the schedule the two of you have set. If he's smart enough to do the work and just won't do it, this extra scaffolding could help him. Yes, it would be ideal that a 16 year old would keep up with his homework on his own and complete his work without his teachers and parents standing over him, but sometimes it happens the other way around (and it seems like boys tend to have this tendency more often...later in life, they catch up pretty quick). Hopefully, a few months of this will teach him the study habits he needs to be successful for the rest of his school career.<br>  <br>  If he struggles with the work itself (which could lead to not wanting to do the work, as it's too hard or confusing for him), a tutor may be appropriate. Find one that your son connects with and will work for. Consider ways to make his assignments more interesting. If he has to study something in history, see if you can go visit a museum or other site that involves that topic. If it's math, relate the problems to real life situations that are meaningful to him (such as sports).<br>  <br>  Last but not least, set your standards and your expectations. For many teenagers, even if they say they want good grades, they don't really want to put the work into getting them if they don't absolutely have to. Are there any consequences for his poor grades or bad work ethic? If not, he may just decide that sleeping/eating/playing video games/watching tv/whatever is a higher priority than studying or doing work at home. Make consequences--no fun stuff until school stuff is done, or no (insert privilege of choice here) until he shows that he can work hard. No, you don't want to punish him for not making As if he's truly having trouble with the work itself, but you do want to enforce the rule that he studies and tries hard--and if he doesn't, he pays the consequences. On that same line of thought, set up rewards for the desired grades--if he puts in X amount of hours of study per week, he gets to go to his restaurant of choice that weekend (or any other privilege the two of you agree on). Put the emphasis on the study habits and work ethic and not on the grade itself; you don't want him to feel like a failure just because he's not the top student--but you do want him to see the importance of trying his best.|`|AA11280073	Sign him up for one of the after school tutoring services such as Sylvan. They can get him on the right track.|`|tqMi1Iefaa	Give him a break - the poor kid, does he get any praise for anything? His self esteem is going down the tube.  Work, gently, with him to find what he loves - he will be good at it.  An academic education isn't all it's cracked up to be - and it doesn't suit everyone - it's just recycled ignorance to a lot of people.  Encourage your son in hobbies and sports and whatever else he shows an interest in. Try kung fu (or another martial art) for him, it is great for self confidence and discipline. Your stress is making you sick and not helping him either.  I know you want him to succeed, and success is being happy isn't it?  No one will ever be happy unless they are doing what makes them happy.  There is good living outside the school system.  Don't allow him to feel like a failure because the system hasn't shown him his strengths.  Help him find them. He needs you for this.  And every day, EVERY DAY, tell him he has done something well, thank him for something.  You will be amazed how he changes.|`|OHXDloIdaa	Electroshock therapy.<br>  I highly boubt he is that nice if he fails. He is on drugs. Search his room.<br>  <br>  Either way, I'm acing my AP classes, so I really don't care.|`|QO5p0kTXaa	Definitely get him a tutor. But people need to realize NOT everyone can be good at school just like  not everyone can dance. He has his strengths so why doesn't he be a gym/ P.E teacher or something he enjoys. What I think is that if you enjoy something you progress in it more. Just like he likes sports and is very good in it.<br>  <br>  So yeah just get him and tutor and see if he is making progress and also ask his teacher why he's failing because if he's failing for not doing homework that can be sorted out.|`|dPgc8p9saa	I think you should show him how important school is for him and that gives him unlimited options to do anything he wants to do in life....you shud make him watch the news and see the poeple suffering becuz of maybe a job loss due to the fact that they lacked college and high school diplomas....you just gotta keep nagging him about it Im sure he'll pull through thats what my parents did|`|UuxE3G8oaa	Talk to the teachers.  Is he doing well on the tests and not attempting the homework?  Perhaps they need to give him something that will actually challenge him so that he has to focus on it.|`|ptZdKKiBaa	Have you tried a tutor yet? That really helped my daughter. She needed help after her father and i got a divorce. Is there anything that could be bothering him in school? A bully or a girl that has his mind all messed up? I'm really sorry about your situation and i hope it gets better.

krIP1mrxaa	Yes, they are correct.  Well done.    best answer please! :)|`|yWoBYJVEaa	Yes on a).     No on b).  See below...    A semicolon ( ; ) is a conventional punctuation mark with several uses, mainly for pauses in sentences.     The uses of the semicolon in English include:    Between closely related independent clauses not conjoined with a co-ordinating conjunction: "I went to the swimming pool; I was told it was closed for a routine barnacle husking."   between independent clauses linked with a transitional phrase or a conjunctive adverb: "I like to eat cows; however, they don't like to be eaten by me."   between items in a series or listing containing internal punctuation, especially paranthetic commas, where the semicolons function as serial commas:   "Donald, who works in New Zealand; Harry, the son of the milkman; and George, a gaunt kind of man."   "There are several Waffle Houses in Atlanta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; Gainesville, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama."     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon      Use a semicolon [ ; ] to help sort out a monster list:  There were citizens from Bangor, Maine; Hartford, Connecticut; Boston, Massachusetts; and Newport, Rhode Island.  OR  We had four professors on our committee: Peter Wursthorn, Professor of Mathematics; Ronald Pepin, Professor of English; Cynthia Greenblatt, Professor of Education; and Nada Light, Professor of Nursing.     to separate closely related independent clauses:  My grandmother seldom goes to bed this early; she's afraid she'll miss out on something.   The semicolon allows the writer to imply a relationship between nicely balanced ideas without actually stating that relationship. (Instead of saying because my grandmother is afraid she'll miss out on something, we have implied the because. Thus the reader is involved in the development of an ideaa clever, subliminal way of engaging the reader's attention.)    It is rare, but certainly possible, that you will want a semicolon to separate two independent clauses even when those two independent clauses are connected by a coordinating conjunction. This is especially true when the independent clauses are complex or lengthy and when there are commas within those independent clauses. You might consider breaking those two independent clauses into separate sentences when this happens.    Coach Auriemma realized that his next recruiting class contained two superb guards, a fine post player, and a power forward; but as of the end of the spring recruiting season, he was still pushing to discover better first-year players for the interior positions.     http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/m...

The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) can arrange for a potential applicant to talk to a practising teacher, visit a school or attend a taster course in England.     Candidates for any form of teacher training in England and Wales must have GCSEs (A-C) in English and maths (or equivalent qualifications). To teach in a primary school or at Key Stage 2-3, candidates also require a GCSE (A-C) in a science subject. In England, candidates must pass tests in literacy, numeracy and ITC.    To obtain QTS, candidates may select from a number of routes:    Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree - offered by many universities and colleges throughout the UK. Courses generally take three or four years full time or four to six years part time. Entry requirements vary, but a minimum of two A levels or equivalent is normally required. Degrees with QTS status are also available in a variety of subjects.   Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) - offered by universities, colleges and schools throughout the UK and via distance learning. Courses last for one or two years full time or two years part time. The normal entry requirement is an undergraduate degree relevant to the subject the candidate intends to teach. Pre-training courses are available in some subjects for graduates who need to develop their subject knowledge. Eligible trainees on postgraduate courses may receive state-funded, tax-free bursaries worth 6,000-9,000.   School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) - offered by groups of neighbouring schools and colleges throughout England (but currently not in Wales), and designed to allow trainees to spend more of their training time in the classroom. Courses last for one year full time. Trainees are based at one school, but complete teaching placements at other schools in the group. Some courses also lead to a PGCE. The normal entry requirement is a degree in the subject the candidate intends to teach. If the candidate has a degree in another subject, it may be possible to take a pre-training course. Eligible trainees may receive state-funded bursaries.   Teach First - a two-year programme which allows graduates to spend two years working in challenging secondary schools in London and Manchester, qualifying as a teacher and completing leadership training and work experience with a range of employers. It leads to QTS, but trainees also develop the skills needed to enter a commercially orientated career. Entry requirements are a minimum of a 2.1 degree in any subject, providing at least 40 per cent of it relates to a National Curriculum subject; 300 UCAS points (equivalent to BBB at A level); and a Grade C or above in GCSE English and maths, or equivalent qualifications. Candidates must also demonstrate a high level of skill in leadership, teamwork, resilience, critical thinking, communication, initiative, creativity, respect, humility and empathy. Trainees receive a training salary.   The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) - involves on-the-job training, allowing graduates to qualify as a teacher while they work. Candidates must either respond to an advert for the GTP programme, apply direct to a GTP provider or find a job as an unqualified teacher in a school that will support them throughout the programme. Training takes from three months to one school year or longer and is tailored to the individual's needs. Trainees receive a salary of at least 14,040.   The Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) - aimed at non-graduates with at least two years' experience of higher education (for example, an HND, DipHE or the first two years of a degree course). Candidates must be working in a school as an unqualified teacher, and training (which takes at least one, but normally two years) is tailored to the individual's needs. The school works with a local higher education institution to ensure that trainees receive suitable training to extend their subject knowledge to degree level. Trainees receive a salary of at least 13,599.   Newly qualified teachers with a PGCE in maths and science may also be eligible for a 'golden hello' payment worth 5,000 (taxed) after successfully completing their induction period. Those with a PGCE in English, modern languages, drama, design and technology, ICT, music or religious education may receive 2,500 (taxed).

A language, especially French, is always useful too - but also complusory.    History is also very useful and suitable, as it develops your analytical skills and essay writing.     This may sound odd, but if your school offers GCSE Law, don't take it. Universities prefer you to have a clean slate, and do not like it if you have already studied several modules already.  Sociology GCSE may be a good choice, as you study people; what they do, why they do it, what causes this behaviour etc...very useful information for if you need to analyse a criminal's behaviour.     Overall, i think History and Sociology would be your best options, but you should definitely speak to your head of year or careers teacher etc... for professional advice :)   Hope this helped!

Ece5gwLkaa	Both sentences are wrong. It should be this.<br>  <br>  "Mariah Carey, another successful pop singer, is notable for her extraordinay voice."<br>  <br>  Notice how Carey is capitalized because it is her last name. All names are capitalized. Though, your punctuation is correct.<br>  <br>  No, "which is" is not necessary. The first sentence is not a complete. If you wanted to do the first sentence, then change your period at the end to a comma, and complete the sentence. <br>  <br>  Examples for Sentence 1: Mariah Carey, another successful pop singer, which is notable for her extraordinary voice, just won another award at the 2009 Grammy Awards.               ..... This was just an example of a complete sentence for the first one.<br>  <br>  The second sentence is not complete either; there is no verb or action.<br>  <br>  "How to better word this sentence", is not correct either. It's improper grammer. One way of saying it better could be "How should I word these sentences better?"   ...This is also another example.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, Mariah Carey isn't really a pop singer in my opinion. She's more into the R&B category. Haha, sorry but that's what I think.<br>  <br>  I think that your English overall is very good. Keep up the good work!|`|933XLRGCaa	Technically, neither sentence is correct as-is, but sentence 2 is correct as part of a sentence.<br>  <br>  To finish the sentence, you need a verb clause, like<br>  "Mariah carey, another successful pop singer, notable for her extraordinary voice, banked more than $4 million last year."|`|0b7hq71Faa	mariah carey, another successful pop singer, IS notable for her extraordinary voice.|`|zMM144lOaa	sentance two is more gramatically correct but it sounds like its unfinished, i dont know if theres more to it or anything but yeah
9erSLvYMaa	Completely depends on the student and the student's courseload. Some kids have three or four classes to meet the bare minimum for full time study, others take on overloads and have 6+ classes as a result. The average college student takes about 15 credit hours though which usually equates to about 5 classes (note that "hours" is a misnomer as you spend way more than just three hours in a three credit hour course during the semester). A lot of classes meet twice per week so a lot of students manage to create schedules that give them a three day weekend (they only go to class Monday through Thursday). However, some classes, mostly science courses, meet three times per week, and although it's rare I know of courses at my college that meet four times per week (though granted a lot of science courses also meet four times per week if you count the lab component). <br>  <br>  College courses are usually 1 hour and 15 minutes long per session if they're the ones that meet twice per week. Courses that meet 3x per week are usually 50 minutes long (so you end up spending the same amount of time in class per week, it's just split up more). Sometimes you will find a course that meets for only 50 minutes twice per week (these courses will usually be worth less credits than normal as well). And some courses can last a lot longer than that though in my experience the only ones that do that are labs (which usually meet for three hours in a single session though you also usually only go to them once per week).<br>  <br>  So all in all the average college student taking five classes will be in class for about 15 hours every week. It's very rare to find a class that meets on weekends although this does sometimes happen with courses that require outings or observations at a very specific time (astronomy for example). This number does not include SI sessions (student instruction) which are basically study/review sessions for a class that may or may not be required attendance (usually they're not but I've had one or two professors who required them). Those sessions can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours depending on what's being covered and how it's being covered (Q&A sessions vs. guided review vs. problem sets, etc). <br>  <br>  That number also fails to include the additional activities you may find yourself doing. For example, music majors are often required to visit a certain number of concerts or performances during a semester. And science majors who hope to attend grad school often find themselves working in labs (often with a minimum of 10 hours per week required, though there's no maximum when it comes to how much time you'll actually spend working in the lab each week).<br>  <br>  I myself am a neuroscience major and as a result I spend a lot of time on campus. To give you an idea of what my schedule is like:<br>  <br>  Monday, Tuesday, and Friday: Class from 10:40 AM to 12:35 AM. Then I head off to my lab to work on my research from 1:05 PM to whenever (I get done when I get done. Usually this means I get off at 5-7 pm).<br>  Tuesday: Class from 10:00 AM to 11:15 AM. Then get to my research lab by 11:45 AM and work until I'm done for the day (again, we're talking about 5-7 hours of work here).<br>  Thursday: Class from 10:00 AM to 11:15 AM. Get to research lab by 11:45 AM. Bust my *** to get a quick experiment in and some data collection before hauling *** back to main campus to get to my chemistry lab by 2:30 PM which in turn lasts until 5:30 PM. I'm not even officially scheduled to come into my research lab on Thursdays, but the nature of my current experiment requires me to come in every day.<br>  Saturday and Sunday: Go to research lab and work until I'm done. Yes, I work weekends too, and yes, it's the usual 5-7 hours here as well.<br>  <br>  Let me point out a few things about that schedule: 1) Because it takes me about 30 minutes to get from class to my lab I actually have no time to eat lunch (or do anything else for that matter) until I get off. And because I try to get in as much sleep as possible I also don't eat breakfast. The result is that my first meal of the day is sometime between 5 and 7 PM. 2) I'm working a full time job on top of being a full time student. I don't see a single dime for any of that work. My reward is something to impress grad schools with and four credit hours. 3) This doesn't even include the SI sessions I attend or the time that I have to devote to studying.<br>  <br>  I'm an extreme example though. Most kids don't spend nearly as much time on campus as I do, and if you don't plan on majoring in science then you'll probably get a nice three day weekend and ample amounts of free time on the weekdays.|`|sekPmSIqaa	You can build your schedule how ever you like. Personally on a longer day I'll be on campus for about 9 hours, but that's including a two hour brea. On shorter days I have like three hours of class. Some people don't have classes on Friday. some colleges ofer class on saturday, it all depends and it's very flexible.|`|5c6c2ed9e550cdae457d854eb7cac3fdaa	If you're full time if you get lucky you can go two times a week, but most of the time classes are spread out so its m-f usually 8am-5 , you study in between brakes|`|LLvrGJQsaa	that depends how many classes they have that day.<br>  you go to different classes on different days of the week.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	it depends on their schedule. full time is considered 12 credits which is anywhere from 3 to 6 classes.<br>  <br>  I am full time and I spend all day at school m-f but I have breaks in between my classes.

You can switch between levels at your convenience. Its really great.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	The first thing to do, obviously, is check your local laws. Providing you are complying with them, you can do whatever you like, whenever you like. You don't mention what sort of problems he has/is having, but the average person of his age only needs about 2 hours of school per day, maximum. It's hard to run a business if you are being interrupted all the time, so is he the type of lad who'll play independently after his school time is over? Do you and your hubby, between you, have time to take away from your business to school him? He's not going to be happy or very successful in his studies if you leave him a pile of work and disappear into the office, of course. I'm sure it's manageable, but the two of you might need to rearrange your usual routines to accommodate him.<br>  The next thing is to find some extra curricular activities to get him out and about, then pick some resources to use to teach him. The main subjects to worry about at this age are reading and maths. There are many phonics programs out there, so pick one! There are many maths programs too, but my favourite is Math on the Level, so check them out. It has nice, hands on, short lessons which are very suitable for little people with short attention spans :) It would also be a good time to start him with a language, if you don't know one, consider learning to sign. You can learn with him as you go along. Many homeschoolers start Latin at this age too, with School Song Latin or Minimus. You could also do science and should definitely do art. Everyone needs some mess, er, creativity in their lives!<br>  <a href="http://www.homeschoolreviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.homeschoolreviews.com</a> is a handy site; and if you choose a style to school him in (eg Waldorf, Classical, etc) then join an online group dedicated to that style for curriculum suggestions. Locating a local homeschool group will help too, for socialising and support.<br>  Good luck with it!|`|dx3jXzuxaa	The legal requirements differ depending on where you are. Each state has a different set of laws that you must comply with. The first thing to do is contact your state's (or city's) homeschool association. They should be able to point you in the right direction and hook you up with some other parents that can help you get started. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!
vv56NHwMaa	While your ideals are admirable, let's start with sentence #2 Maybe 'never tell a lie for personal gain'?  As in 'honey, do these jeans make my butt look big?', just say 'no' and go out and have fun. #3 and 4, pretty good.  #5 'We must reach deep within and act with sincerity at all times, we must consider the best interest of all involved, future judgment will be made by out maker.'  #6 Don't know what this means but you may want to look at 'many saved'.  #7 With total truth one is obnoxious and self centered, one must have the self discipline to tell the complete truth when it causes harm to no one. #8 Trust is earned not by telling the truth at all times but by being trustworthy and harming no one by doing so.  #9 Redundant.  #12 Truth is honesty with out causing harm.  Hope I got the sentence #'s right but I think you may get my drift.|`|2zAp4sgwaa	1st sentence: change "It is giving" to "It gives". nxt 3 sentences: leave the same.<br>  5th sentence: change "forces" to "compels"; insert comma after "situations".<br>  6th sentence: change to "It has saved many lives (omit comma) as well as destroyed some, but it is always the right choice."<br>  leave 7th sentence the same.<br>  8th sentence: omit the comma and change "or" to "and when".<br>  Omit 9th sentence, you have already said this.<br>  Last sentence: put quotation marks around "honesty".<br>  Also, I'm not sure you should call this a "small trait".

You could re-word a lot of it to make it more thought provoking perhaps...but it depends.

You may also want to ask questions about your disability so that you can make some decisions for your future.

zCOvQwQhaa	RN is a license from your state.  It requires passing an exam called the NCLEX-RN.<br>  <br>  In order to be allowed to take that exam you must have one of the following:<br>  <br>  *  An associates degree in nursing, 2 years<br>  *  A hospital school diploma in nursing, 3 years (these are mostly extinct)<br>  *  A bachelor's degree in nursing, 4 years<br>  *  A master's degree in nursing, 2 years after the bachelor's (most are already an RN before they enter the master's program)<br>  <br>  Any of the four will allow you take take the exam and if you pass you get the exact same RN license from your state.<br>  <br>  "Nurse" is a job title and not a license or degree.  There are a lot of different kinds of nurses and each different type requires different licenses, certifications, and experience.<br>  <br>  The more education and experience that you get, the more specialized you can become as a nurse (and probably earn more money).  The most specialized nurses (advanced practice nurses such as the Family Nurse Practitioner) have master's degrees in nursing.<br>  <br>  Some nurses that teach in colleges or conduct research have a doctorate in nursing.<br>  <br>  With just the 2-year associates degree and your RN license, you can expect to land a good entry level job as a general duty nurse in a hospital or SNF (nursing home).  With the 4-year degree and the same RN license, you can apply for jobs that supervise and manage those associate degree nurses or provide care in a specialty area.  Those opportunities increase as you gain more experience.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	You can do it in 2 years.  4 years gets you a BS in Nursing.
