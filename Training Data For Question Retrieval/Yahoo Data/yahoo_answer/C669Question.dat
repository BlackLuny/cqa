20090306113945AAPdpij	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can I ask my husband to leave me and my baby immediately?	My husband is horrible to me, I have been feeling miserable during the past 3 years, I can't take it anymore. Tonight, I want to ask him to leave immediately, I am thinking of putting all his stuff in a suitcase and when he comes back from work, just ask him to leave. Do you think legally I can do this?      Also I have a baby, if he says I am not leaving without the baby, or we leave together, can I call the police? as a mother in US, do I have the right to ask him to leave???      Please genuine advice, I feel like I am thinking about suicide, I can't have him anymore.
20090306114340AAniybj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I being unfair to my mother-in-law?	My elderly mother-in-law is staying at the mansion for a few weeks. Anyway, she has recently voiced her extreme displeasure that I have her woken by  a klaxon every morning at five thirty.   The klaxon produces a noise of 120Db, and is certainly more than enough to wake the old woman. Nevertheless, after the loss of several false teeth, she's now had enough.   Is this a step too far?

20090306160445AAgsYVQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would he look at me when he has a girlfriend? What can he be thinking?	There's a guy who I occasionally see due to mutual friends but don't know. Whenever we're at the same place, there would always be one time where he would just gaze at me, and once he turned around to see me passing by but then quickly turns back to his friends again(yes, im going thru details cos i want you to help me thru deciphering his body languag). The stupid thing is that he has a serious girlfriend, but i don't know if they're still together. He satyed with her awhile but most of the time he stood alone or with friends.    The last time i saw him he noticed me and i pretended i didnt see him, but when i looked at him he was gazing, and then i gazed back and when i was about to smile, his eyes turned down in focus to his conversation on the phone.    I was alone a couple of times, but i mostly saw him around with his friends. Anyway, he always notices me but never looks at me in close, but there's always that gaze. His face would seem blurry, wavering, and also sometimes in focus.   Of what can he be thinking?
20090306155428AAcpWFu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm afraid that either 1) I'm being paranoid, or 2) my friend is being stupid...?	So.  A little help here.   Basically what the title says, but here's some background information.      My friend met this guy online.  She's only 14 and he's 18.  Well, they're planning on meeting up at this place behind our high school trackfield. If you're standing in the right place, no one can see you.  And it's got easy access to the road.  I asked her why she just doesn't meet in a public place, and she said because she doesn't want her parents seeing her.      Well, being the nerdy person I am, I've read a lot of autobiographies and non-fiction books on the FBI, FBI agents, CIA, etc.  So just hearing that information set off little red flags in my head.  And, the guy she's meeting is bringing his 18 yr old friend with him.  That set off not just the red flags, but the sirens as well.  Naturally, I started to warn her--tell her everything I've learned, and how it would be a lot smarter to meet someone in a public place, or how it would be smartest not to meet them at all.  She kept on telling me how this guy told her that he would never hurt her, that he was writing a poem for her, and would someone really say that if all he wanted to do was to kidnap her.      Like I said, I had read all those books, so the red flags and sirens started to really go crazy in my head.  She said that I just watch TV and I'm paranoid, but I just wanted some input.        I don't know her number, or her parents' number, so I can't call them.      What do you think I should do...I considered telling a teacher, but I don't know.       Thanks,   Phoenix
20090306160752AASQdFV	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this normal for dads to be so terrible??????????????????????	Hi yahoo answers: I want to know whether most dads are like this and whether my dad is insane..   I'm 14 and my life stinks. i think that it all leads back to the fact that my dad is the most controlling person I know who has serious anger problems. My mom works late so I don't get to see her much and when I tell her of my problems w/my dad , shes always likee thats stupid or blows it off and says that he does a lot for me..i think whhat he does is out of obligation and not pure desire. I hate my dad. I kno it may seem terrible to say, but you DONT know my dad   1. HE gives me no privacy..he doesnt ever want me to close my door and he even installed a reverse peephole in my door (so that my mom&dad can see what im doin inside my room when they're standing outside the door) ..he only lets me close it when im changing and despite that, he just walks in whenever he wants!    2. I'm a good student , straight A student who works hard but of course, him being very biased says that early high school is sooo easy when its definitely not. i work on my HW late into the nite.   3. he can be so threatening and get angry VERY easily. i always have to help him cook and stand by him for an 40 mins everynite. its terrible cooking w/him!! he walks into me all the time..he pushes me aside roughly when im standing in front of something he needs. he never "'asks" me to do things..he demands them..and he doesnt say please often. today, when he told me to open a soup pot that was boiling, i took it off and it surprised me cuz it was very hot so i dropped it on the counter. no harm done, no mess, but he gritted his teeth and said "dont' be clumsy because i am tired and u r making me lose my temper. be on ur best behavior" and he often threatens me for the silliest things like using my laptop too much and says thigns like "do that again and i'll spank u".."do that again or i'm going to beat u" it scares me. when i was in elementary school, when i made accidnets or dropped things, he used to spank me on the butt to punish me. IT was a mistake!! WHY cant he understand that?? when does mistakes, its not like he reprimands himself. when i used his computer once and accidentally got a virus on his computer..( i was 12) he took a ruler and yelled for me to come down and he hit my arm really hard it stung really badly.   4. He swears constantly..always says the f-word..if i accidentally drop something on the floor or i bump into him..he'll be like "stop being so f***ing careless..mistakes and accidents dont happen on their own. ur being lazy!" he yells all the time when i make just lil tiny mistakes.   5. hes become like a dictator now..hhe took away my laptop from my room so i can only use it for certain periods of time in his office where hes constantly on his computer sitting next to me monitoring how long im doing things. he doesnt like me watching too many youtube videos..its not a big deal for a few hours!! for movies..he says i shouldnt like Tyra Banks or become too "american" and floozy! ihate that word!! im not an idiot or an airhead!!   5. he doesnt respect me..he doesnt listen often and when i bother telling him things about my day..hes like i dont need to listen to that nonsense. i think it leads a lot back to his insecurities i guess. cuz my mom is fairly successful at her job, my dad works part time at home as a website designer. not exactly MAJOR high paying job..so alotta the times he tells me how much he does at the house so we'll believe hes doing tons but whenever im in the kitchen washing dishes, hes right outside watching TV or reading the online news or watching badminton videos   7. he cuts my internet off every nite at 9:25..i need more time than that to do my hw!!!!!! i have to ask him to specially turn it back on if i really need it. BUT it is so annoying he thinks i use my computer too much but often times im doin hw and research      THERES SO MUCH MORE THAN THIS but i have to ask..do u guys have dads like this too???      HE EVEN CUT OFF MY 10 DOLLAR MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION for a year of Seventeen..seventeen means the world to me and shows how to empower teens. its like a lil escapeee whhen i read articles in there about life could b so much easier. it WAS my lil suprise every month getting 1 in the mail..

20090306160234AAQ2UQu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Nervous about a friend?	Our friend has been experiencing some drastic changes in her personality/appearance in a short amount of time.      We don't know how to confront her as we don't know what is going on and don't want her to react.      These are her symptoms, and we were wondering if someone could let us know what is going on with her:      - rapid weight loss   - paleness of skin   - sudden interest in sexual activities (and no we don't mean affects of puberty)   - showing excessive amounts of cleavage (before she would wear tshirts all the time)   - interest in things she said she would never do before   - excessive showering   - easily agrivated when questioned      There are a few more, but we're hoping this can draw a conclusion.   Thanks :)      She has a boyfriend right now and it seems to me that all of this has been going on since she started dating him.   When they first started dating he called her fat. I'm convinced that he is the problem but no one else believes me.

20090306152848AA9KnkN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to fix my relationship with my bffb?	My best friend with benefits and I have been together for 14 months. We're seniors in high school and we've had our happy times and we've had our issues, all of which we have resolved. We are for sure in love with each other. Recently, she has been stressing out with school and PMSing for the past 2 weeks and I think I might failed to be there for her. I've had a really hard time to talk her because of the stress she's been feeling and our communication has been lacking. We talk much less now and she has explained that I need to show more commitment and talk to her more. She says that we need to stop touching each other (hugging, kissing, holding hands) completely and talk more like "normal people" and better our communication. I don't want to lose her so I agreed calmly and trying my best to avoid touching her and talking to her more. Any other tips on how I should better the situation would be appreciated. Serious answers only please.

20090306155949AADFK5G	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does this mean to you guys?	I'm not very confident in myself in the first place.   But today i tried tsomething out with my eyeliner, that made my eyes lookdifferent in a good way.   Then, later on at lunch, my friend told me," You look pretty/Your eyes look pretty".      And i'm not sure what that means.   What does it mean to you guys?      I know i should take it as a compliment, but It's kind of bringing me down, since it seems like they were calling me ugly.

20090306160429AA51ePs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Threats By Ex freind?	Ok There Is This Friend Who I used to be friends with and he knows a few things about me. for example i have said bad things about other people in diffent countrys.and my personal mental state, and when i do anything to offend him he will always use these against me saying i will tell everyone.       Firstly how do i make it so that he cant use anything against me again, i no longer share any opinions around him. or realy talk to him       and he is the one who always gets me in bad moods and has bad things to say.
20090306160456AACPsFV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am adding this to my previous entry to clarify?	I have to admit that I was accusing him of cheating which he wasn't/isn't and was smothering him. I was just so used to him being there for me for so many years that when I would call and he wouldn't answer or hang up on me in the middle of a conversation I became angry and then hurt. He took off his wedding ring long before he left and started to ignore me. All of these things led to a huge confrontation one night with me being the instigator-he left that night and hasn't been back. He is not seeing or talking to his kids like he should and is being terribly mean to me. He is staying at his dad's and says he has no plans to file for divorce or to get his own place and won't answer any questions. I am confused

20090306162919AA7H3W5	Family & Relationships;Friends	A love triangle with my best friend.... please help if you can.?	Okay so Im a Junior in HS, and I have a freshman friend... he and I are really good friends we hang out a lot and I wouldnt ever want to do anything to hurt him.      Well his girlfriend is very beautiful and sweet and she and I became Biology partners. At first it was nothing but me thinking she was kinda cute but then something happend and she and I are really close. She makes lots of excuses to be near me and calls me a lot.      However the thing is that he doesnt really treat her like she exists. I mean he cares about her but when she wants to be with him he leaves to go play video games with other friends and I can see it in her eyes that she gets really upset. So she always comes to hang out with me because well im not that busy more then half the time.      The thing is I have fallen in love with her and I know she feels something too, and she always is just depressed because he is only with her to have a girlfriend you know? But then again he is my friend and I cant really be a dick to him      I guess should I but back my feelings, and ignore her so she feels even more lonely? What do I do

I would like to make most of my senior year, at least the time that i have left in school. I would like to build a friendship with a particular girl in my school who isnt in my grade. But meeting new people scares me, especially when approaching a girl who is always with her girl friends. I'm Asian (Korean), smart, with good grades and aspirations, but in terms of being more social, making new friend seems like a daunting task. I mean, I get along with all my classmates, even the girl who are pretty and hot. But I can't seem to approach this girl that I would like to have a friendship with.

20090306161735AAm0hbI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why did my best friend suddenly hate me...Ignore me etc.?	I don't mean like being mean about me to other people, just like she hasn't talked to me for like over a year and a half. I didn't do anything at all wrong. We were like really close, always texting, helping her to get with her crush who also liked her. Doing all i could to be nice and like a real friend; then out of nowhere, she stopped talking to me shortly after the very short relationship with him. She can't have been using me if she only started liking him after a year and a bit of us being friends.    It's really odd. If anyone asks her she won't say why or make up some weird reason, like because im (my name). But that dosen't add up if i was myself before that too!      If you think this is petty than sorry but i just think its really weird to be best friends and then just being completelt phased out because of absolutely nothing. Just being ignored out of nowhere and i'm not exaggerating.

20090306162017AAf7YG8	Family & Relationships;Friends	This is BAD! Please help! Idk what to do!?	My friend and I, are really close, and I couldn't even imagine losing her, but lately she hasn't been acting like a friend. Since last year she has been pushing me around, telling lies and secerets, telling MY secerets, ignoring me, and just not acting like a friend. She always ignores my texts, Myspace messages, and cuts my phone call short. This year she met one of her 'long lost friends', and favoriting her. Every morning my friend runs up to her, and gives her a big hug. She looks like she is lost without her. I have been getting so mad at her I do the same thing she does to me, I let people talk crap about her, and I sumtimes do it too. She always talks about me behind my back, or summtimes even to my face. We have been best friends for countless years, and we are super close. I am like her sister, most of the time. Her family is like mine, I treat her mom like she is mine, I do chores over there, her mom buys me stuff, her little sister and I fight, I mess around with her dad. My mom and her mom are best friends, her dad and my dad are best friends. I know her grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, all her family. Her grandma called me like family. I go to 'family parties', and we are just so close. I don't want to lose her considering all the fun we have had together, but I can't stand how mean she is. I've tried to tell her that she is mean to me, and that I don't want to be her friend, blah blah blah, then we make up, and she is nice for a while, and then back to the same old her. I really need help on this! Please tell me what I should do!

And who is this girl whose eyes shine so deep into my soul and that I can understand and know so well without a single word spoken?   I have never met her and yet I feel so empty without her.   If only dreams came true...

20090306161133AA8cW2T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sexsexsex welcome to 2009. inputs, please?	Ok. I have had sex before. & I actually have a baby. but thats beside the point. I don't plan on having sex again until i'm married. It's something i'm starting to believe strongly in. I started to wear a purity ring. I know it's a little late and i can never become a virgin again, but i don't care. I'm gonna wear it regaurdless. Because even when i get a new boyfriend or something, he'll know where the boundaries are. I'm just wondering what you guys think. If it was you, would you not wear it because you're obviously not "pure". I think i'm making a good choice, because i don't want sex to be at the base of any of my future relationships.      Please give some feedback. It's greatly appriciated.<3

She wants to get married someday, but he doesn't. I know he would be happier without her. He doesn't want to break her heart by breaking up with her.

20090306164224AATvCe1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need your knowledge of the law and relationship so please read?	I am 32 years and somehow ended dating and gotten pregnant for a 49 year old man. I recently started figuring out that he is hiding something. He works off the book for years. Was living with his daughter's mother for years until they broke up a year ago. He pretty much does not even have a place to stay. I am 32 a registered nurse and I am finishing my Masters in nursing this semester. He told me that he drove without a license 25 years ago and then 1 year ago he did it again with a minor in the front of the seat and almost ran over an ambulance and the office gave him a summon to appear in court, which he never did. He told me that he would be trying to get a license when we first met now he tells me that he can't because he fears that he would be placed in jail. Why would a 49 year old man work off the book and have no bank account, have a prepaid cell phone. Please let me I want to hear your opinions also please tell me if it is a felony to drive without a license.
20090306164208AAV9dsF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me or feel bad for me?	alright i like this girl 1 year older than me and we talked only a little (5 months ago, last friday, tuesday-today) and the method of talking to her is going to her locker when shes there and talking alone cause when shes with a friend she acts somewhat unkinder (not making eye contact, possibly walking faster but im not sure about this one she might just walk fast generaly) but when shes alone she smiles, laughs, eye contact. so i asked my friends about this (all of the above) and they said that either she is interested or feeling bad for me or not interested but being nice. also when i talk to her alone she is somewhat nervous and smiles alot (already mentioned). also i told my friend to watch my conversation and he said that she is feeling slightly uncomfortable when im at her locker. he recommened talking to her in class (we have a same class) and then talk to her locker again later. so is she interested or not?
20090306165136AAHksK2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell this GIRL that I wanna “CHILL” without seeming too desperate?	I have known a girl in University for a few months. We are both studying master’s degrees. We exchanged email and phone contact information. She would usually invite me over to her place for coffee. We would talk, chill, and watch a movie for a few hours. Oneday, she seemed in need of emotional support. She invited me in her bed. We started kissing, holding hands, and cuddling. However, we had no sex. Anyways, we still hung out together. She told me that she was divorced and has a child from a previous marriage. I still enjoy her company. The past month was quite busy due to end of term assignments. I called her last week when I was done my assignments. She sounded happy to talk to me. She definitely said that she wanted to meet and properly catch up. She said she would call. She said that she has been doing research in the library for a main research paper. Then she went home for a few days. I literally talked with her last week. Should I wait for her to call me or should I just give a casual call next week? I was thinking of giving her a casual call to see how things are going and if she’s in a mood to chill?

20090306163514AAt820Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really would like some advice because I have no idea what to do=/?	Well, there was a dance at my school, and I started to flirt with one of my friend's dates. She(lets just call her Sara) told me before the dance she really didn't like him like that so I believed her. We danced and flirted. The another friend of the guy (lets just say her name is Joy) gave him my screen name and number. And Joy told me that Sara didn't like this guy and said that i should go for him. We have talked about 5 times in the last 2 weeks.Nothing big.   A few days after the dance, everyone found out that he hooked up with this other girl (lets just name her Miley) at the dance. Everyone was mad at her but truthfully i really wasn't because i had heard that they had been talking before that dance. Sara got all upset at Miley, but that is done and over with.   So I didn't want everyone to find out that a month later i was talking to this guy, so i went up to Sara and told her. She seemed totally fine. I am guessing that she told Joy, because Joy talked to my best friend, and my best friend told me that everyone would be mad at me for talking to him. So I haven't talked to the boy since, but I am tempted to because i heard he is a sweet guy from a bunch of people. I know he is causing way too many problems but I don't know what i should do   help!=/

He's a classmate of mine who's nice to me and jokes around with me (nothing mean) and kept saying that he would embarrass me during my speech by asking me difficult questions at the end of my speech that I wouldn't know the answer to. (He knows I hate speaking and get really nervous.) But when I gave my speech, he did none of that but listened attentively, was super polite, and even helped helped me out a bit. He was also the first to applaud. So what was with the teasing before and acting nice during my speach all about?       1,)Would a guy only do this if he liked a girl?      Also, he only teases me and jokes around with me when atleast one other person is around.When he talks to me when he's by himself, he is quieter, still really nice and polite, may ask me a few questions, but doesn't joke around. It's a bit more akward.      2.) What's up with his behavior towards me?

20090306165651AATp6jU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a boyfriend that I have been going out with for a week and I need advice?	I have an amazing boyfriend who is nice, polite, sweet, thoughtful, etc. only he's really nervous.  We have been friends for a while now (We're 15 and 14) and know each other well.  I'm his first girlfriend and so he doesn't know how to act romantically.  I can tell he really does like me and all my friends who are friends with him say so, so I know it's not because he doesn't like me.  So far, I've made all the movies (ex: Held hands, flirted, complimented his looks and personality, put my head on his shoulder, hugged, etc).  I also drew him a picture of me and him together and we took picture together with my camera.  He said he loved holding hands and other things, but he never started it.  He followed through and didn't resist, but he never starts things. It's been a couple weeks since we go out, so my question is "How do I get it so he's more romantic and comfortable with me.  Also, how far should I go with him (meaning kissing or cuddling or whatever) ?"  Does it just take time?  Also, what are some romantic or fun activities/places we could go to or do?        Thanks for listening!

20090306164900AAhJ4Xw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it true that a girl can't invite a boy to their house?	I have a guyfriend and he is my one of my bestest friends ever! I thought one day "If I invite all my friends that are girls, why not boys?" So, I invited him over to my house. He said it was a great idea and that he would love to! Then, the next day, my other friend asked what I was doing this weekend, I told her. But at lunch she blurted it out! I wouldn't have cared that much but then all my other friends started saying "What are you gonna do there?!" "So you want to make-out with him huh?" "I bet their going to topple eachother!" I was really embaressed and mad! He wasn't there though he had a project or something. So my question is this:   Is it wrong to ask a guyfriend to you house as a friend?
20090306164620AArl9qn	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do when my friends don't do anything?!?	I have a nice small group of friends.  But lately, they're starting to get really lazy.  The past few weekends or so, I haven't done anything because no one got together.  I'm working on making new friends at my college, but I haven't really gotten to the point where I could hang out with them outside of school.  Is there anything I can go or do by myself on the weekends, w/o my friends needing to be there?
20090306163248AATqWkO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, what's wrong with me?	I am going to describe myself as good as I can. I would like to know honestly why I can't get girls to even consider me.      Personally, I'm very outgoing. I'm not shy, and when I see someone who needs a hand, I give it to them. I try to make friends with everyone, and don't judge. I'm very upbeat, and am always finding ways of making people smile, through jokes, random facial expressions, or just compliments. In reality, I'm quite humble, compassionate, and, even though I'd probably deny it if asked, I'm really quite intelligent, and I'm a good singer.   When it comes to being with girls, I try to be very polite. Not a fake polite, but a sincere kindness. I'm willing to put out time and effort for them, and I'm always upbeat and happy. I smile, I'm confident with them, and make sure they're comfortable. I try to be as friendly as I can. I can also make them laugh and smile, and show genuine interest in their daily lives and the things they're doing. I'm not judgmental, I'm honest with their questions, and I try to be there for them whenever they need it. I introduce them to people they might like, and I treat them all equally.   When it comes to being a little more serious, I remind them often how 'lucky I am to have them', how 'great it is to be with them', how I 'think of them', and, on the rare argument occasion, I think of great, romantic ways to get them back into the mood of things. Basically, I try to be the "Prince Charming" who "sweeps them off their feet", whatever that's supposed to mean to them. I try to be with them, make friends with their friends, and I never act like any girl is above them. They are the most important aspect of my life, and that's just being honest.      Now, to the negatives of me.      I act gay. I'm not, but when it comes to my best friends, I get very inappropriate. Despite that, I'm also rather perverted. I can be slightly moody sometimes, and I have a tenancy of hanging out with 'band nerds', even though I really could fit in with other groups.   I spend a lot of time by myself outside of social situations (school, meetings etc), and I spend a very large amount of time practicing musical instruments, leaving little time for social life. I'm not really the best looking person in the world, I'm very average.      Even with all these things stacked, you'd think I could at least get a single relationship. I've been trying for quite some time, and I'm starting to lose hope.   What's wrong with me?

20090306164627AAIPA0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will she have sex with me this evening?	this woman was with me once before and she started kissing and making out with me after we were in a safe area out of public eyes because she is married with 2 kids and not satisfied with her marriage. She is weird in ways. when she did that the next day she said we should forget about what happened. Now 2 months after she wants me to meet her . We have met and talked in between because we study sometimes together. She wants to become a Doctor and studies for that. when she called me yesterday she said if it is possible for me not to wear colognes. She said that will be safe for her so her husband would not smell the perfume on her. Is this a hint for sex. we have been trying to do this and she has not been available. Also I told her yesterday that if I should book a room and she said whatever you want. what do you say? please no lecture on morals and a woman who is married should not do this. Her husband has a Phd and 10 years older than her, she is 2 years older than me.
20090306164704AAU8b3z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell a guy likes you.?	So i have this friend. She is 11. She really likes this guy but she doesn't know if he likes her back! She think he does because he is giving these signs!Example: Mean in a playful way, tries to impress her,stares at her when she is not looking, talks not a lot but enough to think he likes her, helps her/explains something when she doesn't get it. So are those good or bad signs??? She is really really really really really likes him. She is crazy for him. She cant stop talking/thinking about him.She is really scared to tell him. What should she do. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP. She is really desperate.Oh and she put on makeup (really unnoticeable) and he totally noticed it!

20090306164736AApn8aW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WOMEN are more shallow than men!!!!?	Just some observations here: Men are shallow in the sense they want a nice looking woman. But at least that's a value of the other person HERSELF. Women, on the other hand are WAY more shallow than men. Here's why: Most attractive women know they are attractive, and they seek MONEY. Money...an inatimate object.       Is this just a western society thing? I hear women in Europe are NOTHING like women here in America. That they actually (GASP!) care more about what the PERSON is like instead of their bank account. I hate to sound harsh, but it seems most women in the U.S. are nothing more than money hungry, glorified hookers looking for a rich man so they don't have to work. I wonder if outside of America, things are different?       Another reason women are worse: Men DON'T LIE and honestly say "Yeh, it's true, I want a nice looking girl." Women LIE and say "Oh I just want a "nice guy"...yeh, right. Oh, and if you don't have money BEATING your women also works. Nice, huh? For us normal guys out there (aka "boring" guys to soap opera watching women). Anyway, this is just my rant.      P.S. don't even bother telling me "Stop generalizing" because that is the LAMEST argument ever. NEWSFLASH: How do you think "generalizations" come about to begin with? Through thin air?

Now that I have school off for the weekend and it's Friday I called him at like 6:00 cuz I had things to do b4 that and he gives me a response saying "I can't hang now, maybe sunday" then I text back why not just tomorrow then.  he then says tomorrow morning I have a hockey tournament but maybe after wards, which it seemed hesitant.  WTF he's home from boarding school so there is no hockey tournament and he is on break and there is no spring hockey I checked so it's a lame excuse.   Do u think he doesn't want to hang out with me anymore.  I mean we were great friends last year and hung out a lot this past summer.

20090306172013AAWeMqG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does two girls making out...make me "hot"....and why does it make me feel so guilty?	Why is two girls making out "hot"? Is it because it is "forbidden" in a sense?   On TV there was a show, Being Erica? Hey, I was feeling sick/too lazy to change/jet lagged?   Not a great excuse for watching a "chick show", I know.   Anyway, there were two girls making out and it make me forget I was sick....it made me so insanely "hot".   I know I'll sound like a narcissist regardless but...I'm not a "pig"; I make eye contact, not eye-breast contact; I don't think of/treat women like objects, etc....Yet, I feel so guilty for watching that...   For religious reasons, I'm not meant to agree with homosexuality...yet, I don't understand why..   Personally, I don't care if you like women or men...      Do you think because it, women kissing other women, is, in a way, "forbidden" we tend to want to see it more?         Brayden, 16, London.         P.S. I live in the western, democratic world of Western Europe and North America (travel back and forth, school). There are no laws against women kissing each other but there is definitely a stigma, if you will, around it, socially

20090306173723AAg6F0h	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend is being really blahhhhhhhhh!!!! i dont like it :(?	so i have or had? a best friend who was really awesome, he was one of the bestest friends i could of asked for he really showed he cared and would always make me feel better. he actually doesnt know this but he is the reason i am no longer depressed, he would make me eat and stop cutting and all that stuff. he would actually make me feel good about myself and made me pretty confident in myself.    that was last spring around the begining of summer. we hanged out all the time and did everything together and go everywhere together.       now he is really different, he always puts me down and he doesnt even relize or care. he doesnt care if im sad or anything. he ignored me for 1 week and when i asked him why he said "becuase i felt like it". he doesnt talk to me, call me, come to my house anymore. he acts like such a little ******. it was my birthday and he didnt even say happy birthday, and i sat next to him on the bus. he doesnt even look at me.    it all started when he got a girlfriend, who he didnt even like he just went out with her becuase she asked him out and started crying when she got rejected. and his girlfriend didnt even like me.       so here i am wanting to cut again and not knowing what to do, i have no one. my other best friend, she moved to arizona and i feel like i should just go jump off a cliff.       i just want my friend back
20090306181540AAkTsnV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being too shallow about guy's body types?	I was "spoiled" with the last couple guys I was in relationships with. They had awesome, hard bodies and totally turned me on. It's been awhile since those relationships and now that I'm getting back into the dating game I guess, I feel like I shouldn't just turn down a great guy because he doesn't have an awesome body, but I'm only really turned on by a fit guy - doesn't have to be a muscleman, but toned and good to look at.      I'm sort of seeing this guy right now, but I cringe every time I see his gut. He's hilarious and a nice guy, cute overall, but I fear that physical attraction to someone always overtakes my other feelings, even though I'm huge on a good personality. I probably sound ridiculous, but I really dig someone who can make me "sweat."       Anyone else feel like this? Or am I just horribly shallow?       Ps, I'm 21. I am really fit, so that's part of why I look for that in a guy too.

20090306175802AAxTXJm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think we should break up?	I'm finishing out my last year at college in the next 2 months, I've decided to return in the fall for a higher degree, but in another city, about 2 hours away. I've been seeing this guy since last april, my first serious boyfriend/not boyfriend, cause we never really even discussed that. he won't be graduating until a few months after me, he mentioned once moving in together but hasn't since. I feel like things are fizzing down between us, when we're together things are GREAT, but... I just feel like when we are apart, we hardly talk. We have talked EVERY single night since we met, but lately it's not the same, we talk but I feel like I'm bothering him so I just make up an excuse to go. Should I end things, or just let them...keep going. I really don't want to break up, I feel like I love him, I miss how we used to be, I know it's different since we've been together so long but... I don't know...maybe this is just normal? I'm 20 and he's 23
20090306173305AAQKIvy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I thinking too much?	The guy I like is kinda sending me mixed signals. Like for example, today in the he kept looking at me. Then I would look at him. We did this like two times and the last time I looked at him, the just put his head down for a while. Then he got up and looked at me again, but I didn't look back. Then when I was walking to class I turned around and he was staring at me (I'm pretty sure it was me because no one else was around) and when I looked at him he looked away. Then I turned around again and he was looking at me again.   Am I thinking too much. Sometimes it seems like he might be interested, but other times he avoids me.
20090306171947AAxgc2v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	BOY PROBLEMS! Does he like me?	There's this guy class in my science class who I really like, and I would consider him a flirt. He hasn't been flirting as much as he used to but he still flirts with the girl next to him, as well as me (Of course he flirts with the other girl more) Anyway, he would always poke my sides, squeeze my arm/leg, and try to talk to me when he thinks I'm not paying attention to him. Sometimes when he's on the other side of the room, I catch him looking towards me. (My friends say he looks AT me but that's just hard to believe) Well two weeks ago, my friend from elementary school hooked him up with this one girl and they started going out. I was crushed but did my best to try and hide it from him. Today he told me that he broke up with her, but it's not that that surprised me, it's how he told me. I was making fun of him and he answered by saying, " You're just made at me because I broke up with XXXXXX." I have no idea why he would phrase it like that or why he would bother to tell me. So now I'm wondering, does he like me, or are my feelings preventing me from understanding logic?
20090306182852AAkP6zB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help, with i have no idea what?	Me and my group of friends always hang out together, go out together and go to parties together. I think I am starting to have some feelings for one of the guys in my group of friends. We have never hung out one-on-one, other people are always around. Some how whenever we go to a party, i always end up talking to him for quite sometime towards the end. Or if we go out, we dance. He rarely initiates conversation, it's usually myself. But once I'm there, he doesn't push me away.       i like him, but he is one of my good friends and i don't want to ruin that. i know i can be brave and let him know, its just a matter of getting one-on-one time with him. how do i do this?      we aren't best friends, but we are friends and just generally hang out with the same people. would it be weird if i called him now? or like just what should i do?

But wasnt sure if she was really intrested. Ended up asking for her number, and she said give me youre number instead and i'll text you.      Did give her my number. Just wondering if thats a sign shes not really intrested. Will i hear from her? Surely it would be best for me to call her instead.      She did however question if i was really intrested when i asked for her number again instead. So maybe she thinks im not gonna call her. Seens alot of guys dont get back to girls.      What do u think, Is she trying to get rid of me really. Or is she bit worried i wont call her?       Shes not exactly best looking girl in world, and does seem really nice so dont think she'd mess people around.

Like I'm invisible. When I say "Hey" she always turns to see who it is then turns back like she never saw me. I really don't like her that much anymore becuase she's one of the people that change themselves completely to become popular. She kind of is popular but the friends she became firends with, she doesn't like them. She just wants to be popular. she's dropped almost all of her old friends and replaced them with people she doesn't even like. She starts copying other people and is like a poser really. she dyed her hair a lighter shade of blond, she decided to wear skinny jeans now, she wears converse now, she's just different! I don't know what to do. I want to be friends with her but she just doesn't like me. It's like once she was "popular" she stopped being so nice. What do i do?

20090306174600AALHceK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes mee?	I'm just trying to get opinions.       Okay, so there is this guy in my industrial tech class. He's my partner for my module. At the start of class, when my teacher tells us what to do (we have to sit down), he has sat next to me for five days straight. When I look around or at him, he's usually looking at me. For our mod, we have to be in a completely enclosed room for fourty five minutes each school day, and he kind of flirts with me.. or so I think it is. Like.. I'm really quiet, and nervous around him, yet he still talks and is extremely polite about everything. We don't talk much out of that class, though.       Okay, so I know this question was rather vague, but there are just little signs that he kind of might like me. We have tons in common.

20090306172137AAvrjk8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this love???  The first time I've ever felt this way about someone...?	There's this girl I'm friends with... However, I so badly want something more than just a friendship with her. Personally, I think she's the most beautiful girl I've ever laid eyes on. She has such a great personality and is just fun to talk to and be around...      I've had intense feelings for her for a while, years actually, however about a year after I met her we lost touch...  I still liked her during that time where we never talked and everything too... But as of late, we got back in touch and we're becoming closer friends and my feelings are only getting more intense for her... She has so many great qualities. I still don't really know if she likes me back the same way as I like her. However, my feelings are just so incredibly strong for her.  As time goes by, she just keeps on getting more and more beautiful to me, both appearance, and inner beauty...       I've had my fair share of crushes over the years, but nothing like this... No we're not in any form of relationship, just friends as of right now, but the emotions I feel scream "love" more than just crush or infatuation, it that makes any sense. I just am so incredibly attracted to her, and I care for her and her best interest... And I respect her more than any other girl I've ever met.       Regardless, of what happens between us in the future, it honestly feels like my feelings for this girl will never go away... Or more like, I'll never forget her...       This is the first time I've ever felt like this for someone... Am I in love?  Is she my first love? Or, is it just a really intense crush?

20090306181856AAwtWyv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't understand if he likes me!?	I like this guy and he's very shy. And about a month and a half ago I told him I liked him and he never said anything except he gave me a handshake. I was sure he liked me otherwise I wouldn't have told him. He looked at me often and when I looked back he'd sometimes look away, um, his foot was nearly always pointing towards me, he'd seem somewhat nervous around me, he always seemed more confident around others.  Theres more but I won't write it all down... :) Anyway so whenever I see him in the hallway, rarely, he looks at me/stares looks away looks back kinda thing even though it's been a while. I'm not sure if he likes me or whatnot since its been a while since I told him and he hasn't talked to me since. What do you guys think? I appreciate it! :) Thanks so much!

I first met him my freshman year of high school, when we were lab partners. Then that year at homecoming he asked me to dance with him. However, I didn't like him as anymore than a friend then, but now I realllly see how great of a guy he is. Even after knowing him for a year, we hardly ever talked. I usually wait for other people to start convos because I am kind of shy. This year it is no better. My friend and I always do group class projects with him and his brother, but I freeze up and can never think of anything to say without sounding stupid! Whenever I want to talk to him or even see him in the hall it is so hard to even say hi. Any suggestions for me to talk to him more easily? It hurts me everyday that I just sit there looking stupid whenever I have things I want to talk to him about =[      thank's so much for any help

He definitely liked me last year because he flirted with me non stop, complimented me, smiled, stared, and my friends even said so when they saw how with act with each other. Then, he started just staring at me and only talking to me a little. And now he doesn't flirt with me at all and I catch him looking at me and when I look back at him he looks away. He use to be so open with me and I was really shy and gitty around him and now he is acting like me and will not even come up to me =(. He talks to this other girl that sits right next to me and asks her for homework when I would always be the first person he always asked for help. I really do not know what to do... it is not as complicated as it sounds, I am just not use to dealing with this. Any advice on what to do? Should I just give up now? Please help!
20090306183949AAbnjQq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Should I Do Now?	so there's this guy that lives across the street. we'll call him zach. he's constantly flirting with me and is always touching me [i.e. arm around waist, hip, holding hands...] in some way. we're pretty close friends and are often found hanging out with one another. on weekends, we just sit in the back of my mom's car for hours, sometimes until one or two a.m., just talking. everyone says he likes me, and i had begun to think so too. he's so nice to me and risks getting grounded just to spend time with me [which i tell him is stupid, but it makes me feel so loved].       well, turns out, he has a girl friend. i feel so stupid for thinking there was ever a possibility of him liking me. why would he lead me on? or was i just reading way too much into his actions?       anyways, my real question is, what should i do now? how should i act towards him. his behavior towards me hasn't changed, but should i change the way i act around him? i used to flirt back when he flirted with me, but now...i don't know.      erg. i'm so confused. and i can't get in touch of any of my friends so that i can vent.
20090306180853AAR7aEy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make her appreciate me?	It seems like everything I do in my house is the wrong thing to do. I'm always getting my mom angry, and its getting to the point where I don't even know what I'm doing wrong anymore. My mom makes me feel like I am the worst daughter she could ever have, and she is sooo hypocritical. Everything I am told not to do, she does. I just want to make things right, but everytime I try, there is something else I did wrong. It seems like her favorite hobby is pointing out my faults and mistakes. How do I turn into her 'perfect daughter', so that she doesn't get mad, and so that she doesn't make me feel so horrible all the time? Thanks! Btw...it seems the most common things I do wrong, is complaining, being mean to my brothers, feeling sorry for myself, grades, and leaving things places.
20090306175956AA9b1RN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i losing her??? What should I do?!?!?!? Im worrying abou ther ona friday night.. thats how bad it is :(?	Okay so there is this girl i never really talked to, but then i started and we really started to like each other and then i accidentally said something to piss her off but she says shes over it now. Its like she has lost all interest in me, and all I said was that she acts a little different in public than in private.      I keep trying to get her alone to talk about it but every time i get a chance she has "Homework" or she has to call one.. its like she is avoiding me for some reason i dont get. I see her in the hallway and make eye contact and smile but she like looks away really quick and i dunno what it means.      She liked me before and we got over the awkward stage so it was all going ghreat.. but since the problem i havent felt like im connecting with her, she wont answer any serious texts and wont talk on the phone. Im seriously about to give up but i just dont know what the issue is and i kind of want to know before i drop her... or get dropped by her.      I just cant figure it out.. but i asked a good friend of hers a while back and she asked me if i liked her... at the time i was confused and i said no, so I am thinking maybe she said something and now she is afraid to talk to me because she doesnt want to like me??      what do you think I should do? Or what do you think her problem with me is?

20090306190510AAlg9pk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dilemma with my crush?! Read PLEASE!?	Here goes!      I have a crush on one of the most popular guys in my school...   I'm extremely well known, I have a lot of friends, I'm outgoing, an athlete, everything, but I'm not POPULAR, in the sense that I go partying and hook up with everyone etc.      He's completely like, conceited and metro-ish I guess. He hangs out with the popular group of people and walks around the school like he owns it.      He's in his own little tight-knit crowd and I just can't talk to him. All his female friends are the type of girls who would be like "OMG who the hell is she?!" if I talked to him. I don't care about what they think, I just don't want to be embarassed in front of HIM.       He's so conceited and probably really concerned about his popularity on the inside. He's checked me out before, he looks at me sometimes, whatever. But he's NEVER talked to me.      How can I get his attention? I don't want to change my personality. I've like him for like two years and I can't get over him. ALL my friends tell me he's a loser but I just can't get that into my brain.      He's just sooo appealing.

And the way it's going, it seems like I'm never going to have that. I do NOT want to kill myself, but I have endless suicidal thoughts. I've Been thinking about dehydrating myself. I know it's a bad thing to go through, but it's so easy; all I have to do is not drink anything, and eat a lot of dry foods. But I don't want to have to do that. Please, I'm tired of crying and feeling so sad and left out all the time. Every time I look in the mirror I just want to hop back into bed and die. Please, ANYBODY, HELP ME. I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO FACE THIS ON MY OWN. And there is no one at home I can talk to, and I don't have one true friend I can talk to either. My life sucks. I just want to have a normal life like everyone else. But, unfortunately, I'm stuck in a world where you are judged by your looks, so I'm screwed for the rest of my life. I am NOT going to post a picture. I don't know, just imagine me as the elephant man or rocky dennis or something because I might as well just be one of them. Please, anybody help me. It's hard to imagine anybody here on yahoo answers more desperate for help than me. Please, what can I do?????????      Thank you.
20090306173414AAucJkO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I she cheating or what please tell me?	I have been with my baby's mother for about two years now, and over the last week I have checked the history on the computer and I have noticed that she has searched a guys facebook and myspace. She told me that she has had a small little crush on the guy, he's good looking, I must say and it angers me. However she does not go out anywhere and shes home 24/7. But is it still cheating if you seek out someone on facebook and myspace even though they physically do interact with the person. I've checked her facebook friends and he is not one of them, I think she just like looking at the guy cuz he's attractive, is that still cheating and is this something that I should be worrying about. She doesn't go out and I know where she's at, but is this considered cheating.

20090306171858AAhwJWD	Family & Relationships;Friends	Trying to raise money for a friend who's being abused?	My best friend of 20 years is going through the most horrific situation. She's recently divorced and has 7 kids (she's 36). Anyhow, her ex is the most abusive person one would ever meet. Last year she was able to be strong enough to divorce the monster, no matter what. She didn't want to fight for money or anything...she just wanted her sanity. They agreed he would pay $900 a month in child support and she could live in the house. But of course, that gives him access to continue to abuse her and use the kids as a tool to try to abuse her (like take them and not telling her when he would return). The story is so long and detailed, but the bottom line, I want to try to do a fundraiser for her so she can start her life away from him. Does anyone have any good suggestions for this situation?
20090306184855AALN4PQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do i think about him when he's a total douchebag?	this one guy has been calling me this past term of college at 2 in the morning....and i'm not stupid i know its a booty call...we hung out twice but I didn't feel taken advantage of because i was just bored..i called the shots and I completetly emascualted him so its all good. :)      he's the typical frat guy at my college and doesnt aknowledge my existance in public bc he's a jerk..I'm not into him at all...maybe i just got used to the attention but I think about him which is stupid because what self respecting girl thinks about a guy who treats her like like a piece of meat?    Then i started thinking how women have the tendancy to still love their boyfriends/husbands even after they do stupid **** to them like cheat or beat them (like rihanna and chris brown) and yet they still go back to them..is this like the same thing??? and why????

20090306173439AAytM5i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I slept with his friend?	I have been having sex with this guy for a year. We are really terrible to each other and purposely try to hurt each other. He crossed the line over the weekend by inviting me on a date with him and another girl (i did not know this until I showed up at his house). I was really angry and up set by this and went to a mutual friends house for drinks the next day. They were his friends first but I have grown very close to them through him. I had sex with one of them. The friend felt very bad. I did not at that point. I then went there again last ngiht and had sex with him again last night. He told me he was really mad at himself for having sex with his friends girl or whatever. But in the morning we had sex again. I think I have just gotten myself into a terrible situation and I dont know what to do. I dont want to lose them as friends and I dont want him to either. What do I do??

20090306170955AAsJEuA	Family & Relationships;Family	My parents fight all the time!?	My parents fight at least every other week but usually every week. It's usually my dad who is being an asshole to my mom(actually all the time).  They've been separated before but they got back together.  I get so fricken tired of them fighting all the time and they never seem to ignolage my feelings.  My dad is so off and on.  Sometimes he will be awesome and so much fun.  But then he will turn around and treat my mom like ****.  I hate it so much and it makes me so angry.  My mom does so much for our family and she is so great.  Sometimes I wish she could find someone better.
20090306172343AAw751B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm not sure how to "read" this guy or even how to react to him.  Any advice?	I've known a guy for, I guess, half a year.  He's an outgoing and friendly person.  I like(d) him, and he seemed to like me back.  He'll do random stuff to be funny like throw something at me or say something trying to gently smart off to me.  Something else too: he will normally always hug me every time we see each other.  And when we hug, lately he'll do something like rub my back or kind of massage it.  I don't know if that means anything, but he recently got a girlfriend this year.  He still continues to act the same way to me though: coming up to me trying to start a conversation, joking around with me, telling me stuff that bugs him, etc.  It seems like he's almost always doing at least one thing whenever I see him whether it's trying to scare me or pretending he's gonna slam a door on me.  He treats me like his favorite person when we do see each other, but we don't communicate very much outside of church, which is something that kinda makes me think maybe he's just being polite.          So I'm thinking that either he just thinks I'm a cool person and someone he feels comfortable enough to joke around with, or he might be interested in me.  Either way, I don't really know how I should react or behave through this.  I really don't flirt much back with him; normally I'll just kinda smile and maybe laugh at things he does.  He doesn't strike me as the player type of guy, but I don't want to encourage anything esp. when he's currently in a relationship.          I guess I just want some opinions on how he views me and things that I should and should not do or say.  I don't want to ignore him, but I don't want to be flirting with him either.

We have since exchanged e-mails every day, and he has started to call me "sexy", "babe" and now closes his e-mails with "Luv" before his name.  I now close my e-mails with "Love You" before my name.      The weird thing about all this is that I can't stop thinking about him.  I think I like him.

20090306172427AA5EuaI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend is being bullied in different (all girls) school?	well my friend (girl) is being bullied by a former friend basically....      she has been in lots of small fights with her before, with all of them ending in my friend surrendering to the bullys waves of tears that win over her clasmates...(she's a mental bully, in no way physical)   followed by the bully informing her mother of the talk they had and passing it on as my friend bullying her, and as a result, the bullys mother had a 1 on 1 with my friend and told her to LEAVE THE BULLY ALONE!! and ever since has held a grudge against her...      their mums work together in her house so they have to walk home/spend long periods of time together... She said to me;    ''Everyday I Come Home, Her Mom's In My Kitchen, Giving Me Daggers(filthy looks/glares)''      there are only about 35 people in her year/class so the bully is hard to avoid, especially since only about 10 or 15 are part of the ''popular group'', the 2 of them included, and most of the others are in a similar situation to my friend, bullied by the queen bitc* and her cronies.      the bullys mother knows about the bully and as read about above also partly partakes in this bullying by making her feel uncomfortable at home               my friend gently spoke to the girl about it and said she wanted space from her since they are tecnichaly still friends because of the link through their mothers...      she's pretty much depresed, and comes out regularly with statements like 'i mean i know i'm realy ugly' and 'i thought guys just liked boobs'    (she hasnt realy got boobs yet but besides that is tall, slender, tanned.... pretty amazing body basicaly but her very plain looking bully ''friend'' has convinced her otherwise...      her mum, from what i can pick up, is so selfish, she wont sacrifice the friendship/bussiness partnership with the bullys mother over the bullying...      i just wanna guide my friend through this and stay with her through her talks with her mum and in her school but i know i cant and i dont know what to do      my friend is borderline depressed over this and i dont know what to do...      i know there must be more and so the aditional info section will most likely be large so make sure to read it...

I cant say that im perfect or anybody else for that matter and sometimes I feel like im being to nit picky but im in a serious relationship with somebody who smokes weed, yes he smoked it when we met and so did I which makes me feel like a hippocrite and thats what he tells me I am when I talk about weed being bad for us.  I dont want it around and iv asked him to stop but he hasnt and its getting me down.  Then I think about the fact that it could be worse and he could have other habits that piss me off.  No relationship is ever perfect, should I let him be or leave him over the fact that he wont quit.  I love him to much to let weed get in the way :(

20090306180259AAJvQpS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my date failing?	Sup YA, posting from my blackberry here in the middle of a date and it's going awful. I don't understand, I thought this was going to be the date of my dreams, but she seems so uninterested. It started out with a car show where we saw lots of awesome and incredible cars, but she'd didn't care! I even bought a new 2009 Ford Mustang, but she didn't even care that I got a new car! I took her to a fancy french resteraunt in downtown, but she doesn't really care at all. I'm planning on taking her home to watch Star Wars: REVISITED (A fan edit (it's awesome)) on my HD tv and surround sound system, but she's giving me hints that she just wants to go home instead of watching it. What am I doing wrong and how can I save this date because I really like this woman? Should we go bowling (we aren't dressed for it though) ?
20090306180309AAytJ2u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend insensitive? Why do I always feel that I am overreacting?	I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years and things have been going great. Every once in a while however if we get in a fight I feel like he never ever apologizes and always makes me feel like i'm crazy or overreacting. Anyway, I have a fear of flying and there is trip that we are planning to the UK to visit his family but when we come back he wants to land at one airport because he has a job interview there and he is going right back to the UK afterward.  He could very well fly back with me  to my final stop so I don't have to fly alone but he instead is going to fly from Boston to (to save himself $100 or so even though he is wealthy) to the UK until he finds out about that job. Anyway, I kinda got upset and he doesn't seem to care that I would fly alone and the thing that ticked me off was when he said, "oh i'm sorry am I going to have to fly with you on every flight leg that you ever take?" I felt that it was so insensitive to say that and made me question if I want to continue to be with  someone who could disregard my feelings so much.Also, last time we went to New York I was kinda frantic on the plane rides and he was so annoyed everytime i tapped his shoulder to ask about what was going on with the turbulence etc.  He also does not think it is a big deal if he moves to Boston for this job because he said there is 'email and phone'.It makes me seem like he doesn't care about leaving because he has never once asked me my opinion of him taking a job there. (we live in Texas right now) I told myself last night that if he didn't apologize for that flight leg comment that I was going to break up with him and after our New york trip I said the same thing because I felt he was so mean to me on the flight. But maybe am I just overreacting, because right now I think to myself "oh i guess it is dumb to ask him to fly back" but then again if this is someone that TRULY cares and loves me shouldn't he at least offer or say he wishes he could? Thanks

"ever since you left me everything has been falling apart. i need you." i still talk to her to make sure shes alright. she said that im the only thing thats keeping her alive. for about a week when i call her no reply. its never like this and if she cant talk she always sends a quick message explaining why. it kinda makes me worried. id hate it if something happened to her. i know i shouldnt get involved again but she makes it impossible...      so i guess my question is is there a way i cant get involved without worrying about her? is that possible?

20090306184214AANnCab	Family & Relationships;Friends	Annoying "friend"? Please help. I appreciate it.?	I've known this girl for a long time. We were friends when we were younger but, it wasn't too long until I saw she wasn't as great a friend as I thought. She treated me awful to me and behind my back. I thought when I moved it would get better but,it has gotten much worse. She always wants to come down to visit. Hate is a strong word but, I don't like her & she annoys the crap out of me.There were a few times she was there for me but, it doesn't make up for all the bad things. The problem is that she thinks we're BFF's. Trust me we are far from "BFFS"..we're not even friends. I just consider her someone from my past. I want to be honest w/ her but, I don't want to cause problems because our families. My friends said its best to just ignore her & maybe she'll get the picture but, I've tried that & unfortunately shes not bright enough to figure that out. She & her family actually had the nerve to invite themselves down & expect an answer from me w/ in a days notice. Are you kidding me?!       What should I do?   keep ignoring her like my friends suggested?    or    Be honest with & tell her that we're not good friends?

20090306190058AAwA4kD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need a mans opinion but women are also welcome to answer?	So I have been dating my man for almost 4 months now, but his ex still calls him and tries to stay in contact with him but from what he tells me it ended extremely badly. In my women opinion I would think if I had a relationship end very badly I would want nothing more to do with that person. He also will call her back if she calls him which does bother me but I am trusting and in giving him the benefit of the doubt I let him do as he pleases as far as calling her goes. So his ex recently added me to her facebook page and I accepted of course because I have nothing against the women, adding her led to messaging her today to ask her what her take on there relationship is and how things ended and why did they end ex.. So of course she called him and asked him why I would be asking her these questions(but yes she also did email me back asking me to call her!) anyways so he calls me extremely upset and angry that I contacted her! In my opinion if you have nothing to hide why be angry about it? So does anyone have in thoughts, opinions, or advice?

It used to be where we didn't like guys or anything and we just liked Barbies, when we were younger. But now I have a boyfriend and I told her about it and she supports me. She has this friend who's a girl and they've been together for 2 years, but I'm not angry that she didn't tell me cuz I can see how it would be hard to, especially since she didn't know how I felt about same gender couples. But I'm glad she's happy, and I want to be there for her, but I'm still a little shocked and don't know how I'd react if I ever saw them together (I've met the girl though). How can I get used to it?

20090306195458AAJXydn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't get close to anyone and I RUIN all of my possble relationships with guys?	Okay. I am 15 and im high school. Everyone is getting into relationships now and are dating. I found though that whenever I like a guy and he asks me out I break up with him before we can even consider it a relationship. I have had so many people leave me in my life. My mom, dad (I at least still talk to him though which is good), best friend, ect....      I think I am scared to get close to someone and then have them....leave me. How do I get over this and give a guy a chance. I just broke up with a guy last week and we had technically only went out for '2' days. I know right how sad. He was really kind about it and isn't mad though. I just can't get close to anybody and whenever I start to I go into avoid mode unconsciously. I was avoiding my own boyfriend!!!      :  (      Has anybody ever been this way before. I just don't want to be hurt...
20090306215514AATNnSw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I innocently make body contact with this girl?	...in an appropriate, sweet (ahem), not creepy way of course.

For some scenarios, I work with her in lab sometimes, and we walk together after class.       we're just casual friend now, though we begin to talk with each other more this week (compared to some awkward silence before). So I would like to pick up the momentum.      yeah I forgot to add that we're both kinda on the shy side. So...seriously, no, I am not gonna grab her.....or slap her *** or anything like some people will say..

How do pick up signals from this type of girl? and more importantly, how can I test her out? body contact?? casually ask her to grab lunch with me??      what else other than typical "ask her out" answer lol?
20090306201413AAPAXYi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He use to say I was hot, and now he says I'm ugly?	There's this dude in my class,   and about 3 weeks ago, he use to always say i was hot and pretty and all that crap guys say.   And NOW, he is being really mean to me. He makes fun of me for having big eyes, and makes fun of my nose, and he's just being really mean, and it does hurt my feelings.      Why do you think he's doing this? It makes me afraid to be near him because he could embarrass me by calling me ugly in front of everybody and I could really break down in tears.

20090306221804AAoEeP2	Family & Relationships;Family	How do i handle a sister & brother in law who do nothing but be negative around my nephew when he's ->?	Watching Sporting events?      Today i just couldn't take it anymore.  I went to visit my sister my brother in law & my nephew.  I first started watching the Nets-Magic Basketball game with my nephew but during that whole time all my sister & brother in law would just talk about how the NBA Ref Scandal has ruined the NBA while also complaining about the officiating during the game.  After that game we watched the Celtics- Cavs game. Again instead of just enjoying the game my brother in law is ranting about how the NBA is doing all they can to help Lebron James win a Championship. Then finally i tell my sister & brother in law about taking my nephew to Fenway Park to see his team the Red Sox in June. Instead of being happy about taking their son to see his favorite team I'm attacked by them saying why should i take him to see a bunch of drug cheats? Now my nephew has a dislike of Lebron James & agrees with his father about the NBA wanting Lebron James win a title. What happened to the days where we let the kids enjoy their sports while not really discussing much about the scandals & faults in sports in front of them?I'm very upset at how my sister & brother in law has taken the fun away from my nephew when it comes to sports & now he's so pessimistic & I'm now afraid that he won't enjoy the game I'll be taking him too in June & instead will concentrate more on the negatives of sports like his father does.  How can i talk to my brother in law & sister in a nice way that they are ruining their son's fun in sports by their behavior every time he's watching a sporting event?  Any good advice would be appreciated.

20090306215532AAr0FBL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are Women Threatened By Good Looking Women. Do they Prefer a Jen Aniston Type?	Here is my theory....Women are subconciously threatened by extremely good looking women so they prefer butter-face types....Jen Aniston is a good example. She is attractive....but just a so-so face. She has nice hair and an amazing body..something EVERY woman can acheive....not just the pretty ones...      The favorite on this Seasons Bachelor was Jillian....Jillian is a butter face. She is attractive but at the same time somewhat homely...Someone that a woman wouldn't feel threatened that she may steal her boyfriend. A great friend to go out to the bar with that is good looking enough that you arent embarassed by her but homely enough that she won't steal your sunshine.      Thoughts???

I just feel like there is a part of me missing because i haven't had that experience yet. I know it is wrong of me to base my self worth on a boy or any other person for that matter.       I just feel worthless.
20090306223844AA3ZFTq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	3rd time: Guys, if a girl starts to blush around you, do you know she likes you?	There's this guy I have developed a crush on and now whenever i see him I start blushing and I get really quiet and when he comes and talks to me I'm red as a beet and can barely talk.       When I first met him I wasn't like that and I could talk freely without blushing but now that i like him it's different.       So what do you think? Does he know or do I have to hint, because I think he likes me too but I'm not sure what to do now?

20090306212523AADPM3S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Ok, so me and my friend who's a girl have been friends for about a year. She's in 9th grade and I'm in 8th. We text a lot everyday and I go over to her house at least once each weekend because she's a pretty busy person. So, we watch a movie almost every time we see each other and I've put my arm around her almost every time but she doesn't do anything about it. Last weekend, she came over to my house and after we watched a movie, we just started fooling around on my bed. We just started play fighting for each others phone. This time, we watched the movie with my arm around her and then got something to drink and went to her bedroom. Then we started play fighting over stuff and we were always rubbing against each other. I didn't really mean to but because she was wearing these short shorts, I saw her underwear a couple of times. Disregarding that, I was on top of her and we stopped and just laughed and looked at each other. Then we heard our moms talking because my mom was a little early so we just got up and went.

20090306200104AAs56TB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me, or are we just friends?	the guy is my best friend, and we confide in each other so much. he once told me that he liked me, but were both dating people, so we put our feelings aside and just became friends. recently, he's been talking about this one guy he likes (he's bisexual) and i'm just like...sad. and then one day he said "i love you" and i was like, love is a strong word and he said, "yeah, that's why it's perfect." and now, every time we talk online, he ends the conversation by saying i love you, love you, or simply luv ya...does this mean he likes me? is he just being a flirt? or am i simply overanalyzing things? oh, and yes, i like him!

20090306195412AAnNpIz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend distant or just tired? Details below?	When my boyfriend and I first got together...we were inseparable. We had a long distant relationship but all he wanted to do was talk to me on the phone all day long. After a couple months later...he seemed to have given up on doing that. He is more distant. When we talk it's the same. but he doesn't call me as much. I know he still loves me and wants me the same. He said he was losing himself a little bit. He said he was tired...I guess from all the lack of sleep. He had lack of sleep before but I don't know why this is affecting him now. Do you think I'm being selfish? Do you think he's just tired? I know with all this talking he only gets an hour or two a sleep per night with a nap in the daytime. Do you think he's just tired or not that into me anymore? If a guy wanted to talk to a girl they would do whatever it takes right? Please explain.

20090306222714AACMqjR	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm looking for a unique alternative to an diamond engagement ring... Any ideas?	I'm at the point in my relationship where I am going to ask my gf to marry me in the next few months.  I know she'll say yes - we've talked about it before.  I want to get her a unique engagement ring.  Not diamonds - in her opinion they are far too expensive and commonplace.  She doesn't need them but I want to do something super romantic and different.        Please don't respond by saying that I'm cheap blah blah blah.  Money is not the issue.      This is about awesome alternatives rather than adapting to a cultural norm.  Which is why we're getting married :)

I am slightly overweight. I've got a bit of a stomach and just have a little extra cushion here and there. lol. Anyways, my girlfriend has recently started to get a little sexual with me and the last time she was over, I fingered her and stuff. I am nervous that when she comes over this weekend, she will try to get some of my clothes off. I am terribly insecure though... I am not terrible looking, just a little extra pounds. I know she loves me, so should I let her get in my pants? Will she be immediately turned off by me? Or is weight a small issue? Opinions?

20090306224127AAQMWOP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Physical Abuse. Opinions or advice?	My husband returned home from Iraq the second time with some extreme anger issues. There was one occurrence that we had a heated argument and he hit me, my daughter seen the argument, and now every time he seems angry at me "playing around"  she gets scared and starts to cry. I decided not to give up on my husband, because of the things that he has been through, he can't control his anger. He has been going to see a professional and is doing the best he can to control his anger. When I think back and remember her face, it breaks my heart. Sometimes I wonder if it was a bad decision to stay. We have both attended some marriage counseling, and we have both seen psychiatrist. Since he has been on regular visits, his anger issue has completely disappeared. I'm not sure what else to do here, I would like some opinions and advice from those who've been through a similar situation. I don't want to show her that marriage is of no value and to leave at a sign of trouble, that marriage has it's ups and downs and is something that has to be worked at.
20090306215256AA3fMlW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I still miss him even though he hasn't called in 5 months?	I met "Mr. Wonderful" on a dating site. Things were going GREAT(were going on 6 months). So I thought, then one night I surf the internet site where I met him, and he had a new profile up. What a kick in the gut that was. I confront him about it and told him I wasn't mad, I was sad. Told him friends suggested booting him out of my life, but told him I couldn't because I want him in it. He said he knew he wanted me in his. I told him I wouldn't be calling him until he called me. So five months later and no phone call, and I still miss him and care about him like crazy! Why tell someone you want them in your life if you don't follow through with it?!!
20090306200115AAIjf7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problems with crush!?	So there a guy that I love talking to. I'm naturally a shy person but it seems like I've known him for more than we have which is about 5 months. I can talk to him so easily and be myself and just say whatever I think of. I can talk around other people but I get worried about what I'm saying and sound stupid and weird. This (talking so freely) only happens with a few people for me and usually the people are really good friends.    Well my crush flirted with me a lot this week, but now I'm unsure about him. The problem is, is that his ex from about a half-month ago is in a permanent group with me for the rest of the school year. We're not best friends or even friends, but we're friendly, like we talk and stuff but not as friends...we never hang out or anything. i'm not saying I wanna be her friend (no offense, not meant to sound rude) I just want to stay on good terms with her.    Would it be okay if he was interested in me? Do think it's morally correct even though I constantly work with his last ex?

20090306202328AA9Xzvf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really want her!! What should I do?	I have this girl I reeaally like, and we've known eachother for two years. But I don't know if she has feelings for me. We get along very well, and she does make lots of eye contact with me. She laughs at many of my jokes, and she even told me that she wished to have a boyfriend. She can get perverted at times and makes sexual jokes.    But, she hangs out with other guys too. She doesn't hug me, but she hugs other guys, talks to them, etc. But I've always noticed that she makes lots of eye contact with me, even when she doesn't talk to me.    She's popular, but I'm not exactly (I'm kinda like a nerd, but I've heard others say I'm attractive), which i think could be a downfall. I never went outside with her.    She added me first on facebook first, but when she and I are online, we never talk. When I start the conversation, we go very smooth, but I don't want to start all the time.    What should I do? Advice?      She's always greeting me in hallways.   Also, when I accidentally touched her in the stomach and apologized, she smiled and said it was okay.

He came as friend to my wife. Then my wife told he is like her brother and was her college friend. Instead of resolving things he messed up everything. Last that friend told to divorce her, she doesn't likes you, she hates you while my wife was sitting in front of me only. while this guy was telling like this, she didn't speak a single word. When I told that friend that is his idea, he says that she only communicated to him about divorce matter. Do you accept any third person to resolve marriage issues and also how much you will entertain your friend after marriage?

20090306220101AA1LmTU	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with this?	Yes hello. So in the beginning of the year, there was a girl in my class who I began to talk to. I knew she had done pot and drank and even engaged in semi-sexual activities, but I did not care. Over these many months, I now found out she has been with many many guys and done many many bad things. Horrible things. Not violent or illegal. Just engaged in heavily sexual activities. I don't like this girl nor have I ever liked her, but as a friend, what do I do to deal with this? I am really bummed out.

20090306204354AAZmDtb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested?

20090306214820AALHyAo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not sure about a title for this, but i really need help.?	So, i kinda dealt with this guy for a while (couple months i guess) he told me he loved me and we were alright i guess. but i was kinda if-y. i kinda ended things (romantically) cause i thought he might just be in it for one thing cause hes older, and he gave me reason. and he didnt take it well,      but we started talking again like a couple weeks later, and weve kinda stayed in touch. but then he started beign really sweet and lead me on for about a week before valentines, and then turns around and tells me the day of valentines that he has an "amazing date" and shes "one in a Billion" and continues to tell me things about her.       I was pissed and hurt, and now im not sure if he was trying to make me jelous or he was trying to let me know he moved on? Your Thoughts?      now recently, i ask about his valentine and he says they "never would have worked out anyways" and "she is really amazing, but shes a friend".  and im not sure what to make of this...         i dont know if i regret ending things with him or if im just having trouble letting go, i am one big confused mess and i;d appreciate any tips or advice or enlightenment.    thank you.

He is there whenever I need him, he gives me money, the keys to the car and house, we text everyday but yet we are not in a relationship. I have met his family and him mine - however we haven't made it to the next step, we don't even hold real conversations except for to make plans to have sex. I know he talks to other people and ditto however I really want to be w/ him and settle down. He's 31 and Im 27- neither one of us have kids or been married.  Am I wasting my time waiting for him to get the hint that I want to be serious or what?....

20090306203748AA1lROp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did this quiet girl reject me? how does my plan sound?	i've been going to my college's library for the last couple months to study and borrow laptops, and, because i like the girl who works there, since shes nice and good-looking. we've chatted a few times, but nothign more than 'hows your day been?'. she's really cute but seems quiet and not very expressive/outgoing, compared to the others who work there   so 2 days ago, well i managed to ask her how her weekend went and got her name.   yesterday, I asked her out. ok so heres how it went   after i got the laptop and asked her hows it going, she responded, and then she asked me back. i then stumbled for a few seconds, hesitated, then i told her that i wanted to get to know her better and asked if she wanted to get some coffee some time. she looked kinda confused after previously smiling. i then asked how about this weekend? and she responded right away that shes busy since her friend is visiting from out of town. i then asked about any time this week, and she said shes busy, there was a pause for about a second or two, and then she said that she will get back to me   i then said 'how about i get your number?', she then gave it to me. she smiled. then i left with the laptop      finals are in 2 weeks from now, so i dont know how we can possibly meet up next week for coffee even if she agrees, since shes busy this weekend, and this week, if shes being honest. maybe we can meet up 4 weeks from now, in the new semester?      how does my plan sound? i will call (or should i text instead?)her tomorrow and ask if shes available next week (shes probably busy studying for finals). if she says shes busy, ill ask if she wants to hang out some other time. i will then go to the library and say hi to her next mon or tues, and make small talk, trying to read if she finds me creepy or not. if not, then i will call her again after break and ask if she still wants to hang out. if she says shes busy, then i'll assume she rejected me   OR   should i ask her in person next Monday about hanging out, instead of calling her tomorrow?      she didnt GIVE me her number, i just said 'i should get your number', because i tried to sound confident.   BUT she did say to get back to her, but i think that may have been because she was trying to break the silence that lasted for a few seconds

20090306200424AAMN0lO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl I like........... :(?	Background - I'm in middle school. I'm white. I'm 14. I'm a 4 (out of 10, :( ), or maybe a 6 but I can't tell( I'm not all that attractive but apparently my dad had 3-5 girlfriends at my age, and people say I look just like him). I used to have blonde hair with white at the ends, dyed it brown. I'm 5'7'' 125lbs, in shape, and (most likely) on the track team. She's not popular, but she has friends. She (to me) is extremely hot. To others she's just above average. I really like her, but she doesn't even know me.       She sits in front of me in math and beside me in science. I don't even know her last name so I can't go around networking to get to be her friend, then work from there. Chances are she is never going to notice me. I don't know what to do either. She seems more interested in the pot-head in front of me than in me, when she actually DOES turn her head. I haven't had a girlfriend either. Really stumped. Could someone tell me what I should do? I would really like to be able to be her friend. Then boyfriend. Also, when is it to say to a pretty girl, they look nice today. (As a compliment ofc)      (BTW, I don't get nervous around girls, even the hot ones)
20090306210942AAfCqVG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she love me?...?	I really love this girl, and i recently told her that. It was on MSN so it was less embarrassing, I'm pretty sure she feels the same way, otherwise she might just be effing with me. BUT I DON'T KNOW!!!   when i was about to leave i said " Alrighty i gotta go, buh bye (L)"   and she responded with "Byee (L)". I was doubtful that she meant the heart, so i said "Don't type things if you don't mean them" and she responded "Who says i don't mean it?"      Does this mean that she does love me? and if so, if i ask her out will if eff up the friendship?

20090306205336AABR7WC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Help Boyfriend and Porn?	I'm one of those girls that don't like it when the bf watches porn. Anyways I just don't understand this, my boyfriend watches it and ofcourse j**** off to it. My question is, if you're okay with this it doesnt bother you one bit that they are pretending to have sex with other women or that he's finding your body boring? How come some women said theyd join in, watch and then have sex, don't you think your bf is picturing the pornstar or fanasizing of another woman while making love to you?  Lastly, why does he need the porn, I'm ok with him checking out other women but for him to pretendt to make love to them just hurts me. My bf and I have an amazing sex life, lets just say I'm very generous.

I have noticed that when your in a relationship with a girl, and they start to get bored of you for one reason or another, they just really seem to show it and wont try to work it out. And just because of it they'll leave you with nothing but a middle finger. Every girl seems to be this way from my friends and the way they talk to me about their BFs to my ex's. Or is this just a mental thing that my mind has made up from being heartbroken so many times? Im not trying to be sexest if thats what your thinking and i know that not "all" girls are like that....but "most" of them seem to be. Why?

20090306204913AAScFzd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	At what age did you find a significant other?	I am 24 and an attractive male, I have been working at a job where I make over 42k a year, so I am happily fulfilling all my wants and enjoying a single life whereas most my friends are locked down and somewhat unhappy with their situation (as a lot of americans are).      So just out of curiosity how old were/are some of you when you found a significant other that you have been with for at least 2 years, and how old are you now? And are you happily coupled?      And any details of how you met this person would be appreciated.
20090306215135AAmyOXU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When many constantly question your orientation just because you're single, and it's REALLY ticking you off?	Should you just make up a story about having a boyfriend?      I'm a fourth year college student. I have been asked so many times why I don't I have a boyfriend by this point in my life, and honestly it's because I could never find a guy who is interested in me as a person and not me as another body. I have many goals (but--ironically--many of these goals are to learn more skills concerning crafts, cooking, gardening, etc.) and pursue them actively.      Other people don't ask initially, but they treat you differently after they know you're single. Then, later on, you learn that they asked someone else if you're homosexual. I know I'm not the most feminine-looking person out there: I enjoy things such as hiking and many times I'm miles away from dresses and perfume. And, just generally, I don't have a petite figure. But it's really irritating to be judged based on appearance.      So, I'm waiting for the right guy, I've heard there are some out there. But, I really am getting close to screaming at the next person who asks me if I'm lesbian just because I'm single. Just because I've waited for so long.      Any thoughts?

20090306194539AAhOqmQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	~HELP~ How can I spend time with my boyfriend that I'm not allowed to have?	Okay, my parents are really strict, and I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend. He's in only two of my classes, P.E. and science. I don't get chances to interact with him in science because it I hang out with my friends, the smarter ones, while he hangs out with his friends. In P.E., we act like bf and gf should, but it's a class so there aren't a lot of opportunities. I see him during snack and lunch, but that's not enough. Plus, I have to constantly look for passing supervisors who will get me in trouble for PDA. Remember, I'm not allowed to have a bf, so we can't go out on dates or anything. My school only has dances occasionally, but anyway I don't really like dances. Helpful advice, please and thank you!

I don't know when you will actually be able to get online and read this but I thought I would write you anyway. I want you to know how much you mean to me and I think you are an amazing guy. I really want us to work out but I have been getting my feelings hurt almost everyday. It hurts me when I try to call and you ignore it. It hurts my feelings because when I try to talk to you- I feel like I'm bothering you. I just feel like there is no room for me in your life and I don't want to be in the way anymore. I hope you understand and I want to be able to work this out- but I don't know what to do other than tell you how I'm feeling. Please don't take this the wrong way or get upset with me.

20090306193521AAmtfKS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to kiss a guy when I'm super shy? and what happens after you kiss someone?	Ok so I'm 13, so do you think that's a good age? I think it is but I don't know. He is really sweet and nice and I know he isn't just in it for fun. So for the past couple weeks he was joked around with me and talked about kissing. But the other day he made it clear that he thinks he loves me. I know I shouldn't be 100% positive cause we're so young, but I really do like him. I'm not sure if I love him, but it's the closest thing I ever felt to love.  So the other day he hugged me and I'm pretty sure he was trying to kiss me cause he leaned in further than usual and held me closer but I unknowingly backed away, because I didn't realize at that moment that he might of been trying to kiss me. and the other day he wrote me a note,he usually doesn't do that though, and it said that he wanted to kiss me but it didn't seem like I wanted to kiss him, which is so not the case lol. But Im scared of how to do it, cause what if he doesn't like the way I kiss, and we both never kissed anyone before so.... and I'm scared if he doesn't like my kiss.   Also what if it gets awkard afterwards then what do I do?      So how/when do I kiss him...?

20090306194426AAYi5aT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He acted like he liked me ....but not anymore?!?	Okay long story. So there's this boy I really like. First he started saying my name a lot when he asked me questions about homework. He would ask me something almost everyday and smile at me occasionally. It seemed as though he liked me a little because when other girls were around he wouldn't ask them anything (he would always turn to me). Then there was a school dance and I asked him to dance and he said yes and first he was kinda joking around by putting his arms on my shoulders, but then he put them on my waist. It was amazing for me because it was my dream come true. Then when I went back to school he totally ignored me and this happened about 3 or 4 weeks ago. But he is still kinda ignoring me. I try to text him but that's it. He won't look at me in school or anything. Do you think he hates me now? I know hes never had a girlfriend before but he turns his head when I walk by or and stuff. He isn't shy around other girls either, hes like really outgoing and stuff but I don't know at all what to do. Any advice?

20090306195126AAzS3pW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am so DAMN confused!?	My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday, after a 9 month relationship. Her reason were frustrating. She did not want to replace her friends with me, or her family with me, and she wanted her life to be more simple again. Today she avoided me at school, but when I got home I checked my facebook. She seems like she really wants to be friends. Like really badly. I still love her and I told her that today was hell because it is all I was use to, school with her. So I said I want to be with you even if it means just being friends. Do I have a chance to get her back? should I wait til summer when there is more time and her life becomes less stressful.

No sex was my only condition because I value myself and don't want to give myself up yet. On the 7 and a  half-ish month which was thanksgiving break he went on some cruise with his family and got a ******** while he was drunk with some chick. We broke up and that was the end of that. After barely speaking to each other we again began speaking to each other normally. He now flirts with me and the subject of him cheating on me is often brought up. He compliments me and stares at me. He also says " I love you too" when I roll my eyes at him.[wierd..] Today him and I were speaking and he said he regretted cheating on me and that he didn't want to break up with me. Does he want me back? Guy's your help is requested.!!!

20090306201949AAVTd2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend broke up with me after 3 months because she wasnt ready for a relationship, is there still hope?	my ex girlfriend is 18 and I am 23   I met her in work in october and started dating in november, things were fine with us and she seemed really into me, vice verser!   We became an official in december and I was the first person she had slept with   but in february she broke up with me because she said her mum wasnt happy with seeing anyone. It wasnt untill a week ago I got the truth and she told me she wasnt ready for  relationship. I told her I respected that but when she said can we be friends I said I dont want to be because its weird as I still have feelings for her.      She really seemed like she wanted to be my friend and yesterday I told her I was silly and id like her to be my friend because she is one of the nicest girls ive met. Deep down I dont want to be just friends and am wondering if anyone knows if there could be a chance of us getting back together as I really like this girl?      will she have feelings for me as I was her first?   Or am I getting myself into the friends zone and gunna cause myself more pain in the long run?

20090306202116AAhfLIz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i say sorry to her?	well last summer me and my best friend (not anymore) called my friend destiny and just talked on the phone, he has a habit of putting me down during a conversation with a girl to make him self sound better -___- anyways.. so after the conversation was over he told me "Ruben, you do know the only reason she talks to you and likes you is because your such a kiss *** to her" which i wasn't, but coming from my best friend i believed him. I was so mad i just stop talking to her. so when school started i didn't talk to her, even when she was trying to say "hi" or "whats going on" i would just  try to ignore her. soon she just gave up and stop trying to talk to me.   That was in September of last year, by now me and my best friend stop talking much (he thinks he too "cool" now). so i barley find out that he lied to me! he just said that so he could make a move on her and i would be out of the picture! and he already had a girlfriend at the time.. and now i feel really bad because now destiny wont even look me in the eye and it just makes me feel like crap.. so how do i try to apologize? i don't care if she doesn't forgive me i just want to tell her im sorry.

This is my first year of university and he is now in college, the reason is because he wouldnt listen to me, we were both in the same situation; not having the sufficient credits to get accepted into Universities, I chose to study in summer school for my credits and wait a term, he chose to start the first term at college and then transfer credits over to University,if only he had hung in there with me he would've been in university by now and not dwelling in college. Every now and then i call him and suggest to do something together but he only shows up less than half the time. Hes also adapted quite an unhealthy life style-going out late at night with his other friends and returning home past 1 or so, my aunt tells me cuz shes worried but chooses not to sit down and talk to him. Today i asked him to go and see watchmen with me tmrw, knowing that i've been wanting to watch the movie for quite some time he tells me he cant because he wouldnt be able to wake up at 10 to go watch the one at 12 . while on the phone i hear his friends and he tells me hes out hanging out right now, then we got into an argument because he seems to always put his other friends before me and to be honest i feel a bit hurt becuz i considered him my best friend. maybe he doesnt consider me his best friend anymore. I am a loner. And i've always enjoyed my alone time because i knew i already have a big fun family and a best freind who i could count on. i sometimes feel that he considers me his cousin only now while i still consider him my best friend meaning i would take a bullet for him but he would not in return and this makes me sad. Can anybody tell me what to do? How can i bring him back to a right track and live a healthier life? How can i save our friendship? now i feel lost..

20090306215530AAfrSTw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should i do with my old fashioned Husband?	Hi, I'll try to make this lonnnnng story as short as possible!!!   I've been married for almost 5 years now and we have 2 kids. The 1st is almost 3 and the youngest is 4 months. Everything between us moved quickly. We met and 4 months later we were living together about 8 months after that we got married and 2 months later i got pregnant. Our relationship has always been a bit rocky, but then again who's is'nt...   After having our 2nd child i had really bad baby blues. I would just cry all the time. I was frusterated because i had to take care of a screaming terrible two's kid who is soooo hyper and a colicy baby. I was getting less then 5 hours of sleep each night and they were "Obviously and Expectedly" interrupted by a screaming/hungry/pooped baby. So all of this plus and husband that is pretty old fashioned and thinks that the women's place is in the home and that i need to cook, clean, take care of the kids and animals, take care of all the bills etc. I try hard to keep up to his expectations but lately it's harder with the new baby and all.    He works most of the time. He's in constuction which has gone wayyy down lately so he has a few jobs per month and besides that he's doing a few side things which consist of phone calls and computer work. He has alot more time then he did before and i really want him to be at home whenever possible to help me a bit and so that we can also spend some time together. Whenever he get's home he's either on the computer...on the phone...or playing video games. We rarely go out since i don't have a sitter. The 2 times my mom came to visit we went out. The 1st time we went to the movies...and on the way there he asked me if it's ok if he invited his friend to come with us. I though he was joking but he was serious and i thought am i that boring that he needs his friend to come along on a date with us?!!! Anyways the 2nd time we went to dinner had a few quick bites and left quick because he was thinking that the baby being away from me so long was not a good idea since i'm breastfeeding!!! Yesterday we went out again to his friends birthday at a local bar...and as soon as we got there he sayed hello and went out side to smoke with his friend and left me alone with all these people i didn't really know. we were there exactly 1 hour of which i saw him between cigarettes. I made a cool friend but i hate that i always seem to be alone. Whenever there is a family gathering he usually will make up an excuse not to go with me.       His family lives in South America and he was raised very diffrently then i was. I guess it's common over there for men to be like this, but we live in the US.  He also has a really short temper and calls me an idiot Daily for maybe doing something like forgetting to give water to the dog during the day. I realized that alot of men from his country are like that, they speak like that to people without meaning it nessesarrily, but that doesn't make it right.    So after a very quick sort of into to my crazy life here are my questions...   How do i deal with him...I tried talking to him both in anger and calmly in diffrent situations and nothing works. I say... I need you to be a little more attentive to me and the kids and try to help me out a bit...I even went as far as saying that at times i felt like a single mom ( i was just being honest) His replies are always short...ok well i'll try to change some things around. But nothing changes. I try to plan thing in advance with him but he is too spontanious and hates to plan things out but when his friends plan things out with him its all good. like this weekend for example...we have barely any money right now and he took 300$ to go car racing for the weekend!!!    I get mad and jelouse that he can have the liberty to go out whenever he wants to. Is that wrong?    I'm so frusterated and i don't know what to do. I just wish he would understand at least a little and try to be home a little more and help out a bit and actually act like i mean something to him.    Also the verbal abuse has to stop...i told him a million times but he cant get it out of his system :-( It's like a dirty habbit...i hate it though and i brings me down alot.    Also he smokes in the house and we have kids...I tell him all the time to go out side but he doesnt do it...or he gets mad and kicks something...He needs anger mannegment classes but he wont ever admit it. When he smokes i go into a room with the kids and later make him open all the windows...I know that the smoke stays in the air though but i don't know what else to do other then plead him no t to do it...I kicked him out once...and broke his ciggarettes 2x...he thinks i'm crazy. I guess i over reacted but i couldnt belive he was smoking in front of his kids...again this takes me back to his up bringing and i realize that his family did the same with him and it was never an issue!    Besides all the negative, He is a deacent man...and i obviously love him or i would be long gone. He'

20090306221022AA3jP5X	Family & Relationships;Family	Disgusting Asshole Father?	Basically my mom has been sick for a long time and couldn;t be intimate with my dad... she always felt guilty but it is not her fault she is weak and sick.      My father is a pretentious asshole who always acted smarter/better than thou with his meditation and high-status job.      Now i find out he has been cheating on my mom with hookers and so does my mom know...but she still loves him. He shows literally no remorse. He doesn;t know that I know so I have to try to put up with his joking and paling around with me... it is so hard to put up with that cowardly cockroach scum!!!       I wish he would just leave me and my mom alone... i would rather be poor than have my mom suffer...she already hates/blames herself... she started to cry today...i wish he would die.      Can i hate him? Should she leave him? they've been married for 20 years and until now i never would have known he was such a pig. He even told my mom, "well i have extra money so this way no one gets her and i can have fun"       what a douche...i hate him with all my being for what he is doing to my poor, sick, depressed mother who was even sexually abused as a child      should she leave him????

20090306222914AAEvM0x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have some love or x love question and need someone with experience to answer ?	Ok I dated my high school sweet heart for five years till about a month ago. AWe would alwasy have problems fights and what not but always get back ,,,,,well about a month and a half ago we took a trip to mazatlan mexico to visit her family acompanied by her parents and family members. We had a blast there she showed extreme love and care for me throught out the vacation but as soon as we got back we began to fight again i was here for about a week when she broke up with me and said everything was over over a stupid fight that I was jealous. It was regarding not trusting her she even changed her number just a week after returning from Mexico. I got advice to give her time so I went to visit family members up in northern california for two weeks I tried calling her but the calls would never reach her noone in her family would give her the phone. I was due to come back on a tuesday and the sunday before that tuesday i got a call from my sister telling me she had left with another guy....she ran away from home didnt tell her parents anything (and this is a very conservative family that expects the daughters to leave the house married) and takes off to live with her x before me a x that was with her before I dated her. I know something was not right in the relationship in the last couple months but she covered it up so well in the vacation. As A matter of fact we had our wedding date set for nov 7 of 09 we had a house of my dad that was going to be rented out and we were also picking colors of the house and furniture that week we broke up. My question is can some one act like this with a person and have other plans...? She was more into getting everything ready for the house than I was and all of a sudden she leaves with someone else. Can anyone please give me there opinion of what do you think happend and also what can I do to move one and not think of her all day long its been 1 month since she left her house my sister goes to medical school for nursing with her but I have never seen her since I left up north. I dont know if this matters but her new man is short stubby and is a heavy drinker smoker of marijuana and cocaine user has no job and lives off his parents drug dealing money has no future and is pretty much a low life according to all her friends. What Do you guys think of this problem how can I resolve it and how can I forget her. Another thing her closedt cousin is a good friend of mine and we still ahng out Is That bad thing according to my sister they always text each other in school ( her and my good friend her cousin) and apparently talk about alot of things dont know if hes giving her info or not. Is it that easy to forget someone like she did ? I am so Confused !!!!!!!!!!
20090306222915AAQPk0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't understand him?	I met this guy online and he ended up living not to far from me. We've been friends ever since, actually for about three years now. Things went from hanging out and watching a movie  now and then to getting alot closer.... The first time we slept together I ended up bleeding and he completely freaked out. I found out later that I had a cyst that caused the bleeing. I explained it to him and he seemed very understanding but started to distanced himself. About two months later he said he wanted to see me again but between our schedules it just never happened. Last week he finally came over. We spent hours talking. He was very sweet  and things started to heat up but I was a bit hesitant because of my last experience with him. He ask me what was wrong and I told him what I was worried about. He apologized and said that what happened was so unexpected and that if I didn't want to be with him he would respect that choice. So, we kept talking and he was so sweet and charming that I couldn't resist. The sex was great and he hung around for a while afterwards. After that night we've talked but to me he seems distant again. The other night I tried to IM him and he never replied and logged off. I'm just a bit confused. Any opinions on this thanks.

20090306223923AAP62mu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My X-Husband Has Custody of our kids. He Ran The state with them? What Do I do?	My X-Husband Has Custody of our kids. He Ran The state with them? What Do I do?   FL DFACS called me and asked me if i new where my X is with our kids that they were on the way to go pick up our children because he has been failing his drug test. i had informed that i had received a call 3 days prior they were in a u-haul in Ga and that was the last i heard he wouldn't give an address. they have informed since he is no longer in Florida that there is nothing they can do except verify he is in Ga and transfer the case, Ga has contacted me.and has informed he is cooperating in a drug treatment program. and that my kids are doing well. except. that doesn't make me comfortable. since i don't drive i live 1,000 miles away from my kids. And he will not cooperate on visitation. i pay 535.00 a month in child SUPPORT and have no clue when i will see my kids i can't afford a lawyer and when i call them i get the answer it isn't there jurisdiction. i have even contacted Fl child support to submit the changes in my income and a letter stating he has moved out of florida that we need a modification done. and i just got a letter back stating it is no longer there jurisdiction to make any changes. What do i do..I feel i am in a battle and my heart breaks seeing all my money go to a drug user and not knowing when i will see my kids,Any Ideas will be appreciated,      Additional Details   the Reason Why i don't have the kids. Is because it was my Decision to leave him. I got tired of the arguing and my daughter putting her hands over her ears and crying for us to stop fighting it broke my heart and with my post partum after haveing my son the only thought was i needed to leave and get on my feet. I have no family they are all dead. or choose not to help because they are afraid of me turning them in for there drug use. Hope that answers one Question another qustion was aking who said my kids were ok. It was The Case in GA DFACS, I live in Iowa that is where i reside and hane lived stablely for 4 yrs. I work at walgreens as a Pharmacy Tech and a Beauty advisor, i can't quit paying child support they take it right out of my check and i have looked for layers in florida and iowa it is the same anser from everyone that it is no longer there juristiction      People say that my money.child support that our kids deserve a good chunk do i know forsure the kids are getting the money when it is odvious my kids aren't getting it if he is using the checks he recieves to buy drugs. And even if he isn't using my money he is using his money for wich after his money is spent my money replaces it so he can pay his bills. So its a one hand washes the other. if he was to use his money to pay his bills like he is suppose to and my money to the kids i wouldn't be typing this up asking questions. And i would have a lawyer if i qualified for legal aide ot could even find one that doesn't say (it isn't in our Juristiction)...

I'm not saying all girls. but its like with some girls they don't talk to you or give you the time of day. For example awhile back I had gotten a D&G bag as a gift and some girls would try to start conversations with me. It just felt so fake.       I didn't pursue friendships with these girls, I stayed true to my friends but its like geez. I want people to like me for the real me and not because I have nice things, and no I don't make it a point to show off nice things. This happened one time that I got it as a gift. I don't have the financial means to buy name brands all the time.

We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      This Year:      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop one day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.       Today I passed by her two different times and both times 2 different guys had there arms around her. Should I just give up on her

Someone pointed out to me it's probably cuz they're the only girls in their families and are used to being doted on, where I'm not in my fam, and I'm used to compromising and being the giver.   I feel like I've done so much for them, but they haven't quite returned the favor in friendship. One's getting married and it's both their current obsession naturally, but I'm hurt and tiffed that I only get contacted to fork over the moola, yet they can't even remember my bday, or even include me in the fun parts of planning together.  I've talked w/them about how I felt a yr ago, but they really haven't changed.  I've been thru a lot and they weren't there for me.  I've forgiven them and tried to accept them as they are, and also cuz it's just really hard to make new friends at this stage in life.  Any advice?

My mom got remarried when I was 2, and I've always thought of him (her new husband) as my real dad and called him dad.  But a friend of mine thinks it's weird that I don't call my step dad by his first name.  She thinks it's wrong to since my real dad is still alive and involved in my life.  She even said it's disrespectful to my real dad.  Do you think I'm in the wrong?  He's the one that has been a real father to me throughout my life.

I have a lovely son and nice husband but he is so much devoted to his parents that he can not get seperately from his parents what ever be the reason till they are alive. I am a successful working women always been able to manage things and be successful but politcs from mother in law and then my devarani (sister in law). I have been trying hard to ignore all their dirty stuff doing all my duties. Somehow to attain peace of mind. Life is beautiful if i minus MIL and SIL politcs from my life but the isuse now is that now they both have team up. They behave as one. Work in the kitchen like mother daughter and play tricks against me to show as if they are bossy to me. nag in my work and show mistakes. I had very bad dispute when my SIL tried to act bossy I responded her in the same tone but all that is just spoiled the family atomosphere and everyone is annoyed iwth me. I am so successful at work but then my family is always weakening me. I am fed up of my sob stories as I am not that kind of person. Also tried to be thick skin but then now my MIL and SIL started playing new tricks that BOTHER me more and one can not avoid. my husband is upset and looks to be a helpless man. I feel like ending my life...or just run away but i can't leave my son nor my husband nor this home. how should i behave at home not to loose my peace of mind. My MIL and SIL are happy and behave like a happy family without us they do all this to show we are so happy I am the ODD one out my sil is not working but a housewife so is my MIL....

20090306233048AAyAWHC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This girl is AMAZING!!!  She is the first one to not play games with me.  How would I keep her?	I asked her to hang out Friday night. We ended up walking for 2 hours in New York City at 10pm, on random streets. The whole time we were just going back and forth with the teasing.      Anyhow, we get along amazingly well. She's a really different girl too - no game playing at all! Except for one time when she immediately introduced herself to a passing hot guy and talked to him for 10 minutes while shooting me glances (I totally understand hahaha.) But she didn't go further and while we left, she almost completely ignored him. I thought that was the coolest thing.      It was not one of those "okay, lets have a dinner and a movie" dates. We just hung out for 3-4 hours and then grabbed some food. Didn't feel like a date at all. Seriously, the way we talked, it was like we were already girlfriend/boyfriend. None of this "will you call me again?" stuff. We've only known each other for 2 weeks!      But since this isn't the normal dating pace, how should I do this? I see her in class Monday - Do I hang out with her Monday night, or wait till next weekend? She seems waaaaaaaay too into me. She doesn't seem like a game-playing girl; If I go slow, she might lose interest - if I move too fast, again she might lose interest. In my case, what should I do? Obviously I'm not going to hang out with her every day before we're even official!

20090306231849AAUhabi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marrying young, chances of divorce?	My husband and I got married "young." I was 18 and he was 20. We've been married for 2 1/2 years now, he was deployed to Iraq for half of that. I was thinking in my silent five seconds in the shower today (we have a 16 month old daughter.) In 50 years, will we still be married. I know the divorce rate is astonishing among young couples. I've always  been more mature than others my age, most days I feel 40. But I do miss not being young, and carefree. I'm worried this will lead to divorce. It's a scary fact, we are both christan, and firmly believe in God, and the promise we made to God. We are still in love with one another. I'm just wondering in 10, 20, or 30 years will I regret getting married so young and yearn for a divorce?

Is it just me? or sometimes you don't feel comfortable around some people?   I met my brother's friend for the first time, and though he did nothing wrong, I found myself trying to avoid him. Thankfully I did not show this to him, and managed somehow to finish the conversation normally, but there was something wrong and the problem is I can't even know what is it...       I just have a feeling that he is selfish and just want to make use of anyone who can manage to get something from. I know it is crazy and I know I can't give such judgment after a five minutes talk. Anyway, I didn't want to talk to him, but I forced myself so as not to make problems to my brother...      so is this normal? do you have such feeling or impressions about people? and do you trust your feelings? and what would you do if you felt uncomfortable around someone this way?      sorry for the crazy question...      and thanks for any answer
20090307000525AAnFy75	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do I do? I don't know anymore.?	My parents have been in court to get devorsed since I was five or six, I am eleven now.      I don't know who to believe anymore. My mom and my dad both have a girlfriend/boyfriend.      My mom calls my dad's girlfriend a bimbo. Says my dad spends all his money on himself and her, that;s why they're still in court, because he doesn't give her enough money you support us. I think she is nice to me, so I don't get why my mom calls her that. But my mom yells at me for not understanding. She has cursed me beofre. She also says my dad drinks and is not responsible.      My dad denies it, but he can't spend ANY time with me without having HER around. I really don't trust either of my parents.       I don't ever know what to do and who to believe. My family is crazy. My brother is no help either. He is so private and secretive and... well... a teenager.            I blacked out all my childhood memories up until/before the age of 10 I think. The one memory I remember isn't even full! It's my parents screaming at eachother in the kitchen:   Dad: "Be quiet! Alana is freeking out!"   Mom: "I am NOT going to be quiet Bruce! Do you understand what you have done?!?!!!"   Dad: "Lower your voice!"   Mom: "You are so stupid! You never got any of this!"      I see myself crying on the bottom stair step, I look like I might be 5 or 6. I hear my brother yelling too, but I can't work out the words. That is how I developed my horrible fear of yelling/screaming. And what scares me the most is I don't remember ANYTHING else of my past. Just that small portion if a memory.      On top of that I can't talk to anyone about anything. I have flashbacks as well, and they are SO real! And I get mad and sad over so much stupid stuff, because in my mind it reminds me of something else, but I never know what. And then I need to cut myself (i am not emo. I swear.) so that I can concentrate on that pain instead, because it hurts less.   I have been having anxiety attacks too lately. More and more lately. All this just started about a year ago, and it gets worse each day. I want to kill myself sometimes, that's how bad it is. I want the pain to stop! I am crying right now just talking about it!   I know this is bad. I know I have problems. I know I am probably going crazy. I don't need you to tell me that. What I do need you to tell me i what to do!

20090227035516AA7M3RS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've fallen in love with my best friend- what should I do?	I’m a guy who has just realised that I’m madly in love with my best friend, but I think she is way too good for a guy like me, and I don't know what kind of love it is- she is the one person I can open up to and I feel happy and at peace and not as depressed around her. I don’t know if she likes me but she seemed jealous of my ex and dropped me very subtle hints that the feeling are mutual, if we did go out, would things be awkward between us- we are really close? Also I’m not sure if her and her ex got back together or not because they only recently broke up. She is the most important girl in the world to me and would not hesitate to give my life to save hers. Another thing, is it a problem that she's a year older than me? She is a lot more experienced than me but does that matter? Please help; I have no idea what to do?? I would never want to hurt her and would murder anybody that tried to. Any ideas what I should do?
20090306233047AAkh7rn	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship question did i do the right thing?	i had a friend who lived next door, she is 21yrs and i am 27yrs we used to click very well but until lately we havent until i found out how she really thinks of me which i dont think is a true friend i think its more negative behaviour. non of my other mates act like that they just let me get on with what i want in life and our there no matter what even though we dont talk or text everyday. but they are around doing there things in life as well. this friend of mine was saying that if they dont give opinions on what i do and stuff then they are not close friends so i replied she doesnt know them yet she cant judge how i relate to every single person, she even had the cheek to say that my business was her business which to be honest its not.   this whole arguement started because i have a bf who lives in italy and we are very happy together been so for the last 2yrs.      but i recently found out from a friend of hers how she really feels bout what i do in my life, she had said these things:-   *she doesnt want me to get hurt like my ex did to me and left me in alot of debt she feels my current bf will do the same and that he is only coming for a visa then he leave me. when she has never met him, and doesnt know him at all.   of course every couple is going to have arguements but its not for friends to involve themselves but i couldnt understand why she wud hold on to those bad points and use it against us.    a true friend in my opinion just listens and advises how to deal with situation and let you get on with it, not making you do what they want you to do its like they are trying to control you.   i just found this friendship had to come to an end as she is not independent she relys on her friends to tell her wot she should or shouldnt do, she always talked behind my back to the other friend and the other friend used to come and tell me, she always has something negative to say against my current bf and what ever i am doing, she even could resolve the arugment face to face we had to talk on msn and then she puts all the blame on me and wont admit some fault and also wants time for us to adjust so basically prolonging the arguement, she only knew me when her friends were not available or when she wanted something just coz i wudnt go out clubbing and do the things she wanted she wud push me aside so i decided the friendship had to break up and i told her and she started to get abit angry with me constantly texting me so now i am just ignoring her but she knows i dont want to be friends with her no more.      so did i do the right thing as i thought it was for the best why continue a friendship when the friend wants to:-   *prolong the arguement   *always make out she is the vicitim   *talk behind my back   *always think negatively of me   *use me when they want   * act childish all the time and making me always be the one to back down.   we havent been close for ages she even told me because of the text i sent her wanting to break the friendship up she doesnt consider me a close friend no more and that we are not going to tell each other stuff no more and just be a hi and bye friendship but obviously to me that is a fake friendship its better to not be friends she always told me to be honest when we had a problem and when i did be honest she tried to turn it around like i was the one to blame and that she has done nothing wrong, and i was fed up of the same constant behaviour.

20090227063648AAzye3j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he always blame me for everything?	My boyfriend has been sick with food poisoning.  He doesn't feel good, and he has a rough life at home.  The other day, he told me that he was too sick to see me.  He wouldn't answer my calls, and he texted me saying it was because he was busy working with his mom on a washer and dryer (which bothered me because he's lifting machinery yet he's too sick to see me?).        Since, I made sure that he wasn't bothered with me.  Made sure that he wants to be with me.  He says he's positive and that he just feels bad.  I do believe this, because he has always been really self centered and mean when he feels like it (we've dated for 5 years).      Last night, we were on the phone and he was upset about his dad.  He said he hadn't seen his mom in a long time and she wanted to take him to the doctor but that his dad wouldn't let her.  I tried not to accuse, but said "I thought you saw her yesterday to help her with the washer?"  Then, he started saying I was starting my s*** again and more or less hung up on me and turned his phone off because his story wasn't adding up to me.      I'm so tired of walking on eggshells.  I know he's sick and upset but that doesn't give an excuse for his story not to add up.  He may have just been exaggerating when saying that he hadn't seen her in forever or maybe he lied to me.  Either way, how is it my fault?  I tip toe all the time to avoid his tantrums.  I try to be the perfect girl constantly.  I wish there was something I could do to make him be nice more often because then I'd know there's actually hope...   I'm tired of constantly analyzing things to figure out what I've done.  To him, it's always my fault.  I'm always in the wrong.  No matter what..
20090307004450AAj1w6n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Tired of being a "nice" person?	All I ever am is nice to people, even if I don't particularly agree with you or even if I flat out don't like you I still try to be nice. I find that nice guys really do finish last. I mean I could be the nicest person in a room of people and yet everyone gravitates toward people who are complete *****. I'm just going to start telling people who try and talk to me "go %#@& yourself...get away from me" then perhaps more people would think "omg what a cool guy...I need to talk to him more!". What do you think?

20090306233934AAmZbnT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I make my gift to the girlfriend more personal?	It's my girlfriend and my 1st anniversary together, and I was wondering what I should do. I've asked this question before, but I'm still not sure about it. It feels like something is missing, and I sadly don't have any friends who are girls so this is especially difficult for me.      So what I was planning to do was this. Get a bag to put the gifts in. The bag isn't really the main focus but I don't know any other alternatives.   But I want to get this bag in black, people suggested Juicy Couture because apparently it's a favourite amongst 16 year old girls but my girlfriend like simple and classic stuff:    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3019611?Cate...       -And inside it, I want to put Chanel no. 5 perfume. I was thinking Coco Mademoiselle or Chanel Chance, but again, my girlfriend loves the whole classic, vintage idea so the lady at the perfume counter at Saks Fifth Avenue said Chanel no. 5 would be good.      -Then the DVD of the first film we watched together, and DVD of her favourite film(she doesn't have a copy)      -A box of Godiva chocolates      I just feel like something is missing, especially since people have been telling me that my ideas seem "materialistic and impersonal".   I am not trying to "buy" her love either. I just thought that's what girls like... and I based it on her style. How can I make my gift more personal? No suggestions about where to take her on a date please. I've already got that down. It just it feels incomplete the gifts I mean.

Next year I am going to a whole new school. Do you think I can start meeting new people? The problem is, I am kinda shy and when I push myself to say something, it comes out sounding stupid or cheesy. My friend says I should just stay shy because you should not change yourself for guys. Is she right???      If you have read my other questions, you will know that i have had this crush on this guy who is also shy, and I wanted to ask him out, but I don't even know how. He doesn't know me. Wouldn't it be weird if a complete stranger asks you to the movies?

20090227064006AAqaHkR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I leave him or am "sick" and need to get help?	I've been dating someone for 2 and a half years he is 7 years older then I am.when I met him he just got off a seven year relationship so our relationship wasn't the best in the beginning. Then I find out he was cheating on me n lying to me so I turned in to this really jealous person which I never showed it as much as I do now n now bc of his lies I tend to be more on his back about things like check stuff.  Recently he opened up a myspace page n he never told me about till one day when I found him on it. I no I shouldn't make any big deals about his page but it really bothered me that we have been dating so long that he can't even tell me things like that he opened his own page up. When I saw his page he already added all these girls except for me and in his pictures he had pictures of him and he put up a picture of one girl but not any up of us two. So when I asked him how come u can put up a picture up of one of your girl friends but not of us two he would say why do you care it's mine. Then one day I got onto his page and thought it would be cute to put pics up of us when he saw that he got furious yelled at me n took them down immideately but still kept his girl friends pic up there. Then I saw that he was sending all his friends including that girl some cool graphics saying hello n all that cute stuff but to me he can't send me not even one comment. Well this all leads to leads to my main point or main question. The other day we were talking on the phone me and my boyfriend and he called me her name the girl he has a picture up on myspace of) I got really upset so then yesteday I asked him if he could take her off his top n her pic off bc to me it's almost as if she were more important then me but he yelled again n said no I'm not going to do what you ask for. The only reasoned I said it is bc it's disturbing when someone you love calls you someone elses name has the nerve to put a pic up of that same girl n have time to write to her on myspace but can't even call me text me or myspace me...so he said that I'm crazy I'm " sick" and that I need mental help. So I don't no wat to do
20090227064101AAdXIQB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the worst situation you've been in with 2 friends?	or more whatever
20090227063027AARS8mS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would I be wrong if I never EVER spoke to him again?	--5yrs ago was in a relationship with a guy riding the biggest emotional rollercoaster of my life.  I was innocent & naive; he was the big bad wolf (at the time I had no idea) Best thing that happened = I emerged a strong woman & eventually moved on.   --2 yrs ago he began "his quest to track me down," calling everyone & everywhere I'd been.  When I found out I did not return calls to# left w/frend(did not want to revisit the pain); however, when he from several states away ended up in my hometown (he drove up) I agreed to go to dinner with him =AWKWARD + he told me that he now has children but still unmarried and ready to be intimate that night. I politely (always trying to be nice) left him at the restaurant.   --Over the past year he contacted me again sincerely asking for only a friendship.  I agreed.  We had several pleasant phone conversations (except for 1night when in his drunken state he called yelling and cursing and telling me he loved me at the same time) But he HAD matured.  We were actually friends!  For months he asked me to visit, but I declined. 4 months later I said yes.  He paid for the ticket.  I flew out.   --What did we do?  Nothing. Day 1 picked me up from airport. Told me that he had to work that day (not mentioned before).  Cooked me breakfast and left me in apt. alone w/ no entertainment (no books, no TV, computer locked down)  He called & came by periodically to make sure I didn't leave, but where would I go?  The place was ducked off several miles away from civilization.  The only place he took me that day was to WALMART to get milk.  Next day I told him I had to do something or I would go crazy after being cooped up. He said OK, told me to get dressed and left while I was in the bathroom.  When he came back we were to go to the movies and mall.  Went to the mall where he rushed me out after 30min. He made a point to hug or get close to me only when other guys were looking (though he said that we shouldn't get attchdto one another=DUH he didn't have to tell me that) and if we weren't in one another's vicinity and aguy approached me, he would suddenly appear right beside me.  After the mall we drove around for 2hrs looking for a barber for him and when we found 1 he left me in his car for 2 1/2 hrs while he got a cut.  We had dinner and then he informed me that he would be leaving early in the morning for a flight back to his mother's (I confirmed that this was true) but his flight was 6 hrs before mine!!  He did not want to leave me in the apt. and have me take a cab; he preferred me to wait in the airport he said. I again POLITELY asked him to drive me to an inn with a shuttle service b/c I'd spend the night there and make my way to the airport by my darn self!  So I came out of pocket for that and he stayed the night in my room! (It happened that there were 2 beds--later that night he asked me to get into his and I NOT POLITELY told him hell no) He left early   --Later in the week I texted him to thank him for whatever nice gestures he made and I haven't called him since.  He has called me but I have not answered.  SOOOO  would I be wrong if I never spoke to him again?  I mean it. My friends tell me not to burn bridges but that bridge has already exploded.
20090306234418AAnU7d4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did my best friend make the right choice?	My best friend has been casually seeing this guy for about 8 months. She recently got sick and he accused her of being pregnant, which is impossible since she can't have kids because she has no ovaries (which he knows this). When she told him that he knew she wasn't, his reaction was (and I quote) "good because if you were I'd throw you in my truck and make you have an abortion". I think this guy was super insensitive to say this. My best friend was really upset because he said something like that to her knowing she can't have kids but would love to. So now she won't date the guy anymore (they work at the same place so she still technically sees him, but it's not like it used to be) and he's all upset because she won't date him anymore. Was she right? I agree with her but I think it would help to let her know that others agree (or maybe disagree and why) also. She feels bad but I don't want her too because that was the most heartbreaking thing I think a guy who claims to care (or any guy really) could say to a woman in her situation. Thanks

20090306234825AATmUtb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Defining friend from foe?	OK so I'm pretty upset over this:   I join a group of friends and we go bar hopping. The leader of this group is my fraternity brother's girlfriend who's smashed because she turned 21 a few days ago. We all walk to the 3rd bar and I split off from them because I know another girl there who I haven't talked to in a year. I spend some extra time talking to her and it turns out that the group I was with went to the 4th bar already. So I call my frat bro and he tells me that he tried looking for me but didn't see me, so they left.   I called him back and they said where they were so I had to walk over to meet up again.      So here's my case - still my close friend or DOUCHE-BAG? Should I consider myself an outsider and stay away from them for the rest of my life?

20090307001713AAgM7RR	Family & Relationships;Friends	My ex best friend just told me he loved me. What should I do?	Okay about a year I was in love with this guy, that use to be my best friend. So it took me so long to get over him. He was always having all these different relationship problems with all these different girls and when ever I use to see him, I felt so miserable. But then I met this guy, and he was funny and sweet and made me smile which was a new thing. And I finally felt better. So I started dating him. And it was great.    Until my ex best friend told me he loved me. And suddenly I felt crap again. I kept telling him he really didn't and that he just needed another drama in his life. And he got so angry. So I'm still dating my boyfriend, and he still makes me really happy. It's just when I see my ex best friends, he looks so upset and angry! I don't know what to do. Please help me!

20090227063746AAk1D9p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he being like this...?	Ok, so there's this guy that I like... and he's like my best friend. He used to tell me everything and we would get along really well and have a lot of fun together, and then he stopped telling me who he liked, so all of my friends told me that he liked me, but neither of us said anything but we kept being really good friends. Then one day we have two new twins in our class. And suddenly it's like I don't even exist, he's with them 24/7, and hardly even wants to talk to me anymore. Like one day we were running laps and he brought his iPod, and I asked him if I could use it since girls and boys run at different times. He said yes, but wen P.E. time came, he gave it to one of the twins instead. I know that I'm probably a little jelous, but I'm also mad, why is he being so stupid?      And we're 14 by the way.

There's 2 of them who are sort of showing interest. WOULD YOU DO THIS IF YOU LIKED A GIRL??      1. If he picks you up and holds you in the air until you punch him, is he trying to scare you or is he showing interest?      2. He likes to poke you and when you turn around he says it wasn't him, smirks, and laughs.      3. He studies with you and lays over the books (attention or annoyance)      4.

They're both best friends, the funniest guys in school, sarcastic, smart, both hate the other girls, and they are both really nice guys!

20090306233252AAyN5lU	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with overly sensitive friend?	I have a friend who has been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and is overly sensitive. We are both in our junior year of high school.  The friend tends to gets angry over very minor incidents, like someone gently teasing her or not agreeing with her opinion. I have tried to take her disorder into account and sympathize with her because I value the friendship we have. Recently, however, her behavior has been getting on my nerves. In chemistry class, no one at our table can finish their work because she won't stop talking to us. Whenever I try to explain a concept to her, she replies with a flat "...what" every time I finish a sentence. Naturally, this grates on my nerves; when I let signs of frustration slip through in my voice, she bursts into tears and claims I'm "yelling" at her. Any advice on what I should do?  I'm afraid to confront her about anything because I know I'll make her cry.
20090306231652AA0At4o	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Lost and Lonesome : Friend Advice?	Currently, I am on exchange at a school in Auckland, New Zealand.   I am having a horrible time finding friends because the school is VERY cliquey. Therefore, the only people I have been able to hang out with during lunch without being socially shunned, or stared and and then ignored, is the group of friends that my host sister hangs around.      I do not have much of a problem with this people, but I have a hard time finding things to talk about at lunch and break times (Important note: I am an EXTREMELY shy person). And sometimes I feel like they really rather not have me around in the group - like I am some kind of burden or kid that must be looked after, even though I am the same age as them.      I do have many different classes where there have been some people who have been very polite twoards me. However, I clash with most of the people here, because it is NZ and the drinking age is lower, EVERYONE always talks about drinking and partying - which really are not my thing.       Now, there is this one girl in my English class who I think seems like a pretty nice person, but is always involved in sports. She is kind of quiet but hangs around with some of the people who have been really rude to me while I have been here.      I would like to become friends with her, or at least get to know her, but I do not know if it is the best idea. I only have English class with her, by the way.      What would you do in my situation? I feel odd asking someone to hang out around here because all they do is drink, and if I tell them that I do not drink, or party (I hate dancing) I think they will look down on me. Do you think I should just drop it and bear out the rest of the trip? Or if I do talk to this girl, what exactly do you think I should say?      Thank you for all of your help.
20090307001015AA6jeQ6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need a man's answer.?	I recently asked a question about my current problem with my husband. It came to my mind to ask this: While I was staying in a hotel and discussing things with my husband (finances and our daughter) we also talked about us. He told me that he does love me but he wants a divorce. He also told me this, "In 6 months or 1 year you'll find someone else and forget about me but they'll never love you the way I do and they'll never make you feel the same love that I make you feel." He didn't say this in a mocking way but almost in a sad way. Can someone please explain because my husband has my head screwed up so much right now. Also my previous question might give some insight to the situation.
20090306225055AA3hLH1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why Are People So Mean?	I know i shouldn't let things get to me. I have so much Going on and i feel i am on a loosing battle with my whole life. And when i feel like that i just break down to a Boiling point where every littl ething bothers me.   The other day I had a younf femal come into a store i was working at. She must have been around 18 at least real close maybe young. She came in with her bad attitude and asked for a pack of Cigerets. I asked for Her ID, She said she didn't have it but said I ID'd her the other day. I had informed if she didn't have her ID that i cant sell her her cigertes that i didn't remeber her and i don't know her so i can't sell them. She then started Cursing and i asked her with kindness to please calm down and quit with the perfanity i am only obey the law for tobaco sells. She then told be to ring up her F'ing pop i told her i will be happy to  she started cursing keep in mind i ahd already asked her to stop currising and she continued to carry on. I told her That she can leave my register and but her Pop at another one or she can leave the store.. she chose to leave the store all while calling me a F'ing bucktooth B&*C%... And said i should be fired.... i then told her she needs to leave again and told her to take her attitude else where it isn't welcome here...   I am wrong to refuse her the sale of her cig....Especialy if she looked maybe at the age of 18,, But yet acted like a rebelious 14 year old that need to be whiped and have her mouth washed out with soap.   I think the Part that upset me the most was the Bucktooth part..   Then today although this child was baby 6 if that asked me why my teet are so funny looking.. I kindly told him it was because everyone is made diferently and i was formed from a special mold...   Where in al actuality in my mind i just wanted to go in the Bathroom and cry...   I am so upset my blood preasure is sky rocketed i can't see straight, and my eyes can hardly focus.    I just wish i new Why people have to point out people differnce wether it be someone to tall or skiiny fat or short buckteeth or no teet and just except people for who they are an pick out a feature in the person that is good compliment them make them feel better instead of make people feel like crap...   What is weird was becuase of yesterdays cigeret girl today i dressed up to make my self feel better about myself and yet though a kid can point that same feature that mde me feel bad and just tear me up on the outside to make me feel no matter how i dress or do myelf up to look good i will always be an ugly buck tooth.   I am sorry to be negative. I know God has made me this way for a reson. I just wish poeple could just accept me for my personality and abilities and not for what i look like.   I know i am rambling and i am going to close with this thought,   I know it is in the Scripture of the bible... Judge and Yee shall be Judged. Or it is of some nature like that.
20090306232552AADk76n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship Confusion?	I have a friend that I have known for 5 years but we don't see each other very often. Off and on I knew that i was attracted to her and judging by our multiple times almost kissing only to be interrupted by an outside source i would say she was attracted to me. Well i have since asked her and she said she likes me alot but does not want to date me yet because she is young and there is a lot she wants to experience before she gets with me because she said she wants me to be her last boyfriend (husband) but she has a habit of avoiding me sometimes and she says its because she doesn't want to take things too far with me now and do something stupid that could mess us up forever. I can respect that cause i also went through that phase in my life. But I am so ready to be with her, I would marry her right now. So at this moment i want no other girl but her. Should i wait on her and not date anyone else? i feel like if I do so then im being untrue to her but i know she is. Am i stupid for waiting.? (please no rudeness)

20090306225017AAkuaEf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is She Interested in Me?? Please Help!!?	EDIT: I just found out she has a boyfriend...but read this and you'll see why I'm confused...      I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question. Obviously, to me, this question is very important, and I would like your opinion. (Note; I'm a college student)      So I met this girl at school in the cafeteria. I have a bad/good habit of walking up to people and starting random conversations. This conversation I started was somewhat relevant because I mentioned event that was happening on campus and was wondering if she would go. And from there, I was able to get her name and just kind of become her acquaintence. I haven't really seen her that much during that semester, but did say hi occasionally.      This semester I joined one of the club's she is president of. I got to get to know her from one of the meetings where I spent about 2 hours making/decorating a building for the club. It was fun. I was with her and her friend, and we had some fun talk. I mentioned something about the music I listen to and how she should check it out. She subsequently sent me a message via facebook asking for some of the music, which i gave her.      Next time I saw her was at the next meeting, she thanked me for the music I gave her. I showed her another song, and she said she really liked it. When I was leaving, she asked where I was headed because she would offer me a ride back to my dorm. I declined though because I was going in the opposite direction. She also said "Thank you so much for coming today!"      I e-mailed her later that day about a charity event idea that she came up with and gave her constructive ideas about it. I recieved an e-mail back saying basically thanks for the ideas and another thanks about the music I gave her and how she really liked it.      I saw her again at the cafeteria the next day and I waved hi to her when I saw her and she was about to pay for her food but she came over to me to talk instead. She asked how I was, what I'm going to do, and how she liked the music, yet again. I said I would give her some more music and she said that sounded great and she suggested we get lunch sometime. I agreed and she asked for my number. She was giving me that nice soft smile.      So I saw her a few days later and there was an event going on that was co-hosted by the club and she suggested I go. I said maybe, but ended up going anyway. I got there and sat down and watched the movie, avoiding contact with her at all, and at the end of the movie, went down to sign the petition which was in front of the room and as I was signing, she came next to me and started talking to me. The usual questions (What's up, Where you going after, etc) and then we talked abit about how our week is almost over and spring break is around the corner. She said she was disappointed that we couldnt hangout before break and that she was going back to her home for break and I found out she lived in the same state as me, so I suggested we get together over break. She thought it was a good idea and agreed. I also mentioned something about my exam I had in two days also.      I txt'd her the next day telling her that if i dont see her before she leaves, i hope she has a safe trip back and ill call her to hangout over break. She replied like 7 hrs later and said Thanks for coming [to the movie] last night! And that she thinks it would be fun if we could get together over break. And to ''stay in touch and goodluck on my midterm tomorrow''.      This week, I've seen her alot (practically everyday) in random times and places. Like today, I was walking to the gym and happened to see her on the way there. I was looking at her to see if it was indeed her and then looked away and looked back again and saw she was looking at me.      This may also seem farfetched, but I also noticed that the club membership list (which she typed up) had my name on it right next to hers (note: there are 60+ names on that list).      Do you think she is just extremely nice or interested? She also is holding hands in her fb pic, but she never mentioned it at all to me. From the signs above, what do you think?      Note: She also has not made any mention of a bf at all.          * 5 hours ago       * - 4 days left to answer.      Additional Details   I found out how she had a boyfriend because I read a comment on her facebook from one of her friends.      4 hours ago

20090306230523AAc7oFe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she just a flirt or does she like me?	Well I like this girl and she's really popular in my school. She is the captain of the JV dance team. She's a sophomore and I'm a Junior and we talk a lot since she's in my class and my brother (who's mentally challenged) annoys her during lunch so I kinda help her with getting him away.       I don't know if she likes me however. She kinda seems to make excuses to talk to me. During lunch (if my brother doens't bother her) she sits by her friend and after lunch is over she comes over to me and my friends and we talk. During class it seems like she is always looking back at me and she plays with her hair a lot. When I talk to my friend that's a girl in front of me, she seems to kinda interrupt us, like she is jealous. But I'm unsure of that.      It seems tho that she flirts with a lot of the guys. So I don't know if she likes me or what.      Also Prom is coming up and I was going to probably ask her to Prom, but I'm just unsure on what to do....

20090306230852AA5MIwS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This question is Sex related.?	I just had my first baby about 11 months ago (so i have an 11 month old daughter)      My bf wants another baby, and doesn't care if he knocked me up again.   But i don't want one and i'm not intreasted in having anymore, as i don't have that "i want baby feeling" . That feeling is not there for me, i find it hard enough with just the one. And i do love my "Me" time.       But my bf wants to have a son, and a playmate for our daughter.      It's been nearly 12 months since i've had unprotected sex with my bf, i've been making him use condoms ever since after my daughters birth.      I can't go on the pill as i'm breast feeding, and i've tried the "mimi pill" (for about 1 month) that is designed for women who breast feed, but i had really bad side effects with that (which was it was making me get my period every week, instead of every month) so i stoped taking that and have made my bf use condoms ever since.       i know i should know better, but i've never ever tried this, so i'm going to tell you in details what STUPID thing i did.   For the first time in almost 12 months i let my bf have unprotected sex with me, but i made him pull out before he cums. Which he did.   (that is something i'm not making a habbit)   (i let him do this because i know how much he's hating the condoms)      It is safe not to get pregnant doing it this way?   or can i get pregnant by letting him do this?      please some advice, or please tell me if this is safe      thank you for your answers!!

20090306231430AAE9A2C	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I give my anniversary gift to my Husband earlier, and at a time like this?	My Husband, and I are going to be married for six months on March the 20th.       Recently my mom, and my Husband got into a bad fight (I was included as well). My mom is very envious of our marriage because she has no one (she has no friends, she doesn't work, she's divorced, and she just has a male friend who I feel is using her). She's going through a hard time with her parents, and my Dad (who's her Ex-Husband). She goes off so often! She can be so nice, then all of the sudden she gets mad, bitter, rude, disrespect, and (pardon of my language) bitchy. It's very hard to take, and my Husband told her that he had enough of her attitude. Now, my mom hates my Husband - my Husband hates my mom. She did disrespect him, and it was just awful the fight. My Husband and I feel that she needs physiological    help.      I am an artist, so I made my Husband a very artsy, and creative gift. I made three bristol boards which consists of pictures of us in a collage. The bristol boards are conveyed as an open story book. At the last page it says "This is my eternal love story with you." Then, I made a box - inside of the box I made a paper rose on a green circular ring which represents a ring for marriage. Also, we don't need diamonds, or materialism to express how we feel.      So, basically what I want to ask you; should I give him my gift tomorrow despite it's not out anniversary? Should I wait? I'm truly anxious to give it to him already!! Please tell me what you think! I NEED HELP.
20090306231542AAIUR8J	Family & Relationships;Friends	My parents were spying on my email...?	I caught my mom reading an email I sent to a friend earlier that day. I tried to be mature about it, but it felt kind of bad because I am a good student and am overall not a bad person. Recently, I wanted a myspace, but neither of them said yes. It did make me angry when I found out about the email thing, because first of all I thought it was rude and revealed that they do not trust me. To me it's logic not to email people I have never met, but still they have monitored my email and will probably read this. They also see what websites I visit. I know parents now have to be careful about their kids internet, but I really do think they have gone to extremes. Anyone's opinion would be useful. Thank you!

So i called in another person so she could go home. and she left.      Later on that night another manager called and I told him that she left early because she had the flu.  and he said that another girl is having a party and she probably just said that to leave early.      I really like that girl, i was going to ask her out.  But now what do you think i should do?

20090306232825AA92iEb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For ISLAM only: Marriage Question?	Dear Brothers & Sister in Islam, Please enlighten me with my concern regarding my relationship with my husband.First of all i want to let you know that me and my husband came from 2 different culture, he is arab and i am asian (muslim).      My husband whenerv we have agruments he always mention the word "DIVORCE" as if he threatened me with this everytime. Not actually saying that he will divorse me... I am tired of this situation. I am only human and as it was said:      "He who believes in Allah and the Hereafter, if he witnesses any matter he should talk in good terms about it or keep quiet. Act kindly towards woman, for woman is created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its top. If you attempt to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it, its crookedness will remain there. So act kindly towards women.  (Translation of Sahih Muslim, The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah), Book 008, Number 3468)"        I have high pitch when talking this is due to some hearing complications (but not serious) and he always take this in a wrong way and telling me that i have no rights to shout at him. I have explained this to him many times times if i do something wrong he must guide me but he never listen to what i say but instead repeatly saying the mistake that he sees in me again and again.      This really hurts me and breaks my heart many times, he repeated all the time that his family is telling him that if we have a child in the future it will look asian and it will be discriminated by their society. That's why until now we don't have any child. Also, repeatedly his family is telling him that our mariage will fail one day because of the culture difference...      Wallahi i am sooo feed up right now with my marriage. I am still in the process of making everything right and in place. To prove to his family that he deserves me and that they are wrong with their hurtful assumptions.      I have asked my husband to help me learn more about islam but he told me that "there are books where you can learn on your own". He should also talk to me kindly instead of his insulting ways...      What should i do now? I am broken into pieces. I have always prayed so hard and asked Allah to make me strong and overcome this hardship but i can't take this any longer..      I know that there are still hopes for this marriage and i want this to work on...Please advice me...

20090306235344AAMIFws	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm worried about my friend...?	My best friend, Lizzie, had sex with her boyfriend the other night, and when she was at school the next day, she was limping and obviously in pain. I asked her about it and she said it was none of my business. Her boyfriend obviously hurt her, and I don't want to see that. There are a large number of things wrong with their relationship. He's too old for her(he's 17, she's 15), he's a big football player type, and I just don't think that they should be doing this. I'm worried about Lizzie, but I can't tell her to not have sex with her boyfriend. What can I do?

20090307000046AAeopPf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: Is he interested?	It's been 9 years since high school, and I recently ran into my high school crush, we exchanged numbers, and met for drinks (which lasted for 2 hours). When we first saw each other he hug hugged me (which means a BIG time pull u into him, squeeze u tight hug) We talked about everything, from high school, to family. everything. When a friend of his came by (his friend) sat with us for a little bit, and when his friend and I started talking (my high school crush) looked at his watch and said "Isn't it time for u to leave?" Which I thought nothing of, but my best friend said, him having his friend be there was his 'back up' (it has been 9 years since high school, and I was a big nerd, complete with huge glasses and poofy hair! LOL) and since he didn't need him he gave him the signal to leave. I've done that for my friends too. Also, I can NEVER, tell if a guy is flirting with me or not, I just assume that their nice. I don't know if he's into me or not. I'm actually not even sure if I'm into him in that way myself. Haven't heard from him since (been a few days) Please help me! What do u think. Was his friend his safety net? and Is he interested?
20090307000935AA2Uuqq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a casual relationship turn serious, even after a break?	I have been friends with this guy for over a year and a half, and I think he has stolen my heart.   In the beginning I was going through a rough time and he kept it casual.  I did not understand it at the time but he wanted to date me and yet have his own space.  I'm now in a better place to give it to him.   We went through a period where we did not see each other but I never stopped thinking about him.   He started to contact me a few months back, and now it's different.  He's more attentive and respectful, like trying to win me over again.  He contacts me more frequently, and we've been out on regular dates.  I get this awesome feeling, like butterflies, when I'm going to see him.  And he asked me twice if I remembered a couple of "little things" and of course I did.   His schedule is crazy because of his job, and he's contacting me less frequently.  (This is a trigger for me, but this time I did not make extra phone calls, I stayed busy with my own life.)  I've noticed he's been more open with me, and even his friends are acting really nice towards me, kind of hinting towards something.      So I'm wondering - do you think it has a chance of becoming serious, since it started casual?  Does anyone have experience or input about this?

20090227044118AAzO8Ex	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i still want him back? im confused.?	i broke up with my 3 year boyfriend because we clashed with opinions.He begged and cried that we can work things out. But i didn't listen for i'd think it would only be a cycle. We'd just fight and make up. After being cold to him and ignore him he a little bit distance himself to me.       Why when he's around I just feel like I dont love him anymore, I was cold. and   Now that I haven't heard a word from him, I kinda miss him.      Sometimes I want him to move on. Sometimes I want him to stay.
20090227044335AAxBaHP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why she keeps calling me?	Hi.There is this girl I have been seeing last 3 months. When we met first, she hid the fact that she had a boyfriend. She told me that after I have fallen in love with her. Boyfriend lives in another city only comes at weekends or sometimes she goes there. Other times she calls me over and I go. I know the whole situation is all wrong  and I tried to end it and stay away from her several times but she does not let me go, and calls me all the times. When I try to ignore her calls she goes all crazy. I have heard she cheated her boyfriends with some other guys too. She says she loves her boyfriend but does not let me go also. These days she seems like she made a desicion not to sleep with me anymore, but still keeps calling me and gets upset whem I ignore her calls. Why do you think she keeps calling me and what should I do now?

20090227050054AAUiNJ4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl acting like this?	Ok theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back at home and I think they seem really close. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I got the feeling that she liked me but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being friends but she still avoids me. She stoped sitting next to me in class and 3 days later i got a text saying she needed a while, i guess before she would sit next to me again, so my question is will she end up sitting next to me and talking with me again and why is she acting like this if were goin be friends? Oh and i even caught her stairing at me a couple of times after this whole situation happened. So why is she actin like this and what do I do about it?

20090227053958AA9uYzC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Neediness & Dependance,,,,i DESPERATLEY need help.?	Ok..so to make a long story short, I was away from my gf in an internship for about 6 months. after the fourth month, i was completely isolated from anyone including my friends and family. The only person that i was allowed to talk to was my girlfriend. I became immensely needy and the only way that i could feel any shred of happiness was when i was talking to her. She became my security blanket while i was away. Now that i've returned, the problem still persists. I always want to be around her, because its the only way that i feel good about anything. This is starting to push her away from me, and the other day she said that due to my neediness, that i no longer attract her. I NEED HELP! I don't want to become dependent on one person for all of my happiness. What can i do to make it go away?
20090227054315AAqaHmM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this guy cheap?	he never buys him self a drink his friends does, he say to me sorry I can't buy you a drink I have no money but you can have some of my drink, he never buys me a drink,instead he will be like my friend will buy you a drink or have my friends drink. when we got on the bus he didn't even pay to get on and once I was hungry and I went to his house he was like I have no food just bread chocolate spread and left over pasta, so we both had 2 small spoons of chocolate spread each( I know 2 spoons what happen with the bread he had), also I noticed he always asks me can I have this if you don't want it. he said he doesn't have a job but he has student loan. I like him I don't know if his acting like that cause he don't like me or something to turn me off him or he is straight out rock bottom broke. he even told me that his started to become selfish since starting uni but I don't know was he trying to tell me something there?

20090227054704AAYR5nr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i stop feeling this way?	I've been going out with my boyfriend for 8 months and we're really close. I would say i'm pretty comfortable in my own skin. He on the other hand, is fairly insecure. However, I'm starting to feel like it's rubbed off on me!       Lately, I feel more and more frustrated by his friendships with exes and girls he used to date. I must admit, I am not all that close with any of my exes, so maybe i am just not used to this situation.       He has a good friendship with his ex-girlfriend (the only other major relationship in his life before me) and has a facebook album of when he went to visit her last year, but no albums of me. When we were first dating, he had some photos of her still in his flat - one in his bedroom and a Valentine's thing she made for him up in his living room. Both have been taken down now, but I had to bring it up a lot, and it took a long while for the Valentine's one to go. It really bothers me that the facebook album is still up. Maybe because he doesn't have many photos on facebook, yet has dedicated an album to her. He won't take it down, and says he'll put put photos of me up, but he said that months ago, and still nothing...      There is also a girl who he dated for a while and remained friends with, that always seems to want to meet up with him. She emailed him wanting to go for a drink. She has a boyfriend herself, but only ever seems to meet with my boyfriend on her own. She asks him questions about me, like 'oh are you married off now', and says things like 'wow, she must be really special if you've made her your serious girlfriend', so it makes me question her motives and i just think she wants his attention and probably still fancies him. My boyfriend doesn't really see this...and I just don't understand why he still needs her in his life. It's not like they had a long relationship, maybe when he was single it was nice to have her in the background, but hey he's with me now - shouldn't he drop her?      I am turning into a crazy woman or what?! Sorry for the long rant. I just want to know how to be patient, and cool with all of this. Or how I should deal with it. I feel like my boyfriend is a bit insensitive at times, and yet he can get jealous if another guy in a bar even looks at me!      Help! x

Not men and woman but I am noticing more that if these people have a connection to his family or exwife his says "my friend" and if it someone he knows or works with or new people we meet he says "my girlfriend".  Am I being overly sensative that he just doens't want his ex to know he has a girlfriend?  Should I introduce him as 'my friend' next time to see how he feels about it?
20090227063013AADRdIW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i take the relationship to the next level?	Ok, heres my story...   I am recently divorced and started to try and meet new people, since its 2009 i figured i would give the internet a shot.  I meet a lady on a certain website, we talked for about 3 days and decided that we would meet to see if we actually had a connection...funny story about our first encounter we met at a bar/restaurant between our homes, had way to much to drink and great conversation.  we ended up falling asleep in my truck (passed out) and were awakened at 3am by a police officer.  The police officer basically forced us to stay in a hotel for the night...we did "mess around" but no intercourse...since then we have been seeing each other for about a month, a couple of days throughout the weeks and almost every day on the weekends (she has been staying the night, but still no intercourse)...This girl seems to have everything i am looking for in a woman and I have been out of the "dating" game for well over 6 years...how to i move this "dating relationship" into a full relationship? Is it to early to confront her with this? how do I word what i should say?   I believe we are both on the same page, but i cant read her actions yet...   any help would be appreciated...      Thanks in advance,    No Rico Suave

At the beginning, I rejected him but we still kept contact via texts.   2 month ago, he asked me out after months of no meeting. Then he let me meet his brother, wanted to see my sister, asked me about my family and plan for future. After I talked about my favorite book, he suggested to borrow it from me.   After few dates, he asked me out on Valentine's day and we started to have physical moves since that evening.   Yesterday, he let his brother join our date. We went to a bar and had much fun.   He neither asked me to be his GF nor said he loved me.   What do u think about the guy? Is he serious??

He's really a good guy who treats people w/ respect. She's tired of me being in unhealthy relationships. Well, last night my ex-bf came to my house and wanted to talk. I let him talk. I told him this morning that I had a date tonight and he said "that didn't take you long" and said he didn't want to talk to me anymore and hung up.

20090307141746AATPnog	Family & Relationships;Family	My son is 17 and I'm scared for his future?	After years of fighting him to go to high school, he finally dropped out and got his GED.  He enrolled in a community college and is working evenings in a pizza shop.  Now, he tells me he is failing his classes and school just isn't for him.  He is very smart and funny and kind to his little brother, but seems to have no willpower to stick things out...very undisciplined!  (my fault, I'm sure).  I try to support all of his decisions the best I can, but I'm having trouble with this one.  We do talk alot and he knows how important an education is, but says he just wants to work realizing that he'll probably get nowhere.  He sleeps in til noon, plays basketball til 4 and works from 5-10.  He has plenty of spending money and is saving some too, but once child support ends when he turns 18 in June and he can no longer be on his father's insurance (because he won't be a full time student) he has to have something.  Everything I recommend is put down for one reason or another.  I know that he is young and may grow up and mature enough in a few years to "get it", but so far what I've seen from him is a lack of any motivation.  He says he's sorry he let me down, wants to make me proud, wants an education, but just isn't "into it".  I go from kindness to sarcasm within seconds in our conversations.  Is there any way to motivate a boy who isn't?  BTW his girlfriends works and goes to college for nursing;  she is very ambitious and disappointed too, but she loves him like I do.  Charge him rent at 18?  Throw him out?  I don't think I can do either of those things.  HELP!

20090307120515AA4aDtZ	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help with my sister. Quite a long question, serious answers only please?	I recently applied for a pretty high-profile job. Upon applying I was told that I could only discuss the application very briefly with immediate family. The plan was to only tell my parents and sister if I actually got the job (as I have to wait 4 weeks to find out). My sister and I live together, and share a laptop. She found an e-mail from the recruiters about the position and confronted me about it. I told her the very basic elements, as that is all I'm permitted to say. She then got in a tizz about me "swanning off somewhere" and leaving her alone to pay the rent on our house by herself. This is not the case, I will not be relocating anywhere, just commuting, but she doesn't believe me. She then demanded that I called our parents and told them, which I have done and they're very supportive. We've already had three full-blown arguments, and I honestly think her worries are completely unfounded and uncalled for. All I'm asking for is a bit more support. She has stated that she can't live with me if she can't trust me, but it is very much the other way around as I specifically asked her not to tell anyone else and she has.       Sorry for such a long question but I really don't know what to do. Every time I try and speak to her, we end up in an argument. Please help, as its getting to the point where I don't want this job anymore if it means losing my sister.       Riley.

I found one two hours away, which I am seriously considering.  It is closer to some members of my family, the same driving distance for others, and then my immediate family and my fiances immediate family would have to drive two hours.   I have made some phone calls to those that we really want to come, to make sure it is feasible, and everyone so far is okay with it...except my mother.  Yesterday she said that was fine, it's our wedding, do it how we want, and today when I called her about something else she went off on me about how she's going to have to "deal" with this.   I don't want her to have to "deal" with my wedding!     What do you think?  Is it an unreasonable request?

My dad got an e-mail saying that she wants to give me money for my G1 and a sapphire (or any stone i want) ring. I don't know if I should accept it though? Will that mean I'll have to talk to her?

20090307113145AAcKGza	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can you help me pick 2 of these 5 flavors for the cake please?	I have 5 choices and am picking three different flavors for three different layers.      The first layer I have chosen is:   Cassata (Italian Wedding Cake) - A traditional Italian golden cake with toasted almonds in the cake and an amaretto-butter sauce poured over the cake as soon as it is removed from the oven, frosted with our rich cream cheese frosting.      Now I need to pick two more...out of these 5..   Fresh Strawberry Cake - Whole strawberries are chopped and folded into a white cake batter, usually topped with a rich cream cheese frosting      Orange Marmalade & Lemon Cake - A tangy lemon cake made with bitter English orange marmalade and lemon zest. A lemon and butter sauce is poured over the cake after it's baked, then iced with cream cheese frosting.       Raspberry Liqueur Cake - A white cake made with a French raspberry "crème de Framboise" and raspberries folded into the batter prior to baking. A raspberry liqueur and butter sauce is poured over the cake when it is fresh from the oven, then covered with a rich cream cheese frosting      Texas Turtle - Devils food cake with caramel and nuts in the filling, white fudge frosting on the outside.      Carrot Cake - A moist traditional favorite with carrots, walnuts and spices, topped with cream cheese frosting.       BTW: I have tasted them ALL and they are soooooooo good. That makes it all the more difficult : /   Hubby 2 be picked the Top Layer and left me to decide the other two...please help me..      We are also serving white on white cupcakes with our wedding colors sprinkles for the kiddos/adults with food allergies !!      We want the wedding cake to be "different" and have different choices with a more "grown up" selection.

20090307120121AAa4gL6	Family & Relationships;Family	How do myself and my family cope with our sons death?	My 4 year old son has passed away from cancer. We feel like our world has fallen apart. I have 3 other children, aged 7, 4 and 1. The 7 and 4 year old have been hit terribly hard by this and I really don't know how to comfort them, would it be a good idea for them to see a psycologist or something similar? Also for the funeral in a few days, how do we involve the kids in that? Will it be too difficult, should they just go to the service and not the burial, or not go atall, or go to both. Myself and my husband don't know what to do either and we would greatly appreciate any advice, we are trying to keep strong for the sake of our other children but it is incredibly hard. We are talking to people about it, but I also feel i could be helped on here if anyones been through anything similar or knows about this kind of thing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. thankyou x

20090307140934AA4g7cI	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is playing favorites!?	My younger sister never has to do anything because she is being favored by BOTH of my parents.  Whenever I say that to them they go "What was the last thing we did that showed favoritism?"  I went on for hours and was told I was "overreacting."  My sister never is asked to carry bags while I get treated like a pack mule.  I hate it and won't put up with it any longer.  My sister just enjoys it.  When I was 7 she and her friend hid all my underwear behind her bed.  I told my mother and she just punished me for "trying to get my sister in trouble."  To this day she does not believe anything I say.  She pretends to listen to what I say and if my sister wants to say something while I am talking they will just say "Shut up you idiot...she's talking."  My sister enjoys the favoritism and is also a complete idiot.  HELP!!!

20090307124558AA1Fsd1	Family & Relationships;Family	How am I going to get to spend the night at my friends house?	My dad is a ******* *****.  I seriously have hated him since I was 4 years old. He's a pastor and has never abused or raped me or anything like that, but he makes the most retarded rules. Recently I've gotten some balls and I just straight up tell him how I feel about everything he does and how dumb he is, but he just won't change. I've finally gotten out of going to church and having to deal with all that bullshit which had caused me so much trouble over the years.  But he still won't let me spend the night at someones house because it's on a saturday night. He tells me his parents didn't go to church and they still respected the rule, and he argued with his parents and says all the same stuff I do. I just really don't think he understands, I told him I just going to go and spend the night anyway, but he said he'll give the police my friends address and have them come and get me by filing me missing. I'm thinking that I could probably leave a bunch of notes and messages on the voice machine and his cell phone to use as evidence for the police. What do you think about all this?

20090307095448AATNnWD	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do about mum?	5 months ago my dad left my mum for another woman. He had been cheating for four years, arguing a lot at home, and finally he admitted to me that he wanted to leave. However weeks went by and he didn’t tell my mum which was causing a lot of stress for me which I didn’t need because this is an important year in school for me. My mum kept asking me if my dad had said anything to me about leaving and one day I was so sick of lying to her and seeing her futile attempts at trying to win her back I decided to make my dad tell her.   After that things were a mess and my mum blamed me for the split. Eventually though we made things up and I thought that things would start getting better. Unfortunately they haven’t. My mum is still heartbroken and has given up on everything in life. She complains she’ll never do anything fun again (she relied financially and socially on him) but when I suggest ways of getting around these problems she says there is not point because nothing has every mattered to her but him. I understand her pain but the implication that her children mean nothing to he isn’t very nice on me or my brother. I feel as though she expects me to be able to fix everything and get my dad to come back which even if it were possible I wouldn’t want since my home life was so unhappy before and  I think in the long term both will be happier apart. This makes me feel incredibly guilty and the fact she blames me just makes things worse.    I  suppose what my question is is how can I help her to see that the split was for the best and to move on with her life because if this doesn’t happen I can see our relationship drifting apart since whilst I love her and want to support her, If this heart break is going to go on forever (which knowing my mum I fear it might), I don’t want to be bought down with her.    Sorry for the long post- its a long story! I tried to condense it as best as possible so i hope it makes sense :)

20090307120552AAHwdKj	Family & Relationships;Family	Please for the love of God help me. My mother is acting ridiculous? It's a little long but please read.?	So I decided I wanted to cut my hair last week, since I had been growing it out for a while. I have a stylist that I've been going to for a couple years now, and I really love her because she's really friendly and always listens to me. But my mom had done some graphic deisign stuff for HER salon (which is different than mine), so she had some "points" to use up there. She said I could get my hair cut there if I wanted to, but I didn't want to betray my stylist (and going to a new salon is scary!). I hadn't decided on what I wanted to do, and I never said I wanted to go there, only that it was an option, and my mom was just pressuring me to do it.       I come home from school one day and she was on the phone with her salon making an appointment for me. I got mad at her for a minute, and then I figured, oh, what the heck. I might as well. I asked her if I could do a color too, and she called and scheduled for that.       So I go to the salon and I get my hair cut and colored. I wanted to do a poofy, whispy, kinda messy 50's looking pixie cut and a dark brownish-red color. The guy made my hair reeeeeally short, even though I told him specifically I did not want it to be really short like boy's hair. He used a razor and shaved the hair around the back of my neck and behind my ears and the cut is WAAAY shorter than I wanted. I mean, I even drew apicture and showed it to him. And the color turned out black. I was OKAY with it at first, but after a few days I hate it. It looks totally wrong on me. I don't think I could have been more specific about what I wanted, and the guy totally screwed it up.       I can live with the hair cut, and I can grow it out, but the color is unbearable. It's so unnatural and makes me look like some emo kid who slits their wrists (my super pale skin doesn't help either). I've been researching all day about this stuff called Color Oops  that removes color and lightens your hair. It's bleach and ammonia free, and uses very gentle ingredients like soy and aloe vera, so it will NOT fry your hair. I've read hundreds of reviews and everyone who's used it loves it. So I approached my mom with the idea and she said she's absolutely not going to take me to buy it. I'd even buy it myself. All she has to do is drive me a couple blocks to Wallgreens. She refused and instead called the guy who cut my hair and scheduled and appointment with him to "fix" my hair. WTF?? She wants to send me BACK to him? I'd walk there but she won't let me. How can I convince her to let me do this? She's always shot down my ideas about my hair and always tells me I'm going to destroy it, and I never do and my hair always turns out great because I do my research. I need the color removal. How do I convince her???

My girlfriend and me got an apartment already my family dont know it.i dont really spend time at my new apartment  cuz i have to go back my family's house.

20090307120958AA9HDfI	Family & Relationships;Family	Parental rights for fathers?	I have a question...we recently found out after ongoing contact was trying to be made, that my husband ex(never married) supposedly "gave up her rights by signing a piece of paper" to her aunt. Now My husband has a soon-to-be 2 year old daughter and from what we know the child is now living with her great aunt. His ex is trying to tell him that he has no rights to her and all this yet, its never went to court and nothing was ever signed. Im wondering how we would go about trying to gain custody of her cause obviously her mother doesnt want her or cant take care of her. Now, my only concern is that it never got taken to court as far as custody and child support.       She was only letting him see her when it was convenient for her, which i can say has been about 7 times at most in the last year. When we called welfare to set up child support we were told that she was the one who was going to have to talk to her caseworker about it..      but from what i know about due process, he still has his parental rights and by all means can fight for custody correct!? His name IS on the birth certificate.       Anyone in similar situations or has dealt with this could you please help with any advice possible!!             Any help will be appreciated!

20090307122151AATxb2n	Family & Relationships;Family	How to convince my overprotective dad to let me travel?	You see, my parents are divorced and my mom has custody of my younger brother. I'm pretty young and so is my brother. This simply makes everything harder. I haven't seen him for over two years and my grandma and him are going to Hong Kong for the summer. Since it's summer, I don't have school, which is perfect. I want to go by myself to Hong Kong, but my dad is too overprotective and worries too much. I can't seem to convince him to let me go. When I ask him why he won't let me go, he simply says he "doesn't trust me", which is simply an excuse and he won't tell me straight out why. It's really frustrating because nothing I say seems to work. He simply won't let me see my mother or brother just because he hates my mom. He can't do that. So any help?
20090307122305AAqLTe4	Family & Relationships;Family	Family Problem's. I need advice.?	My parents have divorced about a year now. and about 4 months ago my mom met this new guy. The guy is really nice but my mom seems to spend more time with him. And when ever she cant do or find anything she ends up blaming it on me and acuseing me for things i dont even do. Then she turns back to me and says how i dont spend time with her. Im always on the phone with my boyfriend. Well im always on the phone with my boyfriend because shes always spending time with hers .      Now shes calling my boyfriend and telling him to not ever talk to me again and have nothing to do with me.       So i don't know what to do, to make her happy.

20090307132737AAVuN4m	Family & Relationships;Family	Mother Loves Other Two Children More Than Me.?	i think my mother hates me. she has a bit of an obsession with having beautiful things, which i am not. my other sister is beautiful and younger brother is simply adorable, but im just fat and ugly. The way we are treated is different. When they get in trouble and its something horrible, like smoking or violence, they get grounded for a week or less. Yet, when I do something not as bad, like coming home late by 10 or 15 minutes i get grounded for 2 months. (NO EXAGGERATION) I feel too afraid to confront her about this since i have tried count less times and she just says i say stupid things. I feel COMPLETELY unloved. I can barely even remember the days when i was a child and hugged and kissed or sung to at night or told "i love you". id ont know why she does this or what i should do. my parents are divorced and my mother acts like a teenager (which is my job -_-") im more responsible most of the time

20090307134453AAJkyMZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I the reason my family dont care?	Throughout my life, I have had ups and downs, like everyone does. I have four siblings and usually, in the past we have been there for each other. We have had issues with our parents, stuff that we dont always like talking about and things that went on. Basically we all have out own opinions about them and why things were, the way that they were and perhaps, this is what brings us closer.   However, lately, I have been calling my sibling and rarely will they answer their phones.   I leave messages and texts but never get a reply. All I want to say to them is hello, how are you, however, it is rarely that they will make a gesture to get in touch with me. I have invited them round mine but they do not come and when I make plans to go round theres, when I call to arrange times, they do not answer their phones. It is only when there is a problem, then my phone will not stop ringing, I have had them crying down the phone, because of their problems and I am always there to listen and would never not answer their call. I would do anything for them. However recently, due to them not having any problems, it seems as though, I am being ignored. I do have this same problem with my parents, but I think that I learnt to accept that, because of the way that they are. So at this present point, I have minimal contact with family, I work all the hours god sends, just to forget about the past and the way my life is now. I am single and the only contact that I have outside of work is one friend who visits me every week. I have other friends but they live far away. The friend that I see weekly, has been so good to me. I wish that I had known her all my life, however I do not want to rely too much on her, because she does have a life of her own. I am a good-hearted person, have I done something wrong?

We are going to Las Vegas next weekend and Since its our 8 year anniversary, its a perfect timing.      So, I had a few ideas, but I guess I am looking to do this in a not-super-public place, but yet somewhere identifiable, memorable, unexpected. We hate crowds and children, so keep that in mind as you make suggestions. This would likely happen late night (after 10) Friday, as we have tons of friends meeting us the next day and I want to do this while the vacation is still "just us". Any great ideas? (thanks!)
20090307142038AAdXyja	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Am I being reasonable about engagement?	My current boyfriend and I met when he was 17 and I was either 18 or 19-- I'm about 1.5 years older than him. We dated a couple of times for brief periods, once when I was 20 and he was 18, and another time he came out and lived with me in another state when I went away to college ( I was 22-23). We've been really close/best friends now for 7 years. We officially started dating again a little over a year ago (February 4th).       Basically at that time I told him that i couldn't do the on-and-off thing anymore between dating and friends- and that I wanted to be with him, and if he wanted to be with me we should think about taking our relationship more seriously. I told him that if we were still together in 6 months that we should move in together.      6 months into our relationship I started looking at apartments and with the housing market being in the dumps, I also started looking at condos to buy. He did not help me very much in looking for a place, but agreed that he wanted to move in with me. After a few months of really hard work and determination I bought a condo. He didn't want to buy the condo with me, he felt that a mortgage was too big of a responsibility (straight out of his mothers mouth), so he is now renting from me.      He works part time and is going to school part time. He has been attending a 2-year university now for about 5 years. After he graduates, he would like to move on and go to a four year university (who knows how long that will take). In the meantime, I am working full time and make most of the money. Our condo is fully furnished with things I've bought, and a lot of things we buy go on my tab.       I know that he is the one for me. I love him with all of my heart. I am starting to feel pretty disappointed in our relationship, though. We've talked about getting married, and he says that he just always pictured himself done with school and settled into a nice full-time job before he took that step. Well, he is obviously at LEAST two years from finishing school, and I don't want to wait that long to get engaged. I don't mind waiting that long to get married-- getting married takes a lot of time/planning/money-- but getting engaged just takes love and commitment. He knows that I want to get engaged, I've broken down and cried about it several times.       He says that he can "picture himself with me forever", and that he thinks we will get married someday. I feel disrespected. He knows that I am catholic and that I have a hard time with living together and being intimate without being in a formal relationship. Please do not attack my religion in your response. I just think that if he expects everything that comes from a committed relationship (including sex, living together, shared finances, etc.)-- then he could show me the respect of committing to me.       Last night I was mad and started crying and he said "i feel like i don't do things right in our relationship and I don't know how to fix it until you bring it up", and I go "obviously it doesn't even matter if I bring it up, because you know I want to get engaged, or at least have a promise ring or some sort of commitment, and you don't do anything about it".      Basically we have a great relationship-- but I can't help the feel the daily disappointment of not feeling respected-- or wanted-- for that matter.      Advice? Am I rushing him? I don't think that my life should have to be on the schedule of his ridiculously long educational pursuits-- am I wrong to think this? I support him going to school (both emotionally and financially), shouldn't he support my desire to be in a committed relationship? I would like to bring him to my family reunion this summer, but I can't if we aren't engaged, it would be unacceptable for me to introduce a boyfriend I live with to my catholic family without engagement. That's not the reason I want to get engaged, don't get me wrong, I want to get engaged because I love him and I want to feel good about our relationship.

20090307145819AA6mXSt	Family & Relationships;Family	How to talk to my 63 year old aunt?	I live with my aunt who is 63 and retired, and I'm currently a college student.       my aunt complains about how I don't talk to her enough (pretty much not give her enough attention) honestly, she just seems like a kid asking for attention, I'm 21 years old, and she's 63...Whenever we do attempt to talk, it's mostly me listening to her lectures, which is annoying if that's her idea of a conversation. I just don't know how to talk to her honestly. & it makes it harder for me  to respect her if she's gonna act like a child herself yet expect me to listen to all her guru talk (lectures) & if she was 21 once why doesn't she understand my side of the table? For someone who's 63 and just knows the whole world...she sure isn't understanding or humble. My question is, why is she like that? and what are some topics we can talk about that we can both relate to?

20090307145204AA35Wyr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do I do when my partner is more committed to his dog than me?	My partner brought 2 dogs into our relationship and now 1 of them is threatening my little boy, pissing on his toys, marking after him round the yard, growling at him and he nipped him the other day. He also digs under the fence or escapes out any unattended openings(gates, doors, etc) and won't come back until my partner gets home from work. He also runs off when we are at the beach or out and about and I have to wait around while my partner interrupts our people activities to go look for it. He digs in my vege garden and barks at the chickens. He's completely undisciplined, a terror to walk - in fact its impossible to take him out with the pram as he pulls like a maniac, and I want to re-home him but my partner says no way no how. He'd rather see me leave than get rid of the dog. One of the problems with me leaving is that I came out of a really bad relationship right before we got together (a year and a half ago). I don't want to disrupt my little boys life again (its already been a rough beginning for him) and start over. Also, I really do love my partner and he's wonderful EXCEPT when it comes to his dogs and then they are basically the most important thing to him. When we first got together the dogs were up on the furniture, slept in the bed and went absolutely everywhere with him. They now only come inside to sleep at night (in the lounge), they aren't allowed up on the furniture and DEFINITELY not in the bedroom. It still affects our holidays because we can't go anywhere unless the dogs come too and this particular dog ruins my enjoyment and sends our stress levels through the roof because he requires so much attention. I really appreciate the compromises my partner has made since we got together and enjoy the company of the other dog - shes obedient, good with my son, easy to walk and just generally good company. I just feel its in the best interest of our whole family to re-home the problematic dog. My partner says I'm just jealous, I knew how committed he was to his dogs before we moved in together, I just need to get over it, he doesn't think the dog is too much of a problem so thats the end of the subject, and more along those lines. He's said to me that his dogs are more important than I am and that theres no way at all he is going to get rid of either of his dogs and if I can't deal with that then I can leave. Can I please please have some sensible advice on what I can in this situation????
