So base your answer on the fact that I like small cars, please! Thanks.      I need a car that is cheap now, but will last at least 5 years with no major maintenance issues.

First, moped or motorcycle? My mom is not very happy about my interest in motorcycles/mopeds! So, what would be a better choice to make her feel better about my decision? I am a girl, but I really like motorcycles much better! ;)      Second, I was looking at the Honda Nighthawk as I hear it is a very good first bike choice. I am 5"10 and weigh about 145 pounds. Is the 250cc Nighthawk a good bike?      Third, I am so terrible at changing gears! I really need practice!

If anyone has any other tips or info for me that would be great!      First Time Biker,   Wolf
20090223075533AAdrczk	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I'm having difficulty starting my car. My dashboard/headlights work fine. I don't think it's the battery.?	My vehicle will not start. I have a 1998 Ford Taurus 4-Door Sedan from a friend about 8 months ago. The car was in excellent condition for the first 6 months. Lately, it hasn't been doing too great.      Anyways, when I insert my car key into the key hole in attempt to crank it up, it refuses to fire. I've spent over 30 minutes attempting to start it. It just simply won't. My headlights work fine. Dashboard is good. The windows roll down fine from the switch. It can't be the battery. I don't have much of a mechanical background. I really don't know what the problem is.      If you could kindly help me, I would greatly appreciate it. If additional information is needed, I would gladly provide them. Thank you for your time assisting my inquiries.

I've never once replaced the timing belt in my '95 sedan or '96 truck...and they are both running fine.      But our newer car just went over 60,000 miles and the mechanic keeps pestering me to get the timing belt replaced as it is regular maintenance.  But this so called "maintenance" is going to run me around $700 which is pretty steep in my eyes...      So, do people really replace the belt before it breaks?  About how long do timing belts actually last?  And what is the worst-case scenario if I just drive until the belt does break (engine damage?)  Also, does $700 sound reasonable for this work?

About 2 weeks ago I thought I had a flat tire.  As I was driving I was hearing a thump,thump,thump from the driver side front tire.  I filled it with air (it was a little low) but the noise is still there.  Now the steering wheel shakes back and forth if I take my hands off the wheel and at times it feels like the tire is shaking to the point where it might fall off.  I'm planning on taking it in to get fixed, but I was wondering if anyone had any idea what could possibly be wrong and if anybody knew about how much this will cost to be fixed???

I then took it and had a whole new exhaust system put on for $850. Right now i am in the process of getting the interior done up nice and getting a new radio, window tint and such. Other small things have been done..like new tires and brakes. The only thing it really need is paint, because there is notable wear on the back bumper and some new rear struts...both of which i plan to fix. I want to know what some of you think this car is worth...hopefully some actually Z people will help, and  not run to KBB and give me a price, because these cars go for higher prices than on that website. Im not really interested in selling, just knowing whether my investment will be worth it in the long run..because i hope to keep this car until im like 50 and it becomes a classic.

He said he doesn't recommend Golfs because they have a "soft engine". He said the oil needs to be topped up every week or two, and in his experience Golfs often have to come in to get repaired and parts replaced. He said Golfs are no longer made in Germany and your just paying for a "badge", but not neccessarily a good car.      I'm not sure what to do now. Do I take his advice and go for something else like a Ford Focus or Toyota Coralla or do I just take my chances and get the Golf. Whats other peoples experience with Golfs?

20090223101434AA9Pf1S	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Jeep	1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee: Could it be the Clockspring?	My husband called me the other day complaining that the airbag light on the dashboard would intermittently turn on and off while driving the car.  Sometimes the light will stay off for a week at a time, but other times, it will repeatedly flash on and off throughout the entire trip.        Two or three days before this happened, my husband backed into a mailbox and it left a small dent in the plastic bumper, which my husband pryed out that same day.        I've done some research, and I've heard that the clockspring is a VERY common problem in the 1999 Jeep GC, usually going out around 100,000 miles, but the proximity of the dashboard light to the mailbox incident has me wondering.  Also, with the airbag light on, the horn and the cruise control BOTH work.          Is there a sensor in the back bumper that (if dented) would cause the airbag light to flicker on and off?  And if so, how would I go about fixing it?  What (other than the clockspring and maybe a fuse) would cause this problem?  And is it possible for the clockspring to be broken, but the horn and cruise control function normally?        Any help is greatly appreciated, but please don't tell me to take it to the Jeep Dealer.  $108 to put the truck on a computer and read a trouble code is absolutely ridiculous.  I'm just looking for advice from Jeep owners and mechanics who may have had similar problems with their truck in the past.      Thanks again!

20090223095856AAVCrsY	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Audi	My Audi A4 has no compression. What could be the cause?	After driving my 2001 Audi A4 T Sport for 3.5 hours non-stop I lost power. There was no bang, clank or smoke. The engine just seemed to wind down. I pulled over and tried to start the engine and it just seemed to fly over. This happened in France and it's been looked at twice over there. No one seems to be able to say exactly what has happened. Just that there is no compression in the engine. After a telephone conversation with an "expert" I have been informed it could be something to do with hydraulics and a bent piston? Has anyone else had this happen and know what it is? Is it worth taking apart to try and fix or will it need a new engine? Thanks

I have a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder that is not Inspected, It seems as if everything that i try to fix on it, there is always another problem.

20090223103935AArnh95	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Alloy wheel tyre valve cap seized?	I foolishly fitted some metal valve caps to my valves, and the recent bad weather has resulted in one cap seizing to the brass valve thread. I eventually managed to free off the cap with a pair of long nose pliers holding the valve stem and a pair of mole grips on the cap. Whilst doing this the valve stem rotated 360 degress, so i tightened it up again. This happened several times. I would like to know if i have damaged the valve in any way by doing this, and will an air leak result? So far, over a period of several hours it has not lost any pressure. Is the stem designed to rotate and stay airtight? Apart from the rotation and some tearing of the rubber stem there appears little damage.   It is a tubeless Continental tyre - if the worst comes to the worst could the valve simply be replaced, and at what cost?   Thanks..

I recently was given a 1973 Glendale travel trailer, it is now parked in my park of choice and will be used as a getaway in the summer etc.      My one Uncle is telling me it's not worth the safety risk (leaks & possible explosion) to use the propane system the trailer comes with (pretty sure it's all in good shape), and to just use a space heater on cold nights and use the park's solar showers.      My other Uncle is saying the propane is safe to use (he's a natural handyman who will check my system out for me) and that it's much easier to use for cooking, furnace, water heater etc and with very little risks.      I'm very scared of "going boom" and am unsure if I want to use the propane.      I would greatly appreciate everyone's opinons/answers on whether or not we should use propane for the trailer.

20090223111409AAXAvOD	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	Size of Honda Fit, small?	People keep telling me it's bigger than it looks, but it still looks small to me. To the people that have one, are the back seats big enough with good leg room? I have a 4 year old and his car seat is pretty big and I don't want the other two people riding in the back to feel smashed. Thanks.
