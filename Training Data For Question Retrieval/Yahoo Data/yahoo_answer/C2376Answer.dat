This includes eukaryote such as fungi and protists, and prokaryotes, which are bacteria and archaea. Viruses, though not strictly classed as living organisms, are also studied. In short; microbiology refers to the study of life and organisms that are too small to be seen with the naked eye.<br>  <br>  Microbiology is a broad term which includes virology, mycology, parasitology, bacteriology and other branches. A microbiologist is a specialist in microbiology.<br>  <br>  Microbiology is researched actively, and the field is advancing continually. We have probably only studied about one percent of all of the microbe species on Earth. Although microbes were first observed over three hundred years ago, the field of microbiology can be said to be in its infancy relative to older biological disciplines such as zoology and botany.<br>  <br>  After doing MBBS, you should have done MD/MS. But you chosen Microbiology, now you should do Ph.D as this field require intensive research.<br>  <br>  Plenty of jobs are available for Microbiologist in ever growing Multi Speciality Hospitals with best pay.<br>  hsj

Although to obtain a place on certain courses, you could be asked for certain requirements. ie chemistry A Level for medicine etc. However universities do group subjects when making offers for i.e: A levels are put into 4 groups by universities. Group 1: all science subjects, which include maths, psychology & sports. Group 2: English subjects, including history, geography etc Group 3: Main bulk of A levels. Group 4: general studies, critical thinking, media and some business/travel courses.<br>  <br>  Universities look at the difficulty of subjects you are doing when making you an offer, that's why you might see the course requirements are for example 260-320 points. To receive an offer of 260 points you would probably need at least 1 Group 1 subject in your a levels, where someone else with all group 3 or 4 subjects would be asked for 320 points.<br>  <br>  However saying all that, it's not a good idea to take a science subject for example in the idea of getting a lower offer from your chosen univeristy if your grades are going to be low in that particular subject.  Unless you need specific subjects, for a course, then in my opinion it's better to chose the subjects you like and are good at and try to include a mixture from the groups I have included.GL|`|bb91e85a913bcdb03691f18552cdc897aa	Maths, physics, chemistry, biology, english literature, languages, history and geography are probably the main good ones to have.<br>  <br>  I'm in year 13 and from my own research (looking at different universities) and experience (at least at my own school) english language, media studies, business studies, ICT, PE, any design technologies, music, drama and art are not seen as great (academically that is).

NPtz1Y4Taa	Google Answers: Dulce et decorum est by Wilfred Owen<br>  ... the poem's ultimate irony - "Dulce Et Decorum Est, Pro Patria Mori" ... He does this through his use of punctuation, which includes exclamation marks ...answers.google.com/answers/threadview... - Cached<br>  <br>  also<br>  Here are some thoughts to get you started. <br>  <br>  (1) subject theme and tone of this poem; <br>  <br>  In this poem, Owen’s objective is to show the horror and reality of<br>  war, specifically the First World War, and to set this horror against<br>  the way in which war is so often glorified.<br>  <br>  The glorification of war is reflected in the Latin words taken from an<br>  ode by Horace (poet of Ancient Rome, 65-8 BC): “Dulce et decorum est<br>  pro patria mori”. This phrase can be translated as: “it is sweet and<br>  right to die for your country.”  These words of Horace were well known<br>  in Owen’s time, and were often quoted at the start of WW1. Owen shows<br>  his opposition to the sentiments of these words specifically by<br>  calling them an “old lie”, and also illustrates his opposition in the<br>  whole of the poem.<br>  <br>  As his illustration of the reality of war, Owen describes an incident<br>  of exhausted soldiers trudging through the mud of the battlefield.<br>  They are leaving the front line in order to rest for a few days in a<br>  safer place. However, the group is attacked by mustard gas. This is a<br>  substance used in chemical warfare. It reacts with water in the lungs<br>  to form a corrosive chemical which destroys the lungs.<br>  One soldier is too late in putting on his mask. Owen describes the<br>  symptoms shown by this man as the poison slowly kills him.<br>  <br>  The tone of the poem is very harsh due to the diction (the choice of<br>  words and how they are used). Owen gives us graphic descriptions,<br>  speaking in a very direct and straightforward way, uwing words that<br>  convey ugliness, fear and pain, for example: “coughing like hags”,<br>  “cursed through sludge” , “limped on, blood-shod”, “floundering like a<br>  man in fire or lime” [lime here means quicklime, a corrosive<br>  substance], “guttering, choking, drowning”, “white eyes writhing”,<br>  “blood<br>  come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs”, “vile, incurable<br>  sores”.<br>  <br>  Owen wants us to be shocked at the reality that he is presenting. He<br>  is not afraid to show his own feelings, through the use of emotive<br>  words such as “cursed”, “obscene”, “bitter”, “vile”.  In the line<br>  “Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge” he again<br>  contrasts reality with the idealistic way in which war has been<br>  presented, when soldiers are pictured as singing while marching<br>  proudly to their glorious deaths.<br>  <br>  <br>  (2) poetic devices and their effects; <br>  <br>  “bent double”, a commonly used phrase, is an example of hyperbole<br>  (because someone might be bent over, but not really bent in two).  It<br>  conveys the feeling of exhaustion felt by the soldiers, who are<br>  probably carrying heavy packs as well as having been sleepless in the<br>  trenches.<br>  <br>  Metaphor: “drunk with fatigue”<br>  <br>  Alliteration: <br>  “Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge”<br>  “Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots”<br>  “And watch the white eyes writhing in his face”<br>  The use of alliteration adds to the insistent tone of the poem. Owen<br>  is saying, “Hey!  Look!  I want you to look at this and remember!”  He<br>  hammers home his point, so that it is impossible to turn away and<br>  think of other things.<br>  <br>  “GAS! Gas! Quick, boys!” Capital letters and exclamation marks, and<br>  the resulting break in metrical structure create an impression of<br>  urgency and panic.<br>  <br>  There is an effective use of simile.  At the start of the poem, the<br>  soldiers are likened to old, crippled ugly beings: “Bent double, like<br>  old beggars under sacks, / Knock-kneed, coughing like hags”.  This<br>  contrasts with the fact that the so many of those who fought in WW1<br>  were very young, and it also contrasts with the pictures of handsome,<br>  upright soldiers so much used in propaganda. Owen also makes this<br>  contrast by setting these beginning lines against the ending of the<br>  poem.  In the final lines, he refers to the soldiers as having<br>  “innocent tongues” (ie being childlike), and notes that the “old lie”<br>  of the glory of war is told to and believed by “children ardent for<br>  some desperate glory”. Owen wants us to feel angry about the<br>  misrepresentation and about the ensuing waste of lives that have only<br>  just begun.<br>  <br>  “like a man in fire or lime” – another use of simile to express the<br>  burning and blistering effect and the pain caused by the mustard gas<br>  when it comes into contact with skin, eyes and mucous membranes.<br>  <br>  “Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light / As under a green<br>  sea. I saw him drowning.”   Another simile: The thick greenish glass<br>  of the gas mask, and the greenish fumes of the gas make the narrator<br>  feel that he is viewing an underwater scene.<br>  <br>  “His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin”  This simile is very<br>  ironic. Sin to a devil is the be all and end all of existence. If a<br>  devil becomes sick|`|y39iNwFjaa	He uses it as the title means it is sweet and good to die for your country but the horrific descriptions of the effects of war in the poem show it's anything but good to die for your country.

I never found it to be so.<br>  <br>  Adult learners come to their training programs with a variety of emotional problems, some that would cross a Rabbi's eyes.<br>  <br>  Here is a short list of some of my trainees profiles and their names cannot be shown.<br>  <br>  Male 37: Introverted, lacks confidence.<br>  Male 35: Recovering alcoholic.<br>  Male 25: Takes an eternity to say very little.<br>  Female 25: Assaulted by husband during two pregnancies.<br>  Female 25: Bad school experiences, told she was stupid.<br>  Male 43: No hang-ups. Lacks confidence due to being unemployed. Believes his age (43) is the problem.<br>  <br>  That is just 40% of the class students in a 24 week training programme. I haven't mentioned drug addicts - hard drugs, ex prisoners and more. I remember telling myself that if I survived 24 weeks with that particular group, I could survive almost anything.<br>  <br>  Yes, adults do have different priorities than young students:<br>  <br>  Adults:<br>  Income loss due to being unemployed.<br>  Relationship problems.<br>  Financial, rent, paying bills, food and clothing.<br>  Resentful of authority figures - included me.<br>  <br>  Trainer's Problems: Management were unaware or didn't care about the challenges that would have to be dealt with by teachers/instructors - they just wanted bums-on-seats. <br>  <br>  From my brief outline above you will easily conclude that it would have required the professional help of a behavioralist, a counselor <br>  and teacher to cope with the workload.<br>  <br>  With adults having so many diverse problems I soon realised that the learning process would not be successful until they knew/believed that I was aware of and empathized with their various hurts.<br>  <br>  Personal disclosure statements about my past difficulties encouraged them to reciprocate.<br>  <br>  I hope this will help you with your portfolio and best wishes.<br>  <br>  It was an ongoing case of finding them doing things right.

Also, they might be a lot farther behind then one would think. The things we learn in school and the way we learn change so much one generation to the next.

My advice would be to ensure that you write up a good write up of your findings and perhaps discuss why you decided not to further evaluate (perhaps as a post script).  good luck|`|vJa7abGfaa	you evaluate by saying how you could improve on your experiment...and how you can Make it fairer..

If you get an F however, it will pull your GPA down a lot. 2.9 is not that bad when you have a 3.7 so don't worry about the scholarship.<br>  <br>  If you're having problems with the teacher or it's simply too much, it's best to drop the class. If you need help in any subject, ask for tutoring. Some colleges offer it for free on campus. Talk to a counselor if you have any more college related issues.

But this I can say, if you take an F in that class it'll drop your GPA so it's always better to withdraw. The W means nothing once you complete and pass the class. Back off from that schedule too girl. 12 credit hours is full time ya know? If you push yourself too hard you wont make it you'll just exhaust yourself and possibly give up. Get a tutor for those classes your havin' a tough time with. (ask your man to help with the math) And trust you are smart enough, you made it through one semester! Keep your head up and drop that headache class til your ready to go at it again. Good Luck!

Select any course of interest for more details including entry requirements.  If you’re unclear about your current and proposed choices, it may be helpful to contact the relevant university admissions office for clarification.  As you’re still at school or college, it’s also important to talk to your careers advisers about subject options that are appropriate for entry to this professional area.  <br>  <br>  You might also find these sites useful for a career overview: <br>  1.

The ‘further details’ link takes you to more information on entry routes and requirements as well as links to relevant professional organisations, including the British Dietetic Association (BDA) at <a href="http://www.bda.uk.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.bda.uk.com/.</a>  <br>  2. The NHS Careers site also has a ‘Careers A – Z’ section with a profile for dietitions: see <a href="http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/</a> and then select ‘dietition’ from the A – Z list for details.  <br>   <br>  I do hope this information helps answer your question and wish you well with your study and career plans.

This is because their grammar rules are very strict and they have a LOT of cases.  Having said this, i personally find german beautiful and once you start learning it you'll realize that it' somewhat similar to English.  I took German at GCSE, got a D, missed it at A-Level and then studied international business management with ... GERMAN.  It was hard. Very hard. But i managed it and now i live, work and play here.  I would recommend the language because many large companies have bases in Germany :D  Viel spa?!

By reward, they don't specifically have to be in form of ABC's on the effort report, money or certificates.

If a mistake is made, it is much more likely to be the instructor who either miscalculated the grade or recorded it incorrectly than the Registrar's Office, who only copies what the instructor inputted (and these days, with instructors putting in the grades electronically, the Registrar is not even physically involved in the process of recording grades).  If your instructors are telling you that a mistake was made in the Registrar's Office, it is likely that THEY are the ones trying to avoid taking responsibility for an error.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	I'm at my third college/university, 9 years into my college education, and have NEVER had the registrars office screw up any of my grades/transcripts or those of my friends.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	I never had any mistakes made when I was in college. As long as you follow proper procedures things usually go rather smoothly.

That's all!

On one hand, you are doing a great thing by showing students that rules are meant to be followed and you are not a hypocrite. On the other hand, these children clearly have limited exposure to women dressed as they do in the "real world". Maybe it would be beneficial for students to see a woman dressed with the things they aren't allowed to wear, but doing it tastefully. That way they will have something to refer to when they are let wild to dress however they please. For example, wearing jewelry that they aren't allowed to wear, and makeup, but doing it in a tasteful and elegant way so that they can see that these things aren't evil. That's just my opinion on the situation. But again, I applaud you for being so respectful for your students!|`|lFrJ6hqNaa	no i think you are setting a Standard, which they cant call you a hypocrite for ,so maybe that has upset this girl so she is having a pop at you . once you change them they can say why cant we wear what we like, you do?  so keep up the good work, half of learning and growing up is obeying rules|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	I think you have the right attitude.

You have to lead by example.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I don't think it is weird, but it may be a little misplaced, depending on why the rules exist.  The same rules can't exist for everyone, because not everyone does the same job.  Executives at a factory don't wear the same uniform as the workers because safety isn't an issue for them, nor do they get dirty on their jobs, but they may have to meet with government officials or other businesspeople who expect them to wear business attire, not a uniform.<br>  <br>  If the reason your school has its rules is because they want to discourage vanity, or because there is some religious proscription against it, then it makes sense for you to demonstrate the proper way to dress.  If the concern is that they are afraid that students will be distracted from their studies by flirting or will get into economic competition over what they wear, or if they are afraid that they will get their ears damaged on the playground by other students getting caught on their earrings as they play, then the differential rules have nothing to do with status and more with function.  <br>  <br>  In the long run, you aren't a student, and you shouldn't be following the rules for students just because they exist.  If there are moral reasons behind the rules that apply to you too, then it would be good for you to model correct behavior.  If, however, you were teaching kindergarteners and they were given a list of acceptable garments which did not include a bra (because kindergarteners do not need bras), would you also forego a bra?  If all your students were male, would you wear men's clothes?  I'm not saying you have to "doll up", which I don't enjoy doing either, but neither do you have to follow rules made for some other group of people for reasons specific to them.|`|AA10344737	I applaud you.

2Q2ltt1Saa	Admonition means warning or advice.  The International Standard Version makes this a bit more understandable:<br>  <br>  "Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think."<br>  <br>  I don't have the rest of the context, but it's basically a wanring toeither follow the line of thinking or be sent to your maker for judgment... which I would consider a warning.|`|o3Jpfflgaa	"Abominable" means something of extreme distaste, horrible, detestable.<br>  <br>  Are you misreading that question?  It says "admonition" which isn't "abomination".  Admonition is a caution, a warning.<br>  <br>  The admonition that Paul gives to the Philippians is to be agreeable with each other (and within themselves) because that is a mark of (Christian) maturity.|`|Vq5lbw5zaa	Its something horrible and unacceptable|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	If you are an adult and you don't believe it God will prove it to you.|`|fzU2hP4yaa	Oops, you got the word slightly wrong.  I can see why you're confused.<br>  <br>  "Abomination" means something which is revolting or causes disgust, as in, "Hitler's crimes were an abomination."<br>  <br>  The word you're looking for is "Admonition".  This is either a warning, instruction or encouragement, "He was admonished against using drugs," or "Paul offered an admonition to live holy lives."

O4pC0aN8aa	If you remember back to your chemistry classes at school, water is H2O. In other words, a molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen, and one atom of oxygen.

Jwk7Ib2vaa	Who ever told you that the earlier you worry the better is most likely mistaken. What they meant is that for now, just focus on your studies. Do not, by any means, kill yourself with your homework and become a recluse. Keep your goal in mind as you finish up your schooling, but don't obsess every day about it.<br>  Enjoy the rest of the childhood you have left, because take it from someone who's been there, everything flies by after High School is over. It seems like I just had my first day of High School and yet here I am, sitting behind a desk, writing dissertations and comparative manuals finishing up my third year.<br>  Aim for the top my friend, do your absolute best and have fun while you're at it. When it comes time to start worrying, about the middle of 11th grade, then make sure your transcripts are the best that they can be and write a kick as* essay.<br>  The essay is really what can separate the good from the best. Include things like what sets you apart from the hundreds of other applicants they get. Put in there how YOU can help the student body grow and why Stanford would be amiss without you amongst their numbers.<br>  Hope this helps, and best of luck to ya.
jrWpHYAPaa	Density is the amount of matter in an object. Buoyancy is whether an object floats on water or not. If it does, it is less dense than water, like oil. If not it is more dense.

The main problem is remembering formulas, units and that kind of stuff. Maybe you should tell him to try to memorise the things he finds difficult, instead of trying to completely understand it. His teacher should be able to answer all of his worries, perhaps there are some rules that he may need explaining about. <br>  <br>  I hope i helped.|`|tkpBDLwYaa	If he's made it as far as graduate school, he should not be afraid to talk to his professor and see if he can get some tutoring.  A lot of professors have other graduate students teaching undergrad classes in their field, and being students themselves, they are usually very willing to tutor a fellow student for a little cash or barter.  As is very often the case with very bright kids, they don't always like to ask for help when they run into their first hurdle.  They think they should just "know" it.  For his sake and for the sake of your wallet (I assume you are paying for at least some of his education), urge him to check out some one-on-one time with someone who is in his class or get a referral from his prof.

bo4dGu7Waa	You mean Disney Channel Stars?<br>  It has been mentioned that they:<br>  <br>  Are in too many shows, when the truth is that they are just under a contract and they are finishing it by being in more episodes/shows.<br>  <br>  Another stereotype is that Disney Starts will be naughty, when it is not just Disney. More people have done worse things. And people tend to exxagerate over things that are not even bad. For example is Miley Cyrus's Photo Shoot. It is just an artisitc shoot and people are saying things that do not relate to it.<br>  <br>  People also have said that these Stars are purposely killing the true Disney. But it is not them.

XU1aTqQ8aa	The letters stand for "oll korrect." They're the result of a fad for comical abbreviations that flourished in the late 1830s and 1840s.<br>  <br>  The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839. The Boston newspapers began referring satirically to the local swells as OFM, "our first men," and used expressions like NG, "no go," GT, "gone to Texas," and SP, "small potatoes." <br>  <br>  Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings, a stock in trade of the humorists of the day. One predecessor of OK was OW, "oll wright," and there was also KY, "know yuse," KG, "know go," and NS, "nuff said." <br>  <br>  Most of these acronyms enjoyed only a brief popularity. But OK was an exception, no doubt because it came in so handy. It first found its way into print in Boston in March of 1839 and soon became widespread among the hipper element. <br>  <br>  It didn't really enter the language at large, however, until 1840. That's when Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren adopted it as the name of their political club, giving OK a double meaning. ("Old Kinderhook" was a native of Kinderhook, New York.) <br>  <br>  OK became the warcry of Tammany hooligans in New York while beating up their opponents. It was mentioned in newspaper stories around the country. <br>  <br>  Van Buren's opponents tried to turn the phrase against him, saying that it had originated with Van Buren's allegedly illiterate predecessor, Andrew Jackson, a story that has survived to this day. They also devoted considerable energy to coming up with unflattering interpretations, e.g., "Out of Kash, Out of Kredit, and Out of Klothes." <br>  <br>  Newspaper editors and publicists around the country delighted in coming up with even sillier interpretations-- Oll Killed, Orfully Konfused, Often Kontradicts, etc.--so that by the time the campaign was over the expression had taken firm root nationwide.|`|vdZRgteWaa	hahahahahahahahaha. xx lol|`|jnIvJsX5aa	It originally stood for "oll korrect."

EEfd3WLhaa	BOTH are very competitive.  You will probably be spending more for school to become a doctor, yet you will be making more with more stress...but if you go into fashion, school will be less expensive.  <br>  <br>  The fashion industry has many parts like any other industry.  You can go into anything from designing the fabrics, sewing your own designs, marketing other people's designs, running your own boutique, working as a stylist, working as a buyer for a big company...there is no limit!  Many fashion jobs need specific skills so it is probably good to get a BA (4 year ) in the field you are interested in most.  Most schools have them, but there are trade schools too.  <br>  <br>  As a doctor, you will have to spend close to a $100,000 or MORE on school alone and you will be studying and having no social life for atleast 7 years.  If you are't good in the areas then you can learn but it may not be the right path for you.  The money is good in the end, but there is a reason that not just anyone can be a dr.  You could try for a job that requires a specific form of medicine, or even be a nurse.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10023710	If you suck at science, then becoming a doctor is not a good fit for you. You will need to take a *lot* of science in college in order to qualify for med school; and then med school is all about the science. If you suck at science, you need to look at other careers. <br>  <br>  You can make a good career in the fashion business, either as a designer or as a merchandiser, or a buyer, or a manager, or a visual merchandiser, or in marketing. There are a lot of jobs available in fashion. <br>  <br>  The two big majors for those who are interested in fashion are fashion design (which is art), or fashion merchandising (which is business). Check out this website, and click through each one to learn more:<br>  <a href="http://dept.kent.edu/fashion/" rel="nofollow">http://dept.kent.edu/fashion/</a><br>  <br>  To get into the fashion business, it can help to go to a school that has a great reputation in fashion. Those include Kent State University, Drexel, Parsons School of Design, and the Fashion Institute of Technology. Parsons and FIT are amongst the best in the world. The other two are very well respected, too. I also like the fashion design programs at RISD and Otis School of Art. <br>  <br>  You would go for your bachelors degree in a fashion related major. That would take four years. You'd also want to do an internship while you study, where you gain real-world experience working in the industry over a summer or similar. That's key to you getting a job when you graduate, as is going to a respectable school.

AA11607373	In all honesty, I think the 3 year education would be better for you. You're probably going to find it easy with your background, and I'm sure you want a comparable income and want to be challenged with some of it. I'm taking a business minor so I know there are differences between some of the managerial accounting and the cost accounting. You obviously need to know the basics to understand the harder stuff. With your experience you should be able to easier accept and understand the managerial stuff too. I'm having a difficult time trying to grasp some of the concepts because I have never managed anything at all.<br>  <br>  Is the insurance industry that bad? I wanted to be an underwriter in a year or so.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!<br>  <br>  *I still see the 3 year option as the better of the two. Thanks for your response too, I really appreciate it. I hope I find something when I look for a job.
3EIZ9vkeaa	well you need to put in 10 hours per subject per week. 5 hours worth of lessons per subject and then 5 hours of each subject on your own. It would be very hard but teachers will know if you are able. Health and social care is an easy subject but chemistry biology and psycology are very difficult. Im not sure about travel and tourism though. I think it would be a good idea to do the first year for some of them and then continue into the next year with full a levels. <br>  I think a lot of the exams have changed now though for the years below me but anyhow thats what ive found for me.
Nin6IawVaa	You are going towards the right path. You should have a goal. Only 2 years in community college and transfer in your second year to a 4 year University. Bachelors should only takes you total of 3 to 4 years inclusing community college.<br>  After that 2 years of Masters and 3  or less years for PHD. <br>  <br>  Make sure you get good grades. Also you should pick something which will give you good results. Education is investment.<br>  <br>  I am a Registered nurse with BSN. I spent total of 4 years in college. Now I am making over $75,000 a year. I wa son my 2 feet at the age of 23. You can also get Masters in Nursing and get even higher profession and money.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Ok. First you have to get your bachelor's degree in Psychology. You can get your associate degree in psychology at the community college and then transfer to a four year university to get your bachelor's degree in psychology. If you want to reduce the amount of years you spend in school, you can go to summer school every summer as a full time student. This will knock out a year plus from the total fours that it will take you to earn your bachelor's degree. Then you need to apply to a PhD program. You dont need to get your master's degree first. I entered a PhD program straight out of college. They have combine MS/PhD. <br>  <br>  I have a question for you do you want to do research? If you are interested in just the clinical aspect of psychology, you might want to look into psych D. programs in your junior year of college. Psych D.   is the equivalent of the PhD degree but you dont have to do research.<br>  <br>  I have included several links for you below that will teach you about all the different fields and degrees in Psychology.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/psychologycareer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apa.org/topics/psychologycare...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck my dear.<br>  ss|`|SNBG0Y5eaa	Any college level classes you take can be transfered to another college when you transfer and you will be credited for having completely those courses. Graduation isn't really determined by "years" but by the number of credits completely in required courses. <br>  <br>  If you know what school you want to transfer to, go over their graduation requirements to make sure the classes you are taking are transferable for credit. No sense in taking classes like taking 2 years of Math when you only need 1, etc. Also, be aware if the schools operate on different systems. It will affect the credits. For example one 4 unit Quarter class is not worth the same 4 credits as a 4 unit Semester class.<br>  <br>  As for the PhD, different schools have different curriculums and requirements, but generally what others posted about the Masters and the number of years is generally true. There are also differences if you pursue an academic doctorate or a professional one.<br>  <br>  One other thing about pursuing a doctorate, aside from the classes, research and teaching you will need to do, the most daunting part for any doctoral student is the dissertation, at least for academic doctorates. You have to prepare and write a dissertation on your research and it has to be on a specific unique topic. You will be considered the expert on this topic and your dissertation because you then have to come before a panel your professors (other experts in your field), and orally defend your dissertation. They will bombard you will all sorts of questions and arguments and you will have to prove your position on your dissertation. Only when you pass their scrutiny will they accept you as one of their own peers to receive a PhD.|`|gbeTKHYkaa	man... why do ya wanna doctorate? unless you plan on becoming a psych prof or a psychologist theres really no point.<br>  <br>  anyways, it takes 4 yrs of undergrad<br>  2 yr masters<br>  and about 4 more yrs for the Ph.D.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|D4BRrUVxaa	You need to get your masters before applying for a phd

You've already established the verb, to be, and the tense, 'has been'.<br>  <br>  People may use it, the same way they use ATM machine (automatic teller machine machine)- it doesn't make it correct grammatically.

Partridge and Beale's "A Dictionary of Catch Phrases" tracks it back to at least 1870 as a phrase said to a coachman, "Home, James, and don't spare the horses!" (<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nm3jbg0JalMC&pg=PA194&dq=%22%22Home,+James,+and+don%27t+spare+the+horses!%22&client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nm3jb...</a> )|`|d6d7a4423b15ef5c76be0e2b39ab81c8aa	It's more like, ''Home, James!" referring to your *driver* to get a move on.

It was more like, let's go. I use this expression when I'm in the car, ready to get a move on, speaking to the driver who may or not go by the given name James.

AA10331753	He is being ironic. Remember it is a funeral held by the people who just killed Caesar. If he spoke against them, he would probably be killed himself. So, he has to start out seeming like a friend to Brutus by saying he is an honorable man. But the proof he mentions would flunk him in any sophomore English class. <br>  <br>  He says that Brutus claimed the reason he killed Caesar was because he was ambitious. (He wanted to be king and overthrow the Roman republic.) For his proof he says that Caesar put the ransom money into the public treasury and refused the crown that Mark Anthony offerred him three times, etc. <br>  <br>  Each time he proves that Caesar was not ambitious, he casts doubt on Brutus's claim and tears away at Brutus's honor.  By the end of the speech, he has turned the audience's opinion around 180 degrees.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|55orqX2yaa	there are any number of things that it could mean, one that I personally like it that they would ger harrowed as the saviors of Rome, because they stopped Cesar in his conquest for power.

cYfjfCb9aa	A one-tailed test is used if you are testing a variable greater than a particular value or less than a particular value.<br>  <br>  For example, you might see something like:  find the probability that x is greater than 10.  Or else, find the probability that x is less than -5.<br>  <br>  A two-tailed test is used if you are testing a variable outside a particular interval.<br>  <br>  For instance, we might say find the probability that x is greater than 10 or less than -5.  Basically there will be two conditions that are being applied.  Potentially these could be expressed as absolute values initially as well, such as:<br>  |x|>5<br>  which means x>5 or x<-5.<br>  <br>  They're called one tailed and two tailed tests because if we visualize the normal distribution as a unit area under a curve, than if we set x>5 then just the right tail will be covered.  But if we set x>5 or x<-5, then we get areas under both tails of the function covered.<br>  <br>  Here's a quick link that you may find helpful, if nothing more than to see a visual representation:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-tailed_test" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-tailed_...</a>

50H9fgjdaa	<a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-union-la.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-unio...</a><br>  <br>  The Rise of Labor Unions During the Industrial Revolution<br>  <br>  The Industrial Revolution spread to America as well as France, Germany, Belgium and most of Western Europe in the 19th Century from Great Britain. Because of the shift of manufacturing to the forefront replacing agriculture in economic importance, American cities grew in number and size. Between 1860 and 1900 the count of American cities with populations of 100,000 inhabitants or larger grew from 9 cities to 38 cities. This trend is characteristic of societies experiencing industrial growth.<br>  Industrialization in America brought conflict and stress between businesses and the labor force as mechanized production begin to replace household manufacturing. In the 19th century, an effort to count the balance of power more evenly, the labor force began to form Labor Unions that would help them to bargain for better rights. The first of these were limited in being successful because of the imbalance of power. There were occasional strikes that showed the signs of conflict between employers and workers. Skilled craft workers were the only groups able to support a union during the Great Depression. The earliest labor organizations in the United States were started in New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the later end of the 18th century. These unions represented the crafts of printers and shoemakers. The American Federation of Labor union was the most successful mainly because they focused on improving the wages and working conditions of its members.<br>  <br>  As the United States became adjusted to the changes brought on by the growth of cities from new industry starting up, the government began to enact antitrust laws and regulations to control the excesses of big business. One of the first antitrust laws was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. It was created to prevent corporate trusts, monopoly enterprises formed to reduce competition and allow one business to control the price of a product or service. Laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act which was enacted in 1938, mandated the maximum 8-hour workday and 40-hour work week. Economic growth was soaring along with increases in workers' income.<br>  <br>  Governments in various countries were not in favor of the influence of labor unions in the beginning of the industrial revolution. They were thought to be illegal and cause manufacturing constraints. After the 1900 labor unions began to gain influence, governments began to work at preventing industrial conflict.<br>  <br>  References:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclo" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclo</a> pedia_761577952_5/Industrial_R evolution.html<br>  <br>  <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclo" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclo</a> pedia_761553112/Labor_Union.html<br>  <br>  hope this helped a little

mhFpZT3laa	Whichever has the better engineering department. In all honestly, they are so close in everything. Here are some general tips, all of which both schools fit. <br>  the biggest things to get into medical school, aside from GPA and MCAT scores, are that you have had interesting and meaningful experiences in:<br>  1) Community Service<br>  2) Medically related volunteering/work<br>  3) Research (most important for those wanting to go to a research heavy school)<br>  <br>  Everything else that you do outside of these three areas is what makes you unique, interesting, and can only improve your chances. I personally feel that one of my strongest features when applying was my dancing experiences. These three things, especially 1 and 2, are critical to many schools, because it shows both a tendency towards compassion and charity, as well as provides you with a basis to prove why you want to go to medical school. Because of this, here are my personal recommendations on selecting a school.<br>  <br>  1) Has a research program that is large enough to sustain undergraduate participation.<br>  Look for schools that have undergraduate thesis projects, undergraduate fellowship positions, etc. A school with Research 1 designation is great, because that means there are tons of research projects going on. If you never publish or present a paper, that's fine. However, doing so can be a major boost, especially if you are author or co-author, or even 29th author of a paper that makes it into a major journal like Nature. It does not necessarily have to be medically related research, but I would recommend it if you are contemplating MD/PhD.<br>  <br>  2) A moderately well known school.<br>  I personally would recommend limiting your choices to one of the top 200 or so schools. You want a school that has had a decent number of pre-meds, because this increases the chances of an admissions committee knowing something about the opportunities available at your school. It also increases your chances of getting good advising from a pre-med office. I am a member of the faction that believes that prestige is not a significant factor in the admissions process. Having gone to a public school that isn't even ranked in the Top 100, I have interviewed at a number of the Top 20, 10, and 5 schools. I personally believe that your own merits outweigh the name of your school significantly. This is not to say that I believe a 3.5 is the same as one school than another. Admissions committees often have "experts" on a given school, or look at statistics like the average GPA and MCAT score of pre-meds in past years. Thus, a 3.5 at Princeton might be more impressive than a 3.5 at John Doe public school, simply because the average GPA and MCAT score at Princeton is a 3.5/33, and a 3.5/28 at John Doe. Clearly, it was harder to earn a 3.5 and 33 at Princeton than a 3.5 and 33 at John Doe (though, the equal MCAT scores would somewhat minimize this). Suffice it to say that a 3.5 and 28 at Harvard isn't going to beat out a 3.8 and 31 at John Doe, all other things being equal. This being said, I feel that opportunities at the more prestigious undergrad schools outside of academics are excellent. However, I feel that any big public school like OSU, ASU, etc will have similar opportunities by virtue of their sheer size. Any school that made it in the top 200 should have enough of everything for you to succeed if you are good enough. If you are good enough at one place, you are good enough anywhere, so long as you aren't handicapped.<br>  <br>  3) A School with a medical school or that is near one.<br>  The inside man always has an advantage. If you went to Harvard College, you will have a stronger shot at Harvard Med. This is because you have three years to build relationships with the medical school, do research under doctors affiliated (and thus get letters) with the school, and become an expert on that school. The opportunity to work with doctors at any medical school probably increases your chances everywhere. There is always the chance that they will be recognized, and its a great way to get insight in academic medicine.<br>  <br>  4) Go to a school near a reasonably sized city.<br>  Cities have a lot going for them by virtue of their huge populations. There are all sorts of activities available in research, community service, and just fun things that will make you a more well rounded and interesting person. Being near a city means you will also be near at least a few good hospitals or clinics. This saves you on travel time and ease of access, as it is likely students from your school have already built connections with nearby schools.

74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	Main study tip: if your books are your own, write notes in the margins as you read.  If not, write notes on a separate sheet of paper, indicating the page # and paragraph.  This way, if you have to study, you'll have a shortened version of what you read that you can further refine into what you need to know.<br>  <br>  Other study tips: talk to your teachers about something you do not understand.  I know it can be intimidating, but if you don't get it, the teacher might be able to show you a new way of understanding it.<br>  <br>  Which major: depends on what you like to do and what your favorite classes are (not what you are best in, just what you enjoy).  If you like the humanities/history over math/science, you'll probably want a social science (like Sociology, Political Science, Business) if you are really good with numbers, think about Math and Statistics.  If you like experimenting, try a hard science (like Biology, Chemistry, or Physics).<br>  <br>  Really, it does not matter what you do, as long as you love doing it.  I did political science for my undergrad, which most people would tell you not to do, but I make six figures with a Master's, both developing government programs and teaching.  It all will work out if you really like what you are doing.|`|SOveWKxkaa	I am a college student and I regularly organize study groups on campus at the campus library. Studying in groups is a great way to better understand any subject. In my experiences with this I have found that the students that show up to a study group have a genuine interest, like you, to learn about the subject and are very willing to share any knowledge they have. You will find out that a peer review of a subject is really a great way to learn. You can usually reserve study rooms at your school or local library. Just mention it to your teacher and they should be more than happy to help you organize it. Good luck and I hope this information helps you to become what you want to achieve. It has worked very well for me.

Ok so when you put something in % it's out of 100. So 10/100 is 10%. 17/100 is 17%. Now turning a percent to a fraction... If you have 3% that's 3/100 right??? ok now for mixed numbers. If you have 4 and 3/5 you multiply the denominator(bottom number or 5) by the whole number(4) and add that to the numerator(top number or 3) you put all of that over the denominator. So that would be 23/5. Since a percent is out of 100 multiply the denominator(5) times 20 to get to 100. then multiply the top by 20 also. You would get 460/100 making it 460%! Trust me that seems weird, but It's right :)|`|mYyd8TqOaa	if you are taking a percent sign off you move the decimal 2 places to the left and if you are putting a percent sign on you move the decimal 2 places to the right.|`|3nGhryADaa	35%=.35<br>  .95=95%

leCSVYgAaa	Objects are "similar" if they are the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.  Objects that are the same shape and size are known as "congruent".<br>  <br>  But rectangles aren't necessarily all the same shape.  All squares are squares, all circles are circles, but rectangles can be long and thin or short and fat.  The only thing that defines a rectangle is that it has four right angles, but the pairs of sides can be in different ratios.<br>  <br>  All rectangles are not therefore similar.|`|AA12272543	They all have the same properties and can be squares.<br>  <br>  So, basically four connecting lines.  Each connecting at 90 degrees.

When something is said to be similar, it means that they have the same ratio and you can use one to figure out the other. <br>  Eg. a rectangle with sides 2 and 4 would be similar to a rectangle with sides 4 and 8...

UOz1LPIHaa	That's a tough one.  I promise it'll get better, though, so long as you're working toward that. . . it happens to the best of us.  I didn't believe that a few years ago, but I've been proven very wrong since then.<br>  <br>  I generally leave that sort of thing out unless it's definitely relevant to the case at hand.  This sounds like it may be relevant, but you don't want to go at this as "well, it's all my brain chemistry's fault" because that's not going to help you very much.  It'd be ideal if you can explain this more like "I'm doing X, and it's starting to help me, but. . . if all else fails, at least don't hate me as a person because I really don't *want* to look like a slacker".<br>  <br>  It depends on the kind of personalities you're dealing with whether you want to even say anything -- do they seem like people who'd care, or just file that away and ignore it -- but you could maybe explain that you were having a rough time, think you're on the road to better, and are wondering what you might be able to salvage right now if you can keep trying hard to get your life back.  I wouldn't expect a ton of accomodations for the past since there's not really a lot that can be done that's fair to everyone else who isn't depressed, but at least you wouldn't be sitting in class thinking they probably think you really don't care. . . the fewer negative conversations going on in your head about yourself, the better.|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	Well you could...<br>  But I doubt it would make much difference.<br>  Professors really could care less about your excuses for not doing well in class. The excuses only count to absences but your absences probably won't be excused, even with a note from your counselor, because it isn't a medical condition that makes you physically unable to attend class. And as I said, they really don't care about your reasons for getting bad grades. Well I mean they may care and be sympathetic but on a professional basis, they won't care because if they give you leeway then everyone else will start saying "Oh yeah, I'm depressed, let me skip the midterm!"<br>  <br>  If it's really as bad as you say then maybe you should take the semester off. Depression doesn't count as a viable excuse for missing class.

A college degree is essential for a copy editor.<br>  <br>  A thorough knowledge of English grammar and spelling is also important. Knowledge of another language or field, such as medicine or engineering, may also be useful on a specialized publication. Teachers sometimes move into textbook publishing in their subject area or grade level. Some schools teach copy-editing for those who want to enter publishing. Many schools offer courses in proofreading and magazine and book editing as well. To advance, copy editors need on-the-job training. In publishing, employees learn by doing.<br>  <br>  Work Environments<br>  Work environment. While some writers and editors work in comfortable, private offices, others work in noisy rooms filled with the sounds of keyboards and the voices of other writers tracking down information or interviewing sources. The search for information sometimes requires that writers travel to diverse workplaces, such as factories, offices, or laboratories, but many find their material through telephone interviews, the library, and the Internet.<br>  <br>  Advances in electronic communications have changed the work environment for many writers. Laptop computers and wireless communications technologies allow growing numbers of writers to work from home and on the road. The ability to e-mail, transmit and download stories, research, or review materials using the Internet allows writers and editors greater flexibility in where and how they complete assignments.<br>  <br>  Some writers keep regular office hours, either to maintain contact with sources and editors or to establish a writing routine, but most writers set their own hours. Many writers—especially freelance writers—are paid per assignment; therefore, they work any number of hours necessary to meet a deadline. As a result, writers must be willing to work evenings, nights, or weekends to produce a piece acceptable to an editor or client by the publication deadline. Those who prepare morning or weekend publications and broadcasts also may regularly work nights, early mornings, and weekends.<br>  <br>  As for your 2nd question, here’s a link.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos089.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos089.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

These symbols are used to construct the chemical formula of a substance. Eg. water, H2O and ammonia, NH3<br>  <br>  <br>  There are many different types of chemical formula. The formula may be empirical, molecular, condensed structural or complete structural formula.<br>  <br>  The molecular formula tells us the number and the type of atoms in a chemical element. The molecular chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6, sucrose is C112H22O6 and octane is C8H18<br>  <br>  The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements in a compound. For example, the molecular formula of hydrogen peroxide is H2O2 its empirical formula is HO. Like wise the molecular formula for octane is C8H18 and its empirical formula is C4H9.<br>  <br>  The structural formula tells us atoms are arranged in a molecule. This formula may complete or condensed. See vinegar as an example.<br>  <br>  A game of chemical bingo will be put up on the site to help students to learn the basic symbols and oxidation numbers of the most common ions.<br>  <br>  streak<br>  <br>  Streak is the color of a crushed mineral's powder. The color of a mineral's powder may differ from the actual color of the mineral. This property is useful for mineral identification.<br>  <br>  Almost every mineral has an inherent streak color, no matter what color the actual mineral is. For example, calcite occurs in many different colors, shapes, and varieties. But every single variety of calcite has a white streak. Streak is very useful in distinguishing two minerals with the same color but different streak. A fine example where streak is very useful is gold (yellow streak), and chalcopyrite (black streak).<br>  <br>  Most light colored, nonmetallic minerals have a white or colorless streak, as do most silicates, carbonates, and most transparent minerals. The streak test is most useful for identifying dark colored minerals, especially metals.<br>  <br>  <br>  here is asite that i found for you it might help<br>  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/11855022/Minerals-properties-like-colourluster-hardness-etc" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/11855022/Miner...</a>
a66nvk0taa	Barcelona one is very expensive city to live in. Plus they also speak Catalan there. If it was me I would got to Valencia, the lovely  Palau de la Música in Valencia.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Study has nothing to do with the location. You can study home well if you have appetite for the study, because the facilities and comfort you have in home and available no where. <br>  Barcelona or Valencia can't guarantee for distinctions. It depends on your interest and how serious you are.|`|btn32O2Iaa	If I was given the choice I would not choose either one. In Barcelona they speak Catalonian and in Valencia, they speak Valenciá. If I were you I would go to a location where they spoke a more neutral accent that will be good for you to handle yourself in any accent Spanish speaking country.<br>  <br>  The program I participated with is the most preferred student exchange program in Spain, and is the best lifestyle immersion experience available to those willing to learn Spanish culture and lifestyle. Santander, the capital city of Cantabria located on a beautiful bay and flanked by numerous beaches, is home to this exciting program. Santander is known for its cultural refinement, and an atmosphere typical of old Spain. Inhabitants spend hardly any time at home preferring instead to enjoy the beautiful weather and temperate climate of the region. Life is lived “on the street”: strolling along the pier; spending the whole day at “El Puntal”, a sand island you may reach by public boat; going for a coffee at one of the many “al fresco” terraces; or spending the entire day at the beach with friends and family. These pastimes reflect the relaxed Spanish way of living in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.<br>  <br>  Spain is a wonderful choice and the program www.beautifulspain.com, one of the best if not the best of the programs offered abroad world wide. Location is a safe and most amazingly beautiful beach resort in Northern Spain.<br>  <br>  Host families are extremely well screened and very loving. This program gets returnees year after year, so great it is.<br>  <br>  Cost is really reasonable considering everything included (as long as you sign up with this program through their web site as there are organizations that sell the same program for much more so high quality it is).<br>  <br>  This program is considered the most complete exposure to a foreign country because as they say it is true that it combines CLASSES (art, debate, street talk, folklore, among others) with FUN and EXCITING ACTIVITIES such as Latin Dance Classes, Bullfight, Boat Excursion, etc…, FULL DAY OUTINGS to places of historical and cultural interest such as prehistoric Altamira Caves, Guggenheim Museum, Roman Ruins, "Capricho de Gaudi", Roman Route Hiking adventure, etc... are also ALL INCLUDED IN THE PRICE while living with a local, loving and carefully selected HOST FAMILY. I know this program allows you to choose from several host families (the type of things this program does, no other program would ever) in order for everyone to be happy.<br>  <br>  It offers you the possibility of enrolling with a friend with whom to share same host family home, or for you to stay alone at host family. Many host families count on children of your same age.
Ip0wplAlaa	Ya, it will definitely help but it definitely won't be a deciding factor. Colleges look at grades, sports, extracurricular activities, SATs among other things that will make you stand out from the rest of the kids applying there. Good job!|`|iJzlRCkOaa	You would have a definite one-up when administrative officials are comparing your grades, SAT scores and the likes to a student who had similar grades, SAT scores and the likes, but was not in the National Honor Society.  But say you get a cumulative 1500 on the SAT (math, reading and writing sections) and are in the National Honor Society, but a different student got a cumulative 1950 and was not in the National Honor society.  They'd probably be better off because their scores were so high.  Having both good SAT scores and being in the National Honor Society will give you a huge boost.|`|1bf4705f1e3971ae9ff71220524b0d38aa	No, National Honor Society does not guarantee that you are more likely to be accepted to any college you apply to. All it states is that your grades were high enough to qualify for that club.|`|inWCSvM8aa	No, membership in NHS doesn't signify anything important. Because they don't require anything exceptional of you to be a member, it doesn't mean anything significant (plus, many members do not complete their volunteer hours and manage to stay enrolled). <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, it will help, but don't bank on getting into Yale based on your NHS membership.|`|wjA9ytO0aa	it looks good because it shows that you are smart enough to get in it and also that you do community service because that is one of the requirements once accepted|`|HL8PEDFLaa	It's not a guarantee that you will get in where ever you want to go, but it sure does look great as well as letters of recommendation you can get from them.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	yes...not a 'sure thing', but certainly 'more likely'<br>  <br>  colleges like to see NHS.|`|YFmXD25caa	Yes, being on the national honor society does somewhat increase your chances of being accepted to the collage you aspire to go to.|`|PvpCU2Bdaa	It increases your chances, but it depends on all your grades 9-12 and the degree you want to go for.|`|t9JZrCfCaa	If you are in extracurricular activities then maybe  yeah.. its all about your GPA.|`|fFRD3o22aa	No. It's good but not guaranteed any college. But hey, I got into my colleges and i was in NHS. good luck! :)

qZNvfdtfaa	I'd say try your textbook first. The internet is great, but if you already have a textbook it'll probably be easier to refer to it. I unfortunately don't know of any good websites since I learned this in class and I was fortunate enough to have a teacher who was good at what she did.<br>  <br>  Basics of stoichiometry goes like this...<br>  Moles refer to a unit that has 6.022x10^23 atoms of something. So one mole of hydrogen would have 6.022x10^23 atoms if it. It's used in chemistry because the elements are so tiny and we rarely ever use 1 atom of hydrogen. It becomes tedious to write scientific notation all the time, so the mole was adopted for this purpose. (Also known as Avogadro's number; might help you in your online search)<br>  <br>  So regardless of what the element is, one mole of one element will always have 6.022x10^23 atoms of it. This means that if you know the molar mass of an atom, eg hydrogen (1.01), then you can calculate the mass of a certain amount of hydrogen given. <br>  <br>  With respect to solving equations, you may be given reactants and products and asked to balance them. Based on the idea that nothing can come from nothing and something cannot just disappear into nothing, your elements are always conserved in an equation. <br>  <br>  For example,<br>  H2(g) + O2(g) --> H2O(l)<br>  <br>  This equation however is unbalanced right now... what happened to one of the oxygens? So you have to add in more hydrogens to make up for the fact that each water molecule uses 2 hydrogens. [if you don't know the little symbols represent the states of the elements. chances are you will be given them]<br>  <br>  2H2(g) + O2(g) --> 2H2O(l)<br>  <br>  Now everything balances out, nothing is lost. <br>  <br>  It's hard to tell you everything about stoichiometry, but I hope that helps somewhat... if you have a question you're stuck on try posting it here.

22oMednCaa	"Did he?" asks you whether he did it.<br>  ex: "I asked him to rake the leaves." "Well, did he?"<br>  <br>  "Didn't he?" asks you to CONFIRM whether he did it or not.<br>  ex: "He said he raked the leaves yesterday." "Well, didn't he?"|`|zgBelCROaa	they are basically the same. In did he you are unsure so you are asking. In didn't he it is more like you think he did it but you are just clarifying.|`|roe07rI8aa	one is in the positive - did he, one is negative didn't he (did he not). but essentially they are often transferable in a sentence. the first one is just more direct and nicer.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	one is  just  plain  question  with  no  hidden  meaning but<br>  <br>    "didn't he"  implies  a positive  answer expected<br>  <br>  didn't  he  tell you  to  clean your  room?<br>  <br>  sonya  is  on  the  right  track  but  its  more  like "did  he  not " or  "is  it  not  true  that  he  did"|`|RSeY6dHfaa	"did he" shows more uncertainty<br>  "didn't he" is more of confirming something<br>  <br>  it's basically the same, though. it means the same.|`|LfXJOk0baa	didn't he sounds like better English to me.|`|DD40eB5zaa	No because<br>  didn't means did not<br>  so does did not he make sense.........................<br>  Nope...........
AA12048033	yes!! your moms wrong. why cant you be her friend just cuz shes your kids teacher? well then as soon as the school year ends she wont be, so tell yur mom not to worry. btw the teacher is a human that can have friends duh!|`|QaEeITduaa	Parents can be friends with their children's teachers. When the summer comes and the school year is over, the teacher will no longer be your child's teacher. In some small towns, this would be unavoidable because the teacher might be your neighbor, you might go to church with the teacher, and the teacher's kids might be involved in the same activities as your own kid's activities.|`|QRrURcQDaa	It's perfectly fine, nothing wrong with having more friends. Good to be social.
aa596673c4a4b7827a51695b15eb9ae8aa	Okay according to this website her brother David fell from the roof in 1833.   He was born in 1808 and the article says he fell off the barn roof in the year 1833.  So I subtracted 1808 the year he was born from 1833 the year he fell and I got 25.  So the answer is he was 25 years old.<br>  Here is where I got the information.  Look under Capt. David Barton (1808-1888) <br>  <a href="http://www.clarabartonbirthplace.org/life/family" rel="nofollow">http://www.clarabartonbirthplace.org/lif...</a>|`|fEgK96Rhaa	David was born in 1808, not sure what month. He fell off the roof in 1833. Young Clara, 11 at the time cared for him for two years. So, he w3as 24 or 25, depending what month he was born and what month he fell off roof.<br>  <br>  also , edison was awarded 1,368 patents.
AAgX0SDcaa	You will be bored to tears. I worked there for 25 years and heard the students from out-of-state complaining so many times. The ones from Texas would drive home every chance they got. The weather is different too, very cold in the winter, very hot in the summer and a lot of allergens in the spring and fall. Watch out for the university police, they like to ticket students (for no reason other than having a nice car) moving in and out and also when they come back after winter break, heard those stories too. There are laws against party-houses, you can get a citation for noise violations at a party just for being there. If you live in the dorms don't get caught with alcohol or weed, there are snitches all over the dorms and cameras are hidden in the hallways, elevator landings, lobbies and tv lounges in each building.

4xYAYJjIaa	The answer above is NOT correct.  From 80 to 108 is not an 84% increase just by common sense.<br>  <br>  STEPS:<br>  1. find the difference between two numbers, in this case, it's 108-80 <br>  3. Second: Take the difference, 28, and divide by the original number: 28/80 = 0.35<br>  4. Lastly, multiply the number above by 100: 0.35*100 = 35%|`|33JrXPZraa	I'm pretty sure this is how you do it:<br>  <br>  80 Phones was what used to be one hundred percent of your phones.<br>  <br>  You find out how many phones you gained (108-80) and get that you added 28 phones.<br>  <br>  So to find out what percentage you gained you need to figure out how much percentage 28 phones would be of the original 80 phones.<br>  <br>  You use the equation 28 / 80 x 100 % and get 35 percent.|`|mYyd8TqOaa	i think its 86.4%|`|AA11099426	%= amount of increase<br>       -----------------------------<br>         original amount<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|XatJJQ6Yaa	im pretty sure you minus 80 from 180. then divide the answer by 80 times 100.
9Ijv5Mppaa	I would not call anything about Felician College "great." I would prefer to use the adjectives "decent" and "passable." Farleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, NJ has a better psychology program. Felician is not awful, but it's not the best school you could go to in New Jersey.
akxVJjVFaa	As a RN of 35 years, I am a diploma RN. The present day BSN programs focus on getting you to pass your boards and does not prepare you for life as an RN. <br>  More important than worrying if you are going to be accepted into your college program, what is your college NCLEX pass rate? I find that many programs, even the high paid private colleges, have poor pass rates. many do little to nothing to support those that struggle to pass the NCLEX once they have passed you through their program and have taken your money.<br>  My suggestion to you. is do not sweat the small stuff. If you do not get accepted into your program, consider taking a community college program that has a good reputation. Get your associates degree, then go onto to get your BSN. <br>  This will give you the ability to have your future employer pay for your future education. <br>  If you are hell bent on getting your BSN right away, check out the pass/fail rates of NCLEX at the colleges in your area. <br>  If you work in health care, ask the nurses where the best programs are. Interview the nurse managers and ask where do they see the best new grads gradate from and is there any program that they would recommend.<br>  Nurses are very opinionated and will be very open about this subject.<br>  i would also recommend that you start checking out Magnet Status facilities. These hospitals promote nursing and your experience in these types of facilities will be unlike any other hospital experience. <br>  <br>  Check out if there are internships available at these hospitals. This is where you may want to pursue working as a CNA to get experience and have an "in" at the facility level.<br>  Nursing is a very tough field. I have a son that after the military went onto attending community college for the first 2 years ( to save money) and then transferred to a private college for his last 2 years. <br>  <br>  He graduated last May and is presently working full time in SICU in the largest teaching hospital in the country. He is working to start his master in anesthesiology.<br>  Good luck in your future as an RN. Be smart and do your homework. Actually, when it all comes down to it, no one care where you graduate from, they just care that you passed your boards. You want a program that gives you the practical clinical experience and the knowledge to feel confident to practice nursing once you graduate.

6ep4bEApaa	It depends on what you are good at, to me physics, and calculus sound really hard, while Honors English was like taking candy from a baby. Ask your possible instructors for a syllabus if possible.|`|MNuS31nsaa	yeahhh...not good to take in your senior year. its gonna be stressful enough!|`|AA10432466	Smarty Pants|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Whether these classes are too hard depends on what your skill level is and how high your motivation is to do well. It may be a little stressful too, so consider your ability to manage stress and you time management skills as well. If you think you can handle it, go for it! Hard work only pays off in the end, and you are certainly setting yourself up for tons of college credit.|`|U3WgkkpHaa	Wayy to much.<br>  Take a maximum of 3 AP classes.<br>  It's senior year, have some fun.|`|GQ63zs4Taa	i think so.  its your senior year take it easy on yourself.|`|qwvijKexaa	damn, those classes are hard|`|QaEeITduaa	The classes may or may not be difficult for you as it depends upon your academic background, aptitute/intellectual abilities, your study skills, and your determination to succeed (motivation). Many students take those classes their senior year. Typically these are students who are college/university bound. In fact, some high school students are taking more advanced classes due to dual enrollment with colleges/universities and/or having skipped grades, meaning they are already enrolled full-time in the university. I imagine you'll have a lot of fun in physics, calculus, and statistics if you are good at mathematics. I wish you all the best in your studies! <br>  <br>  The above classes would be too difficult for some students but if your advisor allowed you to take the classes, then obviously they are just right for you, hopefully not too easy and not too difficult. I bet you'll do well regardless. The bottom line is study for those AP exams and get as much college/university credits as you can as that will save you money as you won't have to take those classes when you're at the university this summer or in the fall. If you're taking the classes you mentioned, I expect you to be at the university in the fall, for sure. <br>  <br>  A typical freshman university schedule, by the way, might include a continuation of Calculus or the next mathematics class such as Differential Equations, a science class (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), a Composition/Writing (English class), foreign language class, and then possibly another class that is in your major area or another university required class such as Government or US History. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PFwhxpZ4aa	Yes but if you think you can handle it then take them. Why are you cramming yourself with all these classes? The point is for you to retain all of the information you learn. Cramming like this will only stress you out and all of those AP courses require lots of attention. You will be stuck with no life or a miserable one at that. Most importantly colleges don't only focus on the classes you took but the extracurricular activities you do on your free time like volunteer work, being in clubs, etc. If you can handle all that then do it.|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Wow that's a lot of AP classes!  You must be really smart, good luck!  Just try not to get senioritis too soon because you don't want to mess up your grades and screw up your chances on college scholarships!|`|TUiT6uhpaa	As a teacher, I admire your ambition...But look, take some time out for yourself your senior year...Your senior year in high school is a one time thing...Have some fun!|`|f3b1660d1175bdca51838f4f15b36b49aa	Yes, they are hard but at least you will get the classes over with and have that behind you.|`|C0uMGfCCaa	I'd say if your a hard worker your fine but if you want a break get rid of one.|`|DZ74vzgNaa	Looks like you are setting a good challenge for yourself. Go for it.|`|AA10702959	not if you are committed|`|IU54cQhsaa	If depends on you. Yes they are hard. There are a lot of emotional and recreational activities that come with senior year and you are going to miss out on life if you carry such a heavy course load. If you are set on getting ahead you could conisder taking duel enrollment courses where you go to the community college (or a universtiy near-by) for part of your day. Those classes were much easier for me than the AP courses.|`|tSmAPBIJaa	As long as you are good with time management, I am sure you will be fine. I am sure AP/honors classes aren't anything new to you so you should know what to expect with these. The only things that you may find more challenging are the AP Exams. You said you are really good at math so I think you should be good to go!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|5THeZfQhaa	**** yeah those are hard classes to be taking even if it is your senior year.

22oMednCaa	Hmm. That is a good question!<br>  <br>  Just tradition, I'm sure.<br>  But here's my attempt to make sense of it:<br>  "Apple juice" refers to the juice of an apple.<br>  Whereas "applesauce" is a sauce MADE entirely of apples.<br>  <br>  There's no danger of any kind of confusion with "apple juice." But if you split applesauce into two words ("apple sauce") it might seem like a sauce that goes ON apples? (Like, "pasta sauce" goes ON pasta, it's not MADE of pasta.) Or it might seem like a sauce that's mostly apple-flavored, which is not really accurate. (Like, "meat  sauce" is meat-flavored, but it's not purely meat.)<br>  <br>  BTW, out of curiosity, I Googled "apple sauce" with a space, and there were quite a few results (mostly recipes and stuff). So it looks like there are plenty of people who DO make it two words. Go figure.|`|zgBelCROaa	apple butter<br>  apple pie<br>  Whoa that is weird. maybe cause there are a whole lot of different juices so it is like saying the type of juice. And yes there are a lot of sauces but they are not the same type of sauce as applesauce. Applesauce is it's own thing.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	good  point  just  one  of  those quirks  of  language  that  happens  over  300 years <br>  <br>  the word  was  coined  in  1704|`|2ngFj00Iaa	Weird..

eb0de548cca40ce9e757fc0199994394aa	Your Answer:<br>  No, you aren't stupid. Intelligence is tricky to measure, and most online sites are lousy at doing so. You may be smarter in certain areas like language/social studies, but weaker in math/science. That is a fairly common thing. Part one of recognizing how to improve is figuring out where your weaknesses are and working towards building on them. seek help. There's no shame in that. You also might want to see what careers you can capitalize on your strenghts are. you are pretty young to be commiting to something like medical school, keep your option open. Besides, it may eb that you have a capacity to be a brilliant scientist or doctor, but the one teacher writes tests that are hard to understand or presnts the materials in a way that doesn't jive with your learning style. <br>  <br>  Tests you should take online are leanring style inventories and personality assessments (similar to an MBTI), to see what your strengths are. Your guidance counselor should also have access to these tests.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	It sounds like you may be a little bit of an underachiever, and it's a common problem for students of above-average intelligence.  I went through the same thing myself.  Until now you've probably been able to pass most of your classes with only minimal studying.  Now, possibly for the first time, you're studying a subject where you can't depend solely on your brainpower and you actually need to study hard.  Spend more time studying and have a friend quiz you on the latest chapters to see if you're prepared for the test.|`|44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	It was my experience that the farther along you go in any science, the harder it gets.  My recommendation is that you study the morning of the test so everything is fresh in your mind.  I started making A's when I did that.|`|2OL1VFxnaa	I wonder if you are bored!  No seriously don' t laugh!  If you are not challenged by what you are trying to learn some times we just stop taking it in all together!<br>  <br>  Talk to your teacher about this problem you are having. He/she may have some ideas to stimulate you. <br>  <br>  Also, look at the teaching techniques.  We all learn better in different ways.  Is it possible your other classes are more reading? More verbal? or more hands on?  <br>  <br>  As we learn new things, its obviouse in school particularily, they get harder. So 1st semester may have been allot easier to grasp as well. Its not that you are stupid, or dumb.  But i would take the other suggestions i wrote, and bring them to your instructor.<br>  <br>  good luck, and its nice to see a 14yr old so concerned.  And your writing is amazing|`|3OoCiOkAaa	Biology at your level is remembering diagrams and principles. Therefore  you do need to rely on your memory more than  you think.<br>  <br>  <br>  Science for me became easier the harder it because I realised you had to link it with other aspects. For instance you cannot half remember the function of the kidney or confuse it with the liver. Otherwise it shows confusion. I would say you simply need to understand biology you cannot half understand it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Advice<br>  <br>  <br>  Diagrams - for everything. Remembering one good diagram will guarantee top marks in any biology exam and it cuts out on the revision and stress of recalling under pressure in an exam. If you visualise you can link many processes together<br>  <br>  Use Mnemonics and Acronyms  for processes or remembering difficult names. They stay in your long term memory - which is the place at the back of your brain. If you try to cram  abstract info in your brain in no order it will stay in your short term memory and become confused with other processes.<br>  <br>  Skin = <br>  H for Heat Regulation<br>  P for Protection<br>  P for Production<br>  S for Sensation<br>  E for Excretion<br>  <br>  I know this is incomplete but my mnemonic  would be  <br>  Happy <br>  People <br>  Pass <br>  Sats <br>  Exams. <br>  <br>  You get the picture?  It is a memory aid and biology requires memory at your stage.  It saves me panicking and I would write  my mnenomics in my plan.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Invent your own  glossary for instance - give at least one example of the process, object or term. e.g <br>  <br>  <br>  Osmosis =<br>  Diffusion =<br>  Hinge joint = Knee joint limited movement and stability<br>  Ball and socket joint= in hip joint allows for free movement<br>  Oxidation= <br>  Hydrogenation= <br>  Detoxification =<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Science became easier for me as I travelled up the academic ladder, because I was dyslexic. I had invented memory aids for dyslexia  which aided me in recalling my science. I have two science degrees and a MSc in Exercise Physiology. <br>  <br>  <br>  Your are adept in your use of the English Language , therefore I wouldn't discount scientific writing or even law as a career.<br>  <br>  You are  a refreshing  interlude in the world of text, slang and illiteracy which is often seen on Y. A. I salute you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Someone asked me a biology question the other day   and I gave them a diagram which answered all their questions.<br>  <br>  Ensure your diagrams are clear accurate and then remember these. You should have no problems<br>  <br>  <br>  PS my IQ is average and possibly  slightly lower than average   I have a good memory for facts and I understand principles- which makes me a lateral and novel thinker.|`|lYK61Ycbaa	Maybe u just need to concentrate more in class. Listen properly. Take really good notes. Do your HW on time. And revise before a test. Its what I do. <br>  <br>  Just bcoz ur smart doesnt mean that you wont have 2 spend more time on a particular lesson. Some u may not even need to study for to get As. Some need much more effort. Dont lose your motivation. And dont forget that you dont have to be equally talented in all areas.
debe1637ce1e911c58445b0c39b08566aa	screw mia a shes wrong she should get fired!!!!!|`|DbcL5Rasaa	I think she should be fired; however, with the need of teachers willing to teach for such low salaries, it's very unlikely she will actually get fired. Even if she does suck big balls. In this society, teens or children aren't taken into consideration about things like this anymore. We have no voice.|`|s0XR8cxLaa	heck yes. <br>  my teacher is the same exact way<br>  he doesnt let us fix our hair or put chapstick on<br>  even the earring rule: earrings have to be as small as a dime!!<br>  wtf! my teacher is a b.i.t.c.h <br>  he's not a good teacher and he can't even speak proper english<br>  he acts tough and every thing but i really think he's gay<br>  and his favorite students are boys!!<br>  <br>  so yes hell yea if you can do something<br>  get her fired!<br>  <br>  i totally agree on her getting fired<br>  and on top it's true cuz other ppl<br>  backed you up|`|h28dMdYfaa	yes|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Yes. Start an online petition and have kids sign it. Or just a regular one.|`|AA11043457	That is a decision by the administration.  I won't get brownie points for this but would she need to tell you to shut the *F** up if you were not talking in class?  The teacher needs some training in assertive discipline beause it appears sh is not controlling the class well enough. Perhaps the principal is not supporting her enough in giving detention or whatever.  No student can learn if others are talking instead of listening to the teacher and it disrupts the entire class.  And the class is no place to do hair.  That should be done before class or in the restroom. I'd not want someone's hair flying all over near me.<br>  <br>  The teacher does seem a bit out of control, but it is beause you students are out of control.  It is obvious that you have no respect for her and that is not good.  She is an adult and you should treat her with some respect and then  you will likely find you receive more respect.   This lady is probably overwhelmed by this lass.  I might be as well from the way you describe yourbehavior and that of your friends.  <br>  <br>  You seem to think it is the teacher's job to teach you, but what about your job to learn?  Are you doing your part?  I think not.  Maybe you don't have to mind at home but at shool you are expected to come in, sit down, shut up and get out your books and get ready for class. If you have a bit of time before class, sure you an talk to one anotther but when the bell rings, you should be ready to work.<br>  <br>  I wonder if the teaher would behave differently if class went that way.  I don't know if the administration will fire her or not.  If she continues not giving proper discipline to the students and they are wild, then they may replace her. And you could have worse.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, no she should not be calling you names.  While I agree with her take on many parents not doing their job, it was inappropriate for her to say that to you about your parents when she doesn't know how hard they have tried.  She is frustrated and doesn't seem to be able to overome the problem with lack of self discipline of the students.  <br>  <br>  I hope you will go to class in a mood to learn as much as  you can.  In a few years, if you go to college you will be paying for the education and no one will hold your hand. You will simply be asked to leave the class if you smart off or don't shut up.  And the college teacher will likely get the support needed and you may be paying and be outside the class.  I had a prof who told us once that it wasn't his job to teach us but ours to learn. I think he was only partly right.  He made learning more difficult, but I did learn from that class.  I hope you begin seeing your class as an opportunity to learn, too, and that you spend more time disciplining yourself than looking at how to get the teacher fired.|`|28pcgUw4aa	I'm a teacher and have never cursed in front of my students or at them, but I have gotten very angry with them and yelled in other ways (without cursing).  It always takes two to tango.  People have such ideas about how teachers should behave and how professional they should be, forgetting that teachers are abused too.  I have a student who I have liked all along who I found out was calling me a ***** to other students.  He was calling me a ***** because I got on the case of one of his classmates who...when I asked her a question (school-work related...'please put your vocabulary word in a sentence') said nothing but just glared at me.  Yeah...just flat our refused to answer and just glared at me.  I have another student in a lower grade who I also have liked all along; smart kid who behaves well in class.  I heard from another student that he was making fun of my name to other kids.  So my point is...well, try to see teachers' side of things too.  It is not always as though kids are these nice people who teachers just blow up at.  Kids often disrespect the teachers.|`|igAFIEk7aa	I am sorry, but I don't think she will be fired for this. Some teachers have done alot worse and still have their job. The way I see it is, you are stuck with her. Don't do anything to piss her off. You need to play the "game". You only have her for one semester or year, so learn to live with it and try your best to do well in her class. The truth is there are so many stupid people in the world, and we need to not let them ruin our life ie: education. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|kQea8cJ0aa	My first question is "What would be so great about getting a person fired?"  "Could you live with yourself knowing you got someone fired?"<br>  <br>  I agree that this person needs attention and help with her classroom skills.  Let your parents handle this problem and you need to just really study.  You do your job and some studying on your own and let the adults handle the teacher.<br>  <br>  Be respectful to the teacher and treat her kindly and maybe she will notice that all the kids are nicer than she is.<br>  <br>  Gail
AA10988215	Undergraduate:  Usually a Bachelors degree such as a BA (arts), a BSc (science), a BEd (Education) or a BEng (Engineering) to name a few.  Confusingly, in Scotland (particularly in the older Universities) a BA is sometimes known as an MA (Master of Arts) but this is not the same as a postgraduate MA.  If your bachelors degree is an honours degree it will be classified in the following way based on your performance in coursework and exams:<br>  First (top honours classification)<br>  Upper Second (2.1)<br>  Lower Second (2.2)<br>  Third (lowest honours classification)<br>  An honours degree takes 3 or 4 years depending on which country of the Uk you study in.<br>  <br>  Postgraduate:  These are done after completion of an undergraduate honours degree.  They vary from a PGCert (Postgrad certificate) and PGDip (Postgrad diploma) which take a few months, to Masters degrees such as MA (arts) and MSc (science) which last a year.  There are also Doctorate degrees such as DPhil and PhD which are primarily research degrees as well as applied doctorates such as DClinPsyc which is a doctorate in clinical psychology.  A Doctorate typically takes 3 years.<br>  <br>  The merit of all undergraduate honours degrees is the same-one is not 'better' than another as such.  A postgrad qualification adds to the knowledge learned at undergrad level and usually the longer a postgrad qualification takes the higher the merit (e.g. from PGCert up to a Doctorate).  However, you do not have to work your way through them all-some people are accepted onto a PhD with just an undergrad honours degree whilst others have already completed a postgrad Masters.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|4CQf9G4kaa	Under graduate is a 3/4 year degree<br>  <br>  Bachelors degree is what you get when you do an undergrad<br>  <br>  Post graduate is a course you can do once you have completed an under graduate degree. It can be a post grad diploma (like doing an under grad degree only in 2 years) or PHd (a research degree that can take many years e.g. 5/6 years)<br>  <br>  Masters degree a course you can only do once you have completed an under grad degree. It only takes one year.<br>  <br>  2:1 and 2:2 are grades you can achieve when doing your degree. 2:1 is a higher mark than 2:2. 1:1 is the highest you can achieve.<br>  <br>  hope this helps a little|`|IXskJPlVaa	All Bachelor's Degrees are also called Under Graduate and after that all Degrees are Post Graduate - including - Masters, M.Phil, Phd, DSc et al. No best or worst. Only area of specialisation which depends on your interest and aptitude.

Bachelor Degrees and Associate Degrees are two types of Under graduate degrees.<br>  <br>  Once you graduate college, you do your Post graduate work.  If you are smart, have enough money to pay for it, do all the work on time and pass, you will be awarded a Graduate or Master's Degree upon graduating from Graduate school.  You can obtain a Master's Degree in most every field.  The Masters in business is called an MBA.<br>  <br>  There is no best or worst, it is in how it is used.  It would be more valuable to have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics than a Graduate or PhD in Basket Weaving if you are talented in Math.  It would be more valuable to have a PhD in Basketweaving than a PhD in Math if you were talented with textiles.<br>  <br>  The numbers are simply course load ratios.|`|AA10023710	You are in the UK, correct? <br>  <br>  The bachelors degree is the first degree you get at university. It's an undergraduate degree. <br>  <br>  Post-graduate studies are degrees and certificates that you can get once you already have a bachelors degree. They include a master's degree, a PhD, and post-graduate certificates. <br>  <br>  The 2:1 and 2:2 that you mentioned are undergraduate (bachelors) degree classifications. You graduate with, for example, a 2:1 bachelors degree in physics. The 2:1 indicates what marks you got. <br>  <br>  In the UK, you can graduate with:<br>      * First-Class Honours (First or 1st)<br>      * Upper Second-Class Honours (2:1)<br>      * Lower Second-Class Honours (2:2)<br>      * Third-Class Honours (Third or 3rd)<br>      * Ordinary degree (Pass)<br>      * Fail (no degree is awarded)<br>  <br>  Again, which you get is determined by what grades/marks you got in your course.

When you apply, even if you aren't certain, choose the major you're most likely to go for.  You don't have to stick to it if you find out in college that it isn't waht you really want.  Its a good idea to be involved in at least one academic club (as opposed to a social one) or a club that involves your career of interes, and be sure to have some community service under your belt.|`|MBqoeaEJaa	don't worry...WELL ACTUALLY DO...but there is a solution...you can try REALLY hard now....i failed 2 classes my freshmen year and now i have a GPA OF 3.34...|`|N8wNmQShaa	If you get really high scores on your SAT's... colleges will accept you even if you have a low GPA.<br>  <br>  They will want to know why it is so low, but if you have a strong JR and SR year with high SAT scores, you can get into some good schools.<br>  <br>  Racking up lots of community service hours plays huge dividends when it comes to your character and who they will choose.<br>  <br>  Playing sports, and joining clubs is another good idea that will help them make a decision.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you are as busy as you can be, and your grades are ok... with good SAT scores, you can get into good colleges.<br>  <br>  If you bomb the SAT scores, and your grades are average... you could go to a Community College for 2 years, and transfer to a University for your 3rd and 4th year.

spVv3Icqaa	Hi! Great question! You've got the right idea!--Chemistry, Biology, some Math, and probably at least some basic Computer Science course(s). Also, there are various types of forensic science, but if you have in mind that you'd like to work with the FBI or other government agency, or be there to collect homicidal evidence and things like that, yeah, you're thinking in the right direction. If that's what you're thinking about, Criminal Justice classes would probably also be very helpful! <br>  <br>  As far as the levels of these subjects, I would check into colleges which appeal to you most as to what they require.

gbCB0ohJaa	Whether it's normal depends on your field and the university.  What it means is worth inquiring about directly - is it expected that most students receive funding later for the rest of their degree programs, given sufficient progress in the first two years?  Perhaps the first two years of funding comes from the department or TAships, but the tradition there is for supervisors to support students directly for the later years of their program.  Also, you probably want to get more specific information about typical program completion times in the department before assuming you would be done in four years.  UK doctoral programs typically take less than that, US doctoral programs frequently take significantly longer due to the onerous requirements of coursework and exams, and Canadian ones somewhere in between.

However, teaching may be frustrating when one is dealing with unmotivated or disrespectful students. Occasionally, teachers must cope with unruly behavior and violence in the schools. Teachers may experience stress in dealing with large classes, heavy workloads, or old schools that are run down and lack many modern amenities. Accountability standards also may increase stress levels, with teachers expected to produce students who are able to exhibit satisfactory performance on standardized tests in core subjects. Many teachers, particularly in public schools, are also frustrated by the lack of control they have over what they are required to teach.<br>  <br>  Teachers in private schools generally enjoy smaller class sizes and more control over establishing the curriculum and setting standards for performance and discipline. Their students also tend to be more motivated, since private schools can be selective in their admissions processes.<br>  <br>  Teachers are sometimes isolated from their colleagues because they work alone in a classroom of students. However, some schools allow teachers to work in teams and with mentors to enhance their professional development.<br>  <br>  Including school duties performed outside the classroom, many teachers work more than 40 hours a week.

x15ek422aa	As two of the great traditions within the religion of Judaism, the Orthodox and Reform branches share a common heritage and provide a spiritual home for a number of people. While originating from the same experiences, both Reform and Orthodox Judaism understand Jewish identity in ways that differ in a number of areas. Here are a few examples of the differences that are found between Orthodox and Reform Judaism.<br>  <br>  One area of difference has to do with the interpretation of sacred texts. Orthodox Jews have maintained an understanding of both scriptural writings and rabbinical teaching that is somewhat literal. Because of this literal understanding, an Orthodox Jew will tend to be very strict in the beliefs of a literal messiah who is yet to come, a literal restoration of the promised land, and a literal life after death. By contrast, Reform Judaism tends to be more conceptual in its approach to scripture and historic rabbinical teachings. While still revering sacred writings and the work of rabbis through the ages, Reform Jews tend to see scripture as writings that are about the ongoing consecration of the house of Israel to God. Within that understanding, Reform Judaism tends to approach the scriptural texts without deeming them to be infallible.<br>  <br>  The status and function of women within Judaism is also different between the two branches. Reform Judaism differs in the inclusion of women in the act of worship in two significant ways. First, men and women are not segregated in a Reformed service. This is different than in Orthodox worship, where men and women are not allowed to sit together. The Orthodox tradition on seating is often connected back to the concept that the female is ritually unclean during menstruation. Rather than isolate women who are currently experiencing a menstrual period, all women are segregated from the men. Another school of thought determines that women are a distraction to the men from the focus of worship, and that both genders benefit from being separated during the time of worshiping. Reform congregations do not consider either of these reasons, or any other reasons, to be sufficient to cause males and females to be segregated during worship.<br>  <br>  The second difference involving the status of women has to do with function within the community. The Reform tradition has been open to women as rabbis, cantors, and educators for a number of years. Many Reform congregations cherish the presence of women in all these roles and believe the full inclusion of women in these central functions of the congregation has enriched the worship experience. By contrast, these are all roles limited to men within the Orthodox tradition. Seeing these roles as directly designated by God for men only, the idea of a woman occupying any of these roles would be considered an affront to Deity as well as to the congregation.<br>  <br>  To a degree, the different approaches to the roles of women within the faith are directly tied back into the interpretation of Jewish law and scripture. The approach of Orthodox Judaism to a literal understanding of Jewish law and a belief in the infallibility of scripture will no doubt continue to be the norm. By contrast, Reformed Judaism is likely to continue to proclaim that law and scripture are to be honored but considered to be guidance. With one tradition being highly detailed and focused, while the other allows a great deal of room for individuals to develop their personal beliefs within the context of a caring community, the gulf between the Orthodoxy and Reform Judaism is likely to widen even further in the years to come.

I am in the OT program at a University in Detroit, and you do not necessarily need a separate major to get accepted into the MOT program.

Most schools have full-time programs, although a growing number are offering weekend or part-time programs as well. Coursework in occupational therapy programs include the physical, biological, and behavioral sciences as well as the application of occupational therapy theory and skills. Programs also require the completion of 6 months of supervised fieldwork.<br>  <br>  People considering this profession should take high school courses in biology, chemistry, physics, health, art, and the social sciences.

qZNvfdtfaa	For any quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the way to solve it is to look at the coefficients and think Which numbers are equal to ac and adds up to/has a difference equal to b?<br>  <br>  So looking at this equation, what numbers multiply to 2 and add up to 3? 1 and 2. Thus your factors are (2x+1)(x+1). Since you have a +3 as your middle term and +1 as your constant, you know that you must have plus signs in the factors because that is the only way to get the positives. If you had (2x-1)(x-1), you would have -3x in the middle and if you had (2x-1)(x+1) or vice versa you would not get the +1 as your constant.|`|33JrXPZraa	You know that the first part of the factoring has to be 2x and x because those are the only things you can multiply to get 2x^2 so you have<br>  (x   )(2x   )  <br>  <br>  you also know that the second digits of both have to be 1 because those are the only whole numbers you can multiply to get 1.<br>  <br>  That means you know (2x   1)  ( x   1)<br>  <br>  Now all you have to do is figure out the signs.  Since it positive one they either have to be both negative or both positive and because you have a positive 3x they have to be positive.<br>  <br>  That gives you (2x + 1) ( x + 1) - then you can just multiply it out to see if it's the same answer. <br>  <br>  If you don't know right away on another problem try listing out all the possible numbers it can be and if you have to - just keep trying different combinations until you get your answer

AA10176626	Cn:<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a single mother grant. The "kits" that you have seen are scams.<br>  <br>  Scam artists are telling you the truth about one thing - the government does give out plenty of grants every year. But what the scam artists are also relying on is the confusion that most people have about what a grant is for. Grants are not free money from the government to help you out. That's the biggest lie of all.<br>  <br>  The federal government does not provide ANY grants for personal financial assistance. When I say "any", I mean exactly that. There are no grants for single mothers, no grants for white people, no grants for unemployed people, no grants for former prisoners of war, no grants for ugly people, no grants to fix up your house, no grants to pay your electric bill, no grants to help prevent you from losing your home, and no grants for people who can't run the 40-yard dash in under 15 seconds.<br>  <br>  A government grant is a payment that the government provides to an organization that does something that the government considers useful or necessary. The government gives grants to social service organizations to establish a program to feed the homeless. The government gives grants to libraries to help the library put together a collection of one-of-a-kind artifacts of local history. The government gives grants to research laboratories that are searching for ways to prevent biological terrorism. <br>  <br>  All of these grants have one thing in common - the grant applicant promises to "do something". To "win" a grant, you have to apply, and convince the government agency that you are uniquely qualified to tackle that challenge.<br>  <br>  Being a single mom is not something that you're doing for the government.<br>  <br>  What you're looking for is not a grant. You are looking for a government benefits program. Government benefits include food stamps, TANF (which used to be called welfare), energy assistance, the GI Bill for veterans, disaster relief, and a whole host of other programs. Most of these benefits are known as "means-tested" benefits, because you don't qualify for them by being something, you qualify for them by having very low income.<br>  <br>  The government has a great site that provides information about pretty much every benefits program available - you can find that at <a href="http://govbenefits.gov" rel="nofollow">http://govbenefits.gov</a> . <br>  <br>  Do not pay for any "grant" program - every commercial, every website, and every guide is a scam.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this information helped you.|`|OSQnP4owaa	I found information on grants for single parents.

It was hilarious.  My guess is that those in the UK would view it as being much like a "southern" accent sounds in the United States, but I will follow the answers here to see what non-Americans think.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|DaokQBKhaa	Interesting question. Yeah I'd say the Southern accent is picked up on quite a lot in the UK. Some people will like it and some will dislike it. Probably more will dislike it to be honest.<br>  <br>  A lot of non-Americans will probably find it quite nasal and croaky and just a bit too...American.

For Product Design and not engineering - NID Ahmedabad (In India) is also a good option. Best of luck.|`|btX6mM3Taa	I'm sure you can. It would always look good to have the mechanical engineering degree.|`|zdRTozVxaa	Oh, there is most definitely a link. Mechanical engineering deals with machines in general whereas automotive engineering deals with a specific kind of machine...an automobile. <br>  <br>  While I don't believe that they'd hire someone with one degree to work in a field that requires another, there is a chance that if the other people that applied are less qualified that you'll get the job. <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to try to go (if you have the time or you can afford it) and take a few automotive classes if you haven't already. If you've got a mechanical engineering degree with a few automotive classes tossed in then it'll look way better on a resume'. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

Maybe there's a crack in the floor or a slippery spot.<br>  <br>  Figuratively, it often refers to behavior, meaning to check yourself, make sure your behavior is appropriate for the situation.

In the literal, or direct, sense, it means to be careful when walking.

For instance, if you haven't read the Iliad or the Odyssey, you'd have a lot of trouble writing about #3.  It might help to know that a lot of the female characters in the I and the O were deities, so they could be stronger than mortal (real) women.<br>  <br>  Are you bad at writing essays because your writing skills aren't strong, or because you don't bother learning the material?|`|BnistnrIaa	know little about the Athens.

mrKaKWZtaa	so if the question was a car put if you would measure it in grams, meters, ect and them how many grams/kilograms you think the car weighs.|`|msNXomjTaa	Mass is the amount of "stuff" a thing has.<br>  <br>  People use it to describe weight, although this is incorrect.  However, if does give a fair idea.  E.g., 2.2 pounds is about the same as 1 kilogram.  Except, pounds are weight, and kilograms are mass, but a 1 kg mass will weigh 2.2 pounds a scale, at least on earth.  In space, it will weigh nothing, although it will still have a mass of 1kg.<br>  <br>  Capacity sounds like volume, although I am not sure; I've never heard that term used in this way.  1 kg of water has a volume of 1 litre.  A litre is a bit bigger than a US quart (and smaller than a Imperial quart).<br>  <br>  So, to measure a banana, you would use mass, and it would be about 1/4 kg.  To measure a car, you would also use mass, and it would be about 1000kg.<br>  <br>  To measure the amount of air in a soccer ball, you could calculate it, or estimate, which is pretty much an educated guess.  I think it would hold about 5 litres.  A cup of milk would be about 250 ml (millilitres).<br>  <br>  A bucket might hold 10 litres.
Hi5h9739aa	It was said by Patrick Henry.  He said it because he wanted a free nation.  He would rather die than live under a king.  He also said it to help raise supportors to form a Virginia militia for the war.

If you are going to start applying to college, take some easier classes and see if you can bring it up just a tad bit.  It is a B/B- average, which isn't that bad.  It will get you into some pretty good colleges, especially if you have some extracurricular activities, but, like I said, it is not going to get you into Ivy league.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  <br>  'Til Next Time<br>  <br>  Slok K<br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  <br>  Just saw your note, colleges do send it to people that are looking, not just to people who they are letting in.

Speed-of-light calculations are what confirmed that the universe is expanding. And because light takes a certain amount of time to get here, when we look at the stars, we're literally looking back in time, to what the universe was like millions of years ago:<br>  <br>  "The speed of light is particularly important in astronomy. Due to the vast distances involved it can take a very long time for light to travel from its source to Earth. For example, it takes 13 billion years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago (near the beginning of the universe)."<br>  Speed of light (in astronomy): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#Speed_of_light_in_astronomy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_li...</a><br>  Speed of light (in cosmology): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#Speed_of_light_and_cosmology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_li...</a>

oSCBIHOYaa	According to the link you sent me, Lily, I don't think so. Here's what I think, you should probably gather all other scholarships and grants. Little ones put together can create a large savings bond. Like a lot of people say, you will have to be a genius to get a scholarship. It's not just being able to achieve a perfect score on the SATs or having a 4.0 gpa, but its also achieving something so outstanding that you get on the news. <br>  The best solution is to search for possible scholarships. Intel, Westinghouse, National Merit are all very good ones. The only problem is that they are super hard and very competitive. If you can win that, then most likely, you can get a scholarship from Harvard or the Ivy Leagues. <br>  I, personally, want to go to Princeton. You can tell since, it is princetoncinderella1414. Lol. Well, google it and see what you get. To the person that wrote something about googling it, google is actually a very good idea. One book I suggest you buy is High School to do list. They have many scholarships for freshmen. Some offer as much as 100,000.00 and no one knows about it. Well, not many do, really. There are so many scholarships in sociey and not a lot of people know about it, and we as Technites, should have the ability to find and win that money! <br>   Btw, as unbelievable it sounds, Harvard is actually, in my knowledge, is the easiest to get a four year scholarship. Moneywise, they, of all Ivies and schools, is the most generous with their money. For most people, the only problem is to get in that school. It is best, however to not rely on getting a grant from the Ivy League colleges.|`|fECPKXfxaa	Some might you can try googling it. Lol i highly doubt they will though because u need to be reeeeeeeeeealllllly smart to get in one and suuuuuuper smart to get a scholar ship for part and a GEEEEEEENIUS to get a full scholar ship!
WpGROxH8aa	"I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today, it means getting along with people." - Gandhi.<br>  <br>  He means that at one time leadership (or maybe power) was equated with strength (maybe having a lot of weapons) but now leadership is best described as being able to cooperate.<br>  <br>  Since Gandhi led a very successful passive resistance, this is certainly demonstrated in his life. This quote as well as Gandhi's actions show that we can accomplish great things without physical or military force.

GeIwAUvNaa	Crawford Long, a dentist, discovered ether (and anesthesia) about 150 years ago.  Is that it?|`|zgTsCicNaa	?Dr. Crawford Williamson Long was born on November 1, 1815 in Danielsville, Georgia. He attended his medical education at the University of Pennsylvania. On March 30, 1842, Dr. Long excised on one of two tumors from the neck of James Venable. During this surgury Dr. Long used sulphuric ether anesthesia, which was soaked in a towel to render Mr. Venable “insensible.” Several medical students watched operation and later verified the claim that Dr. Long was the first to use ether as an anesthesia. In June 1842 the secon tumor was removed from Mr. Venable, again using ether. <br>  In 1850, Dr. Long moved to Athens, Georgia, where he continued to practice medicine advoiing the limelight that could have been his due to his historic operations. Dr. Long continued to practice medicine in Athens until his death on June 19, 1878. Dr. Long is buried in the Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia.<br>  <br>  In 1926, Georgia placed a marble statue of Dr. Long in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol.<br>  <br>  This statue of Dr. Long stands on the old courthouse square in his hometown of Danielsville, Georgia.<br>  <br>  ?
iLJASUuOaa	It is not bad, you dont want to rush into a university if you're not ready.

If you dont finish in time you can just relax and take a couple of easy class while waiting to get into ucsb, no biggie.
rwhqgTB6aa	You're joking, right? Of course salaries can range greatly. The president of a university makes way more than a rural kindergarten teacher. And a corporate lawyer for a large company makes more than one working with a small company. But on average any type of lawyer is going to make more than the typical teacher. According to www.payscale.com, the average teacher salary is about $41,000. For corporate lawyers it's $87,000.|`|AA11043457	Corporate lawyers don't make as much as practicing lawyers in court.  That is where the money is.<br>  <br>  Teachers used to have a lousy salary schedule built has improved and if a teacher has been around for awhile, then they can go up the ladder a bit and get more money.  Considering the attorney has a doctorate, and the teacher often only a masters' the teacher probably makes more than a corporate lawyer (desk job - not in court or dealing with clients but with business stuff.<br>  <br>  New lawyer probably makes more, but when  you look to the average -- then the teacher goes up a bit more quickly and would likely pass up the lawyer.  <br>  <br>  Both have to take lasses every year - lawyer probably even more so if they are registered with the bar.  In some cases corporate lawyers might not be part of the bar association, but only have their juris doctorate degree.  The Supreme Court deals with the bar association and registered attorneys - sort of licensed to practice in the state.  But don't have to have that to be in corporate law unless they work with ourts. Many lawyers don't work as lawyers.|`|4kmUX5pHaa	Corporate Layers have an edge.

To be honest, after a quick review on the internet, I made more than the teachers did at that time - I was the legal secretary to the President of the firm so...  lol  <br>  <br>  I would also like to say though that when I was in college the people that majored in Education (to become teachers) were looked on as 'basket weavers'  - serious, everyone looked down on them because 60 percent of them (really a good stat) had been unable to make it in their original major and fluffed down to Education and if they were really dumbos they majored in Physical Ed.  <br>  <br>  Law students in my experience were always tired, smelly and worn out.  lol  I think that tells you which is more difficult to achieve and who got paid the most.

You have to introduce your topic and show what your essay is really going to be about. You need more than just your opinion to back this up. You need to do some research and support your ideas. This has potential do be a good definition paper it just needs some work. When i wrote mine, altogether i spent at least 6-8 hours working on it. I had to write three drafts and i really helped.

E28mQDX0aa	Honestly, it needs some work...<br>  <br>  You need to vary your sentence structure, right now... most of them are choppy and awkward sounding. It's boring and annoying to read sentences that follow the same pattern. Throw some semi colons in there and some commas too using FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to mix it up a little.<br>  <br>  The organization is a little off, it doesn't seem to flow that well. For example, you go from talking about her features, to talking about the theories about the sinking. You should probably mention the sinking before talking about the theories behind it. And, go into some detail about how exactly it sunk.<br>  <br>  You should be more specific about what the Titanic looked like and what made her so special, because, honestly, there were more reasons that made the ship special. It had the most powerful wireless and not one but two wireless operators (this was practically unheard of at the time), it had a unique design with the bulkheads and watertight compartments, this design lead the media to claim it as unsinkable (I think it's important for your to mention that those at White Star Line never advertised the Titanic like this, it was the media who claimed the ship was "unsinkable").<br>  <br>  Also, you got some of your facts wrong, the Titanic was thought up in the spring of 1907 and her keel was officially laid down on March 31 1909. The idea for the Titanic (along with her two sister ships) was thought up by Henry Ismay (owner of White Star Line) and Lord William James Pirie (the managing director of Harland and Wolff) when they met in 1907. Thomas Andrews was the designer and builder of the ship, but he wasn't the director of Harland and Wolff, that was Pirie.<br>  <br>  I wrote a research paper about this for a class last year, I've copied and pasted my works cited page for you, seriously... you should take a look at some of them if you have the chance:<br>  <br>  Banerjee, Hari Nath.

It seems a little unnecessary to have all of the sources in there and elaborated on.

Many issues are discussed, which include but are not limited to terrorism, U.S. government hypocrisy, racism, war, intolerance and greed. Early on, the Peas had been a trio, then before Fergie they had featured Kim Hill in two of their albums. Some view this song as an anthem against the War on terror and the 2003 invasion of Iraq since it was released shortly after the invasion began. A controversial issue raised about the lyrics rapped just before the second chorus. The lyric in question is "I don't really know" rather than "I don't know", contrary to popular belief.

Kamikaze bombers were pilots who would fly their planes into Allied ships--it's hard to fight people willing to kill themselves in order to kill you.<br>  Also, it was felt that if the bomb weren't dropped, the United States would have had to invade Japan,at a cost of tens of thousands of lives.  (You should look up the exact figure of lives estimated to have been lost in an invasion.)  <br>  You can make just as good an argument for the other side, especially since Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilian targets and thousands of innocent Japanese citizens--men, women and children--were killed or horribly wounded. The United States remains the only nation that has ever used an atomic weapon against an enemy--and we did it twice.<br>  Edit:  Matthew, your brain needs to read some history.  Germany surrendered three months before the bomb was dropped on Japan.  it was planned to use the bomb on Germany because they thought Hitler was working on one. That wasn't true, and the bomb wasn't ready before Germany surrendered.  It was used on Japan anyway, even though they knew Japan had no such weapon, or even the idea of one.|`|l2ma3RYraa	From any standpoint morally, ethically, or religiously war is typically the wrong choice.<br>  However there are times when enough is enough and you must fight back.<br>  When in war or any type of fight (other than for entertainment and sports) there is only one option; defeat your enemy as quickly as possible.<br>  Show absolutely no mercy defeat them utterly.<br>  You must break the pride and will of your enemy quickly and assuredly.<br>  This is one of the reasons we have not done so great in the middle eastern wars.<br>  We have lost the pride of our power we have lost our will to defeat our enemy.<br>  <br>  Dropping the bomb on Japan showed our enemy that we will show no mercy, we will use all avenues to obtain success.

RAxSichXaa	Factoring is important because it breaks complex expressions into smaller more manipulable terms.  Often when dealing with such expressions it is necessary to multiply, divide, add or subtract other terms which may be as complex.  Often it is possible to cancel out some of the terms or evaluate them separately which greatly simplifies the calculations necessary.|`|s9tvr0DTaa	It depends on what you are referring to. There are two main definitions for Factoring: <br>  <br>  <br>  1.  Algebraic Factoring - Determining how one number can be broken down into smaller numbers. <br>  <br>  2.  Invoice or Accounts Receivable Factoring - Obtaining business financing through an advance on future payments due to your business. <br>  <br>  Algebraic Factoring serves a wide range of purposes, while Invoice Factoring is primarily utilized by New Businesses since traditional sources of financing & equity are not available to them yet. There has also been a recent increase in popularity for Factoring now that banks are more hesitant to loan money in general, so established businesses are more frequently turning to Factoring for a quick, hassle-free funding source.|`|HlgcJ3FLaa	It helps you:<br>  -- find the lowest common multiple and greatest common factor of two numbers.<br>  -- add and subtract fractions (because you use the LCM for that)<br>  -- find the answer to a quadratic equation and other non-linear functions.<br>  <br>  And this helps the world in general, not just math, because in science and physics and stuff you have to do equations like quadratic equations, and you use factoring for that.|`|qnDYiquFaa	The inclusion of algebra in secondary education in America was a move largely engineered by a man named Charles Eliot, President of Harvard, and his "Committee of 10". The Committee of 10 were the people who designed the curriculum for the then new invention that was the American high school.<br>  <br>  Eliot's belief was that algebra was a "gentleman's pursuit" meaning it had no real use but was an exercise in logic for the mind of young gentleman who really would not need to go on a earn a living but rather live off their family's accumulated wealth. Things like algebra, Greek, and Latin had long been part of the curriculum of "young gentlemen's schools" and with the invention of the free American high school, Eliot felt that only the successful completion of algebra merited the awarding of a high school diploma to all the "lesser sort" that would now be receiving a higher education.<br>  <br>  Eliot and his cronies didn't include algebra because they thought it useful.

If on the other hand you are doing a degree then transferring to medical school (as they do in the USA) then you can choose any subject that you want, BUT I would recommend that you do a subject somewhat affiliated with being a medical practitioner, Psychology, Biology and Sociology are softer science subjects so they are usually pretty interesting and very easy tp get good marks.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Second of all, harvard, and pretty much every ivy, is weird in admissions.  they'll deny a kid with perfect everything academically and a good amount of extracurriculars because they don't think that the applicant would "fit in" at Harvard, or because he or she is white and they filled their quota for caucasians.  Lastly, not to burst your bubble, but you probably weren't asked to attend college summer camps.  You took the plan, and that gives colleges your info and the right to send you all the s*** they can to get you to go to their program and pay an absurd amount of money to take a course that in some cases is not worth the $600-$900 a class fee (if you do the math and think about the # of classes and the cost for the course).

nCP2maFfaa	It went like this: I paddled toward the shore with all the strength I had in me. I looked back for a split second and saw the wave catch up to me as it began to lift me skyward. I was holding onto the rails of my board for dear life while the wave pushed me into a speed that was faster than i had ever experienced. Suddenly I was dropping down the face of a steep wall of ocean. I knew my mouth was open because when i did the face-plant into the bottom of the wave I was gargling salt water, thinking that I was about to die. The wave drove me deeper into the water and I flapped my arms around trying to gain control of myself and thinking that going back up to the surface was a good idea. But it wasn't, at least not then. I surfaced just in time to open my eyes and see my airborne surfboard eclipsing the morning sun and aimed straight for my head. WHAM!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|4BAJoTZhaa	try adding some color to the board, and some wetness to the paragraph. try sandy shore instead of shore, try with what strength i had rather than all ny strength, try describing the ocean rather than just saying ocean, think of someone reading it that has never seen the ocean, you would have to be more 'descriptive' to explain it to them. wont do your work, but hope this helps, good luck.

Also: Satisfaction in something done or owned.<br>  <br>   In general, pride is at the bottom of all great mistakes. — John Ruskin (1819-1900) <br>  <br>  Pride is the lofty view of one's self or one's own. According to Augustine, it is "the love of one's own excellence." [1] The opposite of pride is humility.<br>  <br>  Pride is sometimes viewed as excessive or as a vice, sometimes as proper or as a virtue. While some philosophies such as Aristotle's consider pride a profound virtue, most world religions consider it a sin. The Roman Catholic Church lists pride as the most deadly of the seven deadly sins.<br>  <br>  According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary, proud comes from late Old English prud, probably from Old French prude "brave, valiant" (11th century), from late Latin term prode "advantageous, profitable", which comes from prodesse "to be useful".[2] The sense of "having a high opinion of oneself", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves "proud", like the French knights preux.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's appearance and abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice it is often termed vanity or vainglory. Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's nation (national pride) and ethnicity (ethnic pride).|`|JxzawJZVaa	pride is, depending upon context, either a high sense of the worth of one's self and one's own, or a pleasure taken in the contemplation of these things. One definition of pride in the first sense comes from Augustine: "the love of one's own excellence."

mbXHkf1maa	Agreed with Picador that in this context, "right" and "wrong" are being used as nouns. From the current Oxford English Dictionary:<br>  <br>  right, n(oun).1<br>  3. a. That which is consonant with equity or the light of nature; that which is morally just or due. 1737 Gentl. Mag. VII. 131/1 You must acknowledge a Distinction betwixt Right and Wrong, founded in Nature,<br>  <br>  wrong, n(oun). 2<br>  1I. 1. That which is morally unjust, unfair, amiss, or improper; the opposite of right or justice; the negation of equity, goodness, or rectitude. (Freq. contrasted with "right") - 1781 COWPER Conversat. 149 "Without the means of knowing right from wrong".|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	There aren't any.

Personally, I would rather you get an extension on the assignment so that you can write it yourself when you're feeling better.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, here are some sites that will go a long way towards helping you write the essay when you are feeling up to it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.123helpme.com/search.asp?text=Franklin" rel="nofollow">http://www.123helpme.com/search.asp?text...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fi.edu/franklin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fi.edu/franklin/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/</a><br>  <a href="http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html" rel="nofollow">http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inve...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and again, I'm sorry about your loss.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Just talk to your teacher about getting another extension.  With a grandparent dying, one of your parents is very sad too and I can see how it is hard to catch up.  <br>  <br>  Ben Franklin is a great person to research though and he was a very interesting person.  He invented many useful things like the lightning rod and traveled as an ambassador for the US.  He also helped create the US postal system.  Part of what he did was to place stone pillars every mile from Boston to help figure out how much postage should be paid for a delivery. Some of these milestones are still standing after 200 years.<br>  <br>  I don't think your grandfather would approve of your cheating on a paper after he died.

The past continuous tense, "Was not" + past participle, indicates an ongoing action.  In English, 'to know something' is not considered an action, more of an on-or-off state.  It's assumed that once you possess a piece of knowledge, you go on knowing it.  'To know' is treated as an event, not a process which continues.  Therefore we use the past tense- "I did not know".  <br>  <br>  You can also use the perfect tense- "I have (not) known"- to indicate how long you have possessed a particular peice of knowledge.|`|SUBKGSQNaa	" I was not writing" is  the past of "I am not writing."  We don't say "I am not knowing" but "I don't know",so the past is "I didn't know". The difference is because writing is something I can do for a bit and then stop; with knowledge, I either know or don't know, it's not an activity I can start and stop.

1hS1pQz5aa	This is probably more than just the first page, but oh well (lol)...<br>  <br>  At the start of the Odyssey, the author (generally assumed to be Homer) addresses the Muse, asking her to tell him about Odysseus (Ulysses), the hero who spent more time traveling back to his Greek home than any other Greek hero at the Trojan War. Homer says that Odysseus and his men suffered as a result of the Sun God Hyperion Helios. Odysseus then encountered the goddess Calypso, who has kept him so long that all the gods except Poseidon (Neptune) feel sorry for him.<br>  <br>  While Poseidon is away enjoying a festival, Zeus (Jupiter/Jove) addresses the gods and tells the story of Agamemnon, Aegisthus, and Orestes. Athena brings Zeus back to the topic of Odysseus, reminding him that Zeus has received many burnt offerings at the hand of Odysseus.<br>  <br>  Zeus says that his hands are tied because Poseidon is angry that Odysseus blinded his son, Polyphemus, but that if the gods show a united front, they should be able to persuade Poseidon when he returns.<br>  <br>  Athena responds that the messenger god, Hermes [see cultural notes], should tell Calypso to let Odysseus go, and she herself will go to Odysseus' son Telemachus to inspire him to call the assembly and speak out against the suitors of his mother Penelope. She will also urge Telemachus to go to Sparta and Pylos for word of his father. Athena then vanishes and arrives in Ithaca disguised as Mentes, chief of the Taphians.<br>  <br>  Telemachus sees Mentes-Athena, goes to him to to offer hospitality. He insists the guest eat before telling why he is there. Telemachus wants to ask whether the stranger has news of his father.<br>  <br>  He waits until the food has been served and the entertainment section of the feast begun to ask questions about who the stranger is, whether he knew his father, and whether he has any news.<br>  <br>  Athena-Mentes says he's on a voyage of trade, carrying iron and hoping to bring back copper. Mentes's father was friend of Odysseus' father. Athena-Mentes says the gods are delaying Odysseus. Although he isn't a prophet, he says Odysseus will be coming soon. Athena-Mentes then asks if Telemachus is the son of Odysseus.<br>  <br>  Telemachus replies that his mother says so.<br>  <br>  Then Athena-Mentes asks what the feast is about and Telemachus grumbles about the suitors eating him out of house and home.<br>  <br>  Athena-Mentes says Odysseus would take revenge if he were around, but since he's not, Telemachus should follow his advice and call the Achaean heroes to an assembly the next morning to plead his case and tell the suitors to leave. Telemachus should then take a ship with 20 trusted men to hunt for his father, first asking Nestor at Pylos, and then Menelaus at Sparta. If he hears good news of his father, he can put up with the suitors' pillaging a while longer and if bad, then he can have a funeral, make his mother marry, and then murder the suitors, making a name for himself, just as Orestes did when he killed Aegisthus.<br>  <br>  Telemachus thanks Athena-Mentes for the paternal advice. He asks Athena-Mentes to stay a while longer so that he may receive a gift. Athena-Mentes says to keep the present for the next time he comes, because he must hurry off.<br>  <br>  When Athena-Mentes rushes off, Telemachus feels inspired and knows he has talked with a god. He then approaches the singer, Phemius, who was singing about the return from Troy. Penelope asks Phemius to sing of something else, but Telemachus contradicts her. She retreats. Telemachus addresses the suitors and says, it's time for feasting now and then in the morning it will be time to meet in the assembly for him to formally send them away.<br>  <br>  The suitors make fun of him; then one asks about the stranger and whether he had news. Telemachus says he puts no stock in rumors and prophecies. The feasting continues and then at night, the suitors go home. Telemachus, whose way is led by Euryclea holding a torch, goes upstairs to bed.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	The first answerer has given a summary of the entire first book, and of course the amount on the first page will vary from one translation or edition to another, but her first two paragraphs should cover it pretty well.

YUcl70rbaa	she describes a type of awakening. The image present in the poem is that of the speaker walking, lost somewhere, when suddenly as she passes a house, the door opens to her. While the door is ajar, the speaker enjoys “an instant’s Width of Warmth disclosed — / and Wealth — and Company.” Unfortunately, just as suddenly, the door closes, and because of this experience, the speaker now suffers doubly. She is not only lost but she is also experiencing misery. In this poem, Dickinson seems to imply that when she was lost, at least that was all that was on her mind. She was trying to find her way. However, when the door opened, she saw that someone was living in a manner that was quite different from hers. That way of living exuded warmth. For a brief second, she felt that she had found something or someone with whom she could share her thoughts. It was far better not knowing that such a way of life existed for it made her feel even more lost when she had to go back to her way of life.

Hence I have it in one of the highest regards between the knowledge we must sustain and use. Of course the purpose of architecture is use, but no properly made architectural object may be made without using sound geometric principles in its conception. In fact a geometra is still an architect in Italy, or it was till recently (as by the way, a "carpenter" was in the middle east milennia ago). So, by the use of geometry the architect can make the divisions of space and introduction of proper order and rhythms that allow for buildings both good in construction and architecture.

If we have 2, then we would hate the same thing as a dime, so we just need 1 nickle.<br>  <br>  For Dimes, if we have 1 or 2, there's nothing larger we can substitute, but once we get to 3 dimes, we could just substitute a quarter and a nickle, so we would need 2 dimes.<br>  <br>  For quarters, if we had 4 quarters, we could just use a dollar, so we'll need 3 quarters.<br>  <br>  4 pennies<br>  1 nickle<br>  2 dimes<br>  3 quarters<br>  <br>  Total amount: $1.04 of change.<br>  <br>  And we can make any change amount up to and including the $1.00.
