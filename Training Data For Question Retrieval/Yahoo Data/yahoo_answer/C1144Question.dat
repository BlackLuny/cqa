20090304091035AAkze60	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair help! I'm not sure what to go for...?	My hair length is currently just past my elbows.      My natural hair colour is like a light brown, and I have the underneath dyed black. (A bit like Avril Lavigne) I'm wanting to grow the black bits out, and indeed I have got the roots showing through for a good few centimeters now. (But it's covered by my natural hair colour on top!)      My hair currently, with the brown just hangs down... The feathering effect I had is gone and my layers are growing out / have gone flat. And to be honest, it looks awful and boring... My hair is also very thick and frizzy, so I have to straighten it every day.. :<      I'd love to keep my long hair, but only when it's the same colour, so in the mean time I'm not sure what to do with it.      I guess my choices are to get my brown bits layered and cut off just underneath my shoulders and leave the black bits long.      Or get my brown bits cut off so they just rest on my shoulders and get the black parts cut also, but making sure the black is slightly longer than the brown.      I've just had my long hair for so long, and no one has seen me with short hair, so it'd be a big step for me, and I'm not sure it'd suit me at all... And clearly I don't want to mess this up.      Taking into consideration my colour, hair length now and that it's quite thick and frizzy - what do you guys suggest?

When I was a preteen, I for some god forsaken reason shaved my arms, now they have grown back and are very long, dark and noticeable. I'm always conscience of it, and I know people notice it. The other day, I saw a co-worker point it out to another co-worker. I'm sick of being so conscience of this. So, I was watching tv, and saw one of those silly commercials about removing hair by rubbing a friction pad and the women was doing it on her arms. And it got me thinking if hair removal on a women's arm is weird or not.      Should I do it? Or would I regret it. I don't want to bleach it, it's so unnaturally long.

I haven't done anything about it so as not appear "self conscious," but I'm tired of looking like a kid; I have the chin thing (nothing ridiculous), the physique, the blue eyes, the smile, pretty much everything, but those d@mn cheeks mess me up. I mean, yeah, I'm not frikin' brad pitt or anything, but I definitely have something if it weren't for my cheeks. I think it may be from bassoon; playing it requires a lot of facial strength, so I think my cheeks, though they look like baby fat, are really just relaxed muscle. Is there anyway to flex them naturally and constantly without looking like a fool, or should I just try and put on some more meat to flush them out?

It's in good condition but extremly thick and because of this it looks shorter than it does if I was to tie half of it up. I REALLY want to have long hair, and I am trying very hard to do so, however...      1) Does thinning ones hair reduce hair growth?   -Someone told me that the hair doesn't grow faster when thinned.      2) When I curl My hair in the morning, It stays curly and then after 1h it goes completely flat and puffy. Why is this? I use a ceramic hair curling tong, and smoothing serum, but nothing seems to do the job good. What can I do to create more tight, firm strong curls without frizz?

20081120044738AAcsoTb	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why are Brazilian girls so sexy?	I love them!       Not only are they twice as beautiful as American girls (generally speaking, of course--there are some hot American girls, as well), but most Brazilian stunners aren't stuck-up or arrogant and standoffish like their American counterparts. Also, Brazilians are more fun to be around.      I was wondering, why is that? Is it the culture?

20080328195043AAAw8Wm	Beauty & Style;Hair	I already asked this before, but nobody answered it right...what's the deal with leg hair?	It doesn't grow continuously like the hair on your head and I was wondering if anyone knew why. Somebody answered before, that it will keep growing if you don't shave it for a while, but that's not true. It eventually reaches a certain length and stops. Why doesn't it just stop growing back after you shave it? And why doesn't it grow as long as the hair on your head? I mean, that would be really nasty, but it just doesn't make sense. I don't get how the hair on your legs just grows back when you shave it, but it only goes to a certain length. How does your body even know when you shave the hair on your legs to be able to grow it back?

So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

It's been very cold out lately, so I've been wearing jackets, sweaters, long sleeve shirts, etc. For Valentine's Day, I received a watch as a gift. I don't know how I should be wearing the watch with relation to the sleeves. When I'm wearing a jacket, I just pull the sleeves over my watch. It's when I'm wearing long sleeve shirts that reach my wrists that I'm confused. Should I roll up my sleeve above the watch, put the watch on over the sleeve, or pull the sleeve over and around my watch?

20090304090613AAjS933	Beauty & Style;Hair	What hairstyle would fit me?	I have spent the last 7 years growing my hair out - but, unfortunatlely, my hair grows VERY slowly so it is only just below my shoulder blades and it is in very poor shape. It is not at all how I wanted it to be, so I have decided to die it an auburn color and surprise my husband when he gets home (he is away for a month on busines) - but I can't decide how to cut it. It is very difficult for me to cut it.   So I am looking for opinions please.    http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...     http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...     http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...     http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...     http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...
