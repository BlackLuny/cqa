Well, lately, as I watch myself straighten up everything "just so" I see the similarity between his OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and my neatness. Perhaps you have a little of it too. And a little of it is a Good Thing. But a lot of it, as you are finding, takes you away from the really Good Things, like your kids.    Now don't laugh, but sometimes I think our neatness is a way of staving off the feeling of impending disaster - "If everything is in order, I won't die."     But of course we won't die if something is let go long enough to pay attention to the kids (or in my case, since I'm on the other end of the caring cycle now, my parents).     Try saying the words "But I like the lived-in look" with more and more conviction until you start to believe it. Read about the Japanese style of art called "wabi-sabi". They believe that to create beauty, you must value imperfection.     Did you know that every hand-knotted oriental rug has an imperfection in it, woven in on purpose, so that the gods will not be jealous?      Perhaps you can become even more perfect by choosing to become imperfect!    M  E|`|f1878d960817574592d3484e725061ceaa	Just try to prioritize... I can't sleep at night if the house is a total mess...  Make a list of the things that are most important to get done each day. Don't try to do everything everyday, you will ware yourself down...  Prioritize by Every Day, Every Week, Every 2 Weeks, Every Month, Every Six Months & Every Year.  Then Sort it out on a cleaning calendar...Like I clean out the frige the day I go grocery shopping...  I go grocery shopping once a week, on wednesdays.  I wash all the bedding in the house oncea week on mondays, that is my heavy cleaning day...I have a master list for things to do monday...What ever I don't get done on monday gets done tuesday morning... After that I try to just keep tidy & not stress.  I hope that helps!

5e033d8c6271f9b8b1636fa167eb8cbeaa	The brand of EPT that I am going to assume you used has the one with the two windows and you have to have a positive in one window and another straight vertical line in the other.  IF this is the one that you used there has been reports of this test giving false positives.  This test's sensitivity is 40 mIU which is pretty sensitive but the first response tests there are a couple different kinds of those   The first response early response which has a sensitivity of 15mIU which is pretty darn sensitive but if you used the first response one step that one has a sensitivity of 100mIU which is rather high.  Your best bet since you have already gotten a positive test result is to go and get it confirmed with your doctor.  The one thing also about super sensitive tests is that it can detect pregnancy so early before the missed period that sometimes not so often that the pregnancy ends in miscarriage and the mother never even knew she was pregnant so be careful with those.  I am sorry to scare you like that but wouldn't you rather know all details than someone sugar coat them for you.  A doctors office will be able to confirm or deny pregnancy at this point.  Best of luck to you and I wish you all the best.  Congrats if you are pregnant|`|8a97cd40085f30a1d504e99ab5132ba5aa	Well, actually, the new type of First Response detects the level of 50, I belive.

53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	There's no harm in having more sex, but there's little benefit (from a fertility standpoint) in more than every other day.  If you have sex less then every other day, you're reducing odds of pregnancy.  On the other hand, every day is not much more effective then every other day.    While men produce sperm constantly, after ejaculating it takes about 2 days to be back up to 100% again.  So more frequent sex, there's less sperm per ejaculation ...  Plus sperm can live for a couple days in the woman, so you're covered.    Feel free to have more sex, but every other day is 'sufficient'.|`|14c3e63dc56d3f9ff7782e8b960dd03aaa	Although sperm are constantly regenerating, a man's testicles need a little time to rest.  He may produce a lot of sperm, but the ejaculation may not be as powerful if you are having sex every day.  I've heard that the best way to conceive is to have sex every other day insuring a stronger ejaculation.
df9ffe28326d6ef1f1884a4c3d538788aa	Spotting is fairly normal early on in pregnancy, but an actual period shouldn't happen.  I would call the doctor just to be safe.  If you have no cramping, and just spotting, you should be fine.  Congratulations on the pregnancy.    From Web MD: "Spotting can also occur shortly after conception. In this case, it's known as implantation bleedingbleeding that occurs approximately seven days after conception when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall. Many women mistake this light amount of bleeding for a menstrual periodan error that can wreak havoc on their ability to calculate their due dates. Heavy bleeding during pregnancy, however, is cause for concern and may indicate that you are having a miscarriage.    You should call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:     heavy vaginal bleeding or clotting       lighter bleeding that lasts for more than one day       the passage of greyish or pinkish tissue       any amount of bleeding that is accompanied by cramps, fever, chills, or dizziness       severe pain in abdomen or in your shoulder area       dehydration       a fever of more than 101F       painful urination       a watery discharge from the vagina "|`|8qZgGl5Gaa	No I dont think so because I know alot of women who had a period all 9mths and they had very healthy children|`|AA10602488	Not necessarily.....Some women continue to have light periods, I did.

Better safe than sorry|`|ed1b473401eff96b45582214ce96908baa	not necessarily...bright red is not good. other than that i wouldn't be too worried.|`|AA11754764	IT depends if you continue to bleed it is probably a miscarriage but a little spotting is not i bled when i was pregnant with my son and they told to just try and take it easy no heavy lifting  and today he is fifteen years old he was a full term baby weighing seven lbs 9 ozs so dont worry just try and relax and good luck if you are really worried go to the doctor.|`|AA11399000	No, a lot of women have a light period throughout their pregnancy.

AA11399000	Your baby is not feeling sick just because you are.  If you feel that bad and want to take something, I would take a Benadryl before bed.  That is what I would do if I was feeling REALLY bad and pregnant.  Orange juice will help to because of the vitamin c.... but it probably wont be noticable.  Good Luck!

AA11399000	Your baby is fine.  Unfortunately you will just feel like crap! I was like you, didnt want to take any meds.  Benadryl is safe to take.

The baby should be fine.  In tune with your emotions, but fine.  Congrats and best wishes.|`|1122df847264360cc06a9d8be657324aaa	Check with your doctor which fever reducers and pain killers are safe to take during pregnancy.    I don't think the baby is affected by colds in the womb too much.      I was sick with strep throat the whole 9 months (I began a new course of anti-biotics every 6 weeks) and my daughter was born with no side-effects, but believe it or not she is now 3 years old and has never needed anti-biotics and she has never needed to go to the doctor for any sickness - only for well check-ups.    So don't worry about it, you and the baby are going to be fine, as long as you keep up your doctor's appointments.      Also, if you ever feel like you aren't sure about the baby's well being, the doctor is always happy to fit you into the schedule to give you and the baby an unscheduled check-up.|`|87f4675f342c1248ff2dcfce7e2e37ccaa	u are doing the right thing  drink lots of fluids  and get lots of rest|`|AA12221575	The baby's not feeling sick, but you're right for not taking any medication.    Don't listen to anyone or anything online as for what to take. Call your OB/GYN's office and ask them what you can take for a cold. That's the safest way to go. If you don't know for sure, always, always ask.    I hope you feel better soon, I got a stomach virus while I was pregnant, I was about 22 weeks and I was absolutly miserable for like a month afterwards.|`|ZnZpujWWaa	i agree with DaniZ....dont take anything unless you kno for sure mii ur doctors that its safe cuz once u put it in u u cant get it out....so ask your doctors|`|ffyTa5t1aa	well, there are a list of medications that are safe to take when you are pregnant...the docto should give you that list....i've had different drs tell me different medications. but one simple one is sudafed...which can help your nose with little side effects. my view is, if your body is working so hard to fight off whatever i am sick with...it is that much less able to get the baby what it needs as readily. and it makes YOU all the more tired....if you are more functional so is your body. if you NEVER like to take medicine, then don't stress. but if you normally would, just know their are some that are completly safe for your baby so YOU can feel your best! talk to your doctor!
AA12199906	all answers will be here James interesting site will help and tips   http://www.babyworld.co.uk/    The best time for baby-making sex is just before ovulation. The average length of a womans fertility cycle is 28 days, counting Day 1 as the first day of a period and going on to the beginning of the next. If you have a regular 28-day cycle, you can therefore predict that ovulation is likely to occur mid-cycle, on around Day 14. Many women find, however, that their cycle length varies a great deal, which makes calculating the mid point difficult.     Fortunately, there are other natural changes in a womans body which can help you to work out when your fertile pre-ovulation days might be, and increase your chances of conceiving.|`|AA10715286	14 days before your next expected period.|`|ZIRdJjEkaa	Generally two weeks after the "first day" of her period...but some women ovulate at different times so it is best to buy an ovulation kit at the store to check your own cycle.|`|AA11956503	try this website. it should calculate when you are most fertile according to your menstral cycle.|`|426b2ebde46450837484fb98a2515f7daa	12th day after ur last period|`|82317bcf511af068a5eb51b4c64d98f9aa	Around the 14th day of your cycle is usually the best time.    it worked for me and most of my friends anyway.|`|ciOhg1Qiaa	..to make baby's what?|`|be5dd838d39b383421489c9d40f5061caa	try roughly around the 12th day after the first day of a last period!!!|`|qFhxENqmaa	If the women's cycle is 28 days, then between 14 and 16 days after the first day of her period is the most likely time she will be ovulating, you can buy ovulation testing kits to determine this. Good luck!!|`|a162bdc4ec194898d69ba723c22d1ce6aa	That all depends on every woman we are all diffrent sweetie,for example an average cycle is 28 days so they put ovulation as 14 days before your next due period,But with me since having an ectopic my cycle has been 35 days so its harder to calculate when ovulation and my fertile times are so ive started charting my tempratures in the morning and worked out its around day 24 and before im fertile so when my husbands back from the army we will be giving the best shot everymonth,Also i have found ovulation kits very helpful the positive line will come up as dark or darker than the test line telling you theres been an lh surge so make love!!But if its weaker(fainter than the test line it indicates a negative result)people think they are expensive but if you buy from ebay you can get a load for around 8pounds good luck to you
AA10715286	Most definately!  I use mymonthlycycle.com as well and it has been on the money with my ovulation day!  We just started trying this month and when I was suppose to ovulate I took a test and it was positive for 3 days 2 days before my expected ovulation and on the day I was suppose to.  My body also said I was ovulationg with the Cervical discharge and light cramping on my left side.  Also had lower back tenderness.  When the test says positive and it is still a couple of days before your expected ovulation day that means you are fertile and can become pregnant.  The hormone that is realsed during this time helps the sperm survive longer and get up there to fertilize your egg.  Also sperm can survive for those couple of days before your egg drops.  So as soon as your egg comes on the 11th those sperms inside of you from a couple of days before will be waiting and attack that egg.  My husband and I had regular intercourse everyday after I stopped my period until two days after I ovulated.  We stopped for a couple of days since cause naturally we are exhausted! hahaha...but I do believe you are definately in a higher range of conceiving now and even higher tommorrow!  So keep at it.  Don't be dissappointed to much if you do everything right and it doesn't happen.  Cause sometimes it takes time.  Wish me luck to.  Sorry for the long answer, but I really understand what your feeling and thinking right now!|`|29def52ac159fbd3d1d0ef706db268a9aa	Yes dear there is always a chance. GOOD LUCk    Here's the run down on CM:     These are the types of mucous you will see during your menstrual cycle.  Dry: At the beginning of your cycle, prior to ovulation you will likely produce little to no cervical mucous. Also right before your period should start your cervical mucous may become dry again. If you do not notice cervical mucous you will want to record this on your chart as dry.  Sticky: You may notice sticky cervical mucous prior to ovulation. It feels sticky to your fingers when you touch it  Creamy: As you get closer to ovulation you will notice thicker, creamy-looking cervical mucous. This mucous looks and feels similar to lotion.  Eggwhite: Eggwhite cervical mucous is the term used to describe the mucous you have during ovulation. It looks like eggwhites and is slippery, clear, and stretchy.  Watery: Watery cervical mucous is wet and may be stretchy. You may notice this type of cervical mucous during ovulation or before having eggwhite cervical mucous.   http://www.justmommies.com/articles/cerv...|`|XBy4Tb6Oaa	Yes there is a chance!!!

My period is not always on time because of my health so I alway take the pregnancy test just to make sure since I've had unprotective sex with my husband.  It usually came out negative but not this time.  I'm about a month pregnant now.  I took 4 tests because I wasn't sure and it's kind a surprise me.  I hope you can rest in peace now since you took 4 pregnancy test with negative results.  I think you're definitely not pregnant.|`|AA11090943	If you are getting your period every month then you aren't pregnant. Trust me on that one. I think you are just worried and freaked out after having sex obviousely. I'd suggest going on birth control pills or using a condom and practicing safe sex. You just need to be careful and it seems you are really worried about the repurcussions of having sex. I'd say that emotional and mentally you aren't ready for sex because of your fear of getting pregnant. But to be honest, you know you aren't pregnant because you keep having periods. Trust me you'll know your pregnant because you won't have periods and you'll show symptoms.

That my dear, is stressful.      Best wishes and I hope you can get in to a safer work environment|`|BRT3rb4Yaa	I would see about a different job and even substitution because you never know their intentions when they are angry and you never know if you and your baby might get hurt. It is a wise decision to do something else until your child is born, then go from there. Also if those kids have certain disabilities, it may hinder their judgment to make the right decision when they are angry.|`|4S45zWbOaa	I would definitely be careful in this sort of work environment. Although things may not be bad for you right now, you never know what kind of situations you will end up in the middle of later on. Your child should be what is important to you, as opposed to your job. If it were me, I would find another temporary job in the meantime until I had the baby. You want to keep their health safe, and avoid any potential situations that can jeopardize the safety of you both.
ea86f699bb0bf1af4e0bd9b3df7f96e5aa	The most important things you should do is abstain from smoking, drinking, and drugs, and take a prenatal vitamin... starting now. Avoid large amounts of caffeine (doc says a cup or 2 of coffee a day is ok while TTC). Eating a balanced diet (fruits and veggies!) and mild exercise are also important, not that they'll help you conceive faster, but they'll help you be able to better physically withstand pregnancy. Good luck!   Remember that your husband should avoid excessive drinking, and any smoking too! I personally only use Tylenol for pain while I'm TTC, because I know doctors say only tylenol is safe during pregnancy.|`|5vU73VLuaa	Start your prenatal vitamins now!

OvUW1kZ1aa	home pregnancy tests (hpt) should be reliable already on the day your period is due.  Doing it with first morning urine makes it more reliable, since the concentration of pregnancy hormone (HCG) is highest.  Beware that hpt are in any case less accurate than a blood test. If you still do not get a period after say 1 week, repeat the test or ask your gyn to do bloodtest.  IMO though probability you're pregnant are close to 0. On a 31 days cycle the earliest day you could get pg would be cd10 (31-16(=very long luteal phase after ovulation)-5 (days sperms might survive in your body)=10.|`|26SqFq6Iaa	Best time to take a pregnancy test is the day of your missed period. Most women do that. Some wait 2 weeks after their missed period just so it's more accurate.|`|e312c68b4e3965efbbf77ef5df3f415faa	i doubt it if you used a condom and it didnt break and it was the day that your period ended then you most likely arent but the best time to test is after you miss a period but some test you can take a couple days before you miss your period|`|o8OTk6xYaa	If your cycle is 31 days, you would have been quite a way from your estimated ovulation time.   If you wanted a more accurate test, I would take it on May 28th.  That would be about when your cycle is due.  If you bought a test that detected levels as low as 25mIU (read the box before you buy... some don't detect levels lower than 100mIU), you could test as early as today (the 24th).  Make sure you test in the morning for an undiluted urine sample.     I don't think you would be pregnant because of your dates, but I wouldn't trust a condom in your fertile times.    ~Sweet Eden|`|xKR7i1GZaa	I think you should consult any doctor as soon as possible because you had sex at the time, when the chances of getting pregnant is very high.

As for food you can do the same things just cut him up a few pieces of chicken and meats you would like him to eat and do the same thing with the veggies he will eat what you feed him and he is learning to eat what he sees you eat.

Today, surprisingly enough, my 4 year old ate 30 + mini raw carrots with only a dab of fat free ranch! I'm still shaking my head! Up until now he has vowed never to eat a "crunchy carrot" His 2 year old brother loves them, that's why I include them with their meals at times. I don't make a fuss over veggies AT ALL. That just makes them resist you even more. From now on, I would put his normal food on a plate and add 1 healthy thing and slightly scale back the rest of the unhealthy stuff. Each day, or week add more good, take away more bad. Slowly get to the point where he has more nutritious stuff in front of him than not and it will seem less like a shock and he'll be less likely to resist it. Also, don't fret about him totally gagging about something one day, most kids have to have something,like my oldest, again and again before they accept, and heaven forbid, LOVE IT! If you need nutritious meal and snack ideas, check out books from the library and parenting magazines websites - Great tools to get you on the right path!

My daughter is also way more likely to try food her grandparents offer her, I've found this a great way to at least get her to try different fruit or veg so I can find out what she likes or dislikes if she won't try it for me. Or another good one is to hide veggies in things like quiches or veg patties (grate up a mix of veggies and then add an egg, flour and cheese and fry until cooked through). Good luck!

Globalement, pour une femme de poids moyen, on "s'autorise", de 10  15 kilos, avec un "norme"  12 kilos, ?a donne 3 kilos pour les 3 premiers mois, et 2 kilos par mois les mois suivants (total: 12 kilos pour 6 mois) => 15 kilos "autoriss" maximum.    Parce que dans la prise de poids, il n' a pas que du gras, il y a toute l'eau du liquide amniotique (1litre = 1 kilo), le placenta (500g), le bb (3, 5 kilo en moyenne), le muscle de l'utrus qui grandit en mme temps que le bb (1 kg), le volume sanguin qui augmente (+50%, ce qui donne 2  3 litres/ 2  3 kg), etc... (?a donne quand mme 7  8 kilos invitables)    En gros, une femme de poids moyen peut prendre entre 10 et 15 kilos, c'est "normal".    Une femme plus rondelette devra prendre moins, une femme obse ne devra pas prendre de poids, parfois, elles en perdent mme, car elles quilibrent leur rgime, pour le bb.

AA12178997	First of all, congratulations on your baby. Sounds like you are both healthy, and that's great! Second, your fiance should feel lucky that you care whether you are sexy to him. Many women don't care. So good for you for wanting to be part of a partnership. Third, you are in no way "damaged goods." Your body just went through an experience that changed it. You can change it back to some degree, but it is possible some things won't go exactly where they were. Doesn't matter, though, because a big part of sexiness is confidence and attitude. So, get your problem fixed, enjoy being a parent and be confident in who you are!|`|2TvktLqPaa	i understand how you fel on the other hand did have a prolapse uterus. one you shouldnt be having sex until you have your 6 week check up. also there is other ways to please your fiance.. (oral) or the other end.. just saying not that you would want to. there is other way to have an intimate relationship rather then sex. using the senses doesnt always mean sex. also as much as i know you want to "feel" sexy you still are no matter what. and the natural beauty you had before baby will come back it just takes time. and sometimes some dont want to wait that time to feel sexy. i know i was the same way on that part. i went into depression bcause of it. but over time got my sexy little self back. the stretch marks will fade with time also.. get scar serum it helps.|`|XAUpBbuTaa	I know how you feel.  Well, relax about your boy for a bit and first focus on making yourself feel pretty.  Get an edgy haircut, paint your nails, try new lipstick, buy a hot pink bra, get a tan.  little junk, ya know?  Then let your guy compliment you.  I can't promise you'll feel 100% better (especially right now) , but I swear it'll get you off you a good start with feeling normal again.|`|TBk1OGIyaa	girl treat yourself to a day at the salon if u can afford it... get the whole nine yards... hair, nails, pedi, makeup... then get you a lil sexy outfit and get that wonderful understanding man of yours to take you to dinner.. the time away from lil one will help... then after u have healed from your surgery( i will pray u get better and dont have to have) get you a sexy nitey and have a ball ... he will make you feel sexy again... and girl you better hang on to that man he sounds like a keeper    good luck    p.s   set the wedding date soonn  dont let some other woman get him girl

MxhNzW7Oaa	You probably could get an accurate result with a blood test. A regular HPT may take a few more weeks after that to get a positive. Call your OB/GYN and schedule one in about a week or so.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	5 days before missed period with some test|`|aNsv0PPnaa	when period is due! xxxxxxxx|`|AA10715286	I tested 10 days after I knew I ovulated and got a clear positive.
7E0lmpHhaa	If you havent been taking any hCG hormone then the test is positive because your pregnant!!  I would go to the dr and get them to confirm your pregnancy, my gp surgery dont do that though if you have a positive test then they believe that you are pregnant as the urine stick tests they use are the ones that you buy over the counter.  You could always ask them to do a blood test to check your hCG.  But on the whole I just want to say you are NOT over thinking it!! Congrats!!|`|AA10715286	The only hormone that shows up in a pregnancy test that makes it positive is HCG.  That is only in pregnant women.  So it can't just be hormones, unless it's pregnancy hormones :)  I'm sure if you took 3 and all said positive, then you are pregnant.  You can pretty much be sure you are!|`|MEVg0LBGaa	i think 3 tests would most probably be right!!! id there a reason they told you that you wouldnt conceive naturally? anyway, id go to your dr as they b=can do a blood test which is more accurate than hpt. if over the counter tests can tell you up to 5days before a missed period then im sure the drs test would give you an answer.    good luck ! xxx|`|ehNzfNw4aa	If your tests are saying positive then your pregnant congrats|`|tzRyeX62aa	I agree that three test shouldn't be wrong.  Call your Doctor and they might tell you to have a blood test.   Congratulations and GOOD LUCK!|`|8RQ0l3iaaa	Hey Freaky Gurl, I've been wondering about it since you said you got a pos. last week. I'm with all the others. I think you're pregnant. Maybe the health dept. just doesn't want to spend the money to test this soon. If you can, do like everyone is telling you. Go to your doc. I've never, ever heard of a false positive. I have 5 kids and dozens of friends with multiple children. None of that makes me an expert, but I'll be surprised if you're not. Good luck hon. Be patient for a few more days to find out for "sure."

f0c9e87a68102656b93d9180a652a84faa	when your BF and you didn't use protection did he *** inside you? Even if not males excrete what is know as pre-*** which is still able to impregnate.    No matter what people say the pill is not 100%, if you are on other meds it can effect it, if you are ill it can be less effective.    and like it or not some test are in-effective when taken too early, and are effected if you are stressed (which you obviosuly are), so chill out, give it a couple of weeks and then go to the doc, they have the best kits and they are free.    Best of all though, if you are, (and you wish to keep it), no more need for protection, bang away and there will be no consequences. well at least for 10 months. hehe|`|AA10725437	No you're not pregnant.Do the math sweetie.You got off birth control pills and thats why you're body is acting funny.Pregnancy test are usually ALWAYS right.Also,during pregnancy you dont want to have cramps because this is not a good sign.BUT you may want to go to the doctors just to make sure.    Good luck!;)|`|wnL0m6YQaa	it usually takes me 3 or 4 days to start.  just wait and in 5 days if u havent started then take a test|`|cFod2Ctlaa	It is totally possible to get pregnant on the pill, but if you took a test and it said negative I would relax for now and test again in a few days.  Sometimes the pill can cause women to have light periods, sometimes no periods at all, so this is probably what is happening.    Good luck
VtOVS2nmaa	My son was born three months early.  When I went into the hospital they gave me two shots of steroids to help open up my sons lungs.  He was born perfect!

He will be 6 on 4/19 and he is doing very well with no problems.|`|HnDwsN9raa	They are not fully devolped. Lungs keep devolping and getting more mature each day that they are in the womb.

8SjoUQmEaa	Most kids nowadays start "dating" in 4th-6th grade, basically friends with the "boyfriend/girlfriend" title, so don't freak out if your 10 year old is bragging to her friends about her "boyfriend". They  may even have 2 "bfs/gfs" this is perfectly normal in kids this age nowadays, it makes them feel grown up, and should be nothing to concern over, unless your child gives you reason to. The second stage of dating is usually from 7th-9th grade which is basically the couple mostly see each other at school, hold hands while walking in the hall, sit together  lunch,talk on the phone/text each other, see each other sometimes on weekends with a group of friends. This is usually the age your daughter will face her first major "heartbreak" but will recover shortly and her best friend will be dating the guy who broke her heart (of course she'll be fine with this, and be madly in love with someone else), this is usually how Jr. High relationships go. Usually around 10th grade is when kids will have their first actual dating relationship, if you allow your child to date at this age,  you should make sure you know who their boyfriend or girlfriend is, and only allow them to hang out on weekends such as seeing a movie or going to the mall, start out mostly letting them see each other during the day, then gradually over time if you begin to trust them more they could go on more dates. Don't closely supervise them unless you suspect they're doing something wrong (of course some supervision is necessary this is how you know when to be suspicious), remember less kids are having sex than are. Also talk to your kids before they start dating (around 13 years old) about birth control, and being responsible, this way if the situation does come up they are prepared. |`|zHRWklEWaa	Irene D sums it up nicley|`|QveBSjFSaa	Well, I have 3 kids The oldest is 18, then 11, then 9.  With the younger 2, I will NOT make the same mistake that I did with my 18 year old daughter, which is giving them a general age when they ask, i.e. "Mom, how old do I have to be before I can date?" "oh, about 14 maybe, depending on how mature you are".   Do that, and they start sweating you at 12 1/2, if not sooner.  I have told my younger ones that I will let THEM know when I think they are ready.   From my experience, dating is a privilege that should be individualized.  |`|Wjm53KM2aa	It depends on the child.  If you have a responsible child then 14, as long as you have educated them about sex and safe sex.  If you have an irresponsible child then dont let them date until you are ready to be a grandparent!|`|PWAskEZfaa	14 for group dates and 16 for all dating, just make sure you know the kids.|`|ZRQvrbtGaa	I think 13, thats when i was allowed to date. I know a lot of people say thats too young, but I dont agree.    I was a virgin until 18, have only had 2 partners, always use BC and condoms, never been pregnant\have STD and regualry go to the gyno... so I turned out pretty responsible. I think my parents raised me right.|`|LXc9tGJVaa	my parents didn't allow dating until I was 16, butI'm 21 now and have been with the same guy since I've been 14, so I guess if your child really does like someone a lot when they are younger than that and respect themselves enough not to start being promiscious, then I would consider meeting the person they like and then going from there. If they seem mature enough together, then I might consider letting them date a little younger.|`|AA12243427	30...    just kidding  it depends on the child maturity, not everyone is ready to date at 13-14...the most important factor is what kind of dates are they planning? ...    just talk to the teen and find out for yourself a comfortable compromise.|`|ZKDIMnVKaa	I will allow my kids to start dating when they are 16yrs old.|`|jD0h3s0jaa	16|`|KESlvKqQaa	High school, and in groups to start.

T8zPA3FJaa	Generally a doctor will decide upon an induction when you are 10+ days, as you then pose a risk of becoming toxic. Pre-due date induction is usually only done if you pose a risk going to your due date or you are highly effaced.|`|GNtsdk4saa	For first baby:  They'll induce if there is a medical necessity (for example, if your blood pressure goes sky-high), if they think the baby is in trouble (low fetal heart rate during stress tests), or if you are 2 weeks late.      For second or later babies:  All of the above, or if you have trouble during your previous childbirth.  Example:  A very large baby and lots of tearing (stage 3 or 4) for the mom, they might induce you a week or so early if they think the next baby is also big.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	it's not your choice at all. it is your doctors.

U need to talk to her.|`|JsffWlnEaa	doctor|`|AA12000741	go to the doc....you may need a d&c if you are having a miscarriage...i didnt have a d&c with my first miscarriage and that caused a lot of problems later on resulting in 4 surgeries costing a lot of money...|`|12d8a53bc1ba1a3b1acbc965d42e7628aa	You may need to go to your doctor for a D&C, sometimes you don't pass all of the remaining tissue on your own and you need to be cleaned out. You should go to the dr regardless.|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	Bad pain and blood, those are strong reasons to go see a doctor.  If you did miscarry you should still go see the doctor to check you and make sure you are ok. I'm so sorry you are going through this but now you need to get yourself checked out.  Please don't wait, just go to the doctor right away.    EDIT: Does your mom know you're pregnant? I say give her a call or go see her, give her the news and tell her what's going on. Your health comes first sweety, having your mom there with you will be best too I think.|`|njUuNHzvaa	well it was probably ur period because you can still have ur period and be pregnant that what happened to me. and don't drink anything because it bad for your baby. IF you are not sure or feel really worried go to the doctor but i mostly think it was ur period =) good luck?|`|hvzdZNlhaa	I found out I was pregnant last week.  Yesterday I was bleeding and cramping I had a miscarraige.  You should call your mother bc you need to go to the emergency room, to have tests done.  It is the best thing to do and you will be ok.
9104bb285d8b87b92fe87a09510fdbfdaa	take a bath (as long as you waters have not broken), do some mindful breathing (just concentration on your breathing) get hubby to rub your back or massage you, shower, hot and cold compresses on your back might help take your mind off the contractions, I would suggest walking but it can make contractions more intense but it will help to bring baby down, intensify contractions and help by shortening labour some, sitting bouncing on a birthing/Yoga ball might help (make sure your steady) keep changing positions till you find one that is helping you feel more comfortable, when it becomes uncomfortable again move again, don't forget to breathe you have to remember that your body is doing the rest all you have to do is breathe!!   Good luck I hope you have a smooth easy, quick birth,   Drink plenty, pee often and move!!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Sit in a warm bath it will help with the pains and relax you at the same time.
SaINc1Plaa	In your last question you said you kids were saying "queef" at the dinner table, and you were wondering what it meant.  Now you want to know if your wife will "queef a lot" while giving birth???      You're a sick ticket, dude.
scWXOSnOaa	This happened to me with my son. He was always measuring at least 4 weeks ahead so the doctors kept taking ultrasounds and measurements to check the growth of the baby and his weight.  Don't worry that your baby is weighing more then the average, my son was weighing 8 pounds at 34 weeks and he was born at 41 weeks weighing 10 pounds.   So chances are you've got a nice big strong baby on the way. But for your sake I hope the due dates wrong! Congrats!|`|ioZeveazaa	It sounds like family genetics is showing up in your baby. He may just turn out to be a large baby. NOthing wrong with that as long as he is healthy. However if he gets too big, you will probably have to get a c-section to safely get him out. Good luck and don't worry so much!|`|FKf67HXaaa	its probably fine babies are all different your just going to have a big baby most likely.|`|yrDqtazLaa	The baby is taking a lot from you, that's why he's big and you're small. There's nothing to worry about, it just means he's healthy and might be big when you go into labor.    The doctor can look at size to determine your due date, but they mostly look at the formation of the organs (brain, heart, lungs, stomach, intestines) to determine your due date. Size just helps that part along. So, if the organs are showing to be 21 weeks, but the baby's size is showing to be 22, you are really at 21.|`|AA10780655	I had an ultrasound at 18 1/2 weeks  And he weighed 13 oz.  The baby website said he was almost double the average  Im 36 weeks now and the doctor said he already weighs at least 6 1/2 pounds  And if I go to 40 weeks he'll be close to 9 pounds  Your probably just going to have a big baby, dont worry  I also think Im actually a week ahead of what the doctors say
x8JRkRNkaa	Oh my gosh. Your the only person who must know what I'm going through!! So I'm not alone! I have and had with my other two pregnancy terrible PSD.  Everyone around me thinks it's in my head, normal pregnancy pain. And so does my doctor. The only way I found out what I have is by my own research! My PSD got worse after my second delivery. I had both my previous babies naturally and this one will be too. I must have done something while pushing her out because I couldn't walk without pain for a full year! I'm terrified of having it happen again. I have heard of some woman having elected C-sections, but for me major surgery is really out, unless I don't have a choice. Unfortunately for me since nobody where I live believes in this I had to suffer. I hope you don't go through the same thing! Good luck. I feel your pain.|`|AA11100500	Just be calm... I didn't go into LABOR LABOR till Oct 5th, had my baby Oct 6th. Went thru the same thing. I was due Sept 26th. Had contractions on and off sometimes for days sometimes just for minutes... It will come just stay calm and relax!|`|9104bb285d8b87b92fe87a09510fdbfdaa	firstly the contractions that you are experiencing are called Prodormal labour and even though its annoying it is doing something for you! whether effacing, dilating a little or toning your uterus.  Not everyone looses their mucus plug, I dont remember loosing mine with all 5 of them! Im not 100% sure what you can expect with PSD I have had 1 client with some PSD but it was not severe and she laboured very well she thought that it was going to hurt more because of the PSD and found that after a while the intensity of the contractions was more on her mind than the PSD, try taking a bath it might help relax you and help with the PSD too! Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!|`|3edef8d3de65a00ff88d23cecd7bc6ffaa	you'll be fine....just be patient.
sI0HbV68aa	My cycle is very regular like yours (every 28 days).  I started trying around 11 days after the first day of my period.  We had intercourse every day for about 5 days.  We became pregnant the first month we tried.  Unfortunately, we lost our baby due to a blood clotting disorder I later found out I had.  If you follow this routine, you should have no trouble getting pregnant, since you are so regular.  We are getting ready to try again and I'm going to follow the same regimen.    Good Luck!!!!!!|`|8R2aDPXOaa	total abstinence first ten days and everyday up to twentyfour days or you feel like pain, only once a day late at night but not an hour before day break. please report consequences.|`|RCWDyzogaa	Well, I am a bio major and from what I have learned there is a certain window when this is at it's prime for success.  It is somewhere between the first and second week immediate after your period.  You can try as much as you want.  Make sure you are not using something that will neutralize the sperm in any way.  It usually will take many attempts for most people, but if you keep trying you will get it to happen unless there is a sterility problem of sorts for either one of you (hope this is not the case).  Millions of sperm per ejaculation so don't worry about it.  If you know when you are ovulating you should try it then, the beginning would probably be the best.  Not to rule out the end of ovulation because pregnancy can occur even if you are about to start your period.|`|81sucrAEaa	just keep doing it|`|HhY4Oul2aa	15 dYS AFTER PEROD STRTS|`|0HYG8PlNaa	It is before you start to ovulate that you are most fertile. I have heard it is good to go one time a day every day especially during the fertile time. However if you happen to ovulate one day later you could still be fertile the day after you suspected ovulation. Good Luck.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	On the days you ovulate! you can check on ovulation-calendar.net  You only ovulate 5 days out of the month!     GL|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Place your ankles behind your ears|`|731a2812389b0bee32cddb4ad5329e29aa	i think you should go see a doctor its better!|`|iCLGHUdQaa	BEFORE!  The sperm can live in you for about 3 days, so it's best to have them waiting for the egg to show up.    Have you ever used ovulation predictor kits?   They'll let you know when you're about to ovulate - they detect a hormone that is release 24-48 hrs before ovulation happens.    Good Luck!!!|`|1wb9rotSaa	I would say that you need to try a few days before you actually have your period.  If you already had your period, there is no point in having sperm in your ovarian ducts because the egg is already gone.  I'd say everyday a few days before you usually start your period (like 4-5).  See what happens.  Good luck ;) lol|`|KKrvaPB7aa	i just got done answering this same exact question an hour ago. you should wait until after the pain stops or else it will be uncomfortable and you could have problems. try for a couple months then consult your local doctor.
m8aqAZgJaa	Its not anything that you should be terrified about. I was 12 weeks when I had a D&C and my Dr said that it was ok to start trying again once the bleeding stopped. I got pregnant right away and am now 31 weeks and the baby is doing great.I was concerned about getting pregnant so quickly after but the Dr said that there is no evidence to prove that getting pregnant so soon after a miscarriage will increase your chances for a miscarriage again. He said that most Dr's will tell you to wait 2-3 cycles for your own emotional wellbeing.|`|Pdn4sAKHaa	my sister got prego like a month after her miscarriage they say its not good because ur body needs time to heal but u should be fine just get checked out by ur doc...good luck..|`|P3e2kJtwaa	It is very likely that you can carry this baby to term. A lot of people have done it before, even right after a previous miscarriage. Just be sure to go to your doctor right away and get as much information as you can|`|vwuMTm7Saa	I've heard to wait a month, so I think that you are in the clear.  I think the doc. gave you good advice because they don't want you to try and get discouraged.  Stress can be very bad if you are trying to conceive.  Congratulations and good luck!|`|GEyJMsaKaa	I think right now there is about %60 chance that you will have another miscarriage. But just keep going to see your doctor. You can't tell what the future will bring.    Good luck and God bless!!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I had a miscarriage and then 3 months later I found out I was pregnant. I'm 27 weeks pregnant and I've had no complications. So I'm assuming it's alright.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I heard you should wait at least 3 months because your body might not be ready to be pregnant again.  I personally miscarried after only having one period after a previous miscarriage and was told it was probably because my body wasn't ready to be pregnant again.  BUT my SIL had a miscarriage, a period and than got pregnant again and had a normal healthy pregnancy and he is now 7 years old.  I would definitely say you have a higher chance of miscarrying again, but you could still have a normal healthy pregnancy.  I would just not tell anyone until you have it confirmed by the doctor.  I mean it is okay to tell close relatives, but I wouldn't tell the world just yet.
ETM57dBAaa	I would take another test and if it is neg ask the doctor for a blood pregnancy test to check you HCG level.  There is no sich thing as a false posative only a flase negative so I would double check before taking any other meds, incase it could harm the baby if you would be pregnant~
PKyzcW7Faa	I am 9 weeks along, on friday I was getting cramps I decided to check with my doctor he said it was common and to take it easy. So I did since it was my day off, I grabbed pillow and a throw blanket and watched t.v. NICE huh. Hope you feel better. Good Luck .|`|AA11763588	Yep, could be ligament pains or Braxton Hicks. Totally normal and you will feel it through out your pregnancy.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	I was worried about the same thing and finally when my 15 week apt came, I had worried myself into the worst situation! The doctor checked me for bleeding and a pap and everything was fine. Its normal, and you and your baby are going to be fine. It is annoying, but after like the 15th week, it pretty much seemed to go away...for now anyway.|`|ebCzRLw7aa	Its just your uterus stretching,  its fine.|`|VUss5AfAaa	yes and you are going to all the way till you are 9 months pregos hun.  just breath and move side to side or dont think of it and think of something else and it will go away.  get use to them. part of being a mom!
hmQDjHs6aa	I was thinking of doing the same....
BY02DhfWaa	it is not that bad think of something really gross you are thinking ,what could possibly be worse than this ,but there are lots of things worse like washing out dippers cloth that is really bad,and eating ants ,eating worms ,puke,a dead animal anywhere,road kill , just be glad that they are happy and healthy and so are you . you will be fine good practice for down the road 10yrs from now .|`|GDobAMQ8aa	After the first time, I was "used to" it.  It's smelly, sometimes, but it's not a big deal.|`|AUWZJ8maaa	Its not that bad just wait till they get older and its like big kid poop depending on when the potty trained but just breathe through your mouth. You will be used to it no time trust me i used to be just like that.|`|5b4202a80a9f8a3978f1b24d38ef1b00aa	they are your siblings not your kids you shouldnt be changing their diapers|`|wE5JMeesaa	A day.  I work at a daycare now, so I change about 40 diapers a day.  I'm a pro, these days.    Hold your breath, breathe when the diaper is closed.  The key to getting rid of the smell fast is to wrap the diaper up and use the velcro sides to hold it shut.  Then put it in a plastic bag (from the grocery store!  Finally, a use for them!), then throw it away.      Man, I should offer lessons on diaper changing.  People waste time taking pants off.  That's the biggest mistake.    Anyway, to answer your question, not long.  Pull a kid's pants and diaper back to investigate what's inside and get poo on your finger.  When you're not horrified, you know you're way too comfortable.|`|f98ecf3f5dd8f9c4fb1b97facf100a2aaa	I got used to it straight away. Believe me it's worse when they start solids! My boyfriend refuses to change our twin daughter's nappies  for the same reason but I think he's just being a sook!|`|dnEmFs2maa	It took a few months.  Once you're into a routine of changing diapers, it just becomes as natural as changing clothes, or bathing.|`|yW2C9LWhaa	Start by breathing through your mouth.  Work fast and remember that it is just precious angle poop and that it is not going to hurt you.  You will get used to them pretty fast.  Good luck.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I never had to "get used to it" because, frankly, it didn't bother me. I worked in day cares before I had my son and in my church's nursery even before then. I guess by the time my son came along I was immune to it.    My husband, on the other hand, still gags at the site and smell of a poopy diaper. He rarely changes them because they literally make him sick to his stomach. It's funny to watch him try though!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	do it a few more times, and you'll have it!!|`|c2kopbo6aa	a couple weeks...lol its difference when their your own but you'll get use to it soon...its just poopy...sometimes if im eating dinner and he goes i have to stop to change him then go back to eating....i don't really think about it...ya know?|`|ggETPqedaa	I don't know if you ever get "used to" changing dirty diapers. My guy is two months old and I can tolerate it better on some days than others, some are stinkier than others and some are messier than others.  However, you get better within a couple of weeks if you change them all the time.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Once I realized a pooping baby is a happy baby, I got over it!  My little girl had a problem pooping, and was pretty miserable, so I welcome those poopy diapers!|`|o7bYWjy7aa	i just adapted to it straightaway i guess i ddnt change one till he was 3 days old though but its not fazed me at all|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Colten is 5 months old today and well, we still havent gotten "used to it", its a dirty stinky job but you just have to deal with it.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It didn't take any time at all.|`|MO2H26XOaa	I didn't really need time to get used to changing the diapers. It is smelly and everything, but just think of how bad it would smell if i never got changed at all...give it time..you will be a pro in no time!|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I never got used to changing the diapers, but i did it anyway
AA10624857	Eating pineapple does not induce labor.  That is an Old Wives' Tale.  When my daughter was pregnant with my grandson she craved fresh pineapple.  She easily went through 3-4 pineapples every week.  A pretty expensive craving, but it didn't make her go into labor.  Actually, nothing really makes you go into labor, not even walking.  All 4 of my babies were born past their due dates by 9 days, 11 days, 5 days, and 7 days.  I walked for miles, had a lot of sex, ate spicy food, did squats, walked up and down stairs, drove down bumpy back roads and scrubbed floors on my hands and knees.  Nothing I did made my babies come any sooner.  Babies come when the time is right.  Even medical inductions don't always work if everything isn't ready.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	no|`|AA11763588	The simple answer is, babies come when babies are ready.    If there really was a sure fire way to induce labor we'd all be doing it!|`|qN5iVvAFaa	No No No...... walking induces labor...|`|01vMpHkWaa	hope not..i love pineapple..dont want my baby coming early|`|AA11885437	no. I craved pineapple sooo bad all the time with my daughter. My husband would ask what I wanted for dinner and I would say pineapple with a side of pineapple. I think I probably polished off a whole one by my self on several occasions as well. And my daughter was a week late. :)|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Nope.  I tried it with my daughter and it never worked.|`|VUss5AfAaa	umm no hahah who told you this!|`|EUdpSXQWaa	Hehe I had heard the same thing and am now over 39 weeks, thought I'd give it a try the other night, ate like an entire pineapple, NOTHING lol So I'm going to say this is a myth... MmM a tasty one though :)  :)

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Little kids age 4 and younger may not understand that they shouldn't take things that don't belong to them. But by the time you are 5 or 6, you understand what's right and what's wrong. Most school-age kids know that they aren't supposed to take something without asking or without paying for it.    Still, some kids lack self-control. They might see something they want and take it. They don't stop to think first about what might happen. They might not think to buy the object or ask to borrow it. Kids get better at self-control as they grow. Some kids may need extra help learning self-control.    Some kids steal because their friends or family members do it or because they might have been dared. They might believe their friends will like them more if they steal. Doing something for these reasons is called peer pressure, but kids don't have to give in to it.    Some kids steal because they feel something is missing in their lives. What's missing may be love or attention. Or simple things like food and clothing. They may be angry, sad, scared, or jealous. They might steal as a way to deal with the situation. But stealing won't fix what's missing.    Other kids might have personal problems that lead them to steal. They may feel jealous of what others have. They may feel unloved and neglected. Or they may be upset that their parents are arguing or getting divorced. A kid might steal, in this case, to make up for something that's missing. But stealing won't solve these problems.    Other kids don't care about rules. They steal because they think they can get away with it. They may believe they deserve to have the stolen goods. But kids need to learn respect rules and the rights of other people.    What Can Happen if You Steal?  Stealing causes a whole bunch of problems. Suppose a kid sees a pen in a store and decides to take it. If she gets caught, the store owner might say she's not allowed in the store again. The owner might tell her parents. She may have to give money to pay for the pen and the police could be called because stealing (including shoplifting) is a crime. She could be arrested, especially if she has stolen before, and that could lead to more problems. She may have to go to court and may have some sort of punishment, like having to do work in the community to make up for what she has done.    How does stealing make someone feel? Whoever is stealing is probably nervous during the act itself. If she gets away with it, she may be relieved at first. Later, she feels lousy because she knows what she did was wrong. She may also be afraid that someone will discover her secret, and she'll want to deny it. But lying will only make matters worse.    If she gets caught, she may be really embarrassed. Then she may be ashamed because she let down her family. She may feel like nobody trusts her anymore. She might feel stupid and worried. What if she goes to jail? What if her favorite teacher finds out? What if she loses her friends?    Stealing has serious consequences (say: con-see-kwen-ses) because it hurts everyone. Stealing causes a big problem for a family. Store owners have to spend more money to protect their things, which makes prices go up for paying customers. Kids sometimes don't trust each other with their belongings. People don't feel as safe when they're worried about someone stealing. Stealing, in fact, may lead to violence. Some kids even carry weapons to protect themselves from other kids who may want to take their jewelry or clothing. This can lead to even more problems.    What Should You Do if You Know Someone Who Steals?  If you know someone who steals, you shouldn't just shrug it off. That's like saying stealing is OK. You can tell the person that stealing is wrong or that you're concerned about him, but he may get angry with you. It's a good idea to tell a parent, teacher, counselor, or other adult that you trust. Then leave it up to the adult to decide how to handle the situation.    Don't hang out with kids who steal. It's not smart to go along with someone just because he's your friend or because you don't want to be left out. Follow your conscience (say: con-shens), and don't do anything that would hurt others. Do what you know is right. If someone is caught stealing, you could get in trouble just because you were there with him when it happened.    When Stealing Becomes a Habit  Some kids who steal once might do it a second and third time, until it becomes a habit. Repeat stealers often act in other bad ways, too. They may lie, fight, cheat, or write graffiti. They might ignore rules and disrespect other people and their belongings.    But even if stealing has become a habit, kids who steal can change their ways. Kids sometimes make mistakes, but there are ways to get back on the right track. Kids can ask adults to help them. Parents, counselors, and other adults can help kids with troubles that may have led them to steal in the first place. Kids can learn right from wrong, get better at self-control, and learn to solve problems without stealing.  nfd?|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Start taking her stuff.

The second time, I was surprised that Amy had given Arielle the toy from her kids' meal. The third time -- when Arielle came home with furniture from Amy's dollhouse wrapped in her scarf -- it finally dawned on me that my child was stealing. With images of size-6x prison uniforms in my mind, I drove her back to her friend's house and insisted that she return the goods and apologize.    Like most kids, Arielle had sticky fingers as a toddler, when her philosophy was "What's mine is mine, and what's yours is mine too." But I assumed that by 5, she'd learned not to take things that didn't belong to her. In fact, stealing is perfectly normal for children this age, says family and child therapist Meri Wallace, director of the Heights Center for Adult and Child Development, in Brooklyn. "Five- and 6-year-olds are in the process of developing a conscience, but it can still be very hard for them to control their impulses when they see something they want," she says. "Although they know the rules intellectually, they haven't internalized them yet."    Stealing is not entirely impulsive, however. "Five- and 6-year-olds are outgrowing the belief that adults can read their mind, and they're exploring the idea that there are secrets they can keep to themselves," says developmental psychologist Gil Noam, Ed.D., a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "A 3-year-old may take a toy from his cousin's house with-out giving it a second thought, but a 5- or 6-year-old has usually done some planning," he says. "There's the anticipation, the hiding, and then justifying having the new object at home."    Another reason kids this age steal is to fit in with their peers. "They look around, see what other kids have, and feel bad if they don't have the same things," says Wallace, author of Birth Order Blues (Henry Holt, 1999). Five- and 6-year-olds are also likely to be influenced by television commercials that tout the trendiest toys. Stealing may seem like an easy way to keep up with the cool kids.    When Nicky Dempsey was 5, he would "borrow" things from his friends, his school, even the local five-and-ten. He also had a habit of "accidentally" picking up the tips left on tables at restaurants. "Once, I caught him walking out of the grocery store with a box of Fruit Roll-Ups down his pants," recalls his mother, Bobbi, of Hazle Township, Pennsylvania. "We talked to him about why it's wrong to take things that don't belong to you, and he eventually outgrew it about a year and a half later. But I was really upset about it at the time."    Although it's hard not to get angry if you see your child slip a candy bar into his pocket, it doesn't mean he's a bad kid -- or that you're a bad parent. However, if you make your child feel ashamed or humiliated, he'll learn the wrong message: that he shouldn't steal because he might get caught and yelled at.    You should view your child's stealing as an opportunity to teach him right from wrong -- concepts your kindergartner is grappling with, Dr. Noam says. Be matter-of-fact about the situation ("It's not right to take something without paying for it. You need to give it back and apologize"). Don't compare your child to a sibling ("Your brother never did anything like this"), but express your family values in a more positive way ("Stealing is not something we do in our family").    Even if you understand that stealing is part of a developmental stage, you still need to make it clear that theft is wrong in order for your child to stop doing it. Instead of downplaying her actions by saying, "I'll call Stacey's mom and tell her you took the Powerpuff doll by accident," be direct: "Taking something that belongs to Stacey and not telling her is stealing. We have to return it right away."    If you find something in your child's backpack that you suspect he might have stolen, make a neutral comment, such as "Mmm, I wonder where this came from." If he says he doesn't know, give him a second chance to confess ("I know you didn't have it when you left for school"). However, if you're certain that your child has stolen something, don't ask him -- he'll probably lie to save face. Simply acknowledge it ("I see you took the Game Boy"), and let him know that you realize how he feels ("It's okay to want it and wish it were yours, but it's not okay to take it"), Wallace suggests. Then find a way to repair the situation -- go back to the store or his friend's house to return the stolen item. If your child is too shy, you can apologize for him ("My son took this pack of gum, but he knows now that it was wrong").    "Kids are driven by their emotions, so it's helpful to find out what your child was feeling when she took something," says child and adolescent psychotherapist Joyce E. Divinyi.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Child psychologist visit.|`|DekGIOImaa	SLAP HIM!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I saw this on desperate housewives: you make them take back whatever they stole to whoever they stole it from and make them apologize to that person....its supposed to be embarassing enough for them to make them not want to do it.  Also, I've heard of people having somebody come and "arrest" the kid.  Is the kid stealing from you?  If my kid was stealing from me, I would explain that they don't need to steal from me, all they have to do is ask if they need something.  If that doesn't work, maybe send them to their room with no tv and all that....my parents would have given me a good spanking, which, when all other methods have been exhausted I'm not totally against :)|`|AA11104833	I am not sure what a kleptomaniac is.

My due date was pushed forward by 2 weeks at the time.    When I had my 28 weeks scan my baby had increased in size to the point where I am now due even earlier than my LMP date so all I can say is do not worry. Your baby will grow at whatever rate she feels and although she may be small now she will probably catch up later.    Good luck!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	if the ultrasound showed that the baby is the right size then i wouldnt worry to much, maybe the person who measured your belly did it wrong.

NglVonEUaa	Okay, first off I want to say congratulations on your miracle!     Secondly, I know what it is like to lose a child. My son passed away on July 17th of 2001. He was 2 years, 11 months and 6 days old. I have had two daughters since and the first daughter was named after him. So I understand you wanting to incorporate Renee Nichole's name in there somehow. Have you thought about maybe doing the same initials or maybe reversed initials? (Example: Natasha Rose, Nicholas Richard, Raven Nichole, Noelle Rayne & Robert Nathanial)    Of the names you have come up with, I absolutely LOVE Genevieve. That was my grandmother's name and is my first name. I was always called Genny as a kid and honestly I didn't like it. I would have preferred to be called Eve or Genna. But in adulthood I started going by my full first name. I think it is a beautiful name. (Maxine is my middle name by the way.)    I think Genevieve Elaine sounds very pretty together.  I also like Juliette, Anastasia and Natasha.  For the boys names, I like Samuel Quinn. I think that sounds very good together. So does Benjamin Cole and Christopher Mason.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	Congratulations on five!    I think all of these names are wonderful.    However, I am confused why you would name them a name, but call them something else.    If you like the name Lucy, name the girl Lucy, not Lucille.     I just think it is confusing for a child.    My husband goes by his middle name and has his whole life. It's just confusing, because he doesn't go by his legal first name!|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I love the names Jane, Rose, Mary, and Molly!

aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	I've already "spoken" with you about my experience, but I'll try to go into a little more detail.    I actually "journaled" both of my pregnancies, so I know exactly when the itching started with my first.  It started when I was about 7 weeks pregnant as a rash on my upper arms only.  From there it spread across my chest, down my belly, and then down my legs.  I actually scratched myself bloody at points.    My ob-gyn sent me to a dermatologist, who found nothing wrong with the standard blood tests (they did not do the needed tests for cholestasis).  I was prescribed two different creams but neither helped.  On the third trip in, they did a skin biopsy of one of the rashy bumps, and again found nothing.  By that time I was about 6 months pregnant, and I looked like I had the plague or something.  The itch kept me up at night even.  I would wake up scratching with the sheets all bloody.    It did start to slack off a little when I was about 30 weeks, but then my daughter was born right at 32 weeks gestation.  The itching immediately stopped after she was born, and a different doctor was the one that actually diagnosed the cholestasis postpartum.  I also had hypertension, (often associated with cholestasis) and gestational diabetes with her.    I did not have any of the problems with my son that I had with my daughter, even though they say that if you have cholestasis with one you will have it with subsequent pregnancies.  Go figure.  I was much healthier with my second than I was with my first, so maybe that had something to do with it.|`|zKDHetmEaa	Hey Honey,     I just googled it there and on the irish website vhi came up some information - it's like bupa or one of the healthcare companies.....    http://www.vhi.ie/hfiles/hf-563.jsp    but don't get yourself freaked out - it might not be this at all honey!!!! good luck, and I will be thinking of you sweetie!!     xxxxxx
yU0dp5HDaa	You could be pregnant. Your body could and is likely still getting into the swing of things.
ikLzeEEVaa	this might seem a little harsh------ but i'm in college... and i moved once at 8 from new jersey to florida in the middle of the school year... it was a HUGE culture shock.... and really i didn't want to go... but my mother has always raised us to know our places... she was the adult and we we're the children.. don't get me wrong i love my mother and i truly believe that she did a wonderful job at raising us.. however... your little girl really doesn't have an option... it's obvious no matter what she's moving (WHY) because you're her legal guardian. so you kinda need to let her know that now and let her know that she doesn'tt have an option. as kids we all have upsets that we at the time think is the end of the world... but as we all know life moves on and eventually she'll get over it.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Stop mentioning it.  Give her some time to adjust to the idea.  Bottom line is she has no choice.  Closer to the date you are to move just be positive about the move....maybe even buy some books on things to to in Texas.  Reassure her she will make new friends!|`|JJhxzfA4aa	ok i am only 13 but i do know that it is really hard on kids to move around the age of 10 to senior year!!! they don't want to leave their friends!!! just tell them that it will be okay because he or she will meet new friends!!! if that doesn't work then tell them to get their friends numbers and make sure they keep in touch with each other!!! that's what my parents did and i still hang out with my old friends!!!|`|IX9znFLAaa	Be very positive about the upcoming change and act like you are excited.  Don't be so direct at first and say things like "I can't wait to decorate my new room" or "I can't wait to meet our new neighbors." Your daughter will see you are excited and she herself will become too. Explain that change is fun and exciting, but its ok to be a bit scared. 
HXfHkoSHaa	No, my midwife told me that castor oil will cause really bad diarrhea.  She said it will often continue into labor.  Think about it hard before doing it.  Do you really want diarrhea while you're having contractions, and someone else has to clean you up?|`|AA10167940	Take it only if you like diarrhea and painful cramping-      You could possibly already be in labor, call your OB or go into your L&D-|`|067in9BMaa	No. I took it to induce and did nothing. not even diarea (which I would have welcomed at that point) But I wouldn't suggest it unless you like that nasty taste.
5972520be22327425d6bd6829064cadcaa	You are the best judge here.  If you think she's ready, then have her go.   Since she was really close to him, it will help her put some closure on this stage of life.  It will help her to see that his passing affected other people too and that she's not alone.    Also, most funerals are also celebrations of life, and it would be nice for your daughter to witness this too.    I wondered the same thing when my dear, dear friend died at 97 when my twins were 5.  They too were close to her.  They attended her memorial although they didn't attend the graveside service.  (There was no viewing)    If your gut tells you she'll be ok, then I'd have her go.  Watch her closely and make sure you give her lots of opportunities to talk about this.  And don't be afraid to cry either.    I'm so sorry about your grandfather's passing.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	I would take her. You would hate to have her not understand that her grandfather died, and now she is old enough to remember it. Explain it very well before, saying things like "There will probably be some people crying, because they loved your grandpa very much. If you are sad, it's ok to cry, but don't feel like you have to." I would not take her to see the wake, or if you do take her, don't take her up to the body. That would probably be to much. I'm around 13, and I wouldn't even see the body of a great uncle (sort of). That might overwhelm her or scare her. Other than that, I think she would be able to handle it. |`|1cYPOJkqaa	I was 5 when my great granny died. I was allowed to go to the funeral. It gave my parents a chance to explain death to me.     It was a valuable experience as a class mate died a year later and I was more aware about death.    It's up to you. You know your daughter and if you think she can handle it, then you make the decision.|`|1f0b0b03d9c133a55edc666d26db0972aa	Depends if it's open casket or not also if you think she can understand the concept of death. You're the one closest to her so you're probably the only one who knows if she's ready|`|Ck2AhfTRaa	why dont you ask her? tell her the funeral is in a few days and let her know that it will be a time to remember him and greive. tell her that its okay if shes not ready to go but that if she does nothing is expected of her (dont expect her to cry -it may hurt or embarrase her to do that in public- or it may not be her style of greiveing.) and that whatever she feels is normal and is okay. |`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	I work in a funeral home and I have seen children of all ages attend funerals, I just think it's inappropriate and disrespectful when the younger are running around and screaming, but if they can sit there and behave I think it's ok|`|jLYTKr33aa	While a child should never be forced to go to a funeral, she should never be forbidden, either.  My son was 2 1/2 when my father - in - law, his beloved grandfather, passed away.  We explained to him the best we could what the funeral was, and he decided to go so he could say goodbye.  If your daughter wants to go, please give her the option.  |`|1jwEqxFlaa	I think it is appropriate at any age|`|tg30Jgclaa	I took my 1 year old to my grandfathers funeral and she was fine. |`|BOxTRivwaa	I would give her the choice. It is an appropriate age but I would let her decide.|`|nppCLaDIaa	I think that if you are better off explaining to her what happened and let her say goodbye.  Don't beat around the bush, and don't be too direct.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I think it is not only appropriate but necessary at that age so she can have some closure.|`|RKvZoCemaa	My children went to my grandmothers when they were 1, 4 and 6. Also my daughters went to our aunts at ages 2 and 4. Its never too early, as its a part of life. My 6 year old was telling my 4 year old that it was okay to be sad, Grams was gone to a better place. She knows that she is with God. She also looked at my grandmothers body and said I know she isn't it there anymore. |`|OiZD4leLaa	I think it would be fine to take her. I recently went to my friend's grandfather's funeral. He took his girls (6,8,12) and they were fine there. |`|AA10529334	I think at this age she should go. 
AA10091300	since you don't live together he doesn't feel the need to feel responsible or care for the child. You can't make someone love your baby just because he was part in creating him. Sadly he will probably be a deadbeat dad. If he "props" a 6 week old's bottle and leaves the baby to choke why would you even care if he doesn't want anything to do with baby. His actions have already spoken to you! Listen and don't be a party to NEGLECT of an innocent child! move on with your life and hope that someone will love your baby one day. You are better off without this loser that is only a biological parent|`|IFs6MWDJaa	maybe you should have waited in till you got married. or at lest waiting tell you where living together to have kids with him     he might just not have wanted to have kids right now.  give it more time, one of two things well happen. he well bond with the baby and be a father to him.  or bail out |`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You may need to give him, an ultimatum.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Sounds like you have two babies.    Is it his baby?  You state proudly that it's yours, but nothing about it being his.  If the baby isn't his, he may resent it being another man's, and not feel any responsibility for it.  Even if it is his child too, he may resent the attention being taken away from him.  If even YOU call it "your" baby, instead of "our" baby, it sounds like you already expect him to not care.    Instead of telling him he has to help you, try telling him how you feel.  You feel... tired?  Lonely?  Unappreciated?  Overworked with dealing with "our" child alone?  Ask him what he can do to help.  See if HE can think of something instead of telling him.    This may not work either -- my best guess is that he was eager to have obvious proof that you are HIS (carrying his child!), but doesn't want the responsibility that goes with the actual baby.  If you're lucky, you guys can talk and work it out; but if he really doesn't want to grow up, and resents your attention taken from him to the baby, there's not much you can do.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	Join the club.|`|Xn21UL6Yaa	If he doesn't want to have anything to do with the baby, then let him.  You had 9 months to get used to being a mom (you couldnt drink or smoke, and you bought clothes and thought up names) because you were pregnant. It was already a reality for you, but he needs time to get used to it too. Yes, he needs to man the f*ck up and take care of his kid, but you can't expect him to jump for joy over his loss of freedom.   If he doesn't want to help, then he doesn't get to make rules. If he isn't going to help, then he doesn't get to spend the night, if he doesnt want to help out then he can go somewhere else.   Some guys just aren't meant to be dads. My daughter is now 3, hasn't seen or heard from her dad in almost 3 years. I got tired of waiting on him, and I quit making excuses for him.  I know that you're only 17, and you need reassurance, but I think he may not be ready to be a dad. You need to sit down with him and tell him whats going on. You need to tell him that it took 2 people to have a baby, and he needs to do his part. Just because you're the mom, that doesn't mean that all the un-fun stuff is yours, and all the cool, happy moments belong to him. You deserve to be happy, your baby deserves to be happy.  If his dad doesn't man up, take responsibility and help out, you need to be willing to let him go, and cut him off. maybe that's what it'll take for him to come around.  Good luck, and I'm really glad you're being a good mom.|`|AA11287657	Firstly, it sounds like he does have a paternal instinct and probably loves the baby - because he was excited through the pregnancy, is protective of who holds him, and will at least get up to give him a bottle - you'd be surprised that many men out there wouldn't even do that!   With my first child, the father refused to do anything to do with the baby at all at night because he was working and I wasn't.  But I understand you are worried that he dosen't love the child as much as you do.  Many men go through this with a new baby - especially their first - they are so excited throughout the pregnancy but when the reality sets in and they realise the enormity of caring for the baby they go into a kind of denial.  You say he gives the baby attention when the baby is happy - and again that is a good sign.  Many young men (and 20 is young!) are simply at a loss as to how to cope and leave it the mother of the child because their instincts tell them the mother will look after the child no matter what - which of course is normally true!  Unfortunatley at the moment, I feel that trying to force him to do more with baby is only going to push him further away.  For the sake of trying to improve the relationship between them (even though it does make it hard on you at the moment) is to keep encouraging any posiitive input he makes.  Comments like "Oh, look, he loves it when his daddy gives him the bottle/plays with him, changes him! Isn't that gorgeous! He's going to love it when he gets bigger and he can play baseball/football (or whatever other interest your partner has) with his Daddy!"  Keep everything positive and lighthearted. And make sure you sleep when baby sleeps so you can keep coping! Resist the temptation to do housework etc. when baby is asleep - do that when baby is happily "playing" with something.  Wait until baby is asleep, yor partner is relaxed and happy, and then have a heat to heart with him. If you continue to feel down after all efforts are made please speak to a trusted friend, family member or doctor for extra help.  All the best to your little family!|`|3MhE11Ljaa	u should of givin more infomation of ur boyfriends age .if he is young   he may not be ready to play the father role just yet.  i no how u feel my step father did the same to my little sister   didnt do nothing to help out  . and just 2 let u no my little sister is 9 now and he doesnt have any thing 2 do with the role of being a father .  i think you better sit down and have a serious talk 2 him and tell him to step up 2 the plate. he helpt put the baby in ur lifes. if sitin him down and talking 2 him does not work maybe use should see a counciler i hope this infomation helps with ur relationships.|`|EOW8DOoNaa	You better talk to him sounds like hes being Pathetic and needs to take responsibility this is baby is his baby as much as it is yours! tell him to be a MAN and start taking responsibility or hes out and call child support on his ***!!!|`|EnH8jv6Taa	My sisters boyfriend is the exact same only wants something to do with his son when strangers are about and when my little nephew is happy.   Maybe he needs time to bond with him/her??  Talk to him and tell him how you are feeling and that you BOTH made the baby, its time for him to step up and start acting like a father to your bubs.  good luck|`|Ng7wAzVEaa	Wow sorry to hear that, in this situation you can get very stressed out. Honestly it takes any guy to make a baby but a real MAN/FATHER to be one. You just need to keep telling your guy this is OUR BABY!, We made him together, he's both of ours!! He needs to step up and be a Daddy! When will he ever learn on how to take care of his baby? if hes not there to learn and see.. ok the babies cries.....let me see dude theres only a handle full of possiblilities why the baby is crying. either hungry, pooped, sleepy,sick. Every moment is special with your baby and this guy is just missing out. Best wishes to you and keep ur head up momma|`|b2egKK8Faa	Let him know he can put up or get out and pay alimony while someone that is mature lives with you and the baby. Sometimes we have to share the load as well as the joys or it will become to heavy for the one to carry. If you are not mature enough to support life after it arrives then you were not mature enought to be a part of making it in the first place. Chances are this is just new to him and he need to become aware of some basic rules that apply in making and raising a child. |`|LiKMlFfzaa	well maybe he is the father but  just wanted sex and thats it  he figures you got pregnsnt not him i say dump the jerk he is not worth it. he will only get worse and be a abuser if you stay with him. you need a man not a jerk
2a2c24fc81bc910e984828a1ab26fd3daa	Your most fertile days are different for everyone, but everyone ovulates between day 14-21 I believe.  One of the telltale signs when you are ovulating is that you have a discharge that looks like egg whites, within a day or 2, you will ovulate.|`|uNtXklRJaa	well your most fertile days will vary from person to person but if you have an ideal cycle (28 days) it will be somewhere around day 14. Things to look for would be cervical mucus resembling egg whites also increased sex drive and those sorts of things.   |`|P21H7Yb8aa	No sex is "safe" sex.

38ddc9bef24d3c1eb6a19425a506078aaa	I found that with my second pregnancy they made me sick too. I've been taking the children's Flintstone chewable vitamins. I give one to my daughter and take one myself every day. They're delicious! lol |`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	If you really can't handle the prenatal vitamins, talk to your doctor and see if there is a alternative.  Make sure that you get enough folic acid which is in green vegetables, like spinach or celery leaves.  Also get enough omega 3 fatty acids, like in fish oil.  Omega 3's are absolutely necessary for brain and nervous system development. Without enough folic acid there is   an increased chance of birth defects, like spinal bifida.  Ask your doctor about ginger and see if it's OK for you to take. Ginger is the best thing for an upset stomach.  It is even good for those undergoing chemo therapy.  It is generally safe when you're pregnant unless you have gall bladder problems.  There are gel caps with dry ginger standardized for strength, or candied ginger or even ginger snaps.  Usually ginger ale is too weak to do much.    I hope you feel better and can enjoy this amazing time in your life!  Congratulations!  |`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Call the doctor.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	As long as the food you do eat is very nutritious you should be just fine. Make sure to eat enough folic acid everyday to prevent spinal bifida. |`|EVQzvOodaa	Its really not good for the baby it really needs those vitamins i was told if you cant keep those down to try flintstone vit. |`|4e01f5e1daf5676e8376408fe13f4fbdaa	take them. if they are really that bad go to your doctor and ask for a prescription prenatal. thats what i take. the baby needs the nutrients and so do you. many people have told me, including a few doctors that the baby can actually end up hurting you if you don't take them because he takes so much out of you if you don't put it back in then you're screwed.|`|ZfoU2lNJaa	Try taking them at night time after some good carbs... you really should take them! There is such high risks! If you seriously CAN'T take them then make sure you're getting folic acid in another way, because you NEED it. Eat a  lot of spinach, google some other things that have it in it too. And drink a glass or two of milk every day, because you need calcium. These still don't make up for a prenatal vitamin, but are better than anything! Your sickness should subside between 12-14 weeks, so if you can, try taking them after that. Good luck!|`|tDhkBCNjaa	i would go to your doctor. i am a nurse and i have learned that the baby will be ok but you need the consult from the doctor, no one on here can help, only if the are a doctor or a nurse|`|ozq92BHoaa	they make me sick tooo. so i take by doc recommendation of course flinstones vitamins or gummies take 2 and they dont make u sick the  prenatals are really strong sometimes to strong for some moms ...|`|Pa1mUyjfaa	No worries, the prenatals are for you, not the baby.  Your little one is getting absolutely everything it needs from you .... I'm 21 weeks and I don't take mine either and the Dr. said it's fine.  They made me sick too.  My little boy is doing just great! |`|93b7ec7fdebf357a510ed9e542f2ce4caa	i dont take mine and my baby was born with absolutley no problems. the vitamins are for you and your body. your baby is going to get all the nutrients it needs from your body no matter what. its YOU that is going to suffer if you dont get nutrients from your food. |`|vek2OwQfaa	There are many different kinds that you can try. not  they are all of them are easy on the stomach. Try going to a health food store, they seem to be easier on the tummy because they digest easier. This is what I had to do and it was fine. I wouldn't just not take anything they are really important.Good luck.|`|SfymamWtaa	well i was the same way this is my seventh child and i never took prenatal vitamins because they make me sick even the smell of them so i think you'll be fine just mention it to your doctor|`|AA12033653	Check with your doctor, a friend of mine had this problem, her prenatals were 2x per day, and she cut down to 1x instead.

Good luck!|`|SaTF1kB0aa	Well i took mine but I mean before they were invented women never had anything and there there babies came out fine so its not like you have to take them they just help
wiAVa1H5aa	Did they check for celiac disease?  It takes a blood draw, the gold standard is no longer a biopsy of the small intestine, and it's the most common autoimmune disorder - 1 in 122 of us have it.|`|NgxSR2k3aa	What kind of juice are you giving her? My daughet cant tolerate apple juice AT ALL. She gets the diarrhea so bad that her hind end instantly turns red and hurts her. Maybe your child is lactose intolerant. Try not giving her milk for a day or 2 and see if that helps. If that doesnt work, stop the yigurt for a couple days. try to rule out if it is something that she is eating first.|`|AA11132502	Have allergies been ruled out?  Milk allergies can cause similar symptoms.  After speaking to your pediatrician first, you may want to try to remove all milk and milk products (yogurt, cheese)or any containing whey (may be in crackers or bread) for a few days and see what happens.  The doctor may want you to add a calcium supplement (Viactiv works well per my pediatrician.)  Just consult your ped first.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Did this start with a tummy bug and unwellness?    You probably want to check this with her doctor, but my kids used to be like this and what I was advised to do was cut out the dairy completely for a few days until the diarrhoea went away.    But that's not "picky eater", that's "appalling diet". At the very least you should ditch the chicken nuggets and give her proper chicken. And there's no fruit or vegetable in her diet at all. What did you wean her onto? Why have you stopped feeding it to her?
Po2UqfvWaa	set up a arrangement through the hospital financial service people. they have someone that can work with you. same thing with the doctor visits. most will do payment plans|`|rjVALevtaa	How much does your husband make? As you said you make too much for medicaid but is it still a modest income? Your baby may qualify for something called Healthy Families. It's designed for people of middle class income who make too much for medicaid. It's only for children so it won't cover you and your husband. Still, you should google it and see if you qualify.    If you don't qualify, then yes you'll have to pay cash. The hospital will probably assign you a pediatrician. I delivered my first son at Riverside Community Hospital (Riverside, CA) and that's what they did.     I hope I was helpful.|`|AA10235491	Your best bet is to go to a Community Health Center or Clinic, where they will put you on a sliding fee based on your ability to pay. I sympathize with you because I have very basic Insurance and it also will not cover preexisting conditions, so I am lucky that I do not have any.|`|DYJOpfvraa	I know for a fact that you do qualify for Medi-Cal. Pregnant women are placed in a different category and will automatically qualify for Medi-Cal regardless of income. Once your baby is born he automatically gets Medi-Cal for a year and you get 2 month postpartum for two months.|`|AA11113671	my sissynlaw and me both went through this crap!!! its against the law to consider pregnancy as pre existing!  it has to do with life and death, not just illness, that you can do "without" meds. stupid, i know!!!!  i went through the same situation (however, im in texas) i just through a "hormonal" FIT, because i didnt qualify for medicaid, and the insurance companies knew they were wrong, and didnt want to get sued. push the fact!!!! (i had just switched from my dads insurance to my hubbys, and my sissynlaws job insurance just kicked in) i told them, its ridiculous, my husband actually works, and i cant get on his insurance, and he payes taxes for medicaid, but i dont qualify... paying out of pocket was not an option, so needless to say, they covered me!!!! (my husbands employer, that deals with the insurance, says they just say that to get out of paying for pre existing conditions...) my sissynlaw through a fit also, and her insurance decided to cover her pregnancy!!  now, if it was set in stone, they consider pregnancy as a pre existing condition, why was it that my sissynlaw and me were covered...? like i said im in texas, and its against the law, even though many people dont know it!!! however, where youre at it may be different. talk to a lawyer, because to qualify for nothing, is the gov just putting a life in danger!|`|ovzUvTifaa	You could go either route that you are most comfortable with.    If you prefer to pay outright for her visits until your husband's coverage kicks in, then you call the pediatrician you would like to see and schedule an appointment for a prenatal visit.  The prenatal visit is free.  It is simply for you to get to know them and ask questions.  If you and the doctor are in synch, then you let them know the baby's due date and they will be on call for you.  Your baby will need to be seen by the pediatrician for an exam at the birthing center - usually the day after she is born.  I believe that our visit was somewhere around $300 (it's an on-call visit and then there are tests that are run and sometimes shots that are given).  Then she'll need a checkup at 2 weeks and that will run between $100-200.  Then she'll need a 1 month checkup... 2 month checkup with immunizations.  4 month checkup with immunizations.  6 month with immunizations.  9 months checkup.  12 month with immunizations.  (I know you'll probably have insurance long before this but listed them so you would know what to expect.)    If I was in your position, I would opt to have insurance on my husband NOW and have him let them know he will have a dependent (child) soon.  Then your daughter will be covered from birth.  In most cases, everything runs smoothly but you just never know.  There is always a small possibility that your baby may need something 'extra' after she is born - even something as 'minor' as jaundice could mean paying a lot extra for bili-light treatments and such.  If you are able to do so, I would get the traditional insurance.  If not, you are working with what you have and I believe that we are not given circumstances in life that we cannot handle with what we have.    Congratulations!  I wish you a wonderful birthing and parenting experience. :)|`|qzuzomg9aa	You may not qualify for meidcaid...but check out caloptima...it is specifically for pregnant women...but check it out quickly as there is a limit you reach during pregnancy where they may not cover....again caloptima check them out and call them today!!!    If not, normally if you pay cash you will see that it turns out to be cheaper than paying the out of pocket for monthly fee for insurance and then pay the co payment or deductible depending on the insurance you get...I live in orange county and used cal optima...I was seeing a private doctor till about my 6th month when a nurse told me about caloptima...good luck and please look into it now

f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	It is very possible for you to get pregnant. When you are on the pill you have to be careful and if you miss more than 2 pills in a row it is very possible to get pregnant. If you think you might be pregnant then you should take a test. The most reliable time to take a pregnancy test is in the morning when you first wake up, that is the time of day that the concentration of hormones in your body is greatest.   If you are pregnant then you have a lot of options. At your age keeping the baby would be extremely difficult unless you have parents who are willing to help an support you through the pregnancy and raising the child. The father of the baby will be required by law, at least in most states, to pay child support. If he denies that he is the father then you can get a DNA test and that would give you the proof you need. You also have he option of adoption and abortion but you should talk to your family about those and decide what is best for you in your current situation and age. If you are pregnant then decide for yourself what is best for you and the baby, if the father doesn't want anything to do with you then you shouldn't want anything to do with him.   I hope that you aren't pregnant and either way my heart goes out to you. The absolute best advice i can give you is to drop this guy. A guy that has a girlfriend already but wants to mess around with someone else is an asshole and you deserve better.   Best of luck Levia, take that test as soon as you can, its really stressful thinking that you might be pregnant and it is better to know sooner than later. |`|76hNV3iqaa	First of all ANYTIME you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant. Second, no one on here can tell you for sure if you are pregnant or not. You need to go to the doctor to find that out . Third, even if you are on birth control you can become pregnant ( it's unlikely but it does happen) I am 23 and I have a 2 1/2 yr old boy and I am pregnant with my second. Both times I was on birth control, with my son I was on Yazman and with this one I had an IUD in. If you do not want to get pregnant the best thing is to not have sex! However if you do decide to have sex( which I think you are too young to be doing in the first place) Always use 2 forms of birth control. Have your partner wear a condom with a lube that has spermicide in it, and you should also be on birth control. Like I said before the only 1000% way not to get pregnant is NOT TO HAVE SEX! Also sweetie you should be tested for STD'S every 3 months if you are sexual active! Until you know for sure if you are pregnant you shouldn't worry about what you need to do next. Once you find out then that is when you need to step up and do what is best for the baby. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|J2II0zAgaa	well after taking birth control..then stopping can make you more fertile...and so yes there is very much a chance you could be pregnant....and fyi...you are too young to be having sex....especially not marries...and especially unprotected.....|`|Ol2S1ZiMaa	Wow. you have quite a situation here. What i would do would test first and make sure you are DEFINITELY pregnant. Then I would tell my parents. Then I would tell the dad whether he would deny the baby or not. You really need to think about what your going to do if your pregnant. I know your only 14 but I really am AGAINST abortion. And I would definitely keep the baby.|`|db0778827116a58f89a08caf6b15fd95aa	give it up for adoption,   your only 14 and need to finish or at least get a start at ur life, sheesh your barely in high school. dont have unprotected sex again until your married.    but you prolly shouldnt have had sex w/ a guythat has a gf. o'well past is past it cant be changed.|`|AlOu0n8Laa	Why did you take birth control for 3 weeks then stop.. that's pretty pointless you have to take them everyday to stop pregnancy and even then theres still a chance. You can get pregnant.. have a test asap and find out|`|K89qctNWaa	Chances of not getting pregnant with unprotected sex is 1 week before and after your period.    If you had unprotected sex after 1 week, then you might be.  Give yourself after 10 days of your menstrual period then do the test.  To get the accurate result, do the test first thing in the morning.  Your first pee and in the middle while you are peeing.  That time is the highest hormone our body has.  If you are pregnant, do not try to tell him if you want to and he doesn't take the responsibility for it, do not be irresponsible yourself.  It might be hard but I know you can make it.  If you are not pregnant, then be extra careful next time because you are very young and there's so much more store for you than just having a casual sex.|`|Svdms2vyaa	Hun, you can get pregnant while on the pill. It's only about 80% effective. Missing days, taking it at differant times in the day can make it less effective as well from what i've read.     The baby, if you're pregnant is your decision. Although, the man would be hard pressed to prove he isn't the father. I'm assuming that your parents would fight for a paternity test. If you are pregnant, he needs to be supporting you should you keep the child and if you get an abortion. He should be helping to pay for it, if not the whole damn thing.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	Umm you birth control was barely in effect after only 3 weeks.  You're probably pregnant and I feel really bad for your baby.
ZFtMh9tBaa	I think being a boy, I got the easier life. I mean girls have the monthly "gift" we get leg hair. Girls have to go through everybody seeing them develope. We have people listen to our voice change. Thats about it for boys.    For girls    -Pregnancy  -Major Emotions  -More Sensitive  -Worry about weight  -Worry about apperance    Um, I'm sorry I forgot that you do thats another thing that you can add to your list.

But um boys do have it better caz girls:  worry about weight  hair  what their wearing  pms  and things like that  |`|SMWjCCE6aa	Well it goes both ways...guys, generally speaking have to approach the girl first and guys are always horny....no matter how horny girls think they are, guys are always 100x more...which is sometimes a bad thing....A VERY BAD THING OMG, thats one of the hardest things about being a guy....    girls u got it bad too for various reasons and stuff listed before me soz    another thing is that ANY girl can get a boyfriend if their willing to lower their standards...BUT ANY GUY CANT get a girlfriend because girls somehow find "some" guys completely...well idk, the point is is that therees always at least one guy to like u if ur a girl, but if ur a guy and ur not cool and popular, then it can be said that at least one girl probably doesnt like u|`|9WmtnBxyaa	I'd say girls have it much harder than the boys..

2NxBl4t9aa	You have the right to petition the child custody court for a paternity test! It is your right and you will have to pay for it but at least you will have an answer. They will court order her there for swabbing of your genetics, hers and the child's! If the child is yours they wil establish visitation which at first may just be one night a week or even suppervised until the child know you! Once you prove fit and stable in seeing your daughter then they will increase it to every other week end with one day a week visits unsupervised! Also they will issue a child support order that you will have to pay mom and she can not refuse it becasue its is seen in courts as the child right not moms! Good luck and hope that helps!|`|1EhbLBkUaa	If she won't cooperate in DNA testing, then your only recourse is the courts.  It won't "mess up her life", you wouldn't send her to jail (unless testing is court-ordered and she STILL refuses, for example).  It would force her to do something she evidently doesn't want, that's all; and that's what you're asking to do, anyway.|`|AA11145682	Wow it seems like ur a nice guy i mean i won't say stop trying caz the girl is just blind for not seeing the type of person you are, i wish i could give u really good advive umm i would say get a dna test|`|DVceuScvaa	file for a paternity test for BOTH children with the court. At least that way there's proof that they are/aren't yours.|`|ciPMWGfdaa	You need to look up local Paternity testing services in your area look in the phone book.  Most are usually expensive.  But you get a cheaper rate every kid you have tested.  Then you can call them and ask them how you could go about getting everything done.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	Regardless of what you don't want to happen, you need to go to court and file for a paternity test.It could be low to no cost.    Private paternity tests can cost up to 300/400 bucks and will not stand up in court, so it is cheaper to go the first route.    Also, with private testing, she can continue to refuse.With a court ordered tests,she will have to comply.    Do it for your "possible" kid and don't wait a minute longer.    Good luck.|`|3RFu4W38aa	As a possible father, I think you have the right to ask for a test, go to court and try get a judge to make it so it's not her choice at all. If that is your child, you deserve the chance to raise and love it, and that child deserves to know it's father.|`|RNZaUdxSaa	tell her its only fair for you to know weither they are yours or not.. I mean you could just ignore her and never speak to her and say they arent mine and not even care so I dont understand why shes bein shady like that.. but tell her how you feel and if she wants to be a ****** about it then tell her you'll get the court involved and see if she changes her mind if not go ahead with it.. you have a right to know!! Best of luck!

9CAXUgOZaa	I really like Lily Ava  Lily Rose is way too flowery  Lily Amelia is also cute, but not as cute as Lily Ava    :)|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I like Lily Rose.    also like  Lily Aura...  Aura is a southern name and was popular during the civil war.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	Names have a better ring when the first and middle name have a diffeent number of syllables. I think Lily Rose has the nicest flow, but honestly of the 3 options, Ava is my favorite individual name. I think all of them are pretty good though, so good luck!!!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	None.     Ava is common, popular, and overused. She'd be one of many in her class.    Lily is common, popular, and overused. She'd be one of many in her class.    Rose is common, dull, and overused as a middle name. Tacked on because it sounds good, not because you put any thought into it. And the combination of Lily Rose is ridicously popular.    Amelia is gorgeous.      I suggest Rose Amelia.|`|AA11104833	I like Lily Rose.     Ava Lilly is pretty to. Yea, Ava Lily is real nice    Not a big Amelia fan|`|QmvYGkNJaa	I love the names Ava, Lily and Rose.     Lily Rose sounds good together, but it's also the daughter of Stuart Zender and Mel Blatt (from the All Saints)|`|zgXpomfCaa	Lily Ava is cute.  Lily Rose is very flowery.  Lily Amelia is quite nice.  I prefer Lily Ava :)|`|64q24ABWaa	lily rose sounds the prettiest! (:|`|suxwucfjaa	I like Lily Ava best....Lily Rose is too many flowers, and Lily amelia is ok, but doesn't sound as pretty as Lily Ava in my opinion...hope that helped...good luck|`|dGUV0hgxaa	Lily Ava is very very cute. (:  Lily Rose is too flowery lol.|`|b1cfJ3veaa	Lily Ava has the same syllables so it doesn't flow as well    Lily Rose is cute of you like the flowery theme    Lily Amelia is my fave , its sweet and cute and lovely     good luck. they're all beautiful xxx|`|DnS3FwNYaa	What about Ava Rose|`|S8UbvfWsaa	Yeah, Lily Rose does have the nicest flow, but I've always felt that there should only be one middle name. And it really depends on the first name...Maybe Lily as a first and Rose as a middle...  Or I'd just to Lily as the middle name.|`|POcKHdY7aa	Lily Amelia is a bit over dramatic.   Ava - short simple and sweet, good to compliment a long name.  Lily Ava - sounds like you couldn't decide and threw two random names together.  Lily Rose - Are you naming a princess? Just wondering. I don't think your child would appreciate being a flower.    Are they all middle names?? I suggest Ava to be the middle name. If it was a name like Gwendolyn, would you want your child to be Gwendolyn Lily Amelia? Or does Gwendolyn Ava sound better to you? It's a bit more sophisticated, too.
wl7tlYOYaa	Dont feel stupid for asking. I dont think ur pregnant and ur period is probably late because u have been stressing it so much. Stress is known to delay periods in some women. But next time when u decide ur ready use protection so u dont have to worry about this in the future. I know someone that got pregnant the very first time they had sex so being a virgin does not lower the chances. Protect urself so u dont find urself in a position u many not want.|`|AA11104833	stress can really mess up ur cycle. I was over a week late and then I finally started.      Relax, take a deep breathe. The brest tenderness coudl be a PMS sign. It does not sound like he penetrated enuff to get ur pregnant

5VPiTqUEaa	Kids at this age love games and arts and crafts.  So just do things like painting, drawing, play dough with the younger kids and stuff like that.    Just see what the family has to do and ask the kids what there favorite things to do are and get them involved too!    For all the kids if the weather is nice I would go outside and play games and stuff.|`|AA11104833	My dghtr is 8 and she is real active. If it isn't to cold I woudl suggest a park.

Don't let them watch TV!!!!|`|XQZ1E28faa	chuck e cheese!!! if you got the $  if not put on a spongebob episode|`|2c9b6b1ea7223077886584010a6e8eaaaa	coloring would be nice  going to the malls..|`|E8j3KRStaa	take them on a walk. play a board game like jr. monopoly
KRZylJyIaa	It's possible  but highly unlikely. You'd have to have a very short menstrual cycle, which is the time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period, or a tendency to have long periods. This would bring the time of ovulation closer to the time when you would start bleeding.    Conception occurs when an egg and sperm meet in a fallopian tube. Sometime during the middle of your menstrual cycle, most likely between the 12th and 16th days, an egg reaches maturity in one of the two ovaries. The ovary releases the egg into the abdomen, where it's quickly sucked up by the tulip-shaped opening of the nearest fallopian tube.    An egg can survive in your fallopian tube for about 24 hours after it's released from the ovary. So the only way you can get pregnant is if sperm are present in your fallopian tube during this window of opportunity. If the egg isn't fertilized, it's shed along with your uterine lining during your period.    Typically, when you have your period, another egg is developing in preparation for release during the current cycle. But not every woman's cycle length is the same. Many women have a cycle that's about 28 days long, but some have cycles as short as 22 days long. If you have a shorter cycle, you could ovulate just a few days after you have your period. And considering that sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for up to three days, it's theoretically possible for the sperm to hang around until you ovulate again.|`|Td7Kujqeaa	It is possible to get pregnant on any day of your cycle, whether you are on your period or not. Of course, you have less of a chance when you are on your period then if you are closer to ovulation, but it's still a possibility. What I would do if I were you and you def DONT want a baby is take one of those morning after pills. I've personally never used one but I heard that they work. And for the furture have you ever considered going on the pill? Condoms are ok but dont work as well. Your doctor can prescribe them for you, and dont worry about your parents finding out. Your doc by law cannot tell them (patient confidentialty) or go to planned parenthood. I went on the pill at 15 and my mom never knew..she still thinks to this day that i didnt start on it until i was 18. Anyway, best of luck to you|`|Y6TSCciKaa	If you're on your period becoming pregnant is highly unlikely.|`|AA11104833	hun if u are on ur period then chances are u are not pregnant.|`|mtDWu8sXaa	It's possible, but unlikely.  You have already ovulated.  Just next time use protection.  So you won't have to worry about asking questions like that again.  15...I know you are smart enough to know that you have decades to have kids.  It isn't stupid at all to use protection.  Good luck to you. I wouldn't worry though.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	You should be okay, But dont take my word for it,it is possible but one thing you can do is call the doctor and/or Planned parenthood of somesort and get the PLAN B pill. It has to be used within 72 hrs of unprotected sex so you have to act fast and please do because you are so young.All this pill does is keeps the semen from attaching to an egg or an egg being fertilized, good luck.|`|arukziDbaa	Probably not. Since you're on your period, it's really unlikely that you'd be ovulating. :) Don't worry!|`|mIXzYzfRaa	nah i dont think so|`|cj66oFDKaa	Any time you have unprotected sex you are likely to get pregnant. Be smart, have safe sex. "pulling out" isn't safe sex.     If you're unaware of the risks of getting pregnant you probably shouldn't be having sex anyway.

KV7OGaJbaa	Well done on standing up for yourself. Don't take any crap from anyone saying you made the wrong decision, it was the right decision for you. Anyways, I'd take one of the cheap ones with early morning urine. The chances of you still being pregnant after the abortion are low, however you very ell could be pregnant again. Don't waste money on an expensive one, just go with the cheap one.|`|UOJk5CBLaa	I think the best thing you could possibly do is to go to the doctor. Until your appointment you might want to get a pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests aren't 100 percent accurate that's why you should you should go the doctor, they more accurate tests. Good luck with everything!|`|iNJYsRo6aa	i personally would use a clear blue test, yes they are a bit more money but i trust them more... u can read the test 10 min later and it wnt change.. i took a test 2 weeks ago and it still shows positive... there is a chance the abortion didnt work, or u got pregnant again. you dont necesiarily need a didgital read test, i know clearblue is a bit more expenisive but i think its worth it. Or go to the dr.s... its free and accurate. good luck with everything hunn!|`|claUGpVRaa	Take a morning wee pregnancy test just to see. Also go to the doctors and explain what happened with the abortion but that you are still getting pregnancy symptoms now. The doctor won't judge you but will be able to help you. I wish you luck.|`|ndvSK783aa	My positive pregnancy tests still show positive a year after taking them...but I guess it depends. You might want to get a blood test done to make sure. I've heard some people not getting a positive on a pregnancy test.
GS9Bz0pAaa	Hey hun .. I had 2 false negs when I was pregnant .. It is possible to get false negs if it is still early on but Very rare to get a false positive. Definatley wait till your next period, if it is late etc then try another one  Good luck xxx|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	its too early to tell|`|THZEgP3waa	im on depo and i think im pregnant too!  birth control methods arent 100%.  my test came up negative but i have all the symptoms as well.  its entirely possible that it could be too early to tell.  some women dont get postive results for a long time because of low hormone levels.  there are websites you can go to and see if you were likely ovulating around the time you had unprotected sex, which is also a good way of figuring out if you might be pregnant.  try to work it out and see if the dates match up, and if they do and you still get these symptoms and weird periods but no positive test then id say youre most likely pregnant.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	yes, hpt's can be wrong and it could be too early to tell or it could just be a really weird period.    only time will tell...sorry.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	Those tests can show a false negative but not a false positive.  Basically, if it say's you are not pregnant, there is still a chance you could be & it's just to early to tell but if it says your pregnant, then there's no chance it's wrong.  If you haven't missed a pill or been really late in taking one (or had diarrhoea been sick after taking a pill, or been on antibiotics)  then you are most likely not pregnant.  Wait a few days then take another test (or wait until the day your next period is due) then you will know.  Good Luck.|`|c5b5621732fdf723945dd379cd18a242aa	Its not likely to be wrong maybe just taken too early! Wait another week and retest! Good luck hun x|`|SnoKfIKOaa	The general rule is that you can have a false negative, but not a false positive. Meaning if it says negative, you could still be pregnant, but if its positive then its positive.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Wait a week and take another test.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	yeah they can, take a few to be sure|`|3ay0KVVDaa	from personal experience if its negative then its negative.
CtVLaAZRaa	I wasn't very paranoid with my first baby because I just never imagined that anything could be wrong and I was so happy and excited about being pregnant. The 20 week ultrasound went by and everything was ok and I had a healthy baby boy. Then with my second pregnancy I wasn't nervous either because I had already had one healthy baby and I felt so great. Then at the 20 week ultrasound they told me he had a cyst in his brain and I had to go to a level II ultrasound. They also told me that without an amnio they would not know his condition until he was born. They said he could possibly have trisomy syndrome. In October of 2006 I had a healthy baby boy with nothing wrong at all. After his birth we had a scan of his brain done and the cyst was gone. Well now I am 16 weeks pregnant with number 3 and the ultrasound is all I can think of. I am terrified to death. However, I keep telling myself that they can be wrong and I have had two healthy babies so the chances are pretty good. I am a very optomistic person and that is why I think I never worried before but my last pregnancy scared me and now I am even more scared. I think you need to stop looking up diseases because that will drive you nuts and think about all the healthy babies that are born and have faith that you will be just as lucky. Good luck. It is amazing how the mommy worries set in before the baby is born. We have a lifetime of worrying left. Take care.|`|fHgbL046aa	You are not the only one. I'm 17 week and 2 days pregnant with my second and I've been on medication daily and worried since I found out I was pregnant.I was never worried when I was pregnant with my daughter(I was a lot younger and no medication). I kept think I don't wanna tell anyone or get maternity clothes because I was afraid I would jinx it. I haven't told any family yet, but did by some maternity clothes.   I tried to put the pregnancy out of my mind so I wouldn't be to upset when they tell me I lost the baby(I'll be a basket case if that happens).    I have lots of cramping and even had some spotting(yet things were okay). I was staring to feel good and relaxed. That didn't last long. On Thursday Jan. 29 my doctor called and wanted to see me right away     (I knew it was bad). She told me my blood work came up abnormal and now I'm scheduled for a amniocentesis Tuesday. Feb.3. Now I'm more paranoid then ever.   These test are not accurate and they can say tell your baby is fine and then you give birth to a child with a severe abnormality. Most of the time I don't feel pregnant and that scares me too. I haven't gained any weight, but do have some sorta fat belly going on and no movement yet either. I just turned 35 and thought everything will work it self out but so far it hasn't. I wish I didn't wait so long to have a second child.   I guess we have to hang in there.My doctor says not to worry,but I have things to worry about. Besides if something was wrong with your pregnancy the doctor would let you know.|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	it sounds like you are having something similar of an anxiety attack or panic attack but you may not be hyperventilating... the symptom you posses is you are allowing your mind to play tricks on you.  You need to train your mind to realize when you are having this on learn how to calm yourself down or you should talk to your doctor about this.
Xnr5Y7Coaa	Did the doctors examine you entirely?  When I had my miscarriage they kept me in the emergency room for the whole day and did tests on me and made sure that I was clean inside.  It's either a yes or a no.  I would go back and have them examine me again to make sure.  I'm so sorry if you did miscarry.|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	Hmm..well if they suspected a mc then they should have done more for you, like check your hcg levels weekly to see where they stand ( they can either go up or down, depending)...that's the only way of knowing if it was indeed a mc...take a pregnancy test,  then find a new doctor..if it was a period it would show neg. if it was a mc it will still be pos. so if its positive then i would go to a new doctor and see if you miscarried or if you are still pregnant.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	You should have been given a test and been checked over. There is no such thing as a possible miscarriage and then send you on your way. Go into another Doctor ASAP for a 2nd opinion.|`|uuHPneEcaa	wow the doctor didn't check you out before you left. Thats odd.. I don't know about that. I would go back to the doctor and have them make sure if u had a miscarage or what it was. Some women bleed throughout their whole pregnancy. and the baby is fine. I would just go back to the doctor and have them check u out. you know what I am saying to be on the safe side.|`|MDGRFBoRaa	First of all, your stomach being hard is not a symptom of being pregnant until much further in your pregnancy. At 6 to 7 weeks, your baby is tiny and is not taking up much room in your uterus. It does take awhile for the pregnancy symptoms to go away because your hormones have to adjust Have you started bleeding? Did they confirm you were pregnant at all?|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Its probably the hormones still in your body. It takes a while to regulate them back down. With a miscarriage you still feel the same for a while.     They don't know for sure if you were pregnant? Did they see your HCG levels?|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	The doctor sounds like an idiot.  Why "possibly had a miscarriage" and not running tests?  Go to a real doctor and see what is up!!|`|XrULeFbCaa	if you miscarried then pregnancy symptoms will last for about a month afterwards, so it's possible your body is still reacting from it.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	They should have done a scan to check.    I had a miscarriage at 9 weeks. The doctor removed the fetus himself. A few hours later, they did an ultrasound and there was another baby in there. She is now three and doing well!    It can happen.|`|mDHI7A3Faa	After a miscarriage there is something called a "monster" in you. It takes a lil' while for the symptoms and for "it" to go away.|`|FGUnIrzWaa	The doctor should have done an ultrasound to check. I suggest seeing a different doctor and getting their opinion. If you did miscarry and your body isn't flushing the baby out, it could be dangerous and could cause an infection. When I miscarried, my morning sickness went away almost immediately. But, every woman is different. I really think you should get a second opinion from a different doctor.
j6jG5hg8aa	take a test and talk to a doctor...those are the only real ways of knowing...and don't have sex till your married...then you won't have anything to worry about    With Love|`|m6WYEPMUaa	If you make yourself believe like your pregnant then it may turn out to seem like that, if you believe to much it clinically pr oven to make you think your pregnant.  What do you think?  Have you taken a test?  Ask a doctor.  Now people may act like it's a bad thing.  Because if your a teenager then they will think "What a slut"  If your an adult and no married theyll probably think nothing of it.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	chances are good take a test in a couple weeks if it doesn't come|`|cVqCryr6aa	Terrified.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Next time, use a condom?|`|3664e2604d702b7001b81d717396f845aa	It's normal to be panicky, I use the birth-control pill but because I only get a 2 min warning from period pain about when it's about to start, I always get panicky after three days without a sign of it.    I doubt your pregnant but if you want to be on the safe side, take a test :)|`|xzJGhhN0aa	Take a prego test|`|IuW9zgYcaa	Probably paranoid..  just go for a test if your period doesnt come in a few days of when you usually get it|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	if you already missed your period a test would be positive.|`|KO5extXiaa	I'm sorry but    spermed in you?  please|`|MDWaPmXsaa	I'd take a test to put your mind at ease.  There are a few kinds that supposedly can tell you very early.  Then remember that terrified feeling the next time you plan on having sex..then bust out the protection!|`|CcN3kDl6aa	My lady friends have had periods delayed up to 3 weeks after having intercourse around the time of their periods. Def take a prego test but the "feeling like I'm getting fatter" sensation is most likely paranoia because it is WAYYY too early to have any symptom like that. Getting fatter doesn't come until a bit later in pregnancy.|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	you're supposed to ovulate about a week after your period ends, especially if it's 6-7 days... that's normal. maybe you're gaining weight cuz your bloated and getting your period...     and use protection|`|FGUnIrzWaa	When you're pregnant, you don't start gaining weight until around your second trimester. Actually, a lot of women lose weight during their first trimester (first three months of being pregnant) because of the morning sickness. When I was pregnant, I lost 10 LBS in two weeks because I was vomiting so much. I doubt you're pregnant, but if you're that worried, take a pregnancy test. They're about $3-5 at Wal-Mart. I suggest either getting on the pill or shot or using a condom.|`|s7PMlWSUaa	aww I think you r/arnt|`|f4NySKb9aa	prego test or go ask ur dr|`|JH9IMMDtaa	patience... take a pregnancy test later, and if your worried so much, then stop having sex!!!|`|1zKhAgWSaa	First off. If you are pregnant you would not already be gaining baby weight. I have never met anyone who gained weight in the first 2-3 weeks. Chill out, take a test. They now have some that you can take 5 days before your missed period. If you aren't pregnant use protection. Birth Control is cheap and 100 times cheaper than a kid
d3dd27235b85503aebfc38ebbfb5b514aa	Yes, it's possible..especially if you missed your period last month...What you think is your period can actually be some spotting that happens to a few pregnant women at the early stages of pregnancy  My advice to you is to take a pregnancy test and to go to a clinic and schedule an appointment with a gynecologist ASAP!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	its still possible if your having unprotected sex. take a test and see what it says. that happened to me too and i was pregnant.    and honey, not to be rude, but your only 16...do you really want to risk being pregnant? im 21 and its not easy...please use a condom next time okay?|`|bkOn30I1aa	Sometimes pregnant women continue to get their period after a few months of being pregnant, i am not too sure why this happens but it happened to my cousin. You should just buy a pregnancy test and find out, it is the easiest thing to do and it will answer your question.|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	probably not if you got your period but take a test... and you know what to do next time|`|ZiLxvVUzaa	Yes! You can be preg. Ignoring it will not make it go away. Go take a test ASAP!|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	Sex without protection can lead to pregnancy yes.  You might have been pregnant and then miscarried, hence the last period you had.  Take a pregnancy test please, don't wait.  I know you're young and if you were pregnant and I doubt that you are trying to get pregnant , please use a condom next time.  Good luck with everything.
uhj76Fkpaa	noone can make you feel what a pregnant woman feels and NOONE can describe you how it feels to bring a child to the world.Have one to find out.It's the best experience ever!|`|em8A42Bqaa	At first I felt very nauseated, couldn't eat..even though I was hungry.  I threw up all the time if something smelled funny.    2nd trimester was a breeze, just peeing a lot!      Now the 3rd trimester I'm about to fall asleep typing..  I am so tired everything is tired..I'm just exhausted!|`|0k5hixiWaa	im still pregnant and still in first trimester.    In the beginning - i honestly felt drugged! ha :D yeah, i know.  Never felt anything like that before. It felt like there was a very strong drug in my system!    thats the best way i can explain it....
njUuNHzvaa	well what my mom did was get a little piece of soap and warm water and put it up her rectum and it worked try it and it helps if you use one of those things they give you to take out bugers from the babies nose :) good luck?|`|lTeXIjpOaa	my son is three months old and has had some problems with hard stool, our doctor said not to give him any juice until four months even for constipation, we were recommended to water down his bottles; like use two scoops of formula, which would make four ounces, but add more water so that it makes 5-6 ounces and do this every other feeding for a day or so|`|28ZCfGWIaa	This worked every time when my daughter was a baby:    Use a rectal thermometer with a little vaseline. You don't need to take her temperature, just hold it in there a few seconds and she will begin to push and immediately the poo will push the thermometer and come out.    Good luck    Edit to add:    My Dr. had told me that babies can have 1oz of juice a day per month old. So if your baby is 2.5 months she can have 2.5 oz. of juice per day.   My daughter was on Good Start Formula and was constantly constipated. We had to always supplement with prune juice, you'll have to play around with the measurements to get it just right for your baby. Start with maybe 1 tablespoon in one bottle and see how it affects her. If she starts acting gassy like she has to go then it's time for the thermometer.  The thermometer will stimulate her rectum and will help her go even if it is still hard and lumpy.|`|X4MUGca9aa	Dark Karo syrup works.  Just add it to the formula.  Start with a tablespoon or so and then adjust as needed.  More if it doesn't work less if it really works.  Karo syrup is natural so you are not using any drugs to help the body.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	return to the pediatrician or get a referral to a GI doctor or go to the ER.|`|GnFUugrEaa	Give him an enema|`|tquqyozfaa	when my 1st child had this problem i used prune juice|`|AA11795652	Call the doctor, but our pediatrician recommended mineral oil for our daughter when she was constipated.  I keep it in the fridge and then it tastes sweet.  Our daughter was older when this happened so I'm not sure if this is okay for a 10 week old.  You can also ask about using a suppository as a last resort.|`|igJJ37Tjaa	I wouldn't do the karo syrup.  Keep with the apple juice, rub tummy, push her legs up to her tummy, bath time, and also using a rectal thermometer may help.  My little girl did the same thing around that age and the nurse said it was pretty common.  What are you feeding her: breast milk, formula (what kind like soy)?|`|Uz8BZN6daa	don't panic, my 6 month now baby was very constipated during her first weeks, the doctor assured me not to panic and to not try to feed her anything besides breastmilk, so after a week of her not pooping, we put her an infant suppository per doc's suggestion and she then pooped fine.  So to avoid constipation, I continued massaging her tummy clockwise and doing bicycle with her legs, this massage and exercise apparently helps the intestines work better.|`|oSMNx6L5aa	Our son had the same problem, The doctor said wait three days before taking any action. After three days we took him in a he got an enema, and she said if he couldn't go do it again in three more days. Well we wanted a second opinion because we didn't want to keep sticking q-tips in our sons butt. What the doctor said is that he didn't know how to poop, that he was trying to suck it in instead of push it out. So when you see your baby trying to poop look at her but and see if she's pushing it out or trying to suck it in.     Next, if that doesn't work i'd get some suppositories (they work wonders) just some suggestions, hope i helped some|`|0B2YqMuSaa	I had same problem because I breast feed.  Buy Miralax, it is for adults.  Mix up an 8 oz bottle and use only 1/2 oz a day for a few days.  It helps to loosen everything and get her to be regular.  You can mix the 1/2oz in with her bottle.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	If this is a long-term problem, try either a baby-size glycerine suppository or the mini-enema Chihuahuanese described.    All you need is a nose-sucker and some soapy-water solution (like put a bar of soap in a beaker of warm water for a minute!).  Squirt a couple of bulbfuls up her butt (making sure you insert gently) and wait only a minute or two for the result!
Ulff1hcDaa	Food stamps is a nutrition program that is tied to a lot of federal funds.      If your kids have a medical issue you can sometimes have the larger diapers covered through Medicaid or through one of the children with special health needs clinics.  Check with your local human services office.    If you can't get it covered you might be able to claim it as a medical cost when applying for other programs.|`|AA11210211	Because diapers aren't food.|`|ndvSK783aa	I make just as much as you do and I don't need food stamps or welfare! I eat chips and drink pop. I pay for a babysitter and power and cell phone. I do just fine and dandy. I own my own home too! Must be nice to get child support AND have food stamps that I PAY FOR!|`|P544Sbmqaa	You cant pay for diapers on food stamps because its NOT food!!!!   Does it HONESTLY take a rocket scientist to figure that out?????    If you want to be able to have soda and chips like everyone else, get a better job and pay for it yourself instead making us pay for your family.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Tax payers can't provide you with everything.  I can just barely pay my bills and I don't even have any kids.  That's part of the crappy economy right now.  No one can afford everything they need.  Whining about how the government doesn't give you more money to bridge the gap between your income and expenses makes you weak.  I'd love it if I got the government to buy me food, but you can't even appreciate that you get anything at all.  If they gave everyone on food stamps all the money they needed to live on there wouldn't be enough to go around.  Put the things you can't afford on credit cards and slump more and more into debt like all the rest of us.    When I was a kid my mom had full time school, full time work, and twin babies, all by herself. She had no child support, no family around, nothing. She would stay up late making sandwiches to sell to corporate suits before school that morning. She sold every piece of jewelry she had, her TV, anything anyone would buy.  With the small amount the government gave her, after rent and utilities she had $150 a month to feed 3 people. Not to mention school, gas, clothes...  She was the kind of person that made the best of what she could, and she still managed to buy diapers.   Tax payers can't pay for everything in your life.|`|zPHo7Ociaa	After reading this question, which you posted 3 times in seperate sections.....and the replies you gave to the questions of others, I think I have come to a conclusion.    The government is attempting to starve you and your spawn out of the genepool, so that you can't hurt anyone's brain EVER AGAIN.|`|X4MUGca9aa	Umm........because they are not food!|`|hkQSqPEwaa	lol|`|7SKVCPcSaa	because FOOD stamps are for FOOD? hence the name.. and they aren't 'diapers', they are 'protective underwear".|`|agTCqkLDaa	You should quit having children if you can't afford them.    You should always wash your sheets despite the fact that they are goodnites-those leak and leave odor.      No, they should not be included in food stamps.  It is not MY responsibility to pay for YOUR children.|`|F08HDRvraa	No, the food stamp program was set up to help people who didn't have enough money to buy food, not to pay for diapers.  It is your choice to buy disposable's for these children rather than getting waterproof pads and regular diapers for these children.  There are cloth/nappy style diapers that adults wear in nursing homes, so If you don't want to go to the expense of disposables, you might see where you can buy these diapers.|`|fFe75M3Baa	I hate people like you. having a bunch of kids you can't support on your own, you get a little bit of help and you're still trying to get more. Here is a way for you to save money... STOP MAKING BABIES! You answered your own question... diapers are not food! And if you want to save even more money... stop buying GoodNights. They are the same as regular pampers, they just open differently.    Moonfrye- I'd give you infinite thumbs up if I could. I struggle to take care of my one child and I go to work everyday, and I'm still taking care of other peoples kids.    As for your edit, you knew what your salary was when you kept getting pregnant. You knew you couldn't afford all of those kids. You don't get enough for child support? Your fault. You should have had kids with someone who could afford them since you can't. And since you're the one begging for more help, then why should you be able to eat the same foods as me? I pay for mine, with my hard earned money, not a government handout!    OMG, you have upset me just a little. You're asking for assistance and you're on the internet? Get rid of the damn internet and you'll have more money to spend on your bed wetting kids who are probably in need of therapy, since they are too old to still wet the bed. You probably have cable, internet, house phone, cell phone, go out every weekend, drink liquor and smoke cigarettes, don't you. And I'll bet that you only work part-time. Cut the cable, internet, cell phone, house phone, and stop the drinking, smoking and partying.     You need to delete this question so I'll stop feeling the need to keep editing and telling you off.

( seriously, I used to cashier an this was an order I rang out one day, then the woman yelled and screamed because she actually had to pay CASH for her soap)|`|AA11755924	I wish that was the case.  It seems like diapers cost so much now.  And the bigger the kids get, the less comes in each package.  But if you need assistance with diapers, you can try TANF.  "Temporary Assistance to Needy Families."  If you qualify, they give you a certain amount of money each month that you can buy anything with it, except alchohol and stuff like that.|`|XD42367paa	You have four kids and you don't know why you can't buy diapers with food stamps?

It's kind of commonsense.|`|NOYxalJ6aa	I think the REAL question here is why your 7 and 11 year olds are wetting the bed... I can understand maybe a bit for the 7 year old, but by eleven the bed-wetting thing should definitely be done.

(assuming mental and developmental capacities in the "normal" range)    Edit: I just read your edit... and I would like to mention one thing... it is not wise to call the tax payers that provide the money for your welfare "you people" and sound as if you're angry with us for your situation. The situation has been created, and more than likely it is more your fault than ours... we, whether we like it or not, are spending our portion of our "$9/hr" for your benefit. Instead of whining about what isn't covered under food stamps, you should thank God, your government and all of us that you get them in the first place.|`|RtmfVevbaa	Huummph! You do not need a cell phone, bill gone, do not need the internet, bill gone! Last I heard FOOD stamps are for that, food!

If you are working I applaud you, and you should be able to get assistance, because your ends do not meet! But damn if you refer to me or us as you people! We can get those things because we can afford to buy them! You chose to have 4 children with limited job skills and education, we people or us did not make that decision for you, nor did we saddle you with absent fathers, who only pay you 595.00 in child support for 4 kids, they must be broke also and too ignorant to buy a less expensive condom and you to dumb or lazy to put one on them. Get yourself together lady, YOU and YOU alone made YOUR life choices!!!!! Get out of my pocket!!! Chips and soda are a cheap way to feed your kids, it took years for them to catch on, but they no what you would do with the rest of the money! Those thing would make your kids unhealthy, that is not what they need!!!! It is clear your decision making process is fuc ed up, so people in the food stamp office set guidelines for people like you!!!!|`|AqdNwEG6aa	"why can we drink soda like you people. why cant we eat chips like you people. why cant we do the same things you people do."    Because I don't DO those things. I ate rice, and beans, and peanut butter sandwiches till I couldn't stand it anymore. Then I sat there sobbing for a few moments, regained my composure, and made another pan of rice. I've been doing this for over 3 years now.. I hate it. I'm ready to be DONE with it. But I can make it work till the money is better. It's a struggle sometimes to get the daughter to eat it. But she does. Why can't you have those things? It's because food stamps are supposed to help you buy food so you're healthy. Junk is JUNK.    Yes, I did this while on WIC. Not once did I wonder why WIC wouldn't pay for diapers. Or chips. I did wish that it would pay for Veggies, but I didn't complain to the internet about it.    You've posted this questions THREE TIMES|`|dnEmFs2maa	Food stamps are limited to what a retailer would classify as "Grocery" items, and diapers are considered "General Merchandise".  The way food stamps (we have cards here), they count on what the computer labels "Grocery" items.  However, I believe WIC (Women Infants & Children benefit system) will cover diapers.  I'm not positive, though, so don't hold me on that.    Actually, thinking about it, my mom had some kind of plan where she would receive free diapers in the mail.  I think it could've been based on my little brother's disability, but my other brother got free diaper's too.  Try doing some research.
eSOzKj0Waa	Yes, I like it a lot :)    I also like Sophia Marie, Savannah Marie and Sienna Marie.    Hope this helps!

Use different tactics to help...are you already taking prenatal vitamins?  If not, start.  Are you exercising and eating right?  Use a pregnancy calendar to help you keep track of things like the one on www.babyzone.com and it will help you track your periods and help you estimate the most optimal times to have sex and also gives you other tips on the site to help you conceive.  Don't get beat down, give it time.  If you aren't able to successfully get pregnant after a year of doing some of the right things as far as lifestyle goes, book an appt. with your o.b. for some more options.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Depo can still screw with your body up to 5 years after taking it. That's not fact, it just happened to a couple of my friends. Just give it time, and continue on your baby making adventures. You'll get pregnant eventually. If after a year you haven't conceived, then see a specialist.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	are you tracking ovulation or just randomly having sex?   If its been a year you may need to see a fertility specialist for you and your partner. It may not be you.
Xnr5Y7Coaa	I knew I was pregnant before I missed my period but I was in denial and wouldn't accept it until I had done the pregnancy test. This is my second pregnancy but my first one resulted in a miscarriage, that's why I was in denial about this pregnancy.    I thought I was dying though, I couldn't eat, I felt nauseous all the time, that's how I knew. My symptoms came very early on and very strong.|`|8Qbx8PDnaa	WELL I MISSED MY PERIOD, AND  A DAY AFTER I MISSED IT I JUST HAD THAT FEELING  I WAS PREGO AND I LET MY HUSBAND KNOW HES LIKE HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE IM LIKE I JUST DO ITS THIS STRONG SURE FEELING YOU GET       I WENT TO GO BUY ME A PREGNANCY TEST , HE WAS WAITING OUTSIDE THE RESTROOM 4 MY RESULT AND I CAME OUT AND I TOLD HIM I TOLD YOU IT WAS POSITIVE:)|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I had a miscarriage so I wasn't having a period maybe just some spotting for 3 months. In those 3 months I got pregnant and I just knew it. I know my body and that's what gave it away. Now I'm pregnant and due may 1st.|`|MDGRFBoRaa	I think that feeling because more recognizable after you get a positive test. I had that feeling too, but something in the back of mind was telling me I wasn't because I felt the same way the month before. Are you experiencing symptoms? You could take a test now, but it would be more accurate after your missed period. HTH!|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	yeahhh it's pretty much like that. i had missed my period since july 3th but i didn't get pregnant until like late august and i felt just "different" in september. i used to smoke and suddenly it was really nasty and didn't want it and i knew something was up but i denied it for awhile because i thought it wouldn't happen and then i go to a clinic to get on birth control and they tell me its too late because im already pregnant haha|`|4lHJEq5Haa	I just felt a change inside of me. I knew I was carrying life inside my body. That's the only way I can describe it!|`|OwK17Qo1aa	You know its a feeling that you just can't describe. I wasn't planning to get pregnant, but about 4 days before my period was due I was wondering why am I buying this stuff if its not going to start? I didn't even take a pregnancy test cause whats the point on wasting money if you already know the truth? For me it was a gut feeling. Hope it makes sense.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I didn't have any symptoms at all, in fact I got a false negative pregnancy test and tested again 2 weeks later before I got my positive! But I knew. I mean, I really honestly just KNEW. It was like knowing that I have red hair. Just a simple, clear fact that there is no doubting or refuting. I was so certain that I didn't believe the false negative at all, but I thought it best to wait a couple of weeks before testing again to get a strong positive. I never second guessed myself even though I didn't have any symptoms, the feeling was so strong. And of course, I was right lol.
3lEMNFFzaa	What you said actually scares me a bit--- not the pooping part, but are you absolutely certain that the mucous and blood came from your rectum, and not your vagina?  Seriously-- insert a finger into your vagina and make sure that there is no blood on your finger when you remove it.  If there is, get your as* to ER, NOW.  Pregnant women develop a mucous plug in their vagina, right at the cervix.  This keeps bacteria from entering the uterus, and it releases during labor.  The fact that you had the mucous and bloody show, and have a feeling that you need to defecte are not good signs.  Don't be embarrassed if the ER just tells you you're constipated-- they've seen it all, and you are better safe than sorry.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Um, it sounds like you lost your mucus plug - please call your doctor ASAP and talk about needing to push plus having bloody show.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	You could have been feeling contractions and you may have just lost your mucus plug!  If I were you I would go to the hospital being only 5 months you don't want to chance that you are going into labor this early on.  Seriously it is better safe than sorry!!|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Its normal. Its your mucus plug.|`|mlAI5S5Eaa	you need to go to the emergency room and explain to them what is going on. and they will inform your doctor that you had visited them,they will tell you that you need to do a check up with your doctor. just go and do that and see what they tell you to do.      hope this helps/congrats on the baby :)|`|4xDDR7c3aa	you might be having an urge to push from contractions. Your doctor should have some sort of on-call nurse you can speak to, If not maybe call the labor and delivery department at the hospital.|`|cSzX6mI9aa	This happened to me around 6 months. It could be your mucous plug, but it can regenerate, so don't worry too much. Call the doctor/hospital and see what they say.
QRWHDsL2aa	all you can do it wait really. i am in the dame boat as you due on the10th.. i have also had what i think could of been implantion bleeding a few days ago.. gd luck fingers crosses for us both... loads of baby dust to you
5DJcir9saa	I put my baby in an infant swing around 2 months.  It depends on the swing though.  The chair needs to be able to lounge back so the babys neck stays supported.|`|ggETPqedaa	I have a two month old, he enjoys the swing now. Though I don't have one that reclines, however, I shove blankets all around him to make sure he's secure.|`|mYfkJFTVaa	2 months      http://www.toboc.com/forum3/default.aspx...|`|JP2h62qiaa	a swing at the park? or an infant swing?      From birth. That is why it is an infant swing.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	My daughter used her Fisher Price Rainforest swing from birth. As long as your swing has a reclining seat so baby isn't slumped over, it's fine. My daughter enjoyed the swing until she was 5 months - we had to pack it away then because she was rolling over a lot, and could nearly roll right out of the seat, even though we always strapped her in. Good luck.|`|3MelQFxOaa	I put my darling baby girl in it when she was a week old, but she didnt take to it until she was about 3 months old, that just depends on the baby. You can do it day one, usually on the swing itself, there will be a weight min. and max.|`|wTeJulT5aa	I think we bought our swing when our baby was 6 or 7 weeks old.  She loves it.  It was so nice when she was really young because I didn't have a baby chair yet, and it was a great babysitter.
37f5d6a84330d5f182e80354750ea47daa	OMG I went through the same exact thing! I have PCOS as well and had to take provera and chlomid. I got lucky and only had to do one round and i got pregnant. It was like a month after i took it that I found out I was pregnant though. I kept taking tests and they kept saying negative, I was stressing out so bad. I started having some breast pain and I was just feeling very sluggish, still a negative test result. I waited another week and I was still feeling the symptoms so I tested again and it was positive.   If you got a really faint test line, that should be positive. You can take her to the doctor and they can do an hcg test that will show the actual count instead of just positive or negative. That way you will know for sure.  Is she having any symptoms?  Good luck!
cj7sSPZEaa	I think it's about $40.  You can't get it if you are under 18 without a prescription, so you will either have to go to a planned parenthood or go to your doctor, or else have an 18 year old friend get it for you.|`|AA12298409	No you have to be eighteen to get it.
AA12123428	The chances are about the same as flipping a coin. You certainly timed it almost right for pregnancy (a couple of days earlier would have been ideal) but it's in the lap of the gods now.    You can take most tests on the day your period is due, but some can be taken a few days before. Take the test, and if it's negative but you still wait more than another week for your period test again.|`|urJIlSBQaa	I don't think its too soon to take a test, considering you missed your period.  Take a test...... and know that you don't get false positives.    Just a side note: please consider adoption before abortion if you were going to go down the road of not wanting to be a parent.  thanks|`|ojtqdScPaa	Unprotected? Then pretty high. By then the egg should be in the uterus waiting fertilization. I would take the test just to be sure.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	There is no way you can tell she is unless she tells you! Maybe she is just gaining weight. Also, that's really none of your business, good grief!|`|T8zPA3FJaa	i agree with what Abi said.|`|msQqxMIbaa	She's probably just curious ya'll.  Give her a break.|`|nuyjnfOfaa	She could . . or she could not be. I know you may be curious but this really isn't any of your concern. If she is in fact pupped, she'll tell her students when (or if) she wants to.    It would be rude to ask, btw.
3kW6i3Vdaa	Water represents cleansing.  Perhaps your mother isn't going to be happy with a change in your life, doesn't necisarily mean a baby but Congrats if it is!|`|4CINI0fsaa	waters gonna break and going to have the baby  :)|`|8tYKGDy0aa	lol|`|savPsYWjaa	Ya Blew it|`|oA6UOlKdaa	one water does not mean anything in your dreams because i dream about water every night for the past 2 years and i am not pregnant.

Sorry, but this usually comes true. No, you will not have a baby from the dream. Take a pregnancy test! If you are single and haven't had sexual intercourse, then you are so not pregnant. Unless you have been raped.|`|3LCRJK9saa	To dream you drink hot water means difficulty in personal and money matters. Drinking cold water predicts good luck. If you throw water on someone, you will annoy  friends with your actions.    Also, you are afraid that the implantation went wrong.|`|UnMLa6r8aa	Water: Clear and calm this is a good omen. But rough or murky and problems are ahead. Drink water and you are in for some good luck, but spill or throw it you are going to have to control that temper. Hot water predicts social setbacks, but running it's a sign of lasting happiness. You are in for a pay raise if you see a waterfall. Anything being watered forecasts exciting events.|`|5d69096a97f9015e41817b901338a7cbaa	It means you're going to drown in a pool trying to save your mother while your daughter floats helplessly with her floaties.|`|zFb022Iiaa	Maybe your mom will be there when  your water breaks, ha.|`|5cBmCVw3aa	http://www.dreammoods.com/|`|uWJWz068aa	It means that ur mom saw a cracked CHOCLATE CHIP COOKIE in your little sisters hand nd she the cup of water fell on the GROUND..UHHHHHH wut a shock!!!

fdalc5Rcaa	really thats funny cause a minute ago you where looking to hook up with some one for sex ????   STOP MESSING AND GROW UP !!!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    yes you could be.  definitly take a test when period is due.

He doesn't even have to *** in you, there's also precum. But what were you thinking letting someone *** in you anyway?|`|PYySLOw6aa	if he came in you its possible my best friend got pregnant and she had sex the day after her period!
bcZSIphUaa	Remember back to what your doctor told you.       Go by the advice he gave you.    Remember that it's not a given that you will ovulate at all  - and I think that 5-10 days is the window of opportunity. If you are really concerned - ring your doctor and talk to them - it's their job and you pay them!
0nIwKd5Uaa	Set "rules" for your babysitting.      Like you wont babysit during bedtime. Just explain its hard enough to put your own child to bed let alone someone else's child.     That if the kids aren't able to use the whole house then you wont baby sit either. Honestly I'd rather be knocked out by Mike Tyson than be stuck in a bedroom all night with 3 children 4 and under.     Just some suggestions and of course you could ad some of your own. Most parents wont get upset, but if they do oh well the child are their responsibility not yours. You have your own child to deal with.     You could also tell them no boyfriends allowed as you think it sets a bad example for your child. (worked on an old friend of mine)    Sorry quick thing i would also tell them you need more notice than them showing up on your door. Any more just showing up for you to watch their children and you will no longer do so.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, I wouldn't feel that obligated to be nice in this situation.  But if you want to be "nice" play it like you're overwhelmed.    "Oh my God, I would so totally love to help you out but I am freaking out so much about my baby!  She's so busy!  I'm so overwhelmed!  I can't even handle it!"  Work up a few tears.  Bore them with stories of how busy and tired you are.  They'll bug off.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If I remember correctly, you're pretty young - which is something I think this mom is taking advantage of. It's not like you're a teen who's there to watch her kids - you have your own baby to look after, too. I would just flat out tell her that it's kind of difficult with all the kids around and having to watch your own, too. If she has a problem with that, she can find someone else.     I'm not trying to insult you - please don't take it the wrong way - but it's not like you're 'just a teen' who is there doing the normal babysitting routine. When you have your own kids, it opens a whole new can of worms, and I think she's taking advantage of you. Just tell her no - or you can have your sister talk to her.|`|3klIx1Egaa	tell her you had plans to spend time with your lil one tonight, and wasnt expecting to babysit, and that you would prefer to focus on your own baby tonight, and that the boyfriends will have to wait while she tends to her children.
aGdGNGbpaa	once the test has been sitting for more than =a hour the results are not correct so negative is what u got but if u want u can always test again tomorrow or in a few days to make sure.|`|SGeo7cqYaa	You might wanna go see your doctor.|`|FXPTeTcPaa	Pregnancy tests are no good to read after 10 mins. The instructions say to disregard any changes after that time. So, if it turned positive after 10 mins, then you cannot rely on that. Take another test.|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	You should probably get another test, take it again, and watch it until you know it can't possibly get any more correct than it already is. Watch the result for about 15 or 20 minutes, after that what the answer is will probably the correct one. If you're not sure, just go to the doctor and get a for sure answer.|`|yjhpBM11aa	sounds like you could be pregnant. Go to the nearest Planned Parenthood for  pregnancy test!  :) Good luck!|`|ejHfqSD1aa	I would go to your doctor because that old test is not accurate. You could be pregnant but then again, something could be wrong.|`|3wJVfi1Naa	take another test, dont go by the old one. It is void after so long.it could be spotty or light just because of stress. your best bet is to take another test. if it comes up negative but u still think you might be go get bloodwork done at your doctor thats a sure way to tell usually
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Well I mean the baby starts growing from the beginning but you shouldnt actually start showing your weight gain until around the second trimester until then it is more bloating. You should gain around 4 pounds the first trimester and I cant remember how much in the other two but for average person 25-30 pounds is the recommended gain|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The baby is growing from the time it implants (about 5 days after conception).|`|hmQDjHs6aa	Don't worry about ur weight girl!!!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	uh i dunno why u would want to gain weight before getting pregnant, your body will make you gain weight according to how much it knows the baby will need, your body is smarter than i think you're giving it credit for just let it happen naturally lol.|`|627pWyVkaa	everyone is different, and You'll probably find that when you hear everyones experiences! Its normal if you go by the pregnancy books to gain 5-10lbs by month 4. But you shouldn't really gaine anything by 8 weeks, because the baby is still really really small. However if you start getting cravings or think you do or let your eating habits get really unhealthy then obviously you'll start to gain more and might contribute it too your pregnancy. Im 18weeks 2 days and havent gained anything, However my stomach is now starting to show. Just go by what your doctors say, It really depends on your body size health ect before you became pregnant. I would say you really shouldn't gain weight until after 12 weeks. But its normal if you have gained a pound or two by then. Also if you get morning sickness that can affect how much you gain or don't. Just go by what your doctor says, Is normal or not! If there not concerned you shouldnt worry either. Its on average for pregnancies woman gain 25-35 pounds however Some way less and More. Ive had smaller friends gain 50lbs and another 80lbs! It really depends on the person!
eXsR8Gx5aa	My partner laughs at me for even making him buy one in the first place - we live in a one-bedroom flat you see therefore     We used it when he was a newborn, in fact I recall going for a nap one day and my partner using the talk back facility to bark "I detect movement in the vicinity of the cot, what are you doing?" I laughed so hard - he then proceeded to read me a "bedtime story" while I was trying to sleep !! haha,|`|Ca5n28eVaa	i am gonna stop using them at about 14 months|`|FRFryWDfaa	i used mine all the time my son is one and he shares a room with his sister who is 5. i think there is no ae limit i think i stopped putting them on when my daughter was 3 as she was more settled i think it all depends on what your child is like  and how comfortable you feel. x|`|RIbS6yzYaa	never used one.  never had kids far enought away from me to need one.|`|7Bsb0CNQaa	When he/she was old enough to come through and get me if they wanted.

Somehow we manage to be both obsessed and informal ...    My husband is subtle, charitable, stoical, satiric, bighearted, champion, classy, healthy, loving, merry, super, honored, cherished and that's actually quite accurate.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Mine said cute, fancy and alive...|`|4k5NJN29aa	My name only came up with one...

rmse6Mj8aa	increased discharge can be associatied with pregnancy yes. however it is white lotiony discharge that stretches rather like ewcm that is often mentioned by pregnant women on twoweekwait.com before going on to get their bfp.  black stringy bits and snot like sound like a possible yeast infection more than discharge, or just early spotting.  what dpo are you on (i realised you said cycle day23 but when did you O?) and how well did you time your intercourse? do you chart? use OPK's?    i was snowed in yesterday too.   it is very snowy and sunny here today as well but the tubes are running again now so no excuse not to work.    sadly no bfp yet as i am at the beginning of my cycle not the two week wait.    read up on twoweekwait about spotting and discharge if you are curious to see what other people went through before getting their bfp but it does become addictive and every time you get a twinge you will think it's a sign so be warned. symptom spotting can be heartbreaking if this is not your month.    good luck, enjoy the snow.|`|P3zo82dFaa	i have just got my positive i had the sickness backache,tiredness,tender brests have not really noticed the discarge|`|8y0837nlaa	I just got my BFP Sunday night.  Tested Monday another positive.  So i just hope this is real.  My symptoms are sore breast more around the nipple.  Heahaches, dizziness, tiredness..always want to be sleeping and thats about it... Hope you get your BFP as well.  Baby dust to you...|`|LIVkGLa5aa	BFN for me last week but we were not trying to conceive.  However we are trying from this month on so hopefully will have some news soon!  In my last pregnancy I did notice more discharge (the sort you said) so hopefully it is a good sign!  When is af due?    We are snowed in too so cleaning day for me!    x
n6XYYyoLaa	:LOL  i thought i was the only one who had bought bigger sizes of the same thing; and yes i can't get rid of them, and won't for a while in case we have another...but before she was born i found the 2 set of long sleeve onesies that i loved; they didn't have many and i didn't know how big she would be so ibought nb and0/3....then a month or so ago i was browsing a local second hand shop, and i fought a set of the same shirts in the six mo size; so , u guessed it, i bought them! so she has that same set in 3 sizes!|`|NjeN7Lc9aa	hiya. its not only u. my LO is  6 months and still have all her stuff, even some of her newborn nappies.lol|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I only got rid of the really tiny 7.5lbs stuff, and only because someone my mum knew had a baby soon after I had Luke and he'd outgrown that stuff in a week!    Everything else I've kept....  I now have a suitcase full of stuff.  I keep thinking, "Well if I ever have another boy, I'm sorted!"      And yeah, I've been tempted to buy him the same outfit in a bigger size, haha, thought it was just me!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	im like you- i have so many clothes of mine in the top of the cupboard that i have not worn in a couple of years, but i cant get rid of them- one day i might want to grab em out lol.  im the same with my daughters stuff. She is ten months old, and Her double wardrobe is FULL of baby clothes she has outgrown. I sort through them all the time, but i cant bring myself to get rid of them lol. The ones that are stained i give to my sisters (they are 7 & 8) to use as dolls clothes.  I am 4 months pregnant now and waiting to see the sex of this baby before i do anything with them. If i am having another little girl- thats the reason i was keeping them, lol. If not, i will be giving them to the women's refuge in my town- they are always forgotten, and the women there really need it.  YES- i buy the same outfit a few different sizes LOL. im sure we arent the only ones....i hope lol|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I don't get rid of it.  We plan on one more at least (maybe two) and I'm saving all the clothes.  A lot of the actual outfits she only wore a few times and they look new!  We already have 3 boxes full of clothes and I need to go through her clothes and start purging stuff again since she just grew again!|`|JjXFj2EBaa	I moved country when my son was 8 months old so I gave all his stuff to charity rather than ship it all home, but I have to admit I did shed a tear when I left the shop|`|MHXD3BwBaa	no because i burn them|`|uhj76Fkpaa	I have 2 daughters and a little boy.I must tell you that I still keep all their clothes(it's been almost 4 years now).It's really hard!!|`|eVmQGDHQaa	I think that all of us mums go through that luckily I asked my mum to help me and the thought of a child less fortunate than my own wearing her beautiful things made it much more easier I gave her little things to an orphanage.    Be strong and just remember that there is a little baby out there that would like nothing more than a 'new' outfit.    Good Luck|`|FRFryWDfaa	no it's not just you as when i had my first daughter i brought nearly every outfit in more then one size as i loved her in every thing me and my husband brought even some of her booties i liked with certain outfits crazy i know but then i would keep all her first out fits in a nice box i got her.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	hhaa yes then i started to buy designer clothes and resold them to buy newoutfits this made it easier    but i have about 12 pairs of tiny shoes ect from when my daughters were babys after they get age 2 its gets easier as there not as tiny;)  even those little tiny jelly shoes from the beach!!|`|pDRAciBnaa	i keep all holly things,partly because she is my first so i will want them for the next!!|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	About a month ago my daughter's stack of clothes that she had outgrown was turning into a mountain, and I live in an apartment and there honestly is no room for stuff that we aren't using. (Of course I keep the important ones like what she came home in and stuff)    I sold them to a resale store and when I got in the car from doing it I almost cried. I felt like a bad mother!! I don't know why! I can't explain it! My hubby thinks it's so crazy. I guess maybe it's just bittersweet to see them growing out of those tiny little clothes...|`|69DjSUVAaa	I usually find it quite easy to throw away my stuff, but when it comes to Alfie all his old clothes have gone up into the loft. I know exactly what you mean buying him things up in the next size, when he was little little i bought him some lovely sleep suits from mothercare, i felt he wasn't in them for long and he looked so quite when he wore them, so i got them again recently.

Also:  Winter  Christal|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Snowbell =O|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Aneira - Girl        Bora - Girl OR Boy     Edur - Boy      Eira - Girl      Eirawen - Girl       Eirwen -Girl      Eirwyn - Boy     Eiry - Girl    all these names mean 'snow' :)|`|cmoGATT9aa	the name Winter is lovely i think. lol. wouldnt call my baby that but its an interesting name.|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	Blanche, it means "white"

i6tyscumaa	For girls, i like pretty, feminine names, such as Maya and Holly, and for boys i like sweet, short names.  My favourite boys name is Beau :)     also have this thing, where i think that two syllable names always sound nice with one syllable middle names, for example, i want to name my girls:    Maya Grace   Holly Jade.    I love really sweet simple middle names such as Rae, Mae, Eve, Belle, etc.    I wouldn't want my children to have really classic names, Jessica, Lauren, Emily, Rebecca, etc because they're so popular    However, at the same time, i would hate to give my child a really wild zany name that they would have to live with    I love the ame of Nicole Richies Baby, Harlow Winter Kate i think that's adorable, but not too wacky :)    Also, with unisex names i nearly always prefer them on a girl  Alex, Jaime, Ashley, Robyn... i don't really like any of them on boys    The name "Billy" though, i will always love more on a boy, i think its really cute! :D x|`|TUNvbXbgaa	girls  Sarah Lynn  Jessica Ann  Kayley Marie        David Anthony  Kyle James  Adam Joseph|`|VGij9p0Taa	I tend to go for more traditional names however i like unusual name like Winter, Dakota and Willow as well as Jackson. But my favourite names change all the time furthermore, i tend to like a name if i like the person with this name. For instance I didn't like the name Christabel but when i meet a person with this name who i liked i began to like the name.   My favourite girl name at the moment is:-   Lilian Rose, Olivia Willow, Scarlett Grace, Imogen Sophia, Evie Isabella/Isabella Eve.... and many more.   My favourite boy names I like at the moment are:-  Ryan William, Jackson Elijah, Nathaniel James, Evan Alexander, Liam Riley and Jacob Reed or Jacob Henry.|`|7uy8iy7laa	I like:   Milo Coltrane  Caleb Xavier  Josiah Sebastien   Hayden Giovanni   Leo Bastian   Max Emerson  AND:   Summer Kennedy  Harlow Winter  Shiloh Elise  Sabina Elise|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I like sweet traditional names, like Ethan and Harry. They are really nice strong sweet names. Well chosen. Marcus is nice as well as Alice.     Im not too keen on the hippy choice of names. They are usually not as nice. Azaria is ok, but Autumn is gorgeous. Lunah again not so nice but Angel is sweet and getting more common.     I like names like yours as well as original names that are well thought out and not strictly spiritual or hippyish.|`|q82cqg3raa	I like your style better. I love James and Callie.  I can't stand weird, made-up, misspelled names. I used to hate boys names on girls but sadly now I'm starting to like some of them (Riley, Taylor, Dylan, Casey).  Names I love are Alexander (Alex), Nicholas, Nathaniel (Nate), James, Brandon, Matthew, Jeremy, Zachary (Zac), Hayden Michael (first and middle) for a boy and Sophia, Rebecca, Lily, Violet, Grace, Caroline, Kate, Elizabeth for girls.  I also like some more uncommon names (but I don't think I would actually use them for my kids), like Sawyer, Cooper, Brody/Brady, Chase...|`|SVyBjDguaa	Well, I like a lot of different names like..    Eva Belle  Annabella Mae  Belia Lunette  Jamila Aveen    Those are just my favorites but I like mostly all different kind of names  =]|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love names like yours - Ethan James, Jacob and Callie.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	i like names that arent really common, but people will be able to pronounce. not too silly, but not completely expressionless.  eg - Mariette Layne and Zane Parker.  ;)|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	I always find, if I like the person, I like the name.  I know when I was choosing my daughters name when she was born, some names were put forward and some of them made me think of people I went to school with and did not like.  If I do not like a person, I could never call my child that name.    So I think that names are very personal to a person.  It is like anything, your memories influence your way of thinking and people who I had known in life definitely influenced the names of my three children.    :)|`|8OoqHpbIaa	love those kind of names my name is sky and i always loved having a  nature name ;)    i have Dakota rain / Sienna Autmn rose etc on my list    serenity rose is lovely too|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Girls Names     Alexia  Hannah  Precious   Daisy  Amber|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I like these names for girls:  Rose (After my grandma)  Ruth  (Its a middle name thats been passed down in my family)  Milla   (after the awesome Milla Jovovich..Its pronounce Mee-Luh)  Lilli  Joan (after Joan of Arc)  Tuesday  Scout    Boys:  Dragon  Phoenix  Willis (as a middle name)  Cobain (after Kurt Cobain)  John (after my grandad)  When I have kids I'll probably put all the names together, I'm not going to have twelve kids!|`|ewDKMeJkaa	I like Irish names for bhoys, such as Seamus, Cillian, Declan, Padraig    And ghirls such as Caoilainn, Saorise, Cadhla    and i love Callie aswell =] lol|`|VPOaunmvaa	Callie and Jacob are great names btw.  Your names are great hers are  certainly unusual...    I love Dylan Michael James,Tyler Rory Jack, Nate Samuel Kai and Chase Connor Caiden for boys and  Taylor Ava Skye, Brooke Isabella Rose and Summer Morgan Grace for girls :)|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I like short, simple names.  I don't really like giving a child a long name just to shorten it - why name a child Benjamin if you are just going to call him Ben, for example.  Although I like both Ben and Benjamin.    For boys i like: Evan, Luka, Ben, Sean and Osn (i like some Irish names)    For girls i like: Anna, Lois, Katie, Abigail and Abbie (i like girls names to be feminine - i dislike the trend of using boys names on girls or surnames as first names.    The names you have chosen are lovely - classic and timeless. I particulary like Ethan, Seth and Alice.    I'm not too fond of your friends names - i just cant imagine an 80 year old called Storm!|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	I like Gaelic names for boys. Such as :  Liam  Ian  Donovan  Owen    For girls I like old-fashioned names like:  Sarah  Emma  Caroline  Elizabeth|`|6SB4ufEYaa	For girls i like pretty, and feminine. And quite classic.    Emilie, Alice, Madeline, Molly, Olivia, Poppy, Matilda, Isabella...    For boys, i like classic.    Matthew, Alexander, Edward, Sebastian...      Although i am think of giving them somewhat hippy middle names. Like.. River, Ocean, Summer, Coralie.... We'll see :)|`|nMwbTKlpaa	my favorite girls' names are julianne racheal, isabella mae, aubrey ann, and audrey lynne. i think they're sooo pretty! my favorite boys names are hudson alexander, andrew jacob (plain), noah richard (plain), and jamison lee. hope this helps.|`|8hvUyaStaa	I think something like caspian would be great.  For a cool person there sons names could be like romeo, dreaded,scar,glimpse,eclipse. fella    For a clever person Samuel , hogarth, norman. qwuker(kweek-ker)    Somone strong Titan, chaotic,tempest, triton , mega    Hope this helped thank you.|`|rpqAChh5aa	i like the names Emma Thomas, Francesca and Stefan  i think they are really individual|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I like traditional British names such as James and Rebecca or Rachel, although I know that the latter have their origin in Judaism.  I like some more modern names such as Freyer, Briony, Megan and Verity but I hate the chave names that appear so often on this site when someone is asking for names.  They disadvantage the child in terms of future progression in life.  A name really labels someone and indicates their social class.
Zkfj2f9Oaa	Speak to your doctor there are lots of options before IVF.  Start by having your partner tested.  Get an ovulation kit so that you know that you are actually having sex at the right time.  Have sex.  I am suprised at the number of people who complain about not falling pregnant who are only prepared to have sex once a month.  Sure it can work but give yourself every chance you can.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	No, you either can or cannot have a kid. If you or your partner are infertile, you have two choices. IVF or adoption.     have him tested.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Has your partner been tested to see if he has anything wrong?|`|tJNikP3aaa	have you ever heard of those couples who try to get pregnant, but cant and give up and then get pregnant while not trying? A lot of times, stress plays a big part in infertility.  I wouldn't try to get pregnant, just see what happens. Sometimes if you keep your expectations low you'll be surprised!
JnLoHaoAaa	I just entered my 2nd trimester (15 weeks) and I feel huge, so I was suprised when I went to the Dr. today and was told I lost 3 1/2 pounds in the past 2 weeks. I chalk it up to bloating and water retention. Maybe you are experiencing something similar|`|QY10Hmq7aa	YES! I am 9 weeks and I have gained about 7 pounds too.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I got big very fast. When I was around 3 months, people were actually asking me if I were having twins! Needless to say that wasn't the best thing I would have liked to hear.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i got bigger with baby 2 . my first i was small and this one even tho i am lighter i am bigger|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Yes, this is my 3rd and I am 7 weeks pregnant. But I already feel huge and look pregnant. It is probably a little bit of bloating. And the fact that it ain't our first babies.     Good Luck|`|JdyRdLwVaa	i'm 15 weeks with my 2nd pregnancy and just in the past few days gained 4.5lbs.I feel a lot bigger now then when i was 15 weeks with my first.It feels like its taking the fate from everywhere else on my body and sticking it to my stomach since i haven't gained much weight.But at 8 weeks I was feeling huge too.
BKb72uHnaa	I'm 34 weeks pregnant and had never suffered a panic attack in my life until now.  My attacks hit at night when my husband and I go out somewhere.  To get back control of myself, I play a game on my cell phone (Canal Control).  It seems that getting my mind off of it is the key to getting over it, but boy are they rough!  I get all smothery, sweaty, and nauseated.  I am 43, and will soon give birth to my first child.  I believe my attacks are brought about by too much worry.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	yeah i was like that i hated cuddles from the start and when i got realy big i freaked out at family parties because it was too crowded|`|tJNikP3aaa	yes, it is your subconscious wanting to protect your baby! when i thought i was pregnant i had this problem cuz i didnt want anything bad to happen to the baby.. i think its completely normal, just dont let it get to your head..

Yes it possible to be already 11 weeks pregnant.|`|OWw3LWDCaa	well of course it possible to be 11 weeks pregnant.  you had sex , you got pregnant and wil be pregnant for about 40 weeks. maybe you need to talk to someone about the birds and the bees, and how a baby grows|`|vrt8bMzVaa	yes|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	im thoroughly confused by this.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	If whats possible?|`|JdyRdLwVaa	You don't have enough detail.You were wondering if what was possible?|`|9op65iQVaa	what?  that you learned to count?|`|fSoqa6mdaa	if you're a girl, its totaly possible to be 11 weeks pregnant.    if you're a guy, not likely, but you can pay to have a surgery to get pregnant|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	You had sex 11 weeks ago, you're prego.  Simple.  You should go to the Ob/Gyn and have her/him explain it to you.  The sooner the better, you should get prenatal vitamins now.  Your not far from time to get yur first ultasound.  Congrats!|`|kdPXhPijaa	Hmmm....dont get Ur ?, but thanks for the points!
nCKdkYSyaa	My daughter took her first steps and walked to her room and around the kicthen a few times around her 1st birthday but even then she still liked crawling better, My daughter will be 14 months in 3 days and she is completly walking now, not crawling at all.|`|8MudYsoaaa	Mine started walking a little bit at 11 months than went to full walking and hardly any crawling around 13 months shes 15 months now and walks all the time..|`|BBlfetz3aa	started "wobbling" at 9.5 months but walking full time at 11 months|`|n6XYYyoLaa	mine is 8 mos and def prefers walking (with assistance of course)|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Our son started to walk around 10 1/2 months. He walks perfectly now at 11 months (he'll be 12 months on Wednesday) but still crawls a little. The more we keep him on the floor instead of picking him up, the more he walks. I'm guessing in about two or three months he'll be walking exclusively. I guess it just depends on the child =)
F7tyzrMzaa	Your list is set to private. You need to make it public before I can vote on it.    EDIT: Voted! My favorites are:    Girls- Ava, Peyton and Maya    Ava is very popular though, so your child wouldn't be the only one in the classroom.  Peyton is super adorable but also getting quite popular, but nowhere near as much as Ava.   Maya is also lovely and not as popular as the other two. You could also spell it Maia, but that's just a matter of preference.    Boys: Chase, Riley and Bailey    Chase is my favorite of the three, but so popular. It's an awesome name though.  Riley and Bailey are both unisex names though, so you have to be careful. While I love both names, I have actually met more girls called Bailey than I have boys. But they're both awesome.    Middle Name Suggestions:    Ava Noelle   Ava Brianna  Ava Brielle   Ava Jade  Ava Grace    Peyton Grace   Peyton Zara  Peyton Isabella      Maya Noelle   Maya Grace  Maya Gracelyn  Maya Alyssa       Chase Michael  Chase Sean/Shawn  Chase Harrison  Chase James  Chase Cameron  Chase Ethan  Chase Evan  Chase Everett   Chase Emerson  Chase Avery    Bailey Noah  Bailey Michael  Bailey Mitch(ell)  Bailey Caleb  Bailey Nicholas  Bailey Joseph  Bailey Everett     Riley Matthew   Riley James  Riley Connor  Riley Chase  Riley Felix  Riley Ashton  Riley Jack  Riley Kade/Cade      Good luck!|`|6SB4ufEYaa	-Macey .. i'm not sure on this one. Prefer Maisy.. Sounds softer..  -Kearce - Nooooo.  -Ava - Cute. Classic. ?  -Peyton - The only place i've ever heard this is on one tree hill. Not a fan of it at all..  -Maya - Not bad.   -Sienna - LOVE IT ? It's feminine, and pretty. The only possible downside is that people will think of Sienna Miller, but i don't think that's a bad thing.    -Rylan - Hate it.  -Brody - Not a fan. Makes me think of the word 'grody'  -Bailey - After the drink? No.  -Connor - Nice :)  -Riley - Not bad.  -Chase - Eghh.. no.    Faves = Ava, Sienna and Connor.|`|VGij9p0Taa	I've voted  I love out of the girls Sienna, Peyton and Ava   Out of the boys i love Connor, Riley and Bailey  Hope i helped!|`|ot0TqzSvaa	I LOVE Ava, Peyton, Rylan, and Chase.  they are all soooo cool.    i suggest Landon, Jace, Jett, Grayer, Zane, Zander for boys, and  Shya, Dakota, Kaylee, Haidyn, Lorelei and Camryn for girls.    good luck.
JxVx0GXiaa	i was so scared to experience childbirth, i have extremely low pain / discomfort threshold! i worried quite a lot towards the end of pregnancy.    my labour was quite difficult and traumatic - posterior baby, epidural didn't work, episiotomy, the whole bit. but funnily enough, i still remember thinking it was a good experience.    as soon as my son was born, i was like, yeah i could do that again tomorrow, no worries!     childbirth was the worst thing, but also the best thing i've even been through. very hard to imagine until you've done it.     just remember, it's one day of your life, it's not that long at all in the scheme of things.|`|QCIzOLNyaa	Alot of my friends have had babies, and they say it hurts, but the pain relief helps alot, gas and air they have all said is fantastic, But they have all said , the pain you do go through, is VERY worth it at the end!! good luck :)|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	Yeah it hurts, but if it was that horrible people wouldn't keep having babies.  I am 37 weeks pregnant with my 3rd and even though i didn't have any meds with my other two labors, i got pregnant again lol  I am more scared of the epidural than i am labor lol I'm scared of needles lol|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Well, it is different for everywoman, but is isnt a party. Any woman that tells you its easy and great, probably just has a high threshold for pain.     I didnt have a horrible labor, my water broke at 6.30 am. I got my epidural at 9.30 and at 1.00 i started pushing. She was born at 1.21. It was relatively easy, BUT it still hurt. That being said, i had 2 more pregnancies that ended in miscarriage, and now am 26 weeks pregnant. I did it 4 times, if it was that bad, people wouldnt keep having kids.     But I wont lie, I tore, needed stitches and was scared out of my mind. It's not a day at the park, but its not that horrible.|`|LV9l8EFkaa	I thought you was on about kids workign in sweatshops for a miniut there, ha|`|dsFyihThaa	Whatever you do, don't watch any childbirth videos. And don't make natural birth, get drugs|`|QgHo4Mvtaa	you should ask your doctor about that or even your mom or sister anyone who has been through that instead of waiting terrified
O4JuH8zmaa	Braxton Hicks is false labor. You have to go into real labor for your water to break. Some women have BH without knowing about it. Has your stomach ever gotten hard where it felt like your baby was pushing his head against your belly? That could have been a BH.|`|z9DvICCuaa	yes|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I don't think so, as it takes a strong contraction to break your water. Anything is possible though. Good luck!|`|IllWKAUGaa	Yeah, contractions happen even when you don't feel them...and not everyone will feel braxton hicks, everyone is different...|`|bQAvca08aa	yes your water can break. i went through my pregnancy without feeling a single contraction until 6 hours before my son was born. i was having to get non stress tests done 2 times a week and the machine was registering the contractions but i wasn't feeling them. and also as long as the doctor does a proper stripping (my water broke the second time i was stripped) of the membranes around your cervix, then within a week you should have the baby.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	Yes. My water broke 4 weeks early and I never experienced any contractions (or at least, I wasn't aware they were contractions anyway)
qH3pVH7Paa	no just go by ur dates
Ok8izt2iaa	jasmin isabella is soooo long as someone said why not jasmine bella if u like the way it ended. also i like jasmine spelt jasmyn that can be a change if u lyk it. as for taylor blake i think it sounds a little feminine. thats just my opinion.|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	i like them all|`|Elxuvon8aa	I really dis like the girls name it is just to common Jasmine is over used and I really think of elephants when I hear Bella names  Isabelle is on every one's top ten list also.   Taylor Blake is not so over used|`|cSOkd7Umaa	jasmine isabella is nice!! Taylor Blake is also ice actualy!!!|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Jasmine Isabella is really long. I love Isabella but hate Jasmine. sorry.  Isabella Rose is beautiful. Or Isabel Jazmyn. ;)    Taylor Blake is 100000000 times better as Blake Taylor. But both names are cool. good choice.|`|YjE0AJSnaa	I like Jasmine, not soo crazy about Isabella. I like Talyor but not so crazy about Blake. And together they the girl names don't sound that good but the boy's name kinda has a ring to it.... once they're together.|`|8wn7rQH4aa	Sorry, but I do not like them. Isabella is okay but I prefer just Isabelle or Isabel. And the boy's name sounds pretty girly.|`|KcfBOa9vaa	I like Taylor and Blake by themselves but they don't seem to flow right together.    Jasmine Isabelle flows better.    Good luck!|`|f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	I like them all four.|`|IvU7WH8baa	i love them they are very cute. they both go together.|`|XBpfbjCiaa	Taylor Blake is unisex but not girly. I love it for a boy!
qXq0nmBzaa	I do not like gender-benders. OTHER people don't mind co-opting male names for females but I think it's tacky, distasteful, and disrespectful.    Here's a list for some traditional feminine forms:    GIOSETTA   f   Italian   GIUSEPPA   f   Italian   GIUSEPPINA   f   Italian   JO   f   English   JOBETH   f   English (Rare)   JODENE   f   English (Rare)   JODI   f   English   JODIE   f   English   JOETTA   f   English   JOLEEN   f   English   JOLENE   f   English   JOSE   f   French   JOSEFA   f   Spanish, Portuguese, Czech   JOSEFIINA   f   Finnish   JOSEFINA   f   Spanish, Swedish   JOSEFINE   f   German   JOSEPHA   f   German (Archaic), English (Rare)   JOSPHE   f   French   JOSEPHINA   f   English (Rare)   JOSPHINE   f   French   JOSEPHINE   f   English, German   JOSETTE   f   French (my favorite)  JOSIANE   f   French   JOSIE   f   English   JZEFA   f   Polish   JO?EFA   f   Slovene   JOZEFA   f   Hungarian, Slovene   JOZEFIEN   f   Dutch   JO?ICA   f   Slovene   PEPCA   f   Slovene   PEPE   m   Spanish   PEPITA   f   Spanish   POSIE   f   English   POSY   f   English     The only feminine form of Arthur that I've ever heard was the bizarre Arthureen. Since Arthur means bear or, possibly, stone, I don't see it as a very good choice.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	I don't think they are okay. Addison is a girl name and Peyton is unisex. I think Noah and Ryan are ridiculous for girls too.|`|eSOzKj0Waa	I wouldn't, because people have an image in their head of what someone called 'Arthur' would be like, and they'd automatically think of a boy.    But you can use similar names, e.g. Alina, Alexandra, Audrey, Josephine, Joanne, Josie, etc.    Hope this helps! :)|`|6SB4ufEYaa	No!    Maybe Josephine or Josie.. but Joseph? No.    And Arthur??? Do you WANT a boy instead of a girl?  There is nothing feminine about it at all..|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	arthur and Joseph sound like boy names   for arthur, you can go with alexa or alexandra   for joseph, you can go with josie or joey|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.I think Addison is good both ways but originally was a boys name.Peyton is too.Noah and ryan arthur and joseph are good for boys only.
UMcfklnJaa	because their instinct tell them to do so...do you have children? you'll know what i'm talking about when you have some of ur own..its kinda a dumb question though sorry :P|`|zMLKNCs8aa	'cause its not like you can put them back where u found them and after 18 years of taking care of them they sorta grow on you a little|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you want to get scientific it's biological and hormonal based.|`|NpSVEC2naa	instinct|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Not all of them do. Look at the millions of child abuse cases.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	So we don't eat them like the tigers do.|`|PX4u59tkaa	its designed that way by biology! if we didnt like them so much (if we didnt have a totally distorted perception of how great they are!) - oh my! how would the species continue?!|`|8pyOVKcmaa	thats the stupidest question i've come across. You love wat is yours dont you?|`|Et5ffAMGaa	well most caring parents love their kids.    i have no idea why dead beat parents cant care for their kids they rather watch tv drink or go out until stupid hours of the night.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	lol because they gave birth to them and loved them even before they were born?
VGij9p0Taa	Congrats!   Firstly i'd like to say i really like Kayden your son's name it is so cool and trendy i love the spelling instead of the usual spelling Caiden.   Charlotte meaning free the feminine form of Charles is really pretty traditional name it's very classy and i think goes well with your first child's name. The name Charlotte ages well and as a few nicknames to choose from my favourite being Lottie. A middle name that i think goes really well with Charlotte is Rosanna.   Hope i helped and good luck!|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I think it is a very elegant name, but it reminds me of the spider with the pig.  She was a smart spider !|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes very nice name....|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Nice name|`|bIaywrBCaa	I like it. Good old fashioned name that hasn't been overused. Nice sound to it.|`|7uy8iy7laa	LOVE it!

If you want another biblical, better name her EZRA.|`|AA11346465	Love it, that's my name :-)    The name Charlotte has been in England much longer than 36yrs - King George III married Queen Charlotte in 1761 so it's been around a long time. I was named after my  great grandmother - It's a classic name :-)|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It's a nice name and has been used in England for the past thirty-six years.  That is my daughter's age and she had a friend named Charlotte.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	It's very nice! I love the name Charlie for a girl so it could be a possible nickname? Or even Lottie.      :)|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Nice!|`|0yLrQUdsaa	very nice name :)|`|85a7adb7410df3ce980f02b34377f6edaa	I love the name Grace...but i also like Charlotte, it can be shortened to Charlie, Lottie.. even Lolly =]|`|wUQ51VBdaa	yeah that name is lovely, my cousin is called Charlotte, its a name that makes u think of pretty and sweet if u know wot i mean xx :)|`|UIT1khqtaa	it's nice. but Charlotte sounds more like Shallot to me.  but i luv it (:|`|cmoGATT9aa	its a lovely name.    its truly stunning. classy and sweet.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I like it. I know a few Charlottes (that's not a bad thing).    It's cute. It's classic.    And it can be shortened to Charlie or Lottie.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	its okay. i prefer mariette. plus, i know 4 charlottes. its a common name atm.|`|NYEUyRNqaa	I LOVE, love, love the name Charlotte! It's top of my list! :)

gTun7ZoHaa	My daughter started walking about a week after her first birthday, she was walking round the furniture from about 9-10 months but had no confidence to let go and walk.  Some babies walk sooner some later, ive known some toddlers not to walk till 18 months or so.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	Crawling 5 months  Walking unassisted 9 months {first steps at 8.5 months though}  Your baby will walk when s/he is ready. You can't force it :)|`|7E37G0SGaa	Crawling - 8 months  Walking - 14 months. Took 14 steps and dropped. Got straight back up and years later I don't think she has sat down yet!

VYMOwgc3aa	Definitely go with gold candles. They will stand out nicely with the dark color of the cake. Black would blend in too much & silver doesn't match as well as gold will.    Happy Birthday |`|1qTNn8qnaa	I think Gold...cos the cake is kinda dark itself so gold candles would look really nice!!|`|7ePjzDZTaa	i think silver cause it would make the twilight sign stand out more    cool b-day idea thou|`|E6T9DPT9aa	hmm black    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|z3GnaxhDaa	Gold. :D Because that's like the topaz of the Cullen's eyes! xD
395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	If your friend cannot afford to raise the children, perhaps she should consider adoption. If she goes through the paper, she can find couples willing to pay her hospital bills as part of the adoption process. It may be hard for her to give up the kids, but she also wouldn't have to worry about medical bills.    Another option is Section 8 housing and Medicaid for the babies. She can apply for food stamps and daycare assistance. My friend has one child and pays $35 a MONTH for rent with rental assistance. She is a hard worker and going back to school too. Government assistance isn't something to be ashamed of.    In addition, the government and other companies offer assistance to mothers (and fathers) having multiple births. Reynolds and Reynolds is one of these companies.    Now, in the event you raise one of the children for her - unless you get legal custody aka adopt the child, she can and is allowed to take the child back from you at any time. (Meaning if you even got in a small fight, she could take the child away.) Personally, I would NOT take the child from her unless it was a legal adoption and you (the important part) want the child. Don't do it for her. You have to want to have a child in the first place. Then again, if you do legal adopt the child, you are responsible for all care of that child until he or she is 18, including food, clothing, medical care, etc.    Good luck.|`|2ccc059527d1efeda0ddbf17e2bb7b41aa	Well that depends on how close the 2 of you are. Cause later on she may want the baby back but not if you adopt the child . And it could be upseting for the child who would be mommy? Could you take the pain of bonding and caring for the baby for it to be taken away? As a mom I don't think I could. I have taken care of my nephew since birth . Although his mom was there he would still call me mommy. It took her to move and me to only have him every other weekend for him to realize I was auntie. He's 10 yrs old and knows I love him to pieces. I'm Auntie mommy.|`|AA11355733	don't take the baby just go with her for awhile while the babies are growing up until about the age of 3 then she should be ok!! like u don't have to live  with her just help her!!|`|7e272b0eaf698c1ccf498507089db912aa	Tell the B I T CH to keep her legs closed and quit giving that stank  p u s s y up until she gets married|`|36a8daab4c3612abdf3f0a31362e4a1baa	it is a real possibility that she may want the baby back and if you aren't able to go through that i would say that it may be hard but you might have to say no.  Noone can tell you what to do you have to think of you and the baby.  What is best for you both?  I hope this helps some and i will be praying for you, your friend and the babies|`|86fa1f39c39335f9795a9ca6deb3abffaa	as a twin myself, i would never forgive my mother if she separated us .never...|`|c6bcc33e987481a1aeadbc06ae8bb4a4aa	i understand where you are  comming from especialy when i like see the lifetime movies and that happends i cry and could never imagine what would feel like but if i was you i wouldnt i would tell her too keep both of them and you tell her i will help you take care of them and help you anything you need but this is a big i mean a big decision for you so good luck  chel-c|`|e78b80809a3905d1916f2fba6643d11aaa	I don't thing it would be a good idea to take and raise your friends baby.Maybe you can help in other ways like with cooking or cleaning or just take her babies to a park while she can catch-up on some sleep.The babies are her responsibilities and she just can't give one of her babies to her friend.She will learn how to take care of them because noone is born as a mother.And she will have some money from goverment I think they give more when twins.|`|65a18825ff1bfa6803ab3abc20bbb4f6aa	She'll change her mind when the twins are born.|`|d36d6a3a2e685e8e153c6a23d23a894baa	I just had twins 8 months ago and I would never separate my girls. They form a very special bond when they grow inside of you. I know that my sound silly but it's true. When my girls were born they couldn't sleep unless they where touching one another. And as they got a little older we separated them but, they hold hands and everything. I would tell her that you will help her the best way possible. But honestly I would not separate them.|`|f85be681f46b9be671fdc7749cbe7273aa	I wouldn't take that child from her but i would offer all the help and support she needs. Be there for her. I am sure that she is just worried right now and later will feel differently about giving one up after delivery. GL to you and her!!!!!|`|e8bc630b244b0d0af6b2b35e47d0982aaa	I would suggest helping her with the twins until  she gets back on her feet again.|`|AA10766729	I would advise strongly against taking custody of that child.      Give her help financially (if you can), get her in touch with government agencies (if she qualifies), help her out by watching the babies when you're able, but do NOT take that baby - she'll regret it somewhere along the way, and it will tear you apart to have to give it back!|`|AA11435916	Idk what to tell ya...those are her kids that she has to take care of. How old is she anyways?  get back with me...maybe i can tell you more.|`|AA10181372	Don't do it! Help her keep them together.|`|AA12257113	If you are serious enough to take a child, why not suggest that she keep both babies and you offer financial support?    She will get back on her feet and want the baby back.  Protect yourself from heartbreak and support her financially.
7HzfgRmwaa	hehe! They sound like hiccups!! Are you just now feeling them?? Sounds normal and like everything is fine :) My kiddo has them everyday at least once so get ready to feel that more often!!|`|oFo573Vyaa	they could have been hiccups... I am about as far along as you and I feel it too.  As long as you feel your baby move regularly I would say its ok, but if you are worried call the hospital  Good luck|`|sYsfI856aa	Sounds like hiccups! They are the weirdest thing to feel, but happen more often than you would think they would. So long as you have no pain, and baby is still moving you should be fine! :D

Riley Amber flows well..|`|HivQdKgwaa	I don't like the boy's name but Rylee Amber is beautiful|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	Sorry but I do not care for either of them. Neither are terrible, but just not my style.

But overall, they are okay.|`|fboC1N7gaa	I like them both although I'm not as fond of Arthur, perhaps archer or Logan.|`|wgYMHW9Naa	Rylee Amber is SO CUTE!  I love the name Amber and Rylee also, so together its great.  A bit trendy, but hey, we all have our own tastes|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I think the name Arthur is outdated and Amber is a little common    Try Ryder Avery    and    Rylee Aria|`|koXcq0l1aa	I like the girl's answer about Ryder Avery And Rylee Aria.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I love both of them! I love how you have paired a trendy modern name, with a classic name. Very nice!        :)
XbsDGhmNaa	Well, you can go to any emergency room and they'll have to deliver your baby and put you in their maternity ward. But really, you should consider a new doctor. I'm recommending this from personal experience. I developed pre-eclampsia late in my last pregnancy and my baby had to be delivered a full month early or my kidneys could've failed or I could've even lost her. Doctors need to keep a close eye on you, that's why you have to go back more often in the last months.
723QHuicaa	- Put your baby to sleep on his back.  - Take care of yourself and your unborn baby while you're pregnant.  - Don't allow smoking around your baby.  - Put your baby to sleep on a firm, flat mattress with no pillow and nothing but a fitted sheet under him. Don't put stuffed toys or other soft materials in your baby's crib, either.  - Avoid overheating your baby.  - Improve the ventilation in your baby's room.  - Try to limit exposure to infection.  - Breastfeeding will help reduce your baby's likelihood of getting of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, which often occur along with SIDS.  - Some experts believe that bed-sharing (also called co-sleeping) might allow a mother to respond more quickly to changes in her baby's breathing and movements.  - Some researchers suggest that swaddling  the practice of wrapping a baby securely in a blanket or cloth  may help prevent SIDS because it can help a baby sleep more comfortably on his back.  - Studies show a lower incidence of SIDS among infants who use pacifiers, although experts don't know whether there's a direct cause and effect.   - Some companies offer mattresses with a built-in ventilation system that supposedly prevents the buildup of carbon dioxide. These mattresses may keep more fresh air circulating around your baby, but there's no evidence that they lower the risk of SIDS.    babycenter.com|`|PX4u59tkaa	all of the above is good information too!    recent studies suggest that having a light fan blowing in babye's room to keep the air moving will prevent the buildup that sometimes happens to babys more prone to SIDS.    we use an angel-care monitor that senses breathign and motion patterns in the sleeping baby. it doesnt prevent SIDS by any means, but for me it made me relax enough to know that IF she stopped breathing, i would respond within seconds (so you need to know infant CPR also).     please search this topic on babycenter.com and maybe subscribe to a parenting magazine (most offer free trials for the 1st year?) and never stop researching sids. even though the occurance of sids drops drastically at 6 months old, babies still pass away unexpectedly in their sleep when they are nearly 2 years old. ALWAYS follow as many rules as you can.|`|hieQHR0daa	There is still a lot of research going on to find out exactly why SIDS happen. For now the best advice is to put your baby to sleep on his/her back, feet touching the bottom of the cot with a cover that goes up to baby's shoulders. Don't smoke near baby and never feed baby in the cot, i.e. leave baby with a bottle to feed themselves.  There may be a genetic link to SIDS and there is a possibility that minor infections accompanied by baby sleeping on his tummy may contribute but for now the causes are not well defined.  When baby can roll over and turn in his or her sleep then the child will chose a position that they are most comfortable with. Until that time it's a case of on the back.
oFo573Vyaa	yes I think it is your right to change doctors if you feel that they are not treating you properly or not giving you the attention you need and deserve.  I am sure not all doctors are like that- and no matter how pregnant you are you need to feel comfortable and if only for the 15 minutes of your appointment important as far as your doctor is concerned.  Look around and try doctors until you find one you are comfortable with.  good luck
1IDSGM71aa	Yes it's very normal. One word: lubrication. Buy a bottle of lube, and that should help things. Make sure she's ready for sex, before you try again. Eventually her hormones will go back to normal and so will her body, more than likely.
BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|yRihCgxaaa	Get a thermometer and every month wait for your temp to go up and that would usually be 14 days after your period.
cmoGATT9aa	you're baby should be fine.    morning sickness rarely lasts thro the whole pregnancy.  you're boobs are probably just getting used to the 'full' feeling  and you will find by the end of you're pregnancy you're usually lucky to have a bladder the size of a thimble. lol so you're constant toilet trips aren't a big concern.    but if you are concerned (and i doubt a strangers opinion will remove all doubts) see a doctor|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Symptoms tend to go away or taper off as the pregnancy goes along....You are fine.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	There is nothing to worry about. As you enter your second trimester your symptoms will start to subside. Usually form 14 weeks you will have none of the symptoms left at all and instead you will develop new symptoms.    This is normal and nothing to worry about.|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think there's nothing to worry about as my symptoms also went by when i was 9 weeks pregnant...well i have a bit of them on & off from my 10th week & now when i m about to enter my12th week(currently i 'm 11+6) my symptoms are back again & with a stronger effect on me...i think if the symptoms are going away that's a good sign but they do return so don't worry as i have told you my case..  well going to the loo is absolutely normal as your urination process increases when you are pregnant as the going uterus puts pressure on you bladder and you feel to go to the toilet in short time gaps...    hope this calms you down..!!
AA11763588	A pregnancy test is going to come back positive whenever you are pregnant. You still have hormones you in your body.    You could either be leveling out or you could be having early signs of a miscarriage.     It's always better to be safe then sorry. Either call your DR and let him know or wait to see if you start cramping and bleeding.    Good Luck|`|1CryEnb3aa	Your hormones are probably leveling out and getting used to the pregnancy.  You are probably stressing over nothing.  relax and call your dr or midwife for reassurance.  Good Luck and congrats.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	the only thing that will tell u what u need to know is a visit to your GP.  I know that in some women it is normal- i had severe morning sickness, and then 2 weeks ago i woke up and havnt had any since.  But it is definately better to be safe than sorry- this applies ESPECIALLY to pregnancy!!  best of luck!!|`|yRihCgxaaa	Go to the doctor asap hun, there could be something wrong, ALWAYS go to the doctor if your not sure about something.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Your body is just adjusting to the hormones. It is normal. Be glad, with my first pregnancy i was sick until the end of month 5.   A miscarriage is not symptomized by loss of pregnancy symptoms. If you bleed or clot then you need to worry.     Mom is right.|`|nzgZR6onaa	With my first pregnancy I had morning sickness so bad it was like I had the horrific flu for the first three months.But just as quick as it came it left and I was told it usually only last for the first three months most the time.Hey be glad you don't feel ill anymore.|`|6XR6ajTraa	Your mum is right, it's normal, and it's from hormones. Your over the first yuck pregnant stage, congratulations on your pregnancy.|`|hi9SYnrraa	i was on meds cuz my morning sickness was so bad, literally overnight it was gone when the first day of the 2nd tri started.boobs felt better too.its normal

How do you know what the pavements will be like tomorrow? If they get gritted and salted today, they'll be perfectly safe.    Like someone else said, is there nobody who walks or drives past your house who could help you out? No bus? You can't drop hubby at work so you have the car? You should be looking for solutions so he doesn't have to skip school, not excuses as to why skipping school is okay.|`|Et5ffAMGaa	def keep them home. whats a few days when its like this??     hes 4 n half dont stress|`|x0flaLfUaa	Yes you can, call the office and tell them. It is a legitimate reason. Why risk an accident.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Does no other mother pass your house and could take your eldest in for you?    You are obliged to take your children to school, but not at the expense of safety.    Could your husband not get a lift with a colleague?  After all, the safety of the three of you should be very important to him, then you could have the car, problem solved!|`|d1ea9b45baf858c2cb1e39e73587f763aa	personalli i would keep them home and if the school has an issue with it i'd tell them to come pick them up.  it could be potentially dangerous to your unborn baby and you'd never forgive your self if you tripped or fell over .|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	You're the parent. If you feel it's not safe to take him to school due to bad weather, don't take him. I would just call the school and let them know that he won't be there.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Yes ..stay home. I broke a tandum buggy trying to get to school one year...I only live 5 mins away but my lane is untreated and so was deep snow and ruts..I called the school and said I can't get my ekdest to school ..it was fine :)|`|qDLT1eh6aa	You could always just tell school he is unwell if you are worried about their reaction.  It wouldn't hurt to tell a white lie just this once.|`|8dhe15MUaa	if i was you i stay at home you can not push baby in snow and ice|`|69DjSUVAaa	I would keep them at home, then if the school say anything just explain to them what you have said to us.    xx|`|3qLIRorjaa	It's up to you but you can't use the weather as an excuse if the school is open.    Your child will be marked as absent on the days you keep him off.
uP08b6K4aa	Ignore their behaviour, you were adult in this situation and offered an apology, the least she could've done was thanked you for that alone!

Don't worry hun, it'll all come good x|`|EEpBrsSnaa	WHAT a *****!!!    You did exactly the right thing, I would have snatched the card back out of hand if she had reacted like that to me!

Urgh at playground mummies.|`|CPXxN3qzaa	theres not much you can do right now... you've done everything you can do but there choosing to blank you ... they'll come around eventually and realise that what happened couldn't have been avoided and if they dont.. well then that's there problem x|`|QnJvJ67uaa	What is it about the playground that reduces some mums to 12 years old again lol.

It isn't as if you just ignored it. Plus, she was the one who didn't put any contact details down - with any party, out of those who accepted the invite, there is often one or two who cannot make it in the event due to circumstances. If there is no contact details, then she really cannot complain.    She is just being childish. If it were me, I just wouldn't bother about her.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Thats pathetic.

AA11763588	I used it 1 day before my missed period and it said positive. Then I went to the DR and they said the same thing.|`|1CryEnb3aa	YOu are more likely to false negative than a false positive.  How long did the tests sit out?  You should read then immediately.  Do not let them sit out past 10 min or you can get an evaporation line making a false positive.  I hope you do get your BFP!  Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	First Response is NOTORIOUS for giving false positives so I've never used them. Try using Answer early pregnancy test and see what that says. I believe the Equate tests need more of the hormone to detect pregnancy so that may be why that gave a negative. I hope things turn out the way you two want!|`|zsrnhstUaa	i took 3 walmart brands,all were negative.I really thought i was pregnant so i took first response,was positive.Went to a OB and yup i sure was pregnant.I am now 10 weeks|`|OJFz0LBZaa	i used it and got a positive 4 days before my period was due, when your g/f got the negative did she use 1st morning urine because if not your urine is less affective through out the day as the hcg levels will be lower and may not be detected|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i tested a week b4 my missed period and got a positive.  i am now just over 4 months pregnant.  best of luck, and congrats,  it is uncommon to get a false positive- i think you r safe  with 2!!|`|SlhEgGl2aa	I TESTED 3 DAYS BEFORE I WAS DUE A PERIOD AND IT CAME OUT POSITIVE ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH BOTH PREGNANCIES  BUT EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT THE HORMONE HAS TO BE PRESENT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.....

rIOD8tgvaa	It only takes one of those squiggles to work.  You may have to try again.  If they fertilize for you and implant numerous eggs one should take.  Make sure they are not missing an issue with your wife. Could she have a luteal phase defect.  You have to be careful thinking one person is responsible for no pregnancy.  Often it is both.  Has she tried clomid or fertility drugs to increase the chances of pregnancy?  Also, an old remedy...cough medicine with the only ingredient being the long G word.  Have your wife take it during ovulation to liquefy her mucus.  It works.  It makes it easier for the sperm to travel where they need to go.  Take a break right now.  It is emotionally draining.
hVuIySZ9aa	ey everybody needs help (even i with my 3 kids coz sometimes they really can be a handful),specially if you're trying to work out on how to be both the person that you want to be & the mum you think they deserve.but don't take too long to figure it out,or soon it will become a truly selfish thing coz that can be interpreted as escapism.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	It's a bit selfish yes.  How do you explain to your kids why you need to leave them with someone else, because Mommy doesn't know who she is?  They aren't going to understand that.  Maybe you could arrange for a babysitter a few hours a week, maybe a weekend here and there and take that time for quiet introspection.  It's not selfish to want to better yourself, but many a woman has done that with children.|`|AA11024148	a bad person  a bad mother  a bad daughter  a bad wife  a bad granddaughter  a bad cousin|`|t1fx6kXcaa	FIrst and foremost you are a mother and have a responsibility to your children. You can be a mother, a good, loving, nurturing, responsible mother and still pursue your own goals. Finding "who you are" is really a load of BS. Everyone has doubts about themselves, about what they have accomplished and what their future will be. But you have the most important job there is. Motherhood. You need to be selfless. You need to raise your children. You better yourself as a mother by doing more with your children, being more nurturing and loving and  being a good role model for them. You can do all of this whilst gaining an education, working towards a career, having interests and having a fulfilling life.|`|jRNexOtWaa	It's deffo not selfish. When you have kids more time is spent on them, but you still need 'me time'|`|hi9SYnrraa	its very selfish.right now you are a mother. maybe you need some time during the day alone, but to abandon your children will only emotionally devastate them and inhibit their growth into adults|`|c2YcBbXyaa	you're a mom...that's who you are and it's not about you anymore, it's about your kids, they're your responsibility, not your family's.....|`|kXbpzGRraa	actually  you have to take care of your kids but you have to have time for yourself too.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I've found you, your right there.     You can't palm your children off, they need you. How old are they? If they're teens, maybe, but just little kids then no!!  Why don't you take a couple of hours a week to get me-time?  After they've gone to bed watch a movie you've wanted to watch for ages or something.  Maybe ask parents or a sitter for just a couple of hours a week to get coffee with friends or something, but nothing longer than a day, a sleep over and a couple of hours the next day. That's what I would do when I was younger and all I wanted was to go home to my mum!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	u wont be a gr8 mother until u sort yourself out! your children will benefit in the long run|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	It's very selfish if you want them to take them for more than a few days. I can't tell you who you were, but I can tell you who you are and will be: A mother. Which means that finding yourself should take a backseat to caring for your kids. You have no idea how long it will take to "find yourself" which is unfair to your kids AND whoever keeps them for you.      Usually "finding yourself" is a cop out for "I don't want to deal anymore, so I'm taking an undisclosed amount of me time."
2N4j1ficaa	No. Echogenic cardiac foci are not an unusual or abnormal finding in an echocardiography of the heart. In fact, up to 7.4% of unborn children have echogenic cardiac foci when the mother is in the second trimester (months 3 to 6). The vast majority of children with echogenic cardiac foci are born normal. This is especially the case for the children of mothers who are under 35 years of age. Only rarely are echogenic cardiac foci associated with birth defects.     It has been suggested that the presence of echogenic cardiac foci is associated with a greater risk of the child having Down syndrome. Down's syndrome is an abnormality that is present from birth that results in mental impairments and a characteristic physical appearance (small facial features, large tongue that sticks out, a flat back area of the head, and hands that are short and broad).     There is conflicting evidence, however, as to whether echogenic foci in the heart lead to an increased risk for Down syndrome. That is, some studies have found that there is no increased risk whereas others have found that unborn children with echogenic cardiac foci are four times more likely to have Down syndrome. Many studies suggest that unborn children with echogenic cardiac foci have about a 1% chance of having Down syndrome.     my oldest daughter had this and my gran son  neather went on to have down syndrome  and both resulting in  heart mummer daughter +gran son both a ok  so would egnore inless it shows up as hole in deataled scan so will down syndrome    and  choroid plexus cysts  is  asoseated with down syndrome sorry to say more t18 or edwards syndrome      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid_ple...|`|K0iskcyHaa	Hi sweetie, firstly sorry you are going thro this, I'm 18 wks and I had the blood tests as I'm 39 and it came back as 1 in 230 risk, we went private and had the marker scan and none showed up so they put our risk as 1 in 690. I was undecided about the amnio as I have had a previous miscarriage but they say the risk is less than 1 in 200 for a miscarriage, If I were you as the odds on the baby having something "wrong" are higher I'd have the amnio, It's the only way of knowing for certain and even tho you wouldn't terminate it would help you prepare, If the baby does have downs you could see if you could meet some parents with a downs baby so you know what to expect, you could get all your support networks in place now. Having said that, the chances of 1 in100 are very low, my midwife said look at it as if you were backing a horse! You gotta think all the positives too, I hope some of this might have helped, Take care xxxxx Di|`|79eRDIbXaa	I Haven't been in this situation but I just want to wish you lots of luck for the rest of your pregnancy.  And I no this wont help at all but just remember that there is still 99 out of 100 chance you baby may be fine.xx|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hey huni,     I am sorry to hear, 1 in 100... would still scare the hell out of me, but try and thing there is a 99% chance you are going to have a perfectly healthy baby.    If you are sure you won't terminate the pregnancy (I said the same too)   then I understand you don't want an amniocentisis done. As that has a risk of miscarriage - Truly awful experiece I know. I just lost my baby girl at 19 weeks - So although you are having a hard time at the moment, please try and look on the brighter side - 99 chances that your baby will be fine, and you still have your lovely little baby :)    I am sorry I can not offer you more advice, however the hospital may have offered you some councelling, they can put you in touch with others going through or that have been through the same.    Good luck xx
AA11503426	So this 'simple' adult uses words like 'obstreperous' does he? Doesn't sound too simple to me.    You seem to have a very good knowledge of what goes on in this child's family, how do you know what the child says to his relatives? Were you there?    As long as the child is getting an education, and can read properly themselves, and is being fed, kept warm and safe and sent to school, it sounds like the family may be a little odd, but they aren't doing anything against the law.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	That is not abuse and it's not neglect. The parents simply can't read. Parents all over the world can't read and their children are still healthy and happy.    Stay out of it.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	other then the lashing out, no this in not abuse.. just because a parent is not social does not make them a bad parent.. mine almost never left the house..      If the child is smart enough to think that someone, even a parent is 'simple; then maybe the child themself needs to find outside activity's ..|`|547Ln6rNaa	"When the child mentions to the father's relatives he thinks the father might be simple...."    omg the "child" tells relatives that he thinks his father is simple? he's lucky they are only verbally telling him off, I can't imagine what might happen if he had a different father, mine perhaps...or pretty much anyone elses.    They could do a better job of raising him. If this is actually you, please don't go around telling people your father is simple, that's just rude and disrespectful.
AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.    So yes, there is a chance you are pregnant, but you won't know till you miss your next period.|`|1CryEnb3aa	You should be a little worried.  Unprotected sex as you know can give you more than one positive test.  You will have to wait and see if your period shows up or not.  Please get checked for STD's as well.  You don't want to have something go undiagnosed.  Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You definetly could have gotten pregnant.

If not, then you're fine.|`|4UQegWk0aa	You should always be worried when you have unprotected sex. You can get pregnant at any point in your cycle.

Hu9yquP4aa	No, the pill is useless if you try to use it to stop pregnancy. There is a chance you could be pregnant if you were ovulating. Unfortunately, when you stop the pill mid cycle, your body immediately gets confused and your ovaries tend to drop and egg. That is why most women who skip or miss a pill get pregnant.     Your chances are incredibly high.|`|hi9SYnrraa	taking bc after the fact doesn't matter.they have to build up in your system.if it happened then it happened. bc pills aren't going to help after the fact|`|CrnGAeC0aa	i have similar situation like this  before and i was not pregnant. i guess i was lucky then. But my cycle  was delayed then.|`|nzgZR6onaa	Once the egg and sperm meet the pill won't do a thing to stop anything that has already taken place And it also depends on what part of your cycle you are in and if you are ovulating whether you get pregnant.But I certainly would not continue taking the pills for it could harm the baby if you are pregnant.

Q9GFKzg3aa	my days was completely horrible    today i made a poster for a science project and it fell on the floor of my bus and people stepped all over it and ruined it.    1st period i had a social studies test then 2nd period music test a RAEF test when they randomly chose kids from each cluster to see how well the school teaches their kids which was 90 minutes. This was also math my worst subject.    Then because i couldn't go to my flute lessons for band because of the social studies test and i was only able to take the music test then leave so i couldn't enjoy my time in the band room. i love music so it was really sad missing those.    lastly its snowing hear in connecticut and i hate snow with a burning passion.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Ugghh...

I went to the bank to deposit my pay & then to the post office to mail some stuff. Went to eat lunch with my mom & went to Costco for lots of cold medicine lol     Then to a music store to see what electric guitars they had, but I didn't really like them all too much so I went to Best Buy to see what they had. I bought my boyfriend a gorgeous Epiphone G-400 for Valentines day along with a case of course. I was happy because they gave me a $50 gift card for buying a guitar over like $400 or something like that.    Then I cam home to a very happy dog who I took for a walk & then went to sleep because I was super exhausted from being sick & doing all that running around.    I just woke up like 2 hours ago or so & I went online to order some guitar stuff to go with my bf's new guitar. Stuff like a stand & picks & strings & all that.    And now I am here :)    |`|0r3ceXnjaa	It's been OK. I've got a terrible cold so I stayed at home today.

Take him to the ER immediately, if he was injured then behavior changes that is a sign something is wrong.|`|sVkSrUqNaa	htf did he get hit in the chest|`|t1fx6kXcaa	You can safely drink a couple or even a few cups of coffee whilst breast feeding. If you're consuming a lot of coffee, more than 4 cups, than the caffeine may affect the baby. But you ned to be more concerned about the fact that your newborn sustained an injury to his chest! Being hit in the chest at any age is dangerous let alone in a two week old baby. The fact that he is having breathing difficulties is a serious sign that something is wrong. How was he hit in the chest? How hard was he hit? I'd suggest immediate medical attention for him.  Edit: I don't think you're a bad mother but breathing difficulties in an infant is not normal and the fact that it happened after being hit (jumped on) in the chest is a worry. The tiny amount of caffeine in your breastmilk, after drinking one coffee, would not affect your baby.  Good luck.
Hu9yquP4aa	If your period is late, even by your standards, take a test. It will tell you or call your doctor and get bloodwork.|`|oDjtE9ZUaa	id say your pregnant. but be careful will the spots of blood, they usually mean signs of miscarriage but not usually this early on in pregnancy. check with your doctor for your own peace of mind.  hope you have luck conceiving! x|`|XyRzSzjtaa	im in the same boat as you im deperate ttc, im not late yet but ive had heart burn and period pains but im due on now but its only a little blood, but i carnt take a test as i dont want to be disapointed again. take another test in a few days. gud luk, lots of baby dust to you hun.
reO9Dgmsaa	It's not a good idea if he's sick, but go ahead and see what they say.  Because you choose to vaccinate, you need to keep in mind that they lower the immune system anyway; that's why you shouldn't be sick when you receive the jabs.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	take him the nurse will decide i know they dont like doing them when they have a temp but sometimes the sniffles is ok  let the nurse decide x x|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	It shouldn't effect anything. They will probably just suggest you watch him a little more closely since it's common for babies to get a low-grade fever after vaccinations.|`|BPoZPvGoaa	if it is Vaccination you are talking about.  no, try not to push their little body while they are still sick.  In my opinion, kids under 1 year old should not vaccinate because they have the environment to coup with outside of their mother's womb.|`|heoBp6Taaa	Every one's right the nurse or doctor will decide if your bub is well enough to be vaccinated. In Australia your baby see's the doctor before the nurse gives the vaccine to check growth and every thing else any way.    Please don't listen to people advising not to vaccinate your child, the pro's out way the con's by far.
9tcv3TiWaa	How do you know that you are fertile?  Did you have a fertility test done?  Just because you think you are doesn't mean you are, and it is the same for her.  yes she could easily be pregnant and then again she might not.   There is no way to find out unless she takes a pregnancy test.|`|1r05fktRaa	50/50|`|X5F7h3l4aa	simple pay $14.50 for a pregnancy test.  tell her to wake up to herself and take it.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Yeah, well as a woman I will say this. When a woman won't pee on a stick, there is a general reason. She is probably in denial and afraid to do it.  I also would NEVER trust a person that say... its safe. It usually isn't.     Dude, buy a test, tell her pee on it.|`|nzgZR6onaa	I  had five children and conceived at all different times in my cycles. So nothing is etched in stone. They say a women usually gets pregnant two weeks after her period that's when she is most likely ovulating. But with two of my pregnancies I conceived a day after my period ended.The only sure way of not getting pregnant is using good birth  control. Now the only way to know if your girlfriend is pregnant is a pregnancy test.I hope she gives in and gets one so you can get your answer.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	If you are counting on what is called the "rythim method", the safest times are right after and right before a menstrual cycle.  The most fertile days are the 12th to 14th day into her cycle.  I don't want to freak you out.  Getting pregnant is actually not that easy.  It always amazes me so many teens get pregnant because the window is really pretty small.  Relax, spend the $15 and go to Walgreens or Longs and buy a test.  And if she's not pregnant, you'll have learned something right?  Not only the pregnancy issue, but STDs are a consideration, even if she's a Church going angel...it happens.  I re-read your question, I am not a health professional.  If this girl is seeing your serious concern and not interested enough to be your partner or friend in this issue, that's very telling.  Lesson No. 2...you feel it too right?  THis is not a match, in my completely out-of-line opinion.    If this girl has a really young mother and older sisters with babies on their hips, I would be very concerned, she could kind of want a baby.  And poor you, a moral, upright, responsible guy will have to deal.  Lets not get ahead of ourselves if you have to go out of character and pretty much demand she take the test, you'll sleep much better.  The more I think about the more I'm getting mad at her.  Silly huh?    It's God's will, tell yourself that, if she is pregnant you have a gift, and you can still accomplish your goals, but you can NEVER not be responsible.  A baby needs love and nurturing to grow up secure and be and become special person.  Feeling insecure because she feels she's unloveable would totally suck.  Happens too much...she would be ripe to involve herself with the first person, evil or not, who gave her some loving attention.  Soooo not cool.    She's not pregnant ok?  Relax.  If she is relax again....swell up with your daddy responsibility and be your wonderful self.  Lose the Mom as a partner though, my disgustingly uninformed opinion only.|`|b7fRwEmjaa	some can get lucky and some cant    with you it just depends on luck  i guess itsthe most likely thats shes pregnant now than if u had done it earlier or later.    but people try for years to get pregnant.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Is her period already late? If so, have her get a pregnancy test (front her the 10-15 bucks if she is short) and make sure she knows to take it in the morning. Then you will know for certain. I know you realize that you should have safe sex - but just do it next time. Have her get on the pill (www.plannedparenthood.com - she can go there and it is a very minimal cost, and they don't need parental permission).  It is quite possible that she is pregnant.
FUNhlpiqaa	If the doctor "knocked it out," as you said, it would have been pretty painful for your wife.  As you dilate, it very normal to have bloody show.  I was passing some, much like your wife, weeks before I actually went into labor.|`|UxrSFPoPaa	Losing Your Mucous Plug    What is the mucous plug?  The mucous plug is a collection of cervical mucus that seals the opening of the cervix. It keeps bacteria and infection from entering into the cervix, providing a protective barrier for the developing baby.    What does the mucous plug look like?  Some women describe the mucous plug as looking more like the mucous in your nose. It may look like a thick glob of stringy mucous, thicker than what you would see with normal vaginal secretions. If you are close to going into labor you may see pink, brown, or red blood around the edges of the mucous plug. This is called the bloody show.    When do you lose your mucous plug?  Some women will lose their mucous plug or part of their mucous plug weeks before they go into labor. Losing your mucous plug does not always mean labor will begin shortly. Keep in mind that even if a woman has begun to dilate, it may be weeks before she actually goes into labor. However, if you notice blood tinged mucous before your thirty-sixth week of pregnancy, notify your doctor right away. As your body prepares for labor your cervix will begin to dilate and thin. As your cervix opens up, your mucous plug may fall out. Losing your mucous plug is a good sign that labor is on its way. Though, it could be days or even weeks after you lose your mucous plug before labor actually starts. Many women do not lose their mucous plug at one time; instead, they lose it more gradually. They may notice an increase in vaginal secretions weeks before they go into labor.     Should I call my doctor if I lose my mucous plug?  If you are full term and have lost your mucous plug, there is usually no need to call your doctor. You may lose your mucous plug weeks before labor starts. If you notice regular, timeable contractions after losing your mucous plug, follow your doctors protocol for proceeding to Labor and Delivery. If you have a history of preterm labor and you suspect you have lost your mucous plug, call your doctor right away. If you notice blood tinged mucous and are earlier than thirty-six weeks call your doctor immediately. Moreover, you should also call your doctor if you have sudden bright red bleeding. Bleeding can be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption.|`|Um3qrVrqaa	I would love to answer your question but that fact that you said "yummmmmmmmm" after bloody show makes me want to throw up. Are you serious?|`|NqMIFEITaa	The dr. didn't "knocked out" the plug, the body does that on it's own.  She may have scraped her membranes to help the process along.  This is all normal.  Tell your wife if she wants to get this show on the road start doing a lot of walking, a lot of sex, caster oil, the whole works, sounds like this baby is coming soon.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	i don't understand why in the WORLD would you say her dr. 'fisted' her?!?!?!    if that was true, he or she would be in jail...and since its probably (hopefully) a gross exaggeration...ewwww (shivers)...please don't use that expression again - EVER!    yes, its probably from her check up and you can lose your mucous plug at ANY time and over and over - it will grow back.    add: i knew you were just kidding...but us pregnant women don't find that type of humor funny at the moment. lol. :) best not to joke about that quadrant right now. there's too much going on.     p.s. if you think they are up in her business now...wait till the baby is born..your gonna pass out.
Trv9e6n3aa	It is extremely rare for someone to get pregnant during their period. Your body is getting rid of the unfertilized egg and shedding the uterine lining. So there won't even be an egg out to get fertilized because it's too soon in your cycle for that.|`|4UvUN0Sqaa	It is possible to conceive when on your period. However it is unlikely. There is still a chance. I would say a 5% out of 100%.

Other symptoms of pregnancy can include tender breasts, nausea and tiredness but not everybody experiences these. If you suspect you are pregnant you should take a pregnancy test. This can be done at a clinic, or you can buy a home testing kit from most major supermarkets and pharmacies. If you use a home test kit it is important to get the result confirmed by your doctor or healthcare professional at a local clinic.

First of all..this is a great problem.  and speaking from a girl's point of view.  I can tell you that we are confusing.  She still likes you, for one thing.  And I'm guessing that she thought that once you two broke up you would still have feelings for her, and it would take you time to get over her. Once she saw you with your new girl, she was jealous, and probably didn't want other people to think that you were going out with another girl before she was going out with another guy. Therefore, she asked your friend because she (has issues) or she just liked him in the first place, and she wanted people to know that she can go out with someone else.  confusing right?|`|b52c5bfde96b1781f152be9374c7fe3baa	she very jealous because you move on be careful because if she is stalking you that could be dangerous.  good luck! stay away from girl like that.|`|AA11928442	Yeah one she is mostly jealous and two she probably cant believe that  your with another girl already after only been broken up for two days.

AA11758444	I have been  on the pill for a long time now. Everyone is different with their flow on or off the pill. It is normal for a girl to have her period for only like 2-3 days being on the pill especially if this is her first time and first pack,expect things to be out of the ordinary for the first few months till her body adjusts to the changes. If she looses a pill TRY TO FIND IT even one missed pill could mess up her cycle. For me after I finish the "active pills" 4 days later I get my period.

School is a big part of your life and if he goes to college in a year or two things might change but you should always know that you can count on each other. If you can do that you can survive in your relationship. However, if you relationship isn't meant to be you should break up because it is not worth it to be miserable especially at such a young age. You have so many options. I love my boyfriend and he is now my fiance. I am in college and sometimes it is difficult but I love him and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything or that I have missed out on anything like many people think.

AA12381247	http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom...     Early signs and symptoms of pregnancy: Things you might notice before you start prenatal care  Could you be pregnant? Before you test, read this list of classic clues.   Are you pregnant? The proof is really in the pregnancy test. But you may suspect  or hope  that you're expecting, even before you miss a period, if you experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms of pregnancy. These early clues may begin in the first few weeks after conception.  Tender, swollen breasts or nipples  One of the first physical changes of pregnancy is a change in the way your breasts feel. They may feel tender, tingly or sore. Or they may feel fuller and heavier. As early as two weeks after conception, your breasts start to grow and change in preparation for producing milk. The primary cause of these changes is increased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Changes in your breasts are often most dramatic when you're pregnant for the first time.  Fatigue  Many women feel wiped out during pregnancy, especially in the early stages. This may be nature's way of persuading moms-to-be to take extra naps, in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead. But there's also a physical reason for fatigue.  During the early weeks of pregnancy, your body is working hard  pumping out hormones and producing more blood to carry nutrients to your baby. To accommodate this increased blood flow, your heart pumps harder and faster. Plus, progesterone is a natural central nervous system depressant, so high levels of this hormone may make you sleepy. In addition, the possibility of pregnancy can bring about a range of feelings and concerns that may sap your energy and disturb sleep.  Slight bleeding or cramping  Some women experience a small amount of spotting or bleeding very early in pregnancy, about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg first attaches to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a usual period and doesn't last long.  Many women also experience cramping very early in pregnancy as the uterus begins to enlarge. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.  Nausea with or without vomiting  Morning sickness is one of the telltale signs of early pregnancy. Most women feel some sickness around four to eight weeks of pregnancy, but the queasiness can begin as early as two weeks after conception.  Although nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is commonly called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. It seems to stem from the rapidly rising levels of estrogen produced by the placenta and the fetus. These hormones cause the stomach to empty somewhat more slowly, which could be part of the problem. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so a variety of odors  such as foods cooking, coffee, perfume or cigarette smoke  can trigger nausea.  Food aversions or cravings  Turning up your nose at certain foods is often the first hint that you're pregnant. Even the smell of some foods may cause a wave of nausea in early pregnancy. One study suggests that pregnant women experience a unique aversion to coffee in the early weeks of pregnancy. Meat, dairy products and spicy foods are other common objects of repulsion.  Food cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes. Pregnant women typically find that their food tastes change somewhat, especially in the first trimester, when hormones have the strongest impact.  Frequent urination  Many pregnant women find themselves running to the bathroom more often than usual. During the first trimester of pregnancy, this is caused by the enlarging uterus pushing on your bladder.  Headaches  If you're pregnant, you may be troubled by frequent, mild headaches. Early in pregnancy, headaches may be the result of increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes.  Constipation  Constipation is another common early indication of pregnancy. An increase in progesterone causes digestion to slow down, so food passes more slowly through the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to constipation.  Mood swings  You're a no-nonsense kind of woman  so what's with this crying over Hallmark commercials? The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Swings in your mood, from bliss to deep gloom, also are common, especially in the first trimester.  Faintness and dizziness  It's common for pregnant women to be lightheaded or dizzy. These sensations usually result from circulatory changes as your blood vessels dilate and your blood pressure drops. Early in pregnancy, faint feelings may also be triggered by low blood sugar.  Raised basal body temperature  Your basal body temperature (BBT) is your oral temperature when you first wake up in the morning. This temperature spikes slightly soon after ovulation and remains at that level until your next period. If you've been charting your BBT to determine when you ovulate, its continued elevation for more than two weeks may mean you're pregnant. In fact, BBT stays elevated throughout your pregnancy.  Are you really pregnant?  Unfortunately, these signs and symptoms aren't unique to pregnancy. Some can indicate that you're getting sick or that your period is about to start. And, conversely, you can be pregnant without ever experiencing these symptoms.  Still, if you notice any of the tip-offs on this list, make plans to take a home pregnancy test, especially if you're not keeping track of your menstrual cycle or if it varies widely from one month to the next.

Gravidez mal planejada hoje s trs conseqncias trgicas e irremediveis.|`|bca5dc138320efe2afc13e643be062e7aa	Normal n?o  a palavra certa para o que voc quer dizer. Hoje em dia  comum meninas engravidarem durante a adolescncia, pois as meninas est?o come?ando a vida sexual a partir dos 11 anos,  triste, mas  real. Isso muitas vezes acontece por falta de dilogo, por falta de estrutura emocional, por acidente, falta de informa??o ou at mesmo de forma intencional.  Vocs s?o irm?os, mas isso n?o  motivo para pensarem da mesma forma, pois, as pessoas n?o s?o iguais. N?o sei como foi a histria, mas agora seria bom fazer com que sua irm? percebesse como  a responsabilidade de ter um filho. Vocs, como famlia, v?o tentar ajudar, mas n?o podem assumir o papel que pertence a ela. Ela  uma crian?a que agora tem que cuidar de outra crian?ae precisa sentir na pele que ter um filho  perder a liberdade, passar a viver para duas pessoas e n?o mais para si mesmo, acordar de madrugada para satisfazer a crian?a, batalhar para dar uma vida descente  esta vida que foi trazida ao mundo e dar muito amor  crian?a. Se ela n?o sentir isso na pele, ela pode logo aparecer com outra crian?a. H muitas pessoas que eu conhe?o que foram m?es muito cedo e jogaram a crian?a para os pais cuidarem, isso  errado. Por sua irm? ser ca?ula, provavelmente seus pais v?o querer ajudar em tudo, mas seria bom vocs tentarem fazer com que eles enxerguem isso que acabei de falar.  A adolescncia da sua irm? acabou, n?o posso te dizer se isso  normal, mas posso te dizer que n?o  bom para ela, mas agora que aconteceu, ela precisa de apoio, mas tambm precisa de direcionamento, pois, querendo ou n?o, ter que amadurecer.|`|40c1bb2227a0c5d265fd50caa41280b7aa	NUNCA!!!!!!  a "menina" ate pouco tempo ainda brincava de boneca, agora tem um "boneco" novo e que da mais trabalho pra cuidar.

f845e9674faa8bfca7c4826cb98f5d2baa	Acredito que vc n?o esteja grvida. Mais aconselho a fazer o exame com 10 a 15 dias de atraso, para evitar um falso negativo.    Deus sabe de todas as coisas, por isso se vc estiver grvida,n?o se preocupe que ele ir te ajudar.

Seu caso  meio preocupante, fa?a um teste de farmcia e marque uma consulta com seu ginecologista, seis dias  muito tempo para a menstrua??o atrasar, embora a sua seja desregulada. E essa histria que anticoncepcional d ansiedade e engorda, varia de anticoncepcional, existem dois, o Yasmin e o Siblima que n? ocausam esse tipo de problema, pergunte ao seu mdico se pode tomar um deles.

TE comento esto porque si el USG lo haces antes es probable que te lo repitan de nuevo a las 8 semanas porque hay que valorar otras cosas.  Como siempre, si estas esperando embarazarte o quieres estar embarazada, te recomiendo vayas con tu Mdico Tratante para un adecuado control del embarazo.

Debido a que la ovulacin ocurre alrededor de las 2 semanas posteriores al inicio de la menstruacin y que la fertilizacin se produce poco despus de la ovulacin, el embrin es unas 2 semanas ms joven que el nmero de semanas que se asignan al embarazo. Por ejemplo, en una mujer que est embarazada de 4 semanas el embrin tiene 2 semanas. Si el ciclo menstrual es irregular, la diferencia real puede ser superior o inferior a las 2 semanas. Desde un punto de vista prctico, cuando la menstruacin se retrasa 2 semanas, se considera que la gestacin es de 6 semanas.    El embarazo dura un promedio de 266 das (38 semanas) desde el da de la concepcin o 280 das (40 semanas) desde el primer da de la ltima menstruacin. La fecha aproximada del parto se calcula restando 3 meses desde el primer da del ltimo perodo menstrual y agregndole 1 a?o y 7 das. Slo el 10 por ciento o menos de las mujeres embarazadas dan a luz en la fecha estimada, pero el 50 por ciento lo hace con un margen de 1 semana y casi el 90 por ciento 2 semanas (antes o despus de fecha). Por consiguiente, un parto que se produzca 2 semanas antes o despus de la fecha calculada se considera normal.    El embarazo se divide en tres perodos de 3 meses, llamados primer trimestre (semanas 1 a 12), segundo trimestre (semanas 13 a 24) y tercer trimestre (semana 25 hasta el parto).|`|d0afdfa3dbe8747a1eec5e81e0fedbb7aa	280 DIAS CONTANDO A PARTIR DEL PRIMER DIA DE TU ULTIMA MENSTRUACION.

Best of Luck to you!|`|baa5bb3092444448a0b9a919a8f0b603aa	Clomid is a fertility drug. It helps your body ovulate more eggs than usual so yes, it will make you moody and possibly give you headaches. If you do get headaches, you should notify your physician.|`|AA11903378	Yes...I remember those days.  It's hormones luv, just hang in there and you'll be OK when you're done.

First ones don't always take long.  It just depends on the details of the labor, and how the baby progresses. Everyone is different.   Do NOT take demerol.  It makes you puke.  Don't let them give you any pain medication except for an epidural because they WILL make you sick.  An epidural is just a dull pain while they are putting it in, and after that, it's like heaven.  You will feel SO good, and labor will be a breeze.|`|0be6ebc477fbd4757721e109224d558baa	My first labor was not long. Went into labor at 7:30 p.m. and had the babies at 9:25 and 9:45 pm. (Yes, twins)...  No epi, no meds... all natural. Go ahead, I'll wait while you cringe (kidding)- it wasn't as bad as I thought, but it was scary. It'll be over before you know it and it will all be worth it. Congrats!!|`|da30f0e2ca932c8b2b71fe38507f4fdbaa	It depends on your body if it takes a long time or not. Some first timers go pretty fast, other, not. I had long labors with both of my children. If you walk a lot, that can reduce your time in labor. I didn't get an epidural, but I did get an entrathecal, which is also give in the spine. It hurt a little, but honestly, it was nothing compared to the labor pains, so I was very greatful just to be getting it Don't worry abour labor, it is a natural thing. Once you look at that baby, the pain will be gone!|`|97c21a356ed4e49528727da8894ec519aa	My first and only baby was actually a very short labor. I was in labor for 5 hours and delivered in 45 minutes.  Every women is different.  When you get your epideral it is uncomftorble but by no means is it painful. They locally numb you before putting the tube in. Trust me get the epideral, your in so much pain that it will be a huge relief!|`|4bc55206bcbae33b97bf4889eea5b949aa	During the birth of a woman's first child, the process is usually prolonged because it is the first time that certain muscles have had to work in the way they were created to work.  Performing kegal exercises can help prevent an episiotomy and lessen pushing time, by exercising the necessary muscle groups.  It is also the first time that the accordion-like vagina has had to stretch open to accomodate such a large package.    If you recieve a spinal block or an epidural, you should not feel much pain through the labor process.  That is the point of these procedures.  However, during the pushing stage of your labor, you will probably feel lots of pressure and/or burning as the baby's head crowns and is delivered.  Also, when the medication is administered, a single shot, to numb your back before the insertion of the tube, is given.  This stings a bit.  Also, please remember that your body is different than all others.  Demerol may make SOME people vomit, but not ALL, or else they wouldn't still give it.    Be prepared, however, for lots of discomfort and pain as your body heals from this process.  And as difficult as it may sound, the day after you deliver, send your little angel to the nursery for a bit, or leave him/her with dad, and go for a walk around the hospital.  This will seem impossible after delivery, but after you force yourself to walk, you'll be amazed at the natural pain relief responses of your body.  You'll feel so much better after you move around!|`|99ec41ebe4ec6d599668d4f19019f494aa	i was 21 when i gave birth to my first son....i went into labor at 8:00am, i went to the hospital and by 9:00 my contractions started feeling like cramping when you get your period. I don't remember what time it was but i waited until my contractions were more severe to get anistesia through an I.V. after that i didn't feel a thing. This may sound gross, but my son kept going to the bathroom while he was still in the womb, so they had to keep flushing me out. Or else my son could of died..didn't feel that either... When they told me it was time they gave me my Epidural and i didn't feel that either. i was more self conscious that the nurse had 2 trainees watching the process. After that i didn't feel anything. 6:00pm rolled around, i know because i was watching the Simpson's on T.V. It was time to start pushing...after the first push i panicked a little bit but regained my composure after looking at my mom who was there...**** it was too late to stop now. Another long hard push and my son was born at 6:42pm. He weighed 9lbs 8oz. and was 21 1/4inches long. After i held him and took all the photos I chowed down on a Taxi burger and Dr. Pepper!! It was the best tasting meal i had! I would say the aftermath of the pregnancy is worse that having the baby. For me it was a piece of cake...Thanks to a lot of Praying!! LOL|`|c42feb76aceaf22103d8434abc26ce57aa	oh yeah, it's a party. haha  i went in for my regular check up and I was 4cm.  I had no pain, was confortable.  I went right into the hospital, they broke my water.  My labor was only about 5 hours long.  I pushed for an hour and a half, and she wsa 8lbs. 6oz.  I only had one shot of nubain for pain.  I was very proud of myself. But, I have a high tolerance for pain too.  A friend of mine just had her baby last week, she had NO pain tolerance.  She had two shots of nubain before she was 4 cm, and had an epideral.  Her new favorite word is epideral she said. haha ...  but she couldn't feel anything.  she kept pushing after he was out!  I think that's the best feeling in the world when you feel that release of them coming into the world.  Just remember that your doctors and nurses are there to keep you as comfortable as possible.  By the way, my second was 10 pounds-vaginal delivery with only 2 shots of nubain. Good luck!!|`|fe46d7b769fe56951787dbf2077476ddaa	Yes it can hurt. But for everyone it's different. Some of my friends were in labor for 24 hours. It seems like when you're given an induced labor things tend to take longer or end up in a c-section. I was going to get induced (start your labor before your due date by breaking your water & giving you pitocen) but I got scared. I'm glad I didn't do it though. Cause my baby came right on time & was healthy. But doctors may tell you that you need an induction for other medical reasons. When I first began labor I hardly noticed because it was just like periods cramps that came at a certain time. The IV they put in my hand sucked cause they couldn't find the vein the first time. So the medicine was in a lil bubble where they missed. That was sore for days. Then when they gave me the pitocen (used to make contractions get closer & faster & help your cervix dialate) it started to hurt like hell. So they gave me a pain releiver in my IV. That made me a little sleepy & giggly. My hubby couldn't help but laugh. They usually give you a catheder too (helps remove your urine). That you won't feel if you got the medications. It's actually quite a relief. Because if you don't feel the pain, you still feel the pressure. Everytime I had a contraction I felt the pressure to urinate. So THANK GOD for the catheder. Then I got the epidural ....the needle to numb it hurt. The epidural just felt like a pressure going down my back. Giving birth didn't hurt as much....really just tiring. I was in labor for 12 hours & it only took 30 minutes to push my baby out. Then when all the medicine goes away you're pretty sore. The IV can get really annoying. I got a 3rd degree tear (when your perineum (the skin between your vagina & anus) tears) going down & a second degree tear going up. Doctors & nurses say if you get a perineal massage (massaging the inside of the perineum) it can lessen or completely reduce the chance of getting a tear. So you should start that in the last month to prepare. Your vagina will be sore for maybe 3-4 weeks. They usually give you pain killers though. If your breastfeeding (like I did) you usually heal faster & your uterus shrinks back really fast. I was scared to give birth.  But it wasn't a horrible experience for me. But remember everyone is different.

Si Mam, el bebecito tiene que beber agua, si bien es cierto que con la leche muchas veces es suficiente, quizas sienta sed, an as si le das el pecho, pero solamente debers darle agua en caso que veas que tiene sed, lo expresar a su manera, tu sabrs notarlo, o que haga mucho calor,o est en un hambiente muy caliente. Ten cuidado en no darle demasiada agua mineral, trata de que sea de mineralizacin baja, porque los minerales y metales que contienen el agua Mineral, sea natural o artificial, no le hacen bien al bebecito, y si utilizas agua del grifo, hiervela mas de 5 minutos, luego la colocas en una botella tambin previamente hervida y esterilizada y la puedes guardar en la nevera un par de das.

Sperm can survive up to 72 hours in the female body. There is another trick to try...after intercourse,while your hips are raised (putting a folded pillow under your hips helps) have an orgasm by masterbation. the orgasm will cause the cervix to dip down into the seminal pool (where the seman is pooled up inside you) and suck up the sperm like a straw giving the sperm a major headstart.  here's a link for info on basal body temp and cervical changes...  http://www.pinelandpress.com/faq/bbt/bbt...|`|10ead7b8e7d76a307156e2aed3f8b98aaa	Relax LOL and enjoy the practise!!!! Do not stress this is the total put off for sperm to meet ovum, believe me!!!!|`|AA10644766	You are aware that to get pregnant you must have sex on a day that your eggs are being released.  Thus it is important to be conscious of ovulation.    After the 3rd day from the day that menses started put a thermometer into your mouth and check your body temperature every morning before you start turning in bed. The best time is at about 4 a.m. Maintain a chart. You will find that on one day the body temperature drops from 1/2 degree to one degree. This is the day that your eggs are being released. If you want to get pregnant this is the day that you must have sex. Tell your husband to ejaculate on his inward thrust so that the sperms will shoot deep inside.    After having sex you must stay in bed for about 30 mins with your knees bent up with a pillow under your buttocks so that the sperms will not pour out - to enable them to travel up.     Get your husband to save his sperms in the testacles for at least 3 days before sex to enable them to mature well to do their job.|`|9d4fb70ede70c409d894d99c20ede628aa	Have you tried temping or using a fertility monitor???  With temping you can't pinpoint ovulation until after it's already happened, but with the fertility monitor it will give you your most fertile days.  If that doesn't work I would maybe get checked out and make sure the sperm count is good and your tubes aren't blocked or something like that.|`|ebd0fc64a7892791c44538903da9aa2aaa	Sex, 24/7 will eventually work.

I'm so sorry you came on, I know you really want to have a baby.  Take a look on webmd there is something that you can click on and put all your period dates in and it tells you when you are ovulating.  My last period was sept 22 bled for 5 days so finished on the wed, the monday after I had a bit of bloody jelly didn't know what it was, we were also trying for a baby, last sat did a test and it was pos, so that was implantation bleeding so as you see everyone ovulates at different times.

"In what may prove to be a breakthrough finding, a team of scientists from Tufts University and Greece have identified a suspected chain reaction detailing exactly how stress hormones and other chemicals wreak havoc on the uterus and fetus. Their report, in the June issue of Endocrinology, may help explain why women miscarry for no obvious medical reasons and why some women have repeated miscarriages..."    http://www.webmd.com/content/article/66/...    But, another site says:    "Stress is also not likely to have caused your miscarriage. There is some evidence that extreme emotional stress may be linked to miscarriage, but as far as general anxiety, remember that most mothers are anxious and worry about their babies, yet the human race is still in existence. Studies linking stress to miscarriage more likely mean the stress of extreme, traumatic life events or continued stress at an extreme level -- not the stress of normal everyday worries."    http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art2...

Implantation bleeding occurs when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterus.    It is usually a pink or brown colour and the spotting lasts for roughly 2 days.    Only about 20% of women will experience implantation bleeding.    Keep a note of the colour of the blood and if it's spotting or heavier and let your doctor know.    Hope this helps.

The excitement or climax, if you do, during sex causes your uterus to contract.  One of the reasons why it is believed that having sex can speed up your labor.  Don't get too excited though, it could be another day or another 2-3 weeks.  I used to feel the same with my first pregnancy at or even before the 38 weeks and I delivered 10 days late.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	This can happen early in pregnacy too. Because of the extra bloodflow to the uterus it contract when you have an orgasm. Good luck to you !

fcf819acf8d46c020c6eb104f2d395bbaa	ok here's my best explanation... how birth control pills work:    women have monthly hormone cycles. at about day 14 (the first day of your period is day one) the woman's hormone levels spike (go from low to high quickly) this spike causes an egg to be released. the egg can live for up to 3 days, then if it isn't fertilized, it dies.   what the pills do is they keep the hormone levels high all month so that the spike doesn't occur and an egg isn't released.  so, no egg, no chance of pregnancy.      so IF your pills are working properly and you take them at the same time every day, it doesn't matter which day you have sex, you shouldn't get pregnant.  BUT keep in mind that the pill is only 99.4% effective, so there is always that chance.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	Those pills that you take to have your period is nothing but iron/dummy pills so yea pregancy is possible|`|3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	Any doc will tell you that you can get pregnant at any time, even on the pill. Most of them will also tell you that it takes a full month for those things to start really kicking in for the protection part. If you just started taking them and are wanting intercourse with someone, use protection.Heck, use one anyway just to be safe.     Bottom line is you can get pregnant at any time. It doesn't matter. Be safe and strong. Good luck hun!|`|AA11843348	You normally ovulate 10-14 days after the start of your period. However, It is possible to ovulate very close to your period, I know because I got pregnant the day after my period stopped (whoops)  As long as you are not having your period there is a possibility of getting pregnant. The hormone that makes you have your period also prevents you from ovulating. It is important to take the pills as prescribed because you need a certain level of the artificial hormone in your bloodstream to prevent ovulation.  Im not a professional, so if I were you Id call a nurse hotline, or planned parenthood, or make dr appt to talk about the specifics.|`|93d057ccca18833593159e17c8f1d7a3aa	They are dummy pills. The idea is that a woman will ovulate perfectly so will be past that come period time, and sex and blood is icky so why do it?   The truth is not every woman has a perfectly regular schedule. sometimes your body gets its timing off and you ovulate even near or at your period ( my sister did! baby!!) and if your natural schedule (say a 32day cycles) is different than the perfect 28 day one ( per the pills) then its ganna always be fighting with the pills. To be safe, use other protection during your period, still take the dummy pills to stay on track with them, and stay consistent with the pill! I've known pals that missed ONE day and Oops!    good luck!|`|86559d3dd8351cb711471bdb7a9127ecaa	Yes, you can get pregnant. It is unlikely, but certainly possible. Those pills are nothing but placebos. Most women don't have sex that week as they are having their period. To be safe, if you are having sex during that week use other protection.|`|d8de12a2faf9bc285acd458454b38267aa	You  get pregnant about 14 days from the first day of you period.  Say if you get your period on March first, the day you are most likely to get pregnant is March 15 (the window would be 3 days before that date and 3 days after that date because sperm live in the vagina up to 3 days after intercourse and ovulation can't be pinpointed exactly.)  so no you wont get pregnant.|`|a6fb9e3b4b36140457cf47f4a011ba37aa	As long as you take the pill every day at the same time, you shouldn't get pregnant. Even when you're on the placebos (sugar pills, green ones, etc.)
78a3982044ee541708f4f711a0c7fe6aaa	I am afraid that, at this point, you are not entitled. If you are on a low income there is a way round this. You will need to apply for Child Tax Credits and working tax credits as soon as possible after the baby is born. In order to get Child Tax Credits you need to apply for Child Benefit (or your claim for CTC will be delayed). This means that you need to register the birth and get the birth certificates promptly so get that done asap after the birth!    Sure Start Maternity Grant (ssmg) is paid to those in receipt of a qualifying benefit. One of these is Child Tax Credit but you need to be on a higher rate than the family element (which is approximately 500 per year). If you are paid Statutory Maternity Pay in the first 3 months, this will qualify you for the higher rate of Tax Credits and therefore the SSMG. TELL THEM IF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE - THEY WILL CLAIM THE MONEY BACK if you don't tell them about changes in your income or if your partner moves in.    You can apply for a SSMG up to three months after the birth of your baby but not a day later. There are no grounds for appealing a decision so it is probably best to wait until you receive the Tax Credits but since that can take time you may have to tick the box saying 'applied and waiting to hear'.    Don't forget to get your midwife/GP/healthvisitor to sign the form as that could delay it too.    Good luck!|`|426b2ebde46450837484fb98a2515f7daa	Hi there yea u should be entitled to it as its based on ur income. u can apply from 29weeks onwards till 3 months after the baby is born.xxx|`|2fa378978095639821e7ee252489e3c2aa	Just phone your social security office, they can tell you the outcome over the phone, they just need your ni number to check your earnings.

AA11242832	I started teaching my daughter to sign when she was 4 months old.  Start with the easy ones.  There are plenty of baby sign language books out there that can help.  Don't worry about it stunting her verbal language development.  I feel it actually helped my daughter communicate.  By the time she was one, she had a verbal vocabulary of over 100 words as well as the signs she was already using. Just make sure you're speaking the words when you sign them.  This will--hopefully--prompt your child to try to speak them while signing, also.     The Baby Einstein video called "Baby Wordsworth" is also an excellent tool when your baby is a little older.  It stars Marlee Matlin.      I LOVED signing with my daughter.  It really clarified things and eased her frustration.  I plan to teach my son to sign in a couple of months.|`|N8Ve3DsPaa	The best signs are the ones she needs--eat or milk, mommy, that sort of thing.      I started my son both by signing myself--one word at a time, not complete sentences--and by letting him watch a video called 'signing time'.  He knew 'milk', 'water', and 'eat', by six or eight months, a handful more by a year.  Then I added the baby wordsworth video from baby einstein and he picked up several more.  Just make sure you watch any videos with your baby--my son got VERY frustrated when he used a new sign and mommy didn't pick up on it right away.  Also, he went through a stage where he made up signs for words that he didn't have signs for, so be on the look out for that too.  Good luck!|`|lHN2SSX7aa	I have a 13 month old boy that uses baby sign.  I love it.  It is so nice to be able to communicate with him.  It eliminates a lot of frustration and temper tantrums.  I started with him at about 4 months.  The first signs that I taught my son was hungry, thirsty and more.  I am soooo glad that I did this and highly recommend it to everyone.  My son even made up some of his own signs. Good luck with this and am so glad that you are doing this.|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	I know several kindergarden teachers (and mothers) who would recommend that you not teach your child to sign unless it is actually necessary for them to communicate (the child actually is deaf or hearing impaired).  The reason being that, in their experience, children who signed had far less developed vocal and communication skills than the other students in their classes.  At a very young age, children's manual dexterity isn't good enough for them to control anyway.  By the time they're able to control their hand movements enough to sign effectively, they're old enough to start communicating vocally anyway.  My friends say that it's better to work on speech development solely.
e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	It depends on the brand.  On the box the test will say the *earliest* you can take it for an accurate result...you can take it anytime after that.  Usually it's within a few days of your missed period.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	If you do not chart or monitor your fertility in any way, and you think you may have conceived, you should wait 19 days (or longer) after having sex to test. Why 19?! Sperm can live approximately 5 days in the proper environment; if the sperm managed to live until you popped an egg, the actual conception could have taken place several days after the sex act that got the sperm there. To make sure you're not testing too early, assume the sperm had very long lives (5 days is considered a very long sperm life) and that conception occurred then. Then allow 14 days for the embryo to implant and develop enough hCG to show up on a pregnancy test (96% of pregnant women will test positive by then.)    http://www.peeonastick.com|`|VqcbRunXaa	Go to a chemist and have a look at the different test you can buy. Some of them you can do before you are due for your period.|`|4d53f67e5470b285a8aed72393e14837aa	Wait until the first day of your missed period. Some home pregnancy tests claim that you can take the test up to 5 days before your missed period, but it is far less accurate when you test that early.|`|39649588cccbd3b9bbda88a95f56a827aa	When your about a week late. If you test too early, it'll be negative.|`|5qs6UdJaaa	You should take a pregnancy test after your missed your period because before that the test results might not be right|`|ngTkpUqMaa	Wait until you have missed your period, then take it.|`|j4CH1vmFaa	It's recommended that you wait two weeks after you have sex to take a pregnancy test.  It's believe the hormone is at a high enough level to show on the test then.  In some cases it doesn't so up then and some it shows up sooner.  It'll show up in a blood test by two weeks though.  You should stop doing anything that is a no-no during pregnancy like drinking, until you take a test and know for sure.  Technically I don't know if you ever have to take a test, though you'll have to go to a doctor if you think your pregnant and depending on how far along you'd be, I don't know if you'd be made to take a pregnancy test, at least in the traditional sense.|`|Bkdr87iUaa	The first day of your missed period. OR they have some, where you can test 5 days before your missed period. I think its First Response. Good Luck|`|7cc9b6b522ecd6ded7ecfeb518a9112baa	I'm not sure I understand your question. If you're asking how long it takes for the hormones to be throughout your body in order for the test to pick it up, I think it takes about seven days.     The reason I say this is I am on the Deppo shot and if I miss my shot, I have to wait seven days to get my shot, just in case I am pregnant, then they give me a preganancy test to see if I am.    I hope that was what you were looking for!|`|SUdbKSxPaa	wait until you have missed your period
e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	When I was trying to conceive, I was taking my temp each morning, too.  Like what you have experienced, the difference in temp never was more than one full degree for me.  You really need to be tracking for at least a month so you can establish a baseline - your regular temp and then your changes in temp as you ovulate.  Going to http://www.fertilityfriend.com/ is a great place to start tracking.  You can track not only your temp, but changes in discharge, etc.  Their charting program really takes most of the guess-work out for you (and it's free).  Good luck.|`|AA11619527	first 14 to 15 days after the first day of your last period and not necessary your body temp. have to go up a lot , if your normal temp. is 97.2 and it goes to 98 then it is time|`|bghInW1Vaa	Forget the temperature method. This works much better and I have 5 kids to prove it!  When ovulation is about to occur, your cervical mucus will be clear, slippery and very stretchy, similar to a raw egg white. This type of mucus is ideal for sperm to swim in and helps the sperm swim up to your uterus.|`|ngTkpUqMaa	Upon waking your temp will most of the time be a little low. To know that if you have ovulated you see a huge dip in your temps followed by a sugnificant rise in temp. When you see that then the next 24-48 hrs are when you are most likely to get pg. Good luck!|`|HxaCFxN1aa	You should ovulate on the 14 or 15 day after your last period.

They are real haha look them up too! Anyway, pains are normal as long as the cramping and pains go away and don't stay for more than 60 seconds. If they last long or you have bleeding call your doc or go to the ER. Also if they just seem so painful that they are really worrying you call and talk to the doctor/nurse.|`|cmV16bVoaa	it is very normal every ones body develops differently and by this time your uterus is actually expanding and growing everyday and is going to push whats in the way out of the way! just keep track of taking your prenatal pills and don't skip any meals and you should be fine, and if you think its very bad then i would call your Dr. and make an appointment or go to the ER! hope you feel better!|`|bjuaDTahaa	i'm now 28+1d but have had pains in my abdomen all the way through, as long as they aren't really painful or cramps i think ur ok but if ur really worried go to ur docs to put ur mind at rest, u nor baby need the stress, hope all goes well xx|`|4AO2myzKaa	As long as they are mild it's fine, just your uterus expanding.  Now if it's a really painful period cramp type pain I would call your doc.
zVdVGsoJaa	It is possible that you are pregnant, so give it a week or two and test again.  If negative, wait one more week and test again.  If you still haven't got your period, go to the dr.'s and get a blood test done.  Good luck!    Edit:  I have heard that your bowels can go one extreme or another--whether that be constipated or diarrhea.

QY10Hmq7aa	They wouldn't try to stop it. You are full term at 37 weeks. I gave birth to my son at 37 weeks and he was perfectly healthy.|`|AJe2iiGQaa	It depends on the doctor and hospital but most doctors would just let nature take its course since u are considered full term at 37 weeks. 36 weeks, im not too sure about since it is very close to being full term it is not and if your dates are off baby may be off on his dates also and they will stop it at least until u turn 37-38 weeks. With my second baby i was having regular contractions and a little dialated at 37 weeks so the hospital called my doctor and my doctor told them to stop my labor. they had to stop it by pricking me 5 different times because i wouldnt stop progressing, i thought it was real bull crap since i was measuring 40+ weeks and was already considered full term, but some doctors like to do what is most convenient for them, not for the patient...if u still need more reassurence ask your doctor  good luck!|`|giRRCXU4aa	They won't stop labor at that time. My doctor just told me this last week.|`|M8iaO8hjaa	You'll get a good paycheck?|`|MtC3CWZraa	My doc said that after 36 weeks, they would make no effort to stop it.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no they will let it happen- 37 is considered full term. i had my son at 36 weeks and he came home with me the next day- if it's before 35 weeks they will stop it but not after|`|MNl4xDhiaa	you are considered full term at 37 weeks so i would say at 37 weeks they would let you deliver.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	No, they will just allow the baby to be born, 36 or 37 weeks isn't a dangerous time to give birth.|`|JXXZIsBvaa	They will probably try to stop it but at 37 weeks the baby is considered full term so it wouldn't be the end of the world if you delivered.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I gave birth to my son when I was 37 wks and he is a healthy 3 yr old today.|`|zXSjBHAAaa	Let it happen.  37 weeks in concidered full term.|`|eLCsIUtPaa	Giving birth at 36 or 37 weeks is fine. My son was 37 weeks, and he had an apgar score of 9.  36 weeks is borderline pre-mature, but still fine.

AA12254559	They won't do a walking epidural if you are having a section. They will either do a spinal or an epidural. They are different things. A spinal actually goes into the spinal space, numbs more effectively and can last longer then an epidural. An epidural is put in the epidural space, not in the spinal space, so you can have differing effects from an epidural. If I was getting a section, I would ask for a spinal. There are more risks with a spinal then with an epidural, but not much more. There are more chance of headaches after wards, and more back pain in certain women, but if you want to be awake and totally numb, a spinal is the way to go. An epidural can be as effective as a spinal if more medication is given in the initial injection.     A walking epidural is when you can still feel your legs to walk. It doesn't numb the pain as well, and it's possible it will wear off before labor is over. They won't do a walking epidural for a section. There are too many variables to do it.|`|GL1fP29Kaa	CSE  I for one would not have a baby without one.   Never did the c-section thing but vividly remember two thing from my girlfriends.  Her walking and hugging a pillow.  It is possible to do both at the same time.|`|6a0709b6e7524eaa69398ae12852bd90aa	Don't know about the walking epidural.  I do know that it is best to walk as soon as possible after a section.  It prevents painful gas buildup and encourages recovery.  Best of luck.|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	A "walking epidural" simply uses a different mix of lower dose drugs than a traditional one.  The benefit of a walking epidural is that it does not lessen the sensation of contractions and that you can get up and walk if you want.  It has nothing to do with being able to walk the next day and has nothing to do with a c-section.  For a c-section you are likely to be given a spinal block or other form of major meds.  C-sections are serious business and require a lot of recovery time.

hFfBnaoLaa	You know, it's not such a silly question. Some races develop spotting of the skin that's hard to fade. Other women get acne. Still others lose their hair.    None of it, however, has anything to do w/ whether you're having a girl or a boy. It has to do w/ your genetics and in some part, your nutrition (in the case of acne and hair loss).    As long as you eat non-processed food as much as possible, fresh vegetables and fruit, keep the fried stuff to a minimum and limit how much sugar you eat (not always possible depending on where in the States you live  =D ), your beauty will only improve w/ the joy of another child in your family!

You skin breaks out, your hair looks like it could grease an engine, and your always tired. But concider that an old wives tale.|`|7kHTQJmHaa	Well there is some truth to that. You know when i was preg with my daugher i gained so much weight it wasn't even funny. And it took me longer to lose it then with my son. Not only that i ended up with these white spots on my arms. After 6 yrs they are starting to go away, and my hair started thinning after i had her and she seemed to take a lot of calcium from me, so yeah my teeth started going down hill. Or at least thats what my dentist told me the reason was. so yeah girls do take your beauty. I hate to tell ya that you may lose your butt. Same thing happened to my sis. She had a J. Lo butt, and after she had her daughter. There it went. Unlike you she was happy though. I have no clue how to keep you butt. Guess i've always been upset if mine got a little big so i just know how to lose weight. Not keep it on.

You are going to have to accept a few changes, but who says that it won't be changes for the better.|`|gLQVJVE8aa	they ment that you would get acne problems lose skin color and things like that you know the ones you could get rid of or get back|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	That is an old wives tale that having a girl "steals" your beauty.  Want to know how to keep your looks?  Eat well, get lots of rest, and enjoy being pregnant.  I wouldn't worry about losing your butt...if anything, it will probably get bigger as you gain weight.  There is no reason why (aside from medical issues) you won't be able to regain your pre-pregnancy figure in the months following delivery.  Again, enjoy your beautiful pregnant body and relax.  Congratulations!

If this is your only indication you may be pregnant, I would say that you are probably not.  Some typical early pregnancy symptoms include: no period bleeding, sore/tender breasts, fatigue, morning sickness (nausea and/or vomiting), and frequent urination.  Pregnant women may or may not experience all or some of the above.  There is only one true way to tell if you are pregnant.  Take a home pregnancy test.  Or go to the doctor/clinic and get a blood test done.
gzMMhcjfaa	Si un bebe se pone amarillo al nacer, es porque sus niveles de bilirrubinas son un poco ms altos de lo normal, sto puede ser algo insignificante o en ocasiones (las menos) puede ser algo de cuidado si es que los niveles son muuuy altos. Los pediatras sabemos valorar que tan amarillo est el beb. si es solo un poco, sto puede deberse a la inmadurez del hgado, que es el que se encarga de procesar esta bilirrubina y lo hace ms lento, por lo que se envan ba?os de sol que ayudan a eliminar la bilirrubina, pero si los bebs se ven muy amarillos debemos tomar una prueba de sangre que nos indique que tan altos son los niveles, de hecho hay grficas en las que nos guiamos para saber si los niveles son normales para la edad de vida de tu beb. Si se detectan niveles anormalmente altos, entonces habra que buscar la causa, ya que hay varias causas de ello, entre las ms comunes son incompatibilidad sangunea o elevacin por leche materna, entre otras ms raras. En stos casos tambin se deben poner en una luz especial que concentra los rayor que disminuyen las bilirrubinas para que los niveles bajen rpidamente o bien no sigan subiendo, sto se hace tambin en los casos de niveles moderados de bilirrubinas, lo cual creo que es el caso de tu beb.  Si tu mdico solo te dijo que le dieras ba?os de sol, es porque los niveles deben ser bajos y lo mas probable es que el higado de tu beb necesite un poco de ayuda, pero no te preocupes, el hgado de tu beb madurar rpidamente y tu beb tendr pronto un color normal.|`|LcHSJXdFaa	Eso se llama ictericia neonatal, en los casos leves con ponerlos a recibir el sol un rato por la ma?ana y otro por la tarde es suficiente, estos casos leves son la mayoria.

Muchos bebs nacen con ictericia (as se llaqma la piel amarilla) y se debe solo al aumento de bilirrubina.  Se corrige como dices, con ayuda de la luz y esperando un poco, es importante que tu pediatra te comente lo que hay que hacer, pues a veces interrumpen la lactancia materna , pero deoende de cada caso.

No one can tell you when the best time to share this is....it's personal.   Do what feels right for you.  One hint though.  Don't tell anyone other than your partner before you tell your parents & his.  That could get you in big trouble!!  Congrats and best wishes.|`|68f3d1c2700f911c12b2f83cec1a6c52aa	i told my parents after i couldn't hide it anymore but more at like 2 months and they both told me i might want to wait to tell everyone else till three months thats the time that people usually tell bc after that chances of a miscarriage go down dirastically  and some people think if you tell sooner it will jinks it so i don't think your parents will be mad if you wait but your mom might be a little offened just make sure she knows she was the first to know other then your husband (even if its a little white lie cuz you had to tell one friend :D|`|587f0b8146425d8167ddb66c48ffafe5aa	It depends if you want to tell them or not. We told my husbands' parents before we had the ultra sound and there was no fetal heartbeat at 13 wks and I had to have a d&c (two months ago). It was good that we told them because we had all the support from them, but if they wouldnt have known, they wouldnt have gotten all excited and then disappointed. Either way, it's up to you if you want to tell them or not. It goes both ways. Some people wait until the risk for miscarriage decreases which is about 12 weeks. Good luck and hope everything goes well!|`|72446df3f2a1d859f77c17e38ea9df98aa	yess! i will must tell them if i could pregnant.

The first time I was pregnant (lost the baby at 11 weeks), I told them both almost right away (at about 5 weeks) - after I told my husband, of course!  It was hard to call them to tell them I had lost the baby, but it was really wonderful knowing that they were there for me and helped support me thru that hard time.  This time around, I told my mom at about 5 weeks again but told my dad, brother,sister-in-law, and husband's parents after my first doctor appt. at 8 weeks.  At that appointment I had a vaginal ultrasound and got to see and hear the baby's heartbeat - I nearly cried!  I didn't tell any other family members or friends til 13 weeks, tho.    I think that it's really up to you as to when you feel comfortable telling them.  I can't see any reason why they would be mad at you for wanting to wait til you were farther along before you shared the news.  I think that, if anything, they will be so thrilled that you are pregnant that they will forget all about how you kept it a secret til now.  Your parents will have tons of time to dote on you and the baby - delaying that for a few weeks til you know for sure won't matter to them in the long run.    Congratulations and good luck!

GOD BLESS YOU.|`|AA10862272	yes - take the test again|`|38afb8d42d144033329261d6458a1568aa	I too would wait at least ten days.   If you have been under any stress or problems that could affect your hormones.    Not too mention your cycle could be changing.

So i'll wait till the 2 week mark for you to take another one.    Good Luck! :)|`|d7J9WCSOaa	Yes.  Being late doesn't mean you're pregnant.  Conceiving during ovulation is the only thing that means your pregnant.  Being late could happen from many other things:  Stress  Hormonal Imbalances|`|AA12314337	I'm not sure if I understand your question.   Are you asking if its possible that you are not pregnant, even though you are  1 1/2 weeks late? yes. If you tested, and it comes back negative, it's probably negative. Although you should retest in another week.    Or are you saying that you've tested positive, but are still wondering if you could then test negative? Probably not.     If you're hoping to be pregnant, but have tested negative (as long as you tested after your period should have started), those results are probably accurate.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It is possible to get a false negative.  You can't get a false positive.  Try having the doctor do a blood test.|`|b8b06f4ecb41e0dcbbef0bdfac455625aa	Go get a blood test,this will tell you if you are pregnant or not!!!|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	Yes, false negatives are possible.  You may not have high enough levels of hCG for the test to detect.  Wait at least 5 more days to re-test (assuming you still don't get your period before then) to give your body a chance to elevate hCG to detectable levels.  Be aware that it is possible that your missed period may be caused by another condition other than pregnancy, however.  In your case, it seems too early to tell either way.  Call your doctor if you are concerned.  Good luck.

Lo que s es necesario, es que el varn debe ser sumamente cuidadoso, tierno, paciente y super amoroso con la dama, dada la preparacin que ella necesita para aceptar una penetracin. El varn debe lubricarla extraordinariamente bien, y comenzar por introducir un dedo ( de preferencia el mas delgado ) para que la dama se vaya acostumbrando gradualmente a ser ocupada por va rectal.     Una vez que ella acepte sin molestias un dedo, prueben a introducir uno ms grueso y as sucesivamente hasta que la dama acepte el dedo ms grueso.      Tal vez en otra sesin ( por eso insisto que hay que ser muy paciente ), el varn puede probar a introducir dos dedos, los mas delgados y repetir la gradual introducccin hasta que ella aguante los mas gruesos. Entonces ya estar preparada para la penetracin peneana. Y an as, el varn debe estar muy atento a las indicaciones de su dama, dandole tiempo a que se acostumbre y que se relaje, insisto en la super lubricacin.    Una vez que la dama ya acepte el sexo anal sin molestas, entonces podr dejarse ir. Las terminales nerviosas de perineo, ano y vagina son las mismas, por lo que muchas damitas gozan muchsimo ms el sexo anal  puesto que les quita el componente del temor a salir embarazadas.    Lo que s hay que cuidarse es de una penetracin brusca que desgarre los msculos anales  los esfnteres ( son dos; ) son anillos musculares, susceptibles como cualquier msculo, de ser entrenados. Pero hay que tener precauciones para evitar desgarros o fisuras que tal vez requieran de ciruga para repararse debidamente.|`|92f6975a3513635ce7c25534abbb4715aa	si hay placer no hay problema solamente se deben cuidar dos factores intensidad de penetracin e higiene esta ultima sobre todo si se practica sexo sin proteccin o se alterna con coito vaginal ya que puede traer infecciones.|`|AA12286334	primeramente tiene que estar plenamente convencida de querer hacerlo     causas: dolor al penetrar    efectos : ninguno si no hay violencia|`|0q1BXxIdaa	No es para nada malo! aunke a muchas mujeres no les gusta; solo puede causar un poco de dolor al penetrar, pero con el tiempo se acostumbra; lo unico q no recomiendo es q pases dl sexo anal al vaginal en ese mismo momento, esto podra traer alguna infeccin (sistitis), asi q 1o vaginal y luego terminar con la frutilla dl postre! =)|`|ca32dfff1b4d21f48a3e106cde709a21aa	es bueno siempre que quieran|`|yQaHkuLVaa	no hay problema creo que en el sexo se vale todo sin embargo hay que tener presente las normas de higiene, adems hay producto que facilitan la penetracin|`|RdAfxf4Taa	Pues hay desgarres y es muy doloroso... ai tu vers...|`|dtN0Y4ruaa	si es bueno para "algunas"  pero al realizarlo tambien el varon tiene q tener cuidado porq el pene es muy delicado y tambien se lastima, y realizar la penetracion muy lentamente, para q la hembra lo sienta, NUNCA LO REALIZEN TAN RAPIDO Y BRUSCAMENTE PORQ SE CORRE EL RIESGO DE DESGARRE, le traera placer a varon al momento pero despues vienen los dolores, y la hembra qda total mente o practicamente violada, asi q ojo y tengan mucha paciencia...!!!!

UfqRXAgcaa	La secuela que deja el abortar es muy difcil de superar, quiz al principio es la mejor opcin pero con el tiempo llegan todos los sentimientos de culpa; as que ante esta situacin que planteas lo ideal es hacer el mayor numero de exmenes posibles al bebe y conversar claramente con tu pareja en caso la tengas para que ambos se preparen e instruyan sobre lo especial que sera tener un bebe con complicaciones.

En mi caso, en mi primer embarazo a los cuatro meses me dijeron que tena un riesgo muy alto de que mi nena tuviera sndrome de down... decid no hacerme una amniocentesis para no tener que decidir y segu adelante con esa duda aceptando lo que viniera...pensaba en mi madre que en su poca nos tuvo sin saber ni el sexo, ni las malformaciones ni nada de nada, al final todo sali bien y mi ni?a no tiene sndrome de Down...pero no te voy a decir que no lo pasara mal durante lo que me qued de embarazo enfrentndome a esa duda y a esa posibilidad....pero lo iba a tener de todas maneras, me vea incapaz de no conocer a esa nena que ya haba visto en las ecos y que tena nombre....

Un beso|`|c74d24655e0f8f2ecda071fb7ef002ceaa	La verdad es que no me gustara estar en la situacin de tener que decidir, pero principalmente me preguntara sin con el tipo de malformacin podra valerse por si mismo, porque mientras estn los padres la cosa v bastante bien, pero cuando faltan ya no es lo mismo, el tema de las burlas me preocupara menos aunque seguro que a el no, pero ya te digo si yo creyese que tuviese que depender siempre de alguien abortara y estoy en contra del resto de los abortos|`|f78ad4edd1a12c6b82335ed09f2c3229aa	pues no se lo que haria porque nunca me he visto en esa situacion...  no hay que discriminar a nadie, pero actuaria en base a como yo me viese capaz de llevar el tema, hay que estar preparada y ser consciente de que vas a tener que dedicar mucho mas tiempo a tu hijo....  Yo creo que abortaria, es mi hijo, lo se, y se que alomejor si naciese seria el mas feliz del mundo, es mas, hoy dia, seguro que te da menos problemas que uno que nace sano...pero yo creo que abortaria.|`|f12CggjWaa	Si, abortaria, sin ninguna duda.El mundo ya es bastante dificil para las personas "sin problemas"  como para que una persona con una malformacin venga a este undo. No quiero un mundo de gente perfecta, pero quiero crear una vida sin que de base ya haya complicaciones. Creo que es ms egoista decir "lo tendra" porque "es mi hijo". El decir "es mi hijo" creo que es un sintoma mas de egoismo que el decir, "no lo tendria porque no quiero que este ni?o sufra". Claro que se puede criar a un ni?o con malformaciones con mucho amor y ese ni?o puede llegar a ser muy feliz, pero.. y cuando tu no estes, quien cuidara de el? En el fondo ese ni?o sera feliz cuando veas a los demas ni?os jugar y el no pueda porque por ejemplo, le faltan dos piernas, o no tenga brazos? Como le consolaras cuando tu ni?o venga del colegio diciendo que se rien de el en clase? Es muy facil decir "claro que lo tendria", habr que ver cuantas personas que aqui dicen eso, a la hora ed la verdad abortarian.  Se que este comentario puede herir, pero no soy hipocrita, me gusta decir realmente lo que pienso, no digo lo que me gustaria que oyesen de mi  Si hago este comentario lo hago con uso de razon, por experiencia, no lo hago a la ligera. Y no, yo no he abortado un ni?o con malformaciones, es otro tema que no viene a cuento.|`|q8N6DtJqaa	Dificil decisin, no solo por tu parte, ten en cuenta de que debeis decidirlo 2, no solo tu y que puede que no esteis de acuerdo.Estando embarazada de mi segunda hija, una conversacin con mi marido cierto dia fue sobre eso.Si abortara si supiera que mi ni?a tena sindrome de down, yo creo que lo hubiera hecho pero mi marido se negaba en rotundo.Gracias a Dios no tuvimos que ni siquiera plantearnoslo, pero eso es un dilema de dos......yo creo que s querra perderlo, pero mi marido seguramente no.....as que no s lo que hara.|`|eJ9IUO7Yaa	yo pienso q no  el amor de madre (o padre) es el mismo, asi tu hijo venga como venga  yo no podria ir en contra de la vida  pienso q si un hijo en situaciones normales te hace crecer mas como persona y valorar aun mas la vida, imaginate lo q no te va a ensenar un hijo especial|`|es46gTMpaa	Los mdicos siempre recomiendan tener un excelente estado de nutricin y tomar cido flico y hierro unos meses antes para que el embrin empiece bien; cuando no es as las malformaciones invaden al feto. No puedes abortar algo que es responsabilidad tuya. Solo un Padre Celestial puede quitarlo, recuerda que es un ser puro y no pidi venir al mundo con los problemas que tiene. No puedes desechar algo que viene de tu ser, que espera tu amor sin importar su apariencia fsica porque es un regalo de los cielos; l Se?or sabra como ayudarte a criar un hijo de Dios.|`|SeSVIxyOaa	mira es difcil responder esta pregunta pero no q sentira yo al estar en esta situacion y pensar q mi hijo venga mal como catolica q soy le pediria mucho a mi dios q me iluminara q me perdonara pero de verdad es algo muy doloroso no se q responderte en este momento suerte|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Trabajo con este tipo de pacientes, y te digo personalmente nunca me haria un aborto, al menos q sea una situacion de estas....para q traer un ser al mundo a sufrir?? Noooo, definitivamente me lo haria|`|ECOIcLo9aa	y si ese bebe fueras t? yo no lo permitira jams... saludos|`|eb2b5d08897c78686a866c3b1e7763d9aa	muy delicada mas creo que no,hijo es hijo sea como sea.|`|JQyRwTWLaa	Lo tendra sin duda alguna pq creo a pesar de los problemas q tenga ese ni?o, tiene dignidad como ser humano, y tiene derecho a la vida; el hecho de que sea diferente no significa que el ni?o no pueda llegar a ser feliz, y pienso que nadie tiene potestad para quitar el derecho a la vida y decidir por un ni?o que no se puede defender.    Es mi opinion|`|e7dfaca796ba7011cce2eb8eaf82dc4daa	SI SE DIESE EL CASO QUE PLANTEAS, CREO QUE, NO QUEDA OTRO CAMINO QUE ES, ACEPTAR LA SITUACIN, TAL CUAL ESTA PLANTEADA. ES DIOS EL QUE LO HA DECIDIDO, Y COMO TAL, DEJAR QUE LAS COSAS SIGAN SUS CURSO. EL BEBE NACER, Y SERA PARA UNO, COMO LO ES CUALQUIER RECIN NACIDO PARA CUALQUIERA. SERA RECIBIDO CON TODO NUESTRO CORAZN Y ASISTIDO COMO CORRESPONDE, A TODA CRIATURA RECIN NACIDA.DEJEMOSNOS SORPRENDER. YA EL TIEMPO DIR COMO SEGUIR LA COSA, PERO COMO DICE UN DICHO VIEJO, MIENTRAS HAY VIDA, HAY ESPERANZAS.|`|7962ee476b54977385435c9ff502b5ffaa	Si los mdicos te aconsejan esta opcin no deberas dudar pues recuerda que una vez nacido es una gran carga para toda la familia el tener una persona discapacitada todo el resto de sus dias necesitando siempre una atencin diaria para si misma.|`|7f85513e391500fce5ed54e6399c975eaa	Pregunta muy delicada. Es difcil responder a esta pregunta sin vivir esta situacin. Ahora me imagino que s abortara. Lo que hara primero es muchos exmenes mdicos. Abortara probablemente por no darle luz a un ni?o que empieza mal en un mundo que ya es difcil de por s. Adems, un ni?o con una malformacin necesita ms tiempo, ms dinero y no tengo ni uno ni otro.|`|BwIB5blXaa	Depende de qu malformacin se trate... Si es viable, si ese embrin pudiera vivir, si, lo tendra. Ahora, si hay una hidroencefalia, y se que el bebe va a nacer para morirse a los pocos das... probablemente abortara, pienso que es una experiencia horrible para los paps y sin necesidad. Ya trauma suficiente tienen al saber que su bebe no va a sobrevivir.
OcCgUsmLaa	Did you shoot onto your girlfrind's face and then she went down on another friend, right. Naughty girl!  I hope you all had fun.      S|`|2ubfofmHaa	Tweak is right|`|cj7sSPZEaa	The sperm die when they are dry- they don't die immediately.  How on earth is it going to travel from the girl's face (Gross BTW) to her vagina?|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	How would the sperm even travel from the face to the vagina? Did someone rub it down there?  And no, sperm doesn't die once it leaves the body.|`|H82TNFlgaa	It depends on how quickly this odd act happened!    Sperm can live outside the body as long as they don't dry out. so...a wet patch equals live sperm, a dry patch is dead sperm.|`|hSAMF1foaa	Actually I belive Sperm Can live up to an 1 hour outside of the body before they start to die, hard to have that happen, but not totally impossible.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	the sperm die|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Sperm cannot live outside the body|`|dI1oANPwaa	You can not get pregnant that way i use to wonder that as well|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	it dies.. please use protection, your obviously not old enuf or educated enuf to have a baby....|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Same answer that I always give.  SPERM CAN LIVE UP TO AN HOUR ONCE EXPOSED TO AIR PROVIDING IT IS IN A MOIST STATE (NOT DRIED OUT). THE PEOPLE WHO TELL YOU IT DIES WHEN IT HITS AIR ARE WRONG.|`|Cmrl8Qziaa	no it doesnt die right away!  Be careful what you do!  Use protection!|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Once the sperm enters the vagina it will start swimming the the egg. It doesn't matter whether 'you' put it in there or whether your girlfriend coughs, dribbles or wipes her mouth and then somewhere else. If sperm gets into the vagina you could become a daddy!
O2fI6Ju7aa	It depends on how far along you were.     If you were very very early in your pregnancy, it could have been that it was too early to see the baby, or it could have been hiding.     It is possible that the levels aren't low enough yet. It can take a while for levels to go down.     I would go to the dr. Have them run tests or do another ultrasound.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	I'm sorry, I don't know exactly.  But- I would think that it could take awhile for your levels to drop.  Chances are if they did not see the sac then you did have a miscarriage, but I would double check with your Dr. if you are not sure.  Anything is possible.|`|W0d6NsGBaa	I dont know about the test but I can tell you that when I was 5 weeks pregnant and 7 weeks pregnant I had ultrasounds due to bad cramping. Both times they tried to do an abdominal ultrasound and couldnt see anything so they had to do a vaginal. Once they did that they could see the baby.    I would call your dr and explain your situation and what the hospital did and about the test. They can check your levels again.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	No, it can take a long time for your levels to drop...you are likely not pregnant, I am so sorry for your loss
y5kqAmxraa	Great, another irresponsible stupid teenager I have to pay for through my taxes.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Your best bet would be to go into a county hospital and ask for help.  They have all of the paperwork needed to get help from your state. Just go to the front desk and ask who can help you.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Maybe you should have thought of this /before/ you got pregnant?    Taxpayers don't want to pay for YOUR baby. Get a job and pay for it yourself.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	You can go to your local Job and Family Services and apply for health care.  However, having a baby is much more expensive than going through pregnancy.  If you can't afford to pay for a car, apartment, clothes, food, etc than you wouldn't be fit to be a mom at this time.  I know it would be tough, but you should probably consider adoption until you are older, more responsible, and financially independent.  Good luck!|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	Since your on the internet you can search for you states website and get applications online. But not to be rude. I work full time and long long hours. I work 6 days a week so hun before you apply think of us. The ones that are going to have to support you and the baby with the hard earned money that we work for and it gets taken away because people get pregnant and then think about having a baby financially after the fact. Sorry it just makes me mad.|`|ek0U5M13aa	You could contact agencies like Planned Parenthood or if you have a Pregnancy Resource Center in your area (you can do a search on the internet for one).  Places like these can give you information on what your options are as well as help you get prenatal care.  Medicaid in your state may also help with the costs of having a baby.|`|A8k9NHigaa	Well you should be able to get Sobra Medicaid to pay for the medical expenses. But ahem, you are 16 how do you actually plan on supporting a baby if your parents won't help? Perhaps you might consider adoption.|`|zXSjBHAAaa	Why have a baby if you can't afford it?  That is not fair to your child.
em8A42Bqaa	28 weeks and I just grin and bear it!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	tell him to join the club of men who aren't getting laid because their girlfriend/wife is pregnant.    My husband is in IRAQ right now and I'm only happy about that because I have absolutely no sex drive at all.     with my first pregnancy, i had a mad awesome sex drive.. not with this one though... But its all normal. just apologize to him (even though you shouldn't have to) and explain that you either get a good one or a sucky one, and you got the sucky sex drive. its not your fault. its more his fault for getting you pregnant!!    and maybe to get in the mood, let your man go down on you (tmi, i know.. but you asked). my husband does that when i'm not in the mood (when he is home anyway) and it works like a charm!!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	UM...you are big and uncomfortable! And I'm sure your def. not feeling sexy. He should understand, and if he doesn't that's just crazy.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	37 weeks and i know how it is... :( i love making love to my hubby but the baby is to low and it hurts me if i do anything. So i am just pleasing him ....and that makes me happy. Hope he is too. But after we have the baby .....his booty is all mine..lol|`|sFwHbFgtaa	get him drunk|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Heck, I am 16 weeks and haven't been in the mood for a LONG time! I don't imagine it will get any better - my poor hubby!|`|PqA5hCfbaa	I had this problem unitl i turned 37 weeks. Then i got a huge sex drive!|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|eEK3m1aXaa	I'm not sure there's going to be a way to get yourself in the mood. When I was pregnant, just the thought of having sex made me feel sick. My poor husband only got it, maybe, three times during the 9 months. And I tried everything!!  Good luck!!      ~_~|`|RPszYGXkaa	When I was at the last few weeks...there was no way I could ever ever ever have sex.  It was the furthest thing from my mind, and honestly it was awkward.  We did try it toward the end, and hubby said it felt like he was hitting a brick wall, literally.  Just tell him to give it a rest, a few weeks post partum and you can enjoy each other again.
uhj76Fkpaa	stop breastfeeding and take him to a doctor asap!|`|iufAPDeWaa	You should definately call a doctor. Feeding the baby blood in his milk can't be okay. Please call a doctor you'll probably get all kinds of responses on here. This isn't a good place to look for answers in this kind of situation. Call the hospital!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	do you have a pump? if so i would use it because its less abrasive than nursing your baby. but i would call the birthing center where you had him-they should be able to help you out with some advice or who to contact with nursing issues which you definitly have since you are bleeding that much. dont be afraid to ask them-they get these kinds of calls all the time! my son was 4 days old too when i really started having problems because he wasnt latching on properly and it was like having my nipples in a vice grip everytime! good luck-it gets better!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	The blood itself cannot harm him however it will upset his tummy and cause him to throw up which can harm him if he isn't keeping his food down.    Consult a lactaction specialist, your ob or your babys doctor.|`|Cl4AfJPcaa	HOnestly i went through this and i would just switch him to formula. It was better for me and my son and we were both alot happier. It made me unhappy at first because ive always wanted to breastfeed but we just have to face the fact that we cant all breastfeed.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	Make sure you know it's your blood, because if it's his, you should have had him at the hospital right away. If you know it is yours, he's fine. I would contact a lactation specialist. The first couple of months of breastfeeding can be really hard, but I promise you it does get way better. The blisters, cracked nipples...so much fun! You can do it! I have 3 kids, my youngest is 4 months old, and I went through it each and every time. Try going shirt/braless. Leaving your nipples open to the air will help a lot. Best of luck!    (Make sure it's not his blood)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There is no harm to the baby from swallowing blood, however it will make them spit up more.    On the other hand it is bad for you because you could get an infection, and its painful.  If you don't get help with him latching then you are very likely to give up on nursing which is bad for both of you.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/12more_bf...  6. A mother who bleeds from her nipples should not breastfeed.    Not true! Though blood makes the baby spit up more, and the blood may even show up in his bowel movements, this is not a reason to stop breastfeeding the baby. Nipples that are painful and bleeding are not worse than nipples that are painful and not bleeding. It is the pain the mother is having that is the problem. This nipple pain can often be helped considerably. Get help. (Handout  3 Sore Nipples and  3b Treatments for Sore Nipples and Sore Breasts). Sometimes mothers have bleeding from the nipples that is obviously coming from inside the breast and is not usually associated with pain. This often occurs in the first few days after birth and settles within a few days. The mother should not stop breastfeeding for this. If bleeding does not stop soon, the source of the problem needs to be investigated, but the mother should keep breastfeeding.    http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/blo...  A third common cause: If mom has a  cracked nipple or other bleeding, then baby may ingest some blood from mom (this is not harmful to baby), which may show up in baby's stool.|`|qsl2De8xaa	yake him to the er|`|EvCLeBYwaa	Doesn't sound normal. You need to take him to the doctor and tell them whats happening so they can check him to make sure its not coming from him, they can also give solutions to your sore nipples.|`|CsLyyRQeaa	You should get a lactation consultant.  You baby is not latching on right.  They can show you how to get you baby to latch on right and then your nipples will heal.  Your blood will not hurt your baby but may upset his tummy.
