WrDGhduxaa	They make lots of money because the owners have more money than brains.<br>  Many owners are megalomaniacs with no true sense for business. They will pay anything to win a championship, which is why leagues had to have salary caps to protect the owners from themselves.

AA11088802	no... after 100 .. if u make more thousand run.. that recorded as one century or 100|`|mber3JoAaa	No. If you score anything above 100, it only gets recorded a single 100 and nothing else, regardless of how many you go on to score.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	If the batsman scores runs from 50 to 99 its Fifty<br>  If the batsman scores 100 or more (200 or 300) it will be counted in records as one single century. <br>  <br>  and no fifty will be counted if the batsman score 100 or more.|`|mj1bC73gaa	No - it is getting past a mark that counts.

RS3fjNboaa	We still have the Plaxico situation and the Vick situation coming up. Both of those will be big deals. But on Y!A we have the Playboy Trolls which is a popular topic of converstion. Just look at Joe and Failure. Those guys hate us so bad they never waste an opportunity to put us down. I'm wondering why it bothers them so much. Why do they care what we do? At least we're home and not running the bars or neglecting our families. It's pathetic that some people's thoughts are consumed by other people's actions. I guess now that the Trolls have been formed we have lost the right to come into Y!A football. To be honest, I couldn't care less what they think, especaially with their spite filled comments.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to see that you feel that way, Joe. Basically, the PT's are a bunch of Y!A football users that actually like each other.  We disagree on teams, but we respect each other's opinions. Too many people in here DO NOT respect other's opinions. If you want to talk football, we'll talk football all day. However, the PT's will be always be around because sometimes we want to talk about other things, too. That's why we have our own locker room. Friendship is everything it's cracked up to be.  BTW, thank's for the apology. I appreciate it and accept it.|`|cdQryr7paa	The Mike Vick dilemma will be before Favre.<br>  Although I do agree with you that we have not seen the last of Favre.<br>  Michael Vick can be seen on the horizon.<br>  Here he comes.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	Leinart getting upset that Warner is taking away from his time in charge|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Who's better, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James?

And hes on his computer 24/7 and doing crap like that here on yahoo.. <br>  <br>  grow up guys<br>  <br>  Your right Bevo its good that your not neglecting your family and Im sorry if my comment on the subject was a little harsh, but I needed to break the ice on that subject. Lets stick to talking about football on YA and stop starting little groups, because I know most of you have intelligent answers I just hate to see that kind of immaturity and to be honest I feel like Im surrounded by alot of middle schoolers here on YA when I know you all are grown.|`|YOKuERs9aa	i think green bay is gonna do a LOT better this season, cardinals will make it to the playoffs, and steelers will get cocky and think that they can do it all, that will make them suck|`|kzYdVfifaa	Favre is done.

Jai Ho|`|AA11376432	the fact is Sachin isn't interested in making a double century, there may be some reasons behind this. So he could have got his 200 or may not. but one thing you have to acknowldge about Sachin is he did not lose his "classic shots", even it is a small ground.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	Hypothetical question.

AA11570394	When a bullet leaves the barrel it will continue to travel in its last direction of flight. Long ago Germany took advantage of this with a very strange gun;<br>  <a href="http://collections.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.988/outputRegister/lowhtml" rel="nofollow">http://collections.iwm.org.uk/server/sho...</a><br>  If a rifle barrel is bent so far the sights or scope cant be adjusted to correct the point of aim you have only two choices. One have the barrel straightened by a gunsmith or have the scope mount moved to compensate by drilling and tapping new holes for the mount screws or soldering the rear sight over some to compensate.<br>  <br>  So yes you can sight in a bent barrel, in fact most barrels are not as straight as people think.|`|AA11694178	No chance.  Replacement of the barrel is your only choice if you want to use this gun.|`|y299k5j8aa	yes it can ive done it before|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Sure.<br>  <br>  The key to accuracy - and accuratly zeroing a rifle - depends on the projectile leaving the barrel at the same time and same direction time and time again.<br>  <br>  There is no issue zeroing the rifle at any known distance.<br>  <br>  Even if the barrel distortion is enough to effect the trajectory - this can be adjusted for by actually zeroing at 100, 200, 300, 400 etc and noting the actual elevation and windage clicks needed to bring it to zero.<br>  <br>  It's when the barrel distortion is so signifigant it effects the stabilization of the projectile and physical dimensions of the projectile - squishing the bullet - you would have accuracy issues.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Mountain man made me think.  I suppose those old smooth bore muskets were more similar to paintball guns than most people think.  A tippmann flatline barrel is bent up to cause a backspin on the paintball.  The back spin gives it a flater trajectory, and the spin might help stabilize the bullet the way rifling does.  I'm thinking those indians were a couple hundred years ahead of us.  Just some food for thought.|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	Yes it can, but it will only be accurate at the distance it was zeroed.  So if it was zeroed at 100 yards it will not be very accurate at say 150 yards.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, but only if it is bent only slightly.* Barrels can be straightened however.*|`|CFQbdDRNaa	*dca20033, hit it on the head ...I dont think this happens now..people would think you were probably wakt but 300 years ago it was noticed by some western travelers that eastern indians would place the barrels of their guns in the notch of a tree and bend them ever so slightly to make them shoot straight!.............true, read history boys!|`|BckKMf0zaa	It would be hard and almost imposible.

A 20-20 match between Mumbai and Maharashtra is also scheduled to mark the inaugural event. <br>  <br>  Dilip Vengsarkar, former chairman of the selection committee, Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI), said "the T20 match will begin at 10.30 am. Top players and stars will participate in the match. I have spoken to Dhoni and Tendulkar. They will come for the inauguration. I have also spoken to Sharad Pawar, but he hasn't confirmed his presence." <br>  <br>  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and Dilip Vengsarkar Cricket Academy (DVCA) in May 2007 to set up the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation Dilip Vengsarkar Cricket Academy at Thergaon. The work of constructing the pavilion is in progress. <br>  <br>  "As many as 15 wickets have been prepared at the academy. They will take some time to settle down. Outfield is ready," Vengsarkar said. He added that "It will take three months to complete the pavilion. A club house will be developed in a couple of years. There will be a gymnasium as well."|`|AA11088802	search on google

A5aYD4S3aa	first stand up to him. most bullies dont want to fight. thats why they pick on smaller weaker pepole. the ones that are to afraid to fight back.second if it dose come to a fight . keep your hands up.and kick him in the knee or shins.then punch him in the kideneys or solar plexus.and finish with a straight right to the chin|`|OyBuEpOTaa	if you expect it, block it, and shove it to the side. at the same time punch him with your other hand. hit under the nose, the stomach, under the nose,. Or you can let him hit you, then go to the hospital, call the police. Make sure you have witnessses when he hits you, then sue.  Don't give him any warning.  As long as you are 14 or older you can be taken into court or file for a suit . By the way if the school can't protect you then sue them too.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	I'm no advocate of schoolyard fights, but I hate to hear about people being bullied.  If you have no training of any kind, here's what I would suggest.  The guy is a bully.  Bullies tend to be cocky, they get in close to smaller guys, and use their size to intimidate.  So let him get in close.  Pretend to be scared ( and you probably will be, bullies are good at intimidation)  when he's close enough to reach out and touch, grab both of his arms at the bicep (just above the tops of the forearms) and pin them to his sides so he cant move them, and quickly lift your knee into his groin. Don't rely on one shot, do it at least twice.  If he doubles over, you can knee him a third time to his face, or give him an uppercut just under the chin (If you don't know how to throw an uppercut, look up some boxing reference materials)  You can practice this sequence by shadowboxing.  Get in front of a wall or mirror, and throw 2 knees and an uppercut until you get it committed to memory.  When your bully confronts you, keep your cool, stick to your plan, and strike him quickly.  The element of surprise very important to successful self defense.  If the plan dosen't work, tuck your chin to your chest, and throw straight punches until you can't punch anymore, or rush in and wrap your arms around the guy so he at least can't hit you. Someone will enventually break up the fight.  The good thing is, win or lose, once you stand up to a bully once, they will generally leave you alone, and go on to find an easier target.  Good luck.|`|IGJWF3VBaa	You only fight if you have exhausted all other options, I used to get bullied at school to and it's not fun, I know and bully's (most of the time) only understand one language and that is force but only fight if you have the choice of getting beaten to a pulp or defending yourself.<br>  <br>  The best way to show that you should not be messed with and not badly hurt him (that I know of) is, Rock him back or shock him with a couple of jabs and crosses to the head then kick him on the outer side of his thigh (about in the middle) after two or three of them he should be thinking twice about picking on you again. Then tell him to leave you alone.<br>  <br>  BUT ONLY DO THIS IF HE ATTACKS YOU FIRST. But the best way to protect yourself from bullies is to learn a Martial art. Hope this helps.|`|d9XXe2kLaa	Jared,<br>  <br>  If you have no fight experience or trained in any way, your best bet is to hit him first. <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, if you are getting bullied - he will most likely grab you with one hand whilst threatening you.  <br>  <br>  This is your chance - he can only hit you (hard anyway) with the free hand.  <br>  <br>  Get ready to block/parry this hand if he manages to swing at you, but before he has the chance try to hit him first.<br>  <br>  Unless he is very used to getting hit you will probably find he won't know what to do if you hit him first - but hit him in nose, chin, throat, groin, knee - you are in a street fight - it isn't about fighting cleanly.<br>  <br>  Try your best to hit him hard and keep hitting him as much and hard as you can.<br>  <br>  This is your best chance.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	when he punches you do 1.

All my life I learned various forms of martial arts from the family, and nobody i've fought ever stood a chance to technique. My best guess would be to go to a school and study probably MMA, because it is the most effective in a fight (i feel at least). Good luck, kicks kind of use inertia..for a good kick at least. Bruce Lee said low kicks are the best, and I stick by his word all the time. Mid-low kicks are the most effective according to him..therefore they Are the most effective :P. But don't take the b/s from this bully, take MMA classes, and use it on him when necessary..he will learn his lesson, believe me!!|`|FjA3jGs4aa	heres what you do. let him beat u up and dont fight back, element of suprise, next day at reces or whatever come up from behind him and lock your arm around his neck. take your other arm and try to locate the area right above his collar bone in the middle of his neck. push on it with your thumb, DO NOT USE YOUR NAILS. it will choke him then throw him on the ground by turning to direction the fist of your locked arm is facing down to the ground. you will both get in trouble but hen again self defence is a myth so its a waist to get in trouble for barely being able to fight him.|`|ZpShIvylaa	find somebody you know you can beat up and beat the crap out of them then the bully will lose interest in someone who will defend themselves. or just punch the bully right in the nose.|`|VSz10HdSaa	i go martialarts every tuesday and thursday cos i get bullied easy thell ur mum or do a spinng back kick holy ur hand by ur head and spin aroud with ur leg out and it will kick him/her|`|CHbhTVcmaa	fight him with words<br>  <br>  if that doesnt work<br>  <br>  roundhouse kick his face 'chuck norris' style<br>  <br>  this is not a stupid answer<br>  <br>  chuck norris is the man|`|JQdkDQkWaa	Okay, first off.

DpAwEsqvaa	LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL Don't even mention Steyn in the same bredth of as Mitchell Johnson completely different league hahahahahah Mitchell Johnson by a country mile|`|AUmdOhBbaa	Mitchell Johnson is a far better bowler than Steyn, Steyn inconsistent in line and length and really needs to pick up more wickets i mean the test in Durban Bowler's Paradise but he only picked up 3 wickets he is more capeble than that Johnson got 3 for but looked like ge was going to get 6 or 7 and Steyn got Tailenders but Johnson got Top Order Batsmen Hashim Amla and Neil Mckenzie ( Sucks ) and also Boucher who got lost an Inswinging yorker to hard to play. So I say Mitchell Johnson Best Bowler in the world and Steyn is 3rd behind Peter Siddle ( AUS )|`|xPaXWSLLaa	Johnson.|`|2OLOA0ijaa	Steyn - best test bowler last year IN THE WORLD.<br>  And scored above 50 against Oz...|`|CHbhTVcmaa	mitchell johnson<br>  <br>  i dont like steyn<br>  <br>  i reckon hes arrogant<br>  <br>  from what ive seen, that was my impression|`|0NAMYTYsaa	Johnson for sure.|`|LzkujA3Faa	Mitchell Johnson.

However, in light of the mature way Johnson is leading an inexperienced Australian attack to success in one, and likely to be two, in this series, I would have to say Johnson is currently better. Steyn has had a decent series, picking up a fair few wickets himself, so I'd still say he was up in the top 2 or 3 in the world.|`|NKN7SeDtaa	is that ment to be a question!!!! <br>  <br>  cause currently steyn is betta then johnsen in the rankings and no offense is way hotter than johnsen..... especially his eyes... and johnsen is good too though his big gum ,teeth lip or wateva it is isnt that good....<br>  <br>  insane wayne dale STEYN BETTA 101 %|`|2s244jGgaa	MITCHEL JOHNSON <3<br>  <br>  FANTASTIC & DANGEROUS WICKET TAKER.<br>  His style of bowling is fantastic and he is a high wicket taker, always performs under pressure.|`|kecdkv6jaa	I think Johnson.<br>  He has shown numerous times how he can destroy teams both physically and in the score books. Johnson can also hold the bat well.
8T0Z0Y17aa	When he's fully fit and at the top of his game, there is no doubt Flintoff is the best and most influencial all rounder in the world. However, Kallis is the one with 20000 international runs and 500 international wickets and has been consistantly good at the top level for nearly 15 years.<br>  <br>  Edit: Another thing that needs to be pointed out is that Kallis' test batting average is in the mid 50's, whereas Flintoff's is mid 30's and that Kallis is one of only four batsmen to score 4 centuries in 4 consecutive tests. Flintoff though, when fired up, is an arguably better bowler, as he showed at Edgbaston last year in a battle with Kallis, which ended with Kallis' stumps flying all over the place.|`|AA11088802	Kallis|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	flintoff|`|gfxXikenaa	Kallis the best ever allrounder with many records and a brave person who came to bat yesterday even after stitches on the chin.|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	Jaques Kallis is far better allrounder than Andrew Flintoff.|`|A8mKCXuUaa	Jaques Kallis is better.|`|AUmdOhBbaa	Jaques Kallis. Kallis is in my mind one of the best All Rounder's in History he is very good with the bat and can do damage with the ball. Flintoff is also a very good player but he needs to be more consitent with the bat he can make a century in one match and a duck in the next. So if Flintoff can be more consistent with the bat he will be alot of danger to Fast Bowlers around the world|`|NKN7SeDtaa	i like both though kallis is a better batter and flintoff is a better bowler.. and better looking|`|1WQdiPZEaa	Andrew Flintoff.

In my mind Kallis is one of the best All Rounders of all time he is dangerous with the ball and very good with the bat. Flintoff is also very good but inconsistent with the bat one match he get's a Hundred next he gets a Duck. So Kallis is better but Flintoff isn't far behind if Flintoff becomes consistent with the bat he is a danger to all Bowlers.|`|0df7c23b2ec6c594ef9cd80cab3c947daa	Kallis, he has the stats, and he is a great batsman unlike Flintoff who is usually average.|`|CHbhTVcmaa	kallis<br>  <br>  stats tell the story<br>  <br>  check out his test runs and then check out his test wickets<br>  <br>  hes awesome|`|ROGMCn9kaa	flintoff is better because he has to face players using modeern technolgy|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	Kallis mama!!!|`|2OLOA0ijaa	Kallis - no question

First of all, the urgent need of the day is to dismantle the terror network operating on the Pak soil, not merely on account of its attack on cricket, but more importantly due to what it is doing to the very fabric of society as a whole, first of all within Pakistan itself and then across the world.|`|AA11088802	it will organize but not make excitement like 1st one|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|GdJTQX6raa	This IPL, T20 are poisonous to the real cricket.these are commercial extravaganza real cricket is dying in the hands of corporates.I'll say it should never be held. <br>  Security threat is not there at present after Mumbai attack Indians  especially Government woke up and started fool proof method of security.|`|qXkywBogaa	THE IPL IS HAPPENING > I ALLREADY BOUGHT MY TICKETS FOR THE MUMBAI GAME !!!!<br>  <br>  THERE WAS ISSUE COZ THE GENERAL ELECTIONS ARE HAPPENING IN INDIA !

Like main serials on TV are all ending. New ones postponed to starting after it is over.<br>  <br>  IPL has been allowed by the Home Ministry, and that is how it should be.|`|g20ok8mHaa	yakub ka salaam,india has much better security than pakistan,which is a poor country and beggar country (it is yet to repay the loan taken form india at time of partition and has begged lot of money from usa) and there are officials who connive with terrorist .indian's have better intelligence officials and securtiy so it should be held in india maybe after elections are over.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	What message are we sending out to the terrorists if we cancel IPL?

3hOmWoXUaa	It's best to leave the sizing to a reputable bicycle shop.  They'll measure you and fit you on a good bike that will last you a long time.  Components are usually better and will require less tinkering and adjusting than a big box store.<br>  <br>  That said, you may be looking online or used.  I'm 6', 30-ish inseam, and I ride a 17.5" offroad.  If I were riding a hybrid on road, I would ride a 19 or 20.  The 22 is probably too big for you, especially with your longer legs and shorter torso.  <br>  <br>  If you can sit on the bike, the seat height should have your leg slightly bent at the bottom of the pedal stroke (most people set their seat way too low.)  And the rule of thumb for fit is you shouldn't be able to see the front wheel axle, blocked by the straight part of the handlebar.<br>  <br>  If you're only riding on the road, get a road dedicated bike with skinny tires.  They're much faster than wide tire bikes.  Most people think they might ride on trails, but they never do.  If you're going to ride offroad, get a mountain bike.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	at this height 20" frame too big. but i would go to a bike shop and be fitted properly. 18" is more your size.ask your self how much more growing will you do? how many years do you have left on avg to grow?<br>  these are things top talk to a shop about before buying bike. why hybrid? mtn has more options for adjustment parts, tire etc.

e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	around lead of 550|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	At the current run rate, Australia will reach just under 350 by the end of the day, a lead of just over 550, provided the light holds. then think Ponting would bat until about 30 minutes before lunch, with a lead of about 600-625. That would then give the South Africans a tricky little period before lunch.<br>  <br>  He could declare before with about 500-550 on the board, but after losing in Australia, Ponting will want to demoralise SA as much as he can. I say this because remember back to the first Ashes test, when after losing the 2005 Ashes, Ponting wanted to rub our noses in it as much as he could - with a 445 first innings lead he didn't enforce the follow on and added a further 202 runs to set us 648 to win.|`|JC9wAaOsaa	will declare tomorrow at lunch with a lead of 600 plus|`|2s244jGgaa	Yeah around 300. <br>  What a great job they are doing.<br>  AUSTRALIAAAAAA :)|`|GdJTQX6raa	now it is 105 for 1 and Hughes and Ponting going steady.The lead is almost 324 plus.Ricky Ponting should not declare now . Take a lead of 430 plus and give SA chance of reaching that target.|`|XVYRUzkEaa	After Hughes and Ponting get their hundreds. That is another 60 runs needed [Hughes = 70* and Ponting = 70*].

There will never be a time when football is completely free of racism, not until society is completely free of racism at least - which won't be the case for hundreds of years, if ever. Support for the BNP is actually increasing. The only way to deal with it is to ban those ignorant unintelligent people from ever entering a stadium again, in my opinion.

But I do like the fact that they try to recognize the talents of past superstars even tho they werent in the Main Event Mafia. Not so to recognize them if they were in the WWE, but the whole Industry in general like in, for example WCW or ECW. They dont wash down their wrestler's past, which is one reason why I favor TNA. But I think you know the pros and cons, enough have been said already. But I choose TNA for now because as of the moment, the WWE is way too over-rated and needs to step-up, ya'll mean|`|EZf00NJJaa	WWE is better , the stoylines are better , the arenas , the production ....<br>  <br>  TNA Is no.2 , but it has a long way to go still .|`|W8SgRKo7aa	WWE casue all tna either was in wwe or wants to be in wwe.|`|X9iZA9svaa	wwe|`|o9C0du5eaa	The thing with Tna they have had some great wrestler like cm punk ,christian cage and r truth  and petey williams ect Even Vladamir Koslov has apeared in there.

Otherwise, I enjoy watching the TNA X Division. Superstars like Styles, the Motor City Machine Guns, Eric Young, Jay Lethal, and many others are pretty awesome when it comes to they're in ring work. I don't really like the fact that they can cut their promos. Some of them can't cut a promo worth anything and to be honest. I hate Samoa Joe's mic work lol. Other than that, TNA just seems to be basing it's main vocus on former WWE stars such as Angle, Steiner, Nash, Booker, Foley, and even the Dudleyz with the whole Main Event Mafia taking over TNA.|`|LwrFB1ghaa	WWE IS  BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS BETTER STOTLINES AND HAS MORE BETTER WRESTLERS|`|qKi5Co8Jaa	I tend to like TNA more because I think they have better wreslters, but in WWE they have better entertainment segments eg. people talking backstage, people on the mic.|`|KVTW6mCzaa	I love WWE.

Taker is my favorite wrestler, although I'm also a huge fan of HBK. I don't want Taker's streak to end but I have a bad feeling that it's gonna end. Originally Undertaker wanted his "brother" Kane to end the streak but out of respect Kane turned the idea down. Undertaker has said that he would do what was best for the business though. So the streak just might come to an end and I really hate to say that lol. Then again things ALWAYS change at the last minute when it comes to Wrestlemania.|`|tkhlRVn4aa	I am rooting for Undertaker because he at least needs to go 20-0.

IGb7gXpZaa	If you had a previous serious injury you should first strengthen that area by doing some basic exercises before going straight into regular training with the rest of the team. If you had a muscle injury you should try to do some stretching exercises. If you had a broken bone you should try to rest well and do some jogging without tiring the injured area.<br>  <br>  You should also consult your team's trainer/physio, who would surely be able to help you.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	is your name Fernando Torres by chance <br>  <br>  always injured<br>  <br>  play less|`|wQpdot1Raa	You might have the same problem Michael Owen has, you've had a reasonably serious injury and haven't strengthened the muscles sufficiently once its started to heal and now its prone to injury. You may need to do more gym work.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Well, it may be because you're not doing some basic training drills or exercises right. Always remember to stretch before starting to train. And doing exercises in the wrong way can have the opposite effect.
sLVGdCOTaa	Machida will have the belt before too long, Nothing against Rampage or Rashad but his style is very unorthodox and hard to defend, Personally I find his fighting style very interesting not boring,|`|CdAE4nXcaa	Machida will beat anybody in that division everybody he's fought not one of them have landed a devastating blow on him, he's way to elusive, and he's beat some big names in mma. he will beat rampage, or rashad. and keep the belt for a long time.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	The person retaining it until they lose it.

xTPploEcaa	Lucky you, I'm in my 40's and hoping to see Buffalo win one before I die.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes.|`|9j0xuxAOaa	They have bad luck kind of luck the Cubbies!<br>  But with Peterson they have a shot.|`|PMluTf72aa	I'm sure they'll make it again, but as far as winning, that's a whole different story.  So far, Minnesota is 0-4.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  I will say this though, if I had to bet all my money on who would win the big game first between the Vikings of the NFL and Cubs of the MLB, I'd bet the Vikings would win it all first.  Lets face it, the Cubs will probably make it to the postseason this year, then they'll lose, and they'll keep on losing....year after year after year.  Because that's what the Cubs do.  At least the Vikings made it to the Super Bowl 4 times in the last 50 years.  It has been 100 years since the Cubs won it!  Considering you are in your 20's, I'm sure the Vikings will win a Super Bowl at least once.  I don't think it will be anytime soon, but they will or should do it.|`|cdQryr7paa	There are a lot of people that would have asked that same question about whether or not the Cardinals would ever make ths Super Bowl.<br>  Anything is possible.<br>  They Vikes have a great defense and arguably the best running game in the NFL.<br>  Now that they have signed a good QB in Rosenfels, all they need to complete the package is a "go to" WR.<br>  They aren't as far away from the Super Bowl as many would think.<br>  Keep the faith.|`|LvLtAOBFaa	yea you got mad hope now. ap and the addition of sage rosenfels help allot. im just hoping the buffalo bills will win one before my great grandchildren die|`|tWUQU4Juaa	No|`|paIUgtLRaa	Yeah, every team has a chance. Cardinals almost won one, and they haven't won a thing since 1947.<br>  <br>  Vikings have been to the Super Bowl four times. Last time they have been to the championship of the NFC Conference a couple of times since. Last time, they were in the NFC Championship in 2000 against the Giants.<br>  <br>  They will go again, no telling how soon, but it won't be this year, or any year, that has Tavaris Jackson at quarterback. I haven't seen that bad of a quarterback since Vince Young, JaMarcus Russell, and Kordell Stewart. If Jackson was smart, he would look at tape of McNabb, Warren Moon, Steve Young, and Randall Cunningham to get better. Learn from these quarterbacks, or even Ben Roethlisberger to improve. All these quarterbacks are mobile and all had a career that involved lots of success.<br>  <br>  Hold faith, Vikings will be there soon enough.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	I dont think so.  they are in the middle of rankings and that means no great 1st round pick, no great trades, and not lots of money to get FAs. They may win the division, but nothing more. Detroit may have a better chance 'cause they have chances to draft better players now that the former GM is gone.|`|VAx6qu58aa	yes there a team thats begging to be a super power all they need is a good QB they might not just win 1 but 2 superbowls|`|VQyTspNraa	Hey, they have a better chance than the Jets do. Jets = no Super Bowl in last 40|`|bbO4DuwEaa	nope, impossible, i′m sorry|`|AA10225723	I hope. I've been waiting for that since 1969. So I hope its in MY lifetime.|`|JMVkZJzUaa	Odds are - YES.<br>  <br>  It could be a lot worse, you could ask that same question about the Lions|`|KsoUiryAaa	Yes!! I am not a fan of them but their team is looking to be a lot better every year. AP is amazing and getting better every year, and should be around for a while to come for your Vikes. With Bernard Berrian as an emerging #1 WR, they were a lot better, you just need to hold onto all the good players that you can on Offense. You have a long time in your lifetime to see the Vikes sign a franchise QB that they NEED to have and develope. Their D is already amazing at stopping the run, could maybe use just a little work on stopping the pass. I say give it at most 10 years or so and they will win one for you, just hang in there.

8T0Z0Y17aa	Whilst he is only 20 and will get his chance, I agree that he needs some experience. If England was to suddenly find that both Swann and Panesar picked up injuries and he needed to play in the Ashes, it may be too much for him to make debut at that age in the biggest series of them all for an England player. That is why I would give him a little international experience against the West Indies to both assess him and so he doesn't have to be put straight into the pressure cooker of an Ashes test without previous experience. I know Pietersen managed to cope with this in 2005, but he was 25 at the time and had played ODI's previously.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes it's time.|`|AA11088802	i think panesar have some experience and england should not in position to give chance the new buddy in deciding test|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|ms0eYsD5aa	no
0MJRD9sYaa	The 12th man. The fans.|`|KsoUiryAaa	Kinda like the "got milk" slogan, the shirt is referring to the "12th man". The 12th man is the home crowd in a football game and usually referred to them as that because the noise and disruption that they make has to do with how the visiting football team plays. (e.i- loud home noises so that the team cant hear the snap count and there is an offside penalty called)|`|V97YRGn4aa	University of Alabama Crimson Tide.<br>  <br>  12 National Championships !!<br>  <br>  Roll Tide !!!|`|YOKuERs9aa	the 12th man is the huge crowd of fans of the home team...it's just that they make a lot of noise and encourage the home team|`|6e8eb208cb0422b7103ca1b8cb9ab2ecaa	The home crowd is often referred to as the "12th man" by making noise and disrupting the visiting team.

NJMzhcKhaa	You're 15, so you still have a long time to train and build your career.<br>  Train in Jujitsu or judo, find school that also pay attention to the ground game and not only in the throws if you decide to go for judo.<br>  I don't know much about MMA environment in South Wales, do train in BJJ (Brazilian Jujitsu) if you can find one, it's good art to train especially if you intend to go into MMA sport.<br>  You already have the basic of standup with your 6 months boxing practice. Go back to it again later on or go into kickboxing/muaythai to complete your training in standup and ground game.<br>  <br>  Once you're old enough, join local MMA events, keep winning and taking names. If you feel you are good at it, and it's something you want to do and good at, there's nothing better than finding a connection to get into the business.<br>  Find an MMA school that already has several fighters still active in the big MMA events in UK (pretty sure it's Cage Rage there right? with UFC creeping in there).<br>  Big MMA schools will be the first place talent scout look and ask around to fill the fight cards.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nRNsfbE9aa	Your best bet it to study MMA, compete locally and hope to get recognized..it may take a while, but will be worth the wait. I love local MMA events, and so does everyone. Who cares what league it is.. UFC is just a large televised league.. Who cares honestly. Good luck, study hard and train hard. With success on your mind, you will succeed. Do what you can, learn what you can and be successful!|`|AA11434842	You have a long road ahead of you and you should probably think about the fact that only 2% of martial artists go on to fight competitively.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I think most people underestimate how popular Magnum was.  Had the car wreck not ended his career, he would have beaten Flair for the NWA World Title.  Flair and Magnum could have had one of wrestling's greatest rivalries (Magnum's feuds with Nikita Koloff and Tully Blanchard are legendary).  And it's very possible that Magnum would have gone on to be the face and the "Franchise" of WCW in the 90's, not Sting.|`|QouSk1E7aa	Magnum was not the best ring technician in the world, but he was a lot like Jake Roberts. His matches had a lot of psychology and could tell good stories.

H3nbC71eaa	Well, my answer is still basically the same...so I'll repost that:<br>  <br>  <br>  In the Golden Era, most of the Attitude Era gimmicks would probably be heels. Austin would've been a heel easily in the 80's. The Rock I could see as a face though, just because of how funny he was at times on the mic...I could picture him just being a face in the 80's.<br>  <br>  I think most of them would've done very well as heels during the golden era, they just wouldn't be as over the top as they were in the attitude era. We would also actually get to see them in some matches with clean finishes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Give the question some time...since I answered and starred, maybe a bit later on one of my fans will see what I answered and answer it also. It happens with my Q's sometimes..I get an answer...the next morning I have like 10.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	During the first "golden age", the 40's and 50's after TV made it possible for millions to watch, Stone Cold and The Rock would have become big stars as heels.  The Rock would not have overshadowed Gorgeous George but he would have been a huge star.  Gorgeous George was a cultural phenomenon and a household name.  The Rock's narcissus gimmick paled in comparison, but he was so funny on the mic he would have gotten over big.  Stone Cold would have been a no-nonsense ************ heel in the vein of Freddie Blassie.  The fans would have hated him.  For The Rock and Stone Cold both, the fans would have tuned in every week for the same reason I tuned in every week: to see Blassie get beat (didn't happen very often, but that's what I wanted to see).  The Undertaker, Kane, and Mankind would have been too bizarre for that era's audience and would not have been taken seriously at all.  They would have bombed.  Eddie, Jericho, and Benoit would have been beloved faces.  Good-looking, very athletic, very skilled...the fans would have loved them.<br>  <br>  In the second "golden age", the 80's and early 90's after Hulkamania regenerated mainstream interest in pro wrestling, all of them would have done well.  Except for Eddie, Jericho, and Benoit, all would have been heel opponents for Hogan to vanquish.  Eddie and the two Chris' would have been at the IC level, but that's not a bad thing.  At the time, the IC title meant something, unlike today.<br>  <br>  During both "golden ages" Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H would have been stars; they are too talented not to have been.  Michaels wouldn't have been the "showstopper" in the first "age", and Triple H wouldn't have been "the Game"; more likely they would have been popular faces.  And Bret would have been trading the World Title back and forth with Lou Thesz.  Thesz was one of the main faces at the time; Bret would have been his arrogant counterpart.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Get the same result but they would be working as heels getting booed not as tweeners getting cheap pops.
rseD4OG2aa	I think that The Rock would have excelled no matter what era he was in. He had great charisma and a move-set that almost everyone liked.<br>  However, for a guy like Steve Austin, I think that the Attitude Era was really suited to his personality and his wrestling character. In any other wrestling era he wouldn't have been able to pull off any of the wild stunts and mannerisms that made him so popular.|`|QbY18bjkaa	Great back in the day a guy like the rock or stone would fit in as cocky guys that was cool then nd now, taken no **** from no bodi(es)

xTPploEcaa	For the 30 plus years I have been a fan of this football team, I have never seen the Bills front office make such a move. Even during the Kelly and Co. years they were happy with draft picks, usually signing virtually unknowns and meeting with success under Polian and Butler (God Bless).  I have NEVER been so shocked.<br>  <br>  Blue Collar Buffalo- away from the hype but a city as dedicated to its football team as it is to chicken wings and snow removal.<br>  <br>  What I do make of this though, is Mr. Wilson (Congrats to your Hall of Fame election) through his many years of futility of owning this team and 4 times being the bridesmaid never the bride, complaints of the long time suffering fans to bring a big name player in has finally decided that the timing was right. If T.O. was the right choice though, that remains to be seen.  There is no denying his ability to play the game, and he is going to a small town market and will be much under the radar from the circus of what is Dallas. Without the distractions, maybe? With Trent as the QB and the double coverage that T.O. will command, it will open up this offense for Lee Evans. If T.O.is willing to accept this, play his heart out, he might finally endear himself to a town who is so starved for even a playoff berth.|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	Always thought the Bills were a classy team but this just shows they are desperate to win no matter what the cost to the team.They have a young QB that he will bully and other talent that will be in his shadow as he continues to be the same classless player he's always been. <br>  Good luck Bills fans your going to need it.|`|42a808600b09bd222d75e11f7e961238aa	My take on it was that the Bills were more desperate if only to sell more seats in Toronto and Bills Stadium. The needed to take the double team off of Lee Evans so now they have two studs at WR, I like the idea of it even though Kat hates it. It may make the Bill a favorite to win the AFC East if the can coax Trent Edwards into living up to his Hype. TO would have signed with a number of teams. I had thought that the Redskins would have jumped on him as soon as he was released. I guess Dan Synder exercised a little fiscal restarint...yeah right!!|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	If I were Drew Rosenhaus, I would be constantly up TO's *** reminding him to be on his best behavior in Buffalo.  This could very well be the end of the line for TO.  If he jacks things up in Buffalo, then I can't see anyone else wanting to bring him in.  Besides his age (35-36), TO is a proven cancer.  He leaves places worse than when he found them.<br>  <br>  If I were a betting man, I just can't see TO wanting to play with Trent Edwards or JP Losman as QBs.  I have the over/under of week 6 before he blows up at Edwards or Dick Jauron on the sideline.|`|g0LP0Cx0aa	I think T.O., yet at the same time Buffalo is in need of some attention I guess. They just hurt themselves, I wouldn't expect much this season if I was a Buffalo fan. Can you see T.O. in Upstate NY in December? He is not going to be real productive. I guess he will sell tickets though.|`|Bd4gIzwXaa	Mr. Owens.|`|0MJRD9sYaa	Terrell Owens|`|YOKuERs9aa	T.O.<br>  <br>  <br>  the fag wants his name to be known so bad that he signs to a team that a lot of people predict he'll suck on|`|gRXy66dOaa	T.O|`|rRlTtoylaa	Asked like a true journalist.  Unfortunately for the Bills they have been desperate for a winner for a long time.  I don't think T.O. is the answer but it's too late now.  Bills fans can only hope that at least for next season, things work out.  I doubt it.<br>  <br>  T.O. is on the downside of an impressive career statistically.  If not for his craziest it could have been better.  As an Eagles fan I can only imagine what they could have don't if T.O. was a normal, rational person and had stayed.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	The Bills want to put an end to their suffering seasons and hope that TO will help. And TO was more than happy to sign, he had to know about the lack of desire by other teams.<br>  But, TO is poison in the locker room. I really don't see him changing and the Bills took a chance on him that they may come to regret. There's a chance, a small chance, that he may do better in Buffalo without the extreme publicity. He should talk to Randy Moss, I think Randy has added a few years just by staying away from the media trash and this wouldn't hurt the older Owens to do so. He's going to have to realize he's not a young guy anymore...But we'll see...
cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Yes,the "Dawn of Indian Era" is going to start very soon.|`|87D3wCufaa	I would have agreed if Vettori & O'Brien were not missing from the bowling line up and further if India had not allowed the ninth wkt partnership to score at more than 12 per over for so many overs bringing the required run-rate from 12+ down to 10+ level. India should have won today's game by a margin of over 100 runs after scoring the highest ever total in NZ and also India's highest ever total against any test playing nation. Some way to go before competing for the tag of the champion team!! ICC ranking can only be foolproof if the top rank can be maintained by a team over a long period (at least for about 12 months) like Aussies had managed to do in the past. <br>  There is no doubt though that the potential is obvious enough, especially coming to the fore starting from the Tri-Series in Australia last year which India won in 2 straight finals obviating the need for a third deciding final game!!|`|HSXxRjysaa	NO<br>  <br>  Why ?<br>  <br>  India has a Very very Poor record In SouthAfrica..they HAVE TO win against SouthAfrica in South Africa..till now only 60 % of the task is completed <br>  <br>  and SouthAfrica too do not deserve to be no.1 team..their record is pathetic in England and they have too prove their strength in India and Srilanka|`|XVYRUzkEaa	Yes, I don't see any reason that we can't...<br>  We will be the ODI Champions along with being the T20 Champions...Then we will become undisputed Champion :-)|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	Yes!<br>  <br>  By the end of 2009 India will be No. 1 in ODIs.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	I think, for the time being we will be behind...just, Australia.

India have gone up 2-0, and though the margin of victory - 58 runs - may indicate they won convincingly, New Zealand gave them a serious scare. Ryder and McCullum started off superbly , adding 166 in pretty quick time.<br>  <br>  India were poor in the field to start with, dropping the openers and conceding quite a few runs by way of misfields and overthrows. However, Raina sparked somewhat of a revival after running out McCullum and Yuvraj followed suit, getting rid of Ross Taylor. <br>  <br>  New Zealand lost eight wickets for 95 runs and that lost the match for them. There was superb resistance towards the end and it seemed at one point that Mills and Southee could make the Indians pay for letting it slip after they had been in command throughout the middle overs. <br>  <br>  However, the visitors were just one wicket away from sealing a win, and once Mills was gone, so was the match for the home team. A competitive game nevertheless, and India have ensured they can't lose this series from here on.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS TO INDIA FOR WINNING!<br>  AND HATS OFF TO SACHIN FOR PLAYING A SQUAHBUCKLING INNINGS!<br>  GOD BLESS~|`|mber3JoAaa	That was a brilliant performance by the Indian batsmen, especially Yuvraj and Sachin. They deserved that victory, although some of the bowling towards the end gave away a few runs. Overall a well deserved victory for India.<br>  <br>  I only hope Tendulkar is fit to play in Hamilton as I will be going to that match and it would be great to see him bat in person.|`|MwjDCSLpaa	it was a good match.|`|YxmHTqKGaa	To be honest I think the Indian team doesn't get enough credit compared to SA in ODIs.

Well done NZ, however, you have to plan your innings and build partnerships with some player sheet anchoring.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	The first three and a half hours belonged to India, and that's why we won. India made mistakes but NZ too reciprocated through the run outs, so it evened out.

Pyk9Lyfpaa	I think John Cena is awesomee. okay? his moves are awesomee and its entertaining to watch him wrestle. he suprises many fans when he wrestles. he starts losing but then at the end he wins the match. he wants that title. if u were him u would want a chance at the title.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I don't think me and you are watching the same John Cena.

Maybe, you need to watch a match of his a do a recount.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	I agree. Cena can never go without being in a title match and it is really annoying.

hJUGtce7aa	I thought I read the contract details and he has a no trade clause. Even if he didn't, I don't think it would work. either Dodger fans would be mad or no one would want him and his salary(and drama).|`|yk4S7uuraa	I don't think anyone but the Padres will be out of contention in that division in July.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	This is the NL West, no team will be out of contention by July, even the Padres and Rockies will have some hope left as late as mid August. That being said I don't think they will trade Manny at all unless he becomes too big of a distraction, and then not til the end of the season. I think the Dodgers are the favorites to win the west, and a big reason why the Padres and Rockies only have til August and not September to be in contention.|`|SaCMyfHPaa	I dont think that they would even if they only won 20 games, but if Manny puts up the same numbers as Anderw Jones did last year he may be run out of town by the fans instead.  But that wont happen manny will hit 45 homers this year.  MVP|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	I look for Manny to be with the Dodgers for two years.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	no,, His contract is less expensive in yr 2 and the dodgers will try to reload if they fail this season.|`|7YdiNtqVaa	I think it may be hard to trade him with the contract he has. Not a lot of teams can or would be willing to take that contract. And since there weren't a lot of teams knocking on his door when he was unsigned, teams didn't seem all that interested in having him in the lineup or paying what he was looking for.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	I don't think so, even if the Dodgers get eliminated from contention they still need to have a guy like Manny.|`|AA11471458	Possibly, but only if they're in last.

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|bUUjQVhKaa	how are we supposed to know?|`|CMpyekpNaa	6'2 at 14 that is dam too good.<br>  <br>  obvoisly, just work on your legs (do exercises up-rises) by the time you reach 15/16 you can do it.|`|GQi9wRLZaa	Just do it!|`|jDi063pQaa	Just check out this guy.

Stretching helps improve the elasticity of muscles.|`|QXH5jOwEaa	Well i was about your height and i could dunk it at your age and what i did was jump rope.

A1ohtlWsaa	I agree tennis man and you have both summed it up they just arent nice people.Great players though.<br>  Also its disgusting and despicable that someone is saying that people dont like them cos of their race I have black mates(one who refers to them as the williams brothers) who dont like them so would you say their racist for nit liking the williams sisters .no of course not ,but as im white and I dont like im racist apparently according to kellyhann.<br>  Stupid thing to say<br>  <br>  Also telling people to kill themselves because they disagree with youre despicable ignorant comments,. what is wrong with you.<br>  edit - nina how am i a freak Im making a point that its not racist to dislike the Williams sisters.And that people who play that card are pathetic.<br>  This is not a race issue I just think they are unpleasant and arrogant.<br>  if it is racist then Kellyhann is racist for disliking sharapova or if anyone at all dislikes mugabi then they are racist(see its a stupid thing to say)<br>  nina please explain what you disagree with|`|B8Gwxo1laa	It's really all subjective isn't it. I have no problem liking them, recognizing their talent as players and seeing them as respectful of other players. <br>  Venus after her loss to Carla Suarez Navarro at the AO--<br>  <br>  <br>  Q. Obviously a difficult loss. Would you tell us what happened, what went wrong out there?<br>  <br>  VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, you know, I think she played some really good tennis. She was super consistent and aggressive and just went for her shots. I think she just played really well.<br>  <br>  Q. What do you think made the difference? You looked in control of the match the first set. It turned around after that.<br>  <br>  VENUS WILLIAMS: Yeah, like I said, she played well. You know, I think she took her opportunities and really showed a lot of character.<br>  <br>  It's pretty close after the match. We haven't quite figured out exactly, you know, which areas went wrong. But I definitely have to credit her. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just one example, just my opinion.|`|8HALBjQVaa	Because they are up themselves like the majority of the American sports people....you can not deny the talent of American athletes and sports stars in many sports,but I can not name a humble one...if there is a sport that they do not dominate,then they bag it...they are bad in defeat but they are even worse when they win and that′s what the public hate,especially in tennis.|`|1w5blbobaa	Ohhh god enough is enough----Hv U ever heard anything BAD for from the WILLIAMS SISTER to their opponent!!!!!!!!!!! NO !!!!!!<br>  <br>  PRAISING YOURSELF DOESN'T MEAN THAT UR DISRESPECTING UR OPPONENT(why this simple thing people misunderstand!!!!!!!!!)<br>  <br>  If Im saying Im GOOD is that mean others are BAD??????<br>  <br>  They do all the basic respectable gestures like any other player.& WHY people judge the WILLIAMS SISTERS on the basis of their press conference!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Don't u guys think that WHAT WILLIAMS SISTERS DID FOR WOMEN'S TENNIS they deserve peoples love!!!!!!!!|`|j1BTIYcCaa	I like them, they are good tennis players and very entertaining to watch.<br>  I have never seen them bad tempered or waste time calling the trainer just to annoy their opponent, there is one top player who consistently does that - Jankovic.<br>  I hope they are around for a long time to come.|`|HNnVrvCfaa	They confused arrogance with confidence.  I think Serena is worse than Venus - Venus has mellowed slightly with age.|`|slnEu8xlaa	i fully agreed with kellyhann and OIN<br>  To marcus:the freaks here are you and tennis man|`|0RfAT62Qaa	First of all kellyhann, shut up! This isn't about race ok? NOw on to the question. If you see one of the sisters lose, they will never give their opponent any credit at all. It will be "oh I didn't play well" "I hit so many shots out" It's ridiculous. Can't they just say "Wow. My opponent played great." No. Never. Another scenario that comes to mind is when Serena said that she should be the real number one in the world when Jankovic was. That is so rude and ridiculous to say. And you're right, they brag and brag and brag and it's so annoying. I will find myself hoping that they lose when I watch them play even though they're American. Everything you said was very true.<br>  <br>  Also kellyhann, remember that one Wimbledon where Serena pulled her calf or something? Remember what she screamed at her opponent when her opponent hit a dropshot? Well if you don't, it wasn't something very pleasent...maybe you should have the slightest idea what you are talking about before you answer a question.|`|y6pTIQdlaa	i think you pretty much answered the question yourself - "they are so unlikeable. They never respect their opponents (win or lose) unless it's the sister and they are NEVER humble" - its so true. i have never liked them and although i think i am in the minority and i do respect he is an incredible player i also really dislike andy murray for almost the same reason.|`|PWIcfCbxaa	dunno i hate them both.Great players but horrible attitudes though.Totally agree about the respect thing they dont show opponents any and think they can beat anyone which if it were true they'd hve broken Grafs 22 slam record by now.<br>  They are many women in history that were better and more humble Martina Navratilova is one of the best singles players ever and certainly best doubles in the womans game and she was nowhere near as arrogant.and steffie graf wasnt either.<br>  <br>  edit- omg i cant believe someone played the race card in answering this what a ******* *****.Its not racist just cos you dislike a person and they happen to be black.<br>  ansteffie graf wasnt either.d|`|CyjuTf0raa	Because they are both very arrogant and disrespectful.<br>  <br>  I lost total interest in Serena when she once asked for a restroom break before an opponents serve in an obvious attempt to kill her opponents momentum, but then won the game and when the umpire told her she could take the restroom break now, she denied.
e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	NZ cant come back|`|4VoQduaZaa	It is this lack of cricketing sense and casual attitude from Munaf that was about to cause us the match today. I am not sure how people can take things for granted at international level. I can understand if you or I do it .. considering our collective experience and knowledge of cricket. But doing the same at an international level is criminal. I was so frustrated when I saw him laughing after getting hit by Mills and Southee. This is no demolition job, dude. It was an escape. But anyway, congratulations to India (and all of us) for winning this match and congrats to NZ for a great fight.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	It was a good win to India but a demoltion job? I think not. They got an excellent start with Tendulkars 186 (I don't know who got MOM but it should be Sachin) but at the end there was only 58 runs difference meaning that the Kiwis put on over 300.  Hopefully the rest of the series will be just as good as this game.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	They really put up a good show both at the beginning and for the 9th wicket.  Had Mill continued, New Zealand might have won the game.  Well done New Zealand.  We love your performance and the gamely and spirited  fight put in by you.  It is victory for clean and gentlemanly cricket today.<br>  <br>  So it was not a demolition but a spirited fight put in NZ.  They went down all guns blazing!|`|RGxMkT0zaa	NZ is giving a good fight. Makes matches interesting. <br>  They fought till the end.<br>  <br>  Indians made many mistakes.Dropping catches; even by Dhoni. Bad fielding. Not so good bowling.<br>  Must do better next time.<br>  <br>  The good thing was Sachin's batting and his partenership with Dhoni.<br>  Indians 2-1. Congrats.|`|1yVSvCXKaa	India were poor in the field to start with, dropping the openers and conceding quite a few runs by way of misfields and overthrows. However, Raina sparked somewhat of a revival after running out McCullum and Yuvraj followed suit, getting rid of Ross Taylor. <br>  New Zealand lost eight wickets for 95 runs and that lost the match for them. There was superb resistance towards the end and it seemed at one point that Mills and Southee could make the Indians pay for letting it slip after they had been in command throughout the middle overs. <br>  The end of a highly entertaining game. India have gone up 2-0, and though the margin of victory - 58 runs - may indicate they won convincingly, New Zealand gave them a serious scare. Ryder and McCullum started off superbly , adding 166 in pretty quick time.<br>  But yes, it was a highly entertaining game. And one record has been made in this ODI match. Most sixes in an ODI game ever. <br>  Good performance by The Kiwis but it wasn't enough.<br>  CONGRATULATIONS TO INDIA FOR WINNING!|`|87D3wCufaa	I believe NZ may make a sort of comeback at Hamilton, provided Daniel wins the toss and decides to bat first. In every likelihood, Sachin will sit out to get full rest after the muscle twist he sufferred which caused him to retire hurt depriving him the opportunity of having a go at the first ever double-ton to be hit by any batsman in ODIs. In the absence of Sachin, the present Indian team could well falter while chasing!!|`|hRlLyVrYaa	Whatever dude, demolition would have been the word if India had done them by 1 or 2 hundred runs, but a paltry 58 runs with 5 overs left was a very narrow squeak for India indeed. Be thankfull and give a bit of credit where credit is due.<br>  <br>  Thumbs downers can KMA too :-)|`|bN6S0FJEaa	I feel sorry for your cricket knowledge.<br>  <br>  NZ was in the game until the last partnership btwn Mills and Southee.|`|04Mvb5dmaa	They can't win the series now.|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	Come on!!

1jmXT4Vvaa	It's not bad, considering the price.  I have been hearing better reviews of the Mossberg Silver Series over unders.  I'm not a mossberg fan, and it kills me recommending it, but from what I've heard, it's the best cheap over under,plus mossberg doesn't make them, just imports them.  I'd also look at the cz with dual triggers.  Most of the problems the cheap over unders have is with the single trigger firing both barrels simultaneously.  If it was me I'd opt for the cz mallard.<br>  <a href="http://www.cz-usa.com/products_shotguns.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cz-usa.com/products_shotguns....</a>|`|wmhwBhv8aa	The condor is a great workhorse for any hunting chore.

I'll accept "past his prime," but really  you need to cut a break for those of us who are older but still consider people of your generation to be callow youths who might benefit from, if you will pardon the idiom, a clue.<br>  <br>  Thank you and good night, it's time for my Metamucil.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I second Cappo359's comments.<br>  <br>  And Scott Steiner is not featured on TNA to put on stellar wrestling matches, that's not his role in the company.  He is, indeed, not a kid, and can't compete in the ring with the likes of AJ Styles and Alex Shelley anymore.  Scott Steiner is on TNA because of his gimmick, as a "personality" and a "character".

You trainer need to be there and approve your fight.  The fights are set up at the same day weight in.  They set you up with similar record score and closeness of weight class. )Differentiate 8lbs.  Meaning 130lbs you will go against 122 lbs or 138 lbs person. Yes mostly do drug test only on Golden Glove or Blue ribbon.  Depending on bouts some have regular test and some don't.  Some boats need a clean drug test confirm by your gym in order to fight.  Cheekpads it depend on the bouts as well.  BUT as long as you have a headgear with or without a cheekpad but STAMP USA AMATURE BOXING APROVE then you can wear it to any boxing bouts.  Hopefully this answers all your questions.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Amateur fights are usually in tournaments.<br>  You may or may not have to pay a gym fee, but if you are on a team you will not have to pay the trainer.<br>  They do not test at all fights, because it is expensive.

The Law Lords agreed that Titan Sports had violated a 1994 agreement which had limited the permissible use of the WWF initials overseas, particularly in merchandising. Both companies used the initials since March 1979.  On May 5, 2002, the company quietly changed all references on its website from "WWF" to "WWE", while switching the URL from WWF.com to WWE.com. The next day, a press release announced the official name change from World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., or WWE, and the change was publicized later that day during a telecast of Monday Night Raw, which emanated from the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut. For a short time, WWE used the slogan "Get The 'F' Out." The company had also been ordered by the Lords to stop using the old WWF Attitude logo on any of its properties and to censor all past references to WWF, as they no longer owned the trademark to the initials WWF in 'specified circumstances'. Despite litigation, WWE is still permitted use of the original WWF logo, which was used from 1984 through 1997, as well as the "New WWF Generation" logo, which was used from 1994 through 1998. Furthermore, the company may still make use of the full "World Wrestling Federation" and "World Wrestling Federation Entertainment" names without consequence.|`|rzuXnXIMaa	In Year 2000, WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Charged a Lawsuit against<br>  Then WWF (World Wrestling Federation) To Change Their Company's<br>  Name B'coz They Said That WWF Initials R Copyrighted by Them<br>  Thats Why.......

That franchise does not need help finding disaster.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	Personally i think his career is screwed, he will be out of there next summer|`|HpBKn35Caa	omfg shut up and stop putting the buffalo bills down how would u like it if i put ur team yea well shut up then and im so happy for this i cant wait to see him in buffalo and watch frist game vs pats hel win it for us then we can rub it in pats face and lol at them there gonna be soo pissed and how is this a bad move yea the guy is troble but the bills are really close so are the fans were prolly the best fans in the nfl we have a song everytime we score a td and when the power went out here the fans started signing it so i think t.o wont have a problem here|`|iufEdQySaa	at first i just couldn't believe it cuz the bills never do this.<br>  secondly i thought it was a bad idea <br>  then after thinking about it- its a terrific move, he brings an offensive explosion the bills haven't had since the mid 90's<br>  everybody wanted to sign laverneus coles here but T.O. is way above him and actually was cheaper to get<br>  buffalo hasn't made the playoffs in 9 yrs and finished 7-9 three yrs in a row so why not roll the dice on him for one year <br>  miami was a 1-hit wonder last year / jets have no QB / and tom brady is coming off a serious injury / anything is possible and the bills know they can go for the division title this year<br>  personally i am happy to see it------------GO BILLS|`|cdQryr7paa	I am happy to see him anywhere besides in Dallas.<br>  YAY!!!!|`|qQq23yziaa	really could care less. I kind of like the bills so I do feel sorry for them|`|L68Sd6obaa	If you are a Buffalo fan, I would be very upset! The only folks that should be happy are the Dallas Cowboys. Someone took on their problems. The games will begin in Buffalo, but not the one being played on the field. Like TO says, "Get your popcorn ready!"|`|8x8FIm9zaa	As a Pats fan, couldn't be happier he came to our division.  He will ruin them for one year.  And we get to boo his arrogant *** outta Gillette.

If you train hard and really want to dunk , then you have to keep working at it until you can . Will you ever be able to is a question that really and truly only you can answer because you are the one that wil have to train and train hard until you get the desired results . If it helps any , you are certainly on track to be big enough to do it . Spud Webb years ago was from Wilmer Hutchins high school in the Dallas area . He was about 5'4' and never really gained much height , but he was special , so special that at halftime of many of his games , he would put on a show of his ball handling ability and his jumping ability.<br>  He could dunk in high school , college , and ended up dunking on much bigger opponents in the NBA. So your answer is yes if you really want to do it .|`|qDBeG26Saa	yeah if you just practice jumping and eat lots of calcium and grow you will easily be able to dunk|`|jDi063pQaa	Thats up to you dude.

wbhqShh6aa	You have to know your dealer to know if and how much haggling is accepted.  I have successfully haggled on a brand new gun in a gun store...while others wont even talk to you if you do that.  Generally any kind of old gun, or any antique item for that matter, is expected to be haggled unless its something unusual or in perfect mint condition.  When someone indicates "not firm" in their price then I automatically assume that they have priced it high to allow for some haggling...you in turn should offer a lower price than you really would be willing to pay, and hopefully you both are satisfied with some kind of compromise.  Haggling is ok as long as your offer is not so low that it is viewed as offensive to the owner.  Make a fair offer and see what happens.  I thought your note was ok.  Good luck!

Wang has turned up the heat in a recent interview on MSG with Howie Rose during Rangers-Isles game.

I had to quit my job when I went to study abroad, and so I had to pay my tuition with student loans, but it was worth it to be able to study abroad.  Once I was abroad I began to enjoy having a life despite being a student.  Even so it would have been a better idea to try to get a scholarship.|`|RBLobvLiaa	I am fuc*ing confused.

wPlfPc0gaa	Looks to me like it is going to be a cakewalk for Australia.<br>  <br>  Since it is only the 3rd day, Ponting will be in a dilemma as when to declare (if they are not bowled out before that). What kind of target is a safe one? Provided, if the opposition has got enough time and a good start, they may chase down a target like 500. If the time is too less, and the target perceivably unattainable, South Africa will play for a draw. It is not going to be an easy decision.|`|kecdkv6jaa	1/68 as i speak.<br>  <br>  And Australia will only need to get 9 wickets (because of Smith) and the way the pitch is playing now i feel the wickets should come relatively easily.<br>  <br>  Ponting just needs to time his declaration good and they will be a huge chance at winning this test and the series.|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	I think that these are the current odds.<br>  <br>  Aussie Win: 85<br>  Draw: 10<br>  South Africa Win: 5<br>  <br>  Based on this, yes, Australia are heading for a victory and really should win.|`|mZ2Uluioaa	cricket is funny game , it can change very fast~|`|SWxnbKyyaa	I want see Australia back in its old ways, I'd have liked them to have imposed the follow on.Not being critical, but after seeing what happened in the first test(getting bowled out for 158),follow on would have been better<br>  <br>  Edit- I forgot to answer your question,yeah, in all likelihood they are in pole position to win this test.All they need to do is to show a better resolve than they did in the last test,declare when they are at 250 odd and things should be fine|`|mj1bC73gaa	I'd like to know what was with the wasted ball this morning.

He could end up better.<br>  <br>  Kallis is brilliant and you can't write off AB de V or Boucher ... ever<br>  <br>  But if the Aussies can post anything like 200, the proteas will be in big doo-doo.  Of course I'd like to see Australia put 300 up there.<br>  <br>  That said - what was the first innings? 7-50 something  ...

Just listen to him speak haha.<br>  PRICK - Sean Avery of course<br>  <br>  Avery would be voted out first, and Biron would win (because he's not the strongest, so he would probably fly under the radar for a while).<br>  <br>  3.) I only watch it casually, and this season looks boring, so I'm not watching.|`|naZQqrNeaa	I have never seen an episode of survivor in my life.

How about Brodeur again, lol. <br>  DEFENSEMAN - Sheldon Souray...on the comeback<br>  CHECKING LINE CENTER - On a non-lazy night - Jokinen.  As much as I hate the guy....he can land some nice ones. <br>  PRICK - Chris Neil.....hands down<br>  <br>  Chris Neil would be voted off first, because he sucks.  Man, I am technical, lol.<br>  <br>  3.  As stated before, I had never seen an episode. I'm not a fan of "reality" tv....except Deadliest Catch.|`|9wblT5sYaa	1.

Ovie<br>  Lindstrom<br>  Chelios<br>  Boogaard<br>  Miller<br>  Chara<br>  Kaleta<br>  Avery <br>  <br>  Thortan would win.  Chelios may come off as old and inefficent (even though he's not, well he's old but he can still play the puck).  I would say Avery, but it seems like the pricks always stick around for a while.<br>  <br>  3. After the 25th season I just had enough|`|jBXutMblaa	Ovechkin.  Why?

pYXkhw6Jaa	It definitely depends on the settings as far as points and etc I am going to assume it's a default 5x5 H2H league. <br>  <br>  I never like taking a pitcher high and I have won many league without drafting a pitcher in the first 5 rounds. There are a good number of starters out there. You can start a large number of pitchers each week and win Ks Ws and Svs and take a chance at ERA and Whip.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1st Round<br>  I have looking for a quality proven all round hitter here.. I don't want someone that will smash 50 but only hit 250 and I don't want someone people are predicting to do well or someone who is coming off a huge season that doesn't have a track record aka Josh Hamilton. Secondly don't reach just because the position is thin.<br>  <br>  Since you're picking 2nd I would say A-Rod or Reyes <br>  <br>  Round 2-5 <br>  This is where I would take a player that is on the prime for a break out year such as BJ Upton or Curtis Granderson a little later. Once again i'm not looking at SP or RP here and once again I'm taking BPA don't worry about filling in postions until your roster is almost full. It's ok to take 2 3bs or 4 OFs before you draft a SS. Trade bait and you have a utility spot. <br>  <br>  Round 6-10 <br>  In these rounds go ahead and grab a starter or too, someone who has dropped that has potential to be good or maybe a stud coming back from injury that people are scared of. If you didn't get an elite catcher don't reach in these rounds for someone that is a round 15 talent. You can pick up a closer here but honestly I wouldn't panic here there are 32 teams and most teams in your league will only carry 2 leaving 8 extra =).<br>  <br>  Round 11-15<br>  Grab a couple closers in here some more SP and finish filling in your roster in these rounds. Remember a bust here won't ruin your season so grab those Howie Kendricks that people will be scared to touch. <br>  <br>  The rest of the draft.<br>  I'm not a big fan of carrying alot of hitters on the bench I like to maybe have one extra at the most so in these rounds I would grab another closer, I always like to have 3-4 maybe a MRP that could steal a closers job mid season and some more SP. I like to have at least 7 starters and find myself picking up and dropping probable starters with favorable match ups throughout the season.|`|p3rnyBoYaa	This year there appears to be a top five that includes:<br>  <br>  Albert Pujols 1B STL<br>  Hanley Ramirez SS FLA<br>  David Wright 3B NYM<br>  Alex Rodriguez 3B NYY<br>  Jose Reyes SS NYM<br>  <br>  Since the short stop position is more scarce then third or first base, I would take Hanley Ramirez if he was there and Jose Reyes if Hanley went as the first pick.|`|Dilobt5gaa	You want to take positions with rare good players like SS, 3B, 2B, C. But in the first rounds take players that are the best there. And since you only have 7 pitchers you can take them later, cuz there'll be good ones on the waivers if you need it. If you have the second pick Hanley Ramierez will probably be gone, so I'd take Alex Rodriguez. He might have taken steroids, but you can't put an asterisk on Fantasy Baseball. If Hanley is still there take him. Just my opinion.|`|8PJT8gpYaa	I took Hanley Ramirez (Marlins-SS) with the 2nd pick..  <br>  Other choices are Pujols,A.Rod,and D.Wright.<br>  (You can't go wrong with any of these players..)

nvFrVVxaaa	Raw is the best brand because WWE puts the best wrestlers on there and they have very interesting storylines.  Not to mention, they have very good matches and main events to watch.  There was a reason why they put John Cena on RAW.  His character makes WWE a lot of money because people like him and the storylines that he's in.  Smackdown and ECW are like the brands that have spawned from Raw, in other words RAW's children, but they aren't as good because Raw was the first and the best.|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	It Depends i like all three brands although My Favourite Brand WAS Raw and in the Day ECW along with WCW was one of my favourite orginasations <br>  <br>  Hmmmmm.......<br>  <br>  Raw is still one of My favourite brands but most probly not my favourite any more seeing that the storylines are starting to get quite Lame (apart from the Orton Mc Mahon's Storyline)<br>  <br>  My top 5 favourite superstars at the moment are<br>  (Raw Brand)<br>  5.Dolph Ziggler<br>  4.JBL<br>  3.Shawn Michaels<br>  2.Chris Jericho<br>  1.Randy Orton<br>  <br>  Then Again Most of my old favourites are on the wwe smackdown Brand  such as Jeff Hardy,Edge,Tripple H and so on so here are my top 5 favourite Smackdown Superstars and the Reason To watch smackdown<br>  <br>  My top 5 favourite superstars at the moment are<br>  (Smackdown Brand)<br>  5.Shelton Benjamin<br>  4.Tripple H<br>  3.Undertaker<br>  2.Jeff Hardy<br>  1.Edge<br>  <br>  also for watching the young Lions as christian stated you may want to tune into ECW even though it isnt extreme any more and i will always remember ECW for how it was then and not how it is now i still tune into ECW to see what goes on so here are my favourites and from my point of veiw the Talent to watch in ECW<br>  <br>  My top 5 favourite superstars at the moment are<br>  (ECW)<br>  5.Tyson Kidd<br>  4.John Morrison<br>  3.Christian<br>  2.Jack Swagger<br>  1.Evan Bourne|`|CbTd5kvoaa	Smackdown because of Undertaker Jeff Hardy Edge.

It also has a lot of the better storylines too in my opinion. But Smackdown and ECW are good as well. Smackdown will occasionally have decent stroylines and if your looking for a good hour of technical wrestling with minimal storylines than ECW is your answer.|`|UDqMdvESaa	Raw<br>  SmackDown<br>  <br>  Nobody should watch ECW it SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA10486365	Raw isnt the same w/o Triple H.

89a7ac00e4c9522764b66424397919f3aa	I'm saying Mike Green from the Washington Capitals. First off, he's leading all the defensemen in everything (I think) or almost.

KVlRYoidaa	no,just like wrestling.|`|V7lGsaR8aa	Yes it's for real and as you say it is brutal .

But it's not my cup of tea either one that you bump into when you swap channels|`|7domw3t5aa	man theyre as real as it gets! No knock from me about UFC those guys are serious. But not my cup of tea. They take punishment to give punishment. I dont like that. The sweet science of boxing is where it is at. How much damage can u do to ur opponent without being hit back!|`|ZpShIvylaa	They are real, and there not bare Knuckle fights they have small gloves. People get busted up all the time, I saw a fight last weekend when a guy got knocked out, and he was shaking for like 5 min. He was taken out on a stretcher.|`|AnaI7OBJaa	There is plenty of blood! Watch again!<br>  <a href="http://www.competitiveurge.com/speed_punch_challenge" rel="nofollow">http://www.competitiveurge.com/speed_pun...</a>|`|ZBcqZG2Saa	They wear gloves
NJMzhcKhaa	Yes, MMA is real, they real sport recognized my respective state athlete comission on the state the events being held. Usually either California or Nevada, being a sport they have to adhere to all rules related to sport person, which include drug testing and medical inspection. UFC is one of the organization that hold MMA (Mixed Martial Art) events.<br>  <br>  Early UFC fights, before they're recognized by State Athlete Comission, they're bare knuckles fights with very limited rules, they even allow groin strikes and hair pulling.<br>  If you youtube Pat Smith vs Morris, Keith Hackney vs Joe Son, and Gary Goodridge vs Herrera<br>  You'll see blood, groin strikes and brutal KOs.<br>  <br>  The reason wound are more apparent in your examples of street fight were mainly due to lack of training in the person. He was either sucker punched and receive the whole brunch of the punch or does not know how head movement and how to roll with punch and just take the punch hard.<br>  <br>  UFC also wear mini gloves that protect the knuckles and also padded the cutting impact too. That's why most of the wound opened in the UFC fight happened using elbow.<br>  <br>  Unless you download pirated stuff, there's no free full UFC fights.<br>  I suggest to rent the UFC/Pride DVD out there. Many places have $1 weekly special (if you're in Australia) or $20 monthly no limited rent special (Blockbuster in US)|`|S0N3BRecaa	video.google.com<br>  <br>  Do a search for "Pat Smith vs Scott Morris" that should prove to you when UFC was bare knuckle (they're not anymore, as they're sanctioned fights) it was real. And u see blood. ;)<br>  <br>  Also, more recently do a search for "Frank Mir vs Tim Sylvia".|`|u9HfvzL9aa	you cant script these fights without people knowing them....... UFC is 100 percent real.... but there have been questions about lower MMA Associations like Elite XC ..but yes MMA is 100 percent real....and the rings are stained with blood ....broken bones happen alot<br>  <br>  just youtube MMA|`|5KjvNg2oaa	there is blood in many fights first off, second off do you wear gloves in a street fight?  watch ufc 1-5 if you want to see no rules no gloves bloody fights.|`|nRNsfbE9aa	I wonder the same thing man.. But I feel if it were fake, why would there be so much blood and brutality?? I know a few people who compete in MMA, and there is nothing fake about it. UFC is just an organized league for MMA, therefore I feel it is all real..unlike televised wrestling lol.|`|kD4OHI4caa	They are definitely real. I have watched at least 20 of them... roughly UFC 70 through 90, and people really, truly get hurt. I don't see anything about these fights that are staged. And I have seen a few guys so bloodied up that the fight was stopped.|`|cpr4KtAmaa	UFC has more stringent rules now than used to be the case.  Back in the good old days, there were frequently broken limbs (usually due to submission holds) and widespread loss of conscience!!  Definitely real, just a bit wimpier now.|`|pFlcrWolaa	They are real. I watch with my husband all the time.|`|vyGyLV7paa	100% real|`|4gMVe1Tsaa	Yea UFC fights are real i train in MMA and its the real deal|`|LUnscegvaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  As real as you can go ( within their rules )<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	They are real, but they are not bare knuckled.

JEMtVVkBaa	too right, he is my fave too.<br>  <br>  but when South Africa were playing the tests here, he didnt come in until the third test I think. <br>  <br>  He is out here every summer and he does have a place in Aussie sport...most known cricket umpire at school and KFC's favourite umpire too!<br>  <br>  but because Australia (currently the best team) are normally playing the other highly ranked teams, he is a top umpire - so he should get the top games.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	Hey, He is one of the very few honest umpires who judges impartially and correctly.

They call them elite umpires.<br>  <br>  You will see him often as there are only about 12 of these top umpires and two are Australian leaving about 10 who can umpire our games.

pLrTfvo9aa	I reckon Brett Lee's attitude in India and his less than back breaking efforts against NZ and SA (yeah yeah Brett pretend it was injury and not lack of commitment), should consign him to the ranks of ex Test players alongside Symonds and Hayden. And worse for him = unlike them he isnt Ricky's BBQ buddy + he = 1 Dimensional expensive bowler with age against him. Good riddance Brett. Dont need ya.|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	This Australian attack seems to have potential, but it has only performed in two tests. Remember how it was cost them in Australia. Lee would still walk back into the side with ease as he has a thousand times more experience, especially for the Ashes.|`|cWuumdy7aa	He should retire now as his bowling has no pace and swing with domestic problem and problem with his caption its better to retire gracefully|`|iDmjwU26aa	he has no future in it............|`|7l88B7yQaa	He'll probably replace Hilfenhaus, with Stu Clark replacing McDonald.|`|Dp96W9Gbaa	he still is australia's no 1 strike bowler|`|9JZzYC3iaa	brett lee has no future in test cricket but i did see him in sydney last night?|`|fsLMFIpgaa	He is planning to play IPL, so I guess it will all depend on how he performs there. I think he still has a few good years left in him barring injury. He was also to play in the Pakistan series, but I don't know what is happening with that now.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	he would play for sure
oAUOPiNVaa	its pretty weird. but arent kurt and sting rivals now?|`|UDqMdvESaa	Kurt vs. Sting is a match everyone wants to see look at the ratings last week<br>  But TNA is stupid for not writing at good story for a good build up of or a good rivarly for this match|`|qwdh7N6saa	I disagree. sting and kurt angle are good wrestlers. this will be a good match. Sting doesn't need kurt for a crutch. sting is a great wrestler. sting can hold his own against kurt angle.

However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work.

rvyvF3KAaa	I would probably go after the best player available first. Second I would go after a SS or 2B because those positions are pretty thin. Third round I would go after a good starting pitcher. And from there things get pretty mixed up so I think I'd just start filling up my roster with the best player available in the needed positions.|`|WjIHp3WPaa	Take the best available offensive players, they are more reliable year after year than pitchers.  You can get top flight pitchers and relievers in later rounds.|`|ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	That's a tough one because most of the best will be gone by then. The responders each have the idea to take the best available and I agree with that. However, I can give you a specific idea on the 12th pick. On average, Ian Kinsler is pick around this area but there could be some surprise that could fall on your lap (for instance, Mark Teixeira). Assuming you also get the 13th pick, Jimmy Rollins is hovering around this area but you can go on a different advantage and get Johan Santana if you feel you need an ace fast. <br>  <br>  Beyond this point, take what you can get based on value and depth that you need to build for your team. I suggest printing out a cheatsheet (just in case if your choice is taken) or if your doing a live draft, take the best that you can get based on default ranking for your league.
739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I have.  I camped at a few campgrounds around MIS and I have also camped infield 8-10 times.  Infield we would rent motors homes and go and set up Thursday night and stay till Monday morning some awesome, awesome times at that place.  Haven't done that in a while.<br>  <br>  I love to camp around my house. In fact I organize an all girls weekend canoe/camping trip every year. It started with just a few of my friends and myself to get just get away from the guys and kids for a weekend.  We had an outstanding time and named ourselves 'Sip 'N Tip'.  So the next year we invited more gals it got bigger every year and last year was our 10th anniv. and we had 37 crazy females floating down the river. We all wear crazy hats and are armed with the baddest water guns and best jello shots known to man....LOL!   (up in Augres on Rifle River, you may it Old Fart I know you and the wife camp up this way) And in case your wondering yes, I do fly my Dale Earnhardt Jr. flag at camp ;)|`|7B3TwoaSaa	I am thinking of going to the Walkins Glenn race this summer.

0MJRD9sYaa	How can this not be a smart move? Think about it. The Bills weren't going to make the playoffs this year and they have a slight chance with T.O. If he acts up and they don't make it, that's why he is on a one year deal. They have a bad season but it's not like they would have been good without him. It was a great deal for them and 6.5 million is pretty cheap. Good move by them.|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	If Terrell Owens can keep on his best behavior, then this is a good low-risk signing by the Bills.  The Bills need someone who can score touchdowns.  That is something the team has struggled to do the past few years.  It can be a good deal for TO because he can use the year to prove he still has good game and can perhaps parlay it into a bigger deal next off season.<br>  <br>  That being said, I wouldn't hold my breath that TO will be on his best behavior.  It didn't work in San Francisco, Philadelphia or Dallas.  What makes one think Buffalo is going to be different.  If he couldn't get along and be happy with Jeff Garcia, Donovan McNabb or Tony Romo as quarterbacks, what makes anyone think he will be happy with Trent Edwards or JP Losman?  There is a good reason why at least half the NFL wouldn't touch TO with a ten foot pole.  He is a proven cancer pure and simple.|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	They'll be sorry they ever signed him.Young QB that TO will screw with and a good player with evans that TO will over shadow. To quote TO If it talks like a spoiled player and it acts like a spoiled player then it is what it is. Always thought the Bills were a better team then that.|`|YOKuERs9aa	no... nowhere close<br>  <br>  <br>  they should release him|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Great move by the Bills,TO will have something to prove .<br>  <br>  Giving him a 1 yr deal was a very smart move.Signing someone like TO to a big contract is just setting your team up to lose $$$!!<br>  <br>  Like Dallas did...............|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	If it doesn't work they suck in 2009, like they were going to.<br>  <br>  If it works they might be good in 2009.<br>  <br>  Problem comes if they are good but not good enough to topple the Patriots.  Then in 2010 TO needs  anew contract, they are in a bidding war (in a possibly uncapped year) and when he is secure, he can go off.<br>  <br>  I pity the Bills if this is successful.
dLNm2QLoaa	I'd say stacy, he has the mold,<br>  and potential of being a BEAST.<br>  plus, he's playing alongside his bro,<br>  so he's getting him prepared mentally for this season.|`|UfQhMDeeaa	They are both really good tackles, but I would say Runyan is better because he has the experience with the team and the blocking schemes. Andrews is just coming in and we haven't seen him in an Eagle's uniform yet, so I wouldn't say he is better just yet.|`|XF9FKg3Aaa	they are both pretty good
XZTwrn2Qaa	nnever|`|7RziqsDcaa	DeSean Jackson?|`|qQq23yziaa	I think Marvelous Marvin|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	i think it is a league bi-law that the eagles  cant find a good no 1 wr<br>  <br>  but this year is a very good very deep wr draft  <br>  <br>  so maybe this is the year.    marvin harrison would have been a great pick-up for philly  about 4 years ago  and i am not knocking his career or talent but  right now he is a slower older version of desean jackson.   the eagles  need a  big fast wr to be the no. 1  wr they have only had when  TO was there|`|hBzEmMO4aa	i defently see them drafting a wr, i think the eagles theme for this is to think big, a big rb a big ot a big wr. and with all the draft picks i see them making a move for somebody in the draft|`|nMZqHaqCaa	Marin Harrison still out there I think he has at least 2 good season left|`|GaMkqVu1aa	Im an Eagles fan so i really hope. But the only reciever i think we might sign is either marvin harrison, if not were gonna pick one up in the second round cuz this year we have alot of picks|`|XF9FKg3Aaa	yes. what they are trying to do is get a cornerback like bryant McFadden to replace sheldon brown so hey can trade him and a first round pick for BOLDIN|`|c5a8d3e36c990d16d1cdef0f0f6c9c7daa	I don't think that they need a wr. Jackson is pretty good. They need a backup running back.

X8NGHSP8aa	No one knows what will happen at this point. We won't know until the season starts if he's completely healthy. Even then how his knee holds up during the season will have to be watched carefully. Cassel was franchised as an insurance policy in case things don't go well with Brady's knee. He's more than capable to lead the Pats if Brady isn't ready.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	*sigh*<br>  I wish that man the w*rst of luck.<br>  No...............Matt Cassle should stay|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think he'll be fine.  I mean, he may be less mobile and may have less strength in his knee, but his arm is fine and he'll still be able to make good decisions with the ball.<br>  <br>  I seriously doubt Cassel will be named starter unless Brady can not play at all.  I don't care what any of you Pats fans say, Cassel is not good.  He took the best team in the league out of the playoffs.  I mean, I don't care that he was 11-5, he took a 16-0 team to 11-5, that is not good.  His numbers were good, but Kellen Clemens could probably put up decent numbers if you put him in the Pats offense.  Personally, I hope they do start Cassel, since I really cant stand the Pats.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Brady will be back...Other doctors have looked at him since his surgeries and infections, and said he'll be ready next season barring any unforeseen circumstance...|`|kDkqDPE4aa	i think he will do well but he won't be as good as he used to. most guys after an injury they are still good but not as good or they keep getting hurt right after they heal up.|`|DujXZCd9aa	I 100% guarantee Matt Cassel won;t be the starter. I think he might run less and try to pass.|`|qAJWFJlqaa	wait, whos tom brady? does this person play professional football? theres a tabloid celebrity named tom brady, but that cant be the same person. the one in the magazines looks like tom cruise's queerbag clone. i think your in the wrong section to ask this question.|`|52JcqKJmaa	He'll be ginger with his injury for awhile. It took McNabb a season and a half to get over his injury and play a little like McNabb of old. Still if Brady can get open receivers on short routes quick he should last a full season.|`|CQcLHR0zaa	I think he will do better than Cassel but he wont do as well as his last season|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	brady will win the super bowl|`|09fdLaeIaa	no<br>  he will probably slow down when he runs|`|5Fq178afaa	no. no.

gfxXikenaa	i believe nothing is a fluke in cricket. that time SA played better cricket and now Aus is giving them no chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lee will replace McDonald<br>  <br>  Clark might probably get in for Hillfenhaus<br>  <br>  Symonds currently is out of contention|`|NR4hbYPiaa	I wouldn't call it a fluke but it was a lot closer than it seemed, in Perth SA chased down the 2nd highest total in Test match history, if you are going to set the opposition 400 to win you will lose maybe once every 30 years. In the Melbourne Test Australia looked like they would have a 1st innings lead of 150+, instead they let the last 3 SA wickets add 275, otherwise SA would have been chasing 400 again.|`|41dbd5f49217df2a78323631830fd261aa	no. but australia are getting it together now. the pace attack was inexperienced. I think they learnt a lot of things during the tour which they are putting into practice in this game and the previous one.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	It is the difference between an Aussie team in turmoil and the present one which is finding its feet.|`|FhQlwxrqaa	No i don't think it was a fluke. The South Africans prepared well and trained hard in the lead up to that series, and were able to deliver on the plans and stratagies that were set.<br>  <br>  And i believe the they also may have just expected to do the same again in South Africa and did not work as hard in the 3 weeks between series.<br>  <br>  Still to early to call on the retirements, but i do think Tait should retire from international cricket. His body can't handle it.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	The confidence in SA team is missing.<br>  Bowling & Batting failed to deliver.<br>  <br>  At the other hand all of a sudden the Aussies are playing good cricket, why you need Lee, Clark & Symonds now? if they are winning.|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	No , it wasnt ,the SA team(as a team<br>  ) looked more aggressive in australia than in their home soil..It took a team work to win test matches in australia, but here they lack in..|`|5421VCEBaa	No it wasn't a fluke RSA just batted and bowled better than Australia. Ricky Ponting would not have bowled Brett Lee anyway but none of them should retire. Maybe Symonds he's crap.|`|KyU7thGRaa	i dont think it was a fluke by S.A<br>  australia was simply out played<br>  australia is whipping S.A now cause thats the aussie spirit, we aint going to let the title go that easy|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	no<br>  no- brett lee<br>  no - stuart clark<br>  maybe - andrew symonds|`|vlzq1JRmaa	Yes and yes.|`|7l88B7yQaa	nope|`|AA11088802	no that was not a fluke.. they came against aus. with 9 series undefeated streak|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	SA does not look much motivated to win

They hung on quite a bit in the 2nd half, and it was probably the most nervous I have ever been in football, so the final whistle was a great moment.|`|m2zXOREJaa	The most memorable was when i stole the ball off the away team and on my way to their goal from just outside my own box i nutmegged 5 of their players and cut inside their left back,not bein greedy i looked up to see if i had any options,but to my surprise no one was near from my side so i megged him as well and only had the keeper to beat and thought fuc* this he's gettin it as well and i dummied him twice then megged him.<br>   We were tied at 1-1,they were 3rd ,we were 9th<br>  Took place in 95 in the Manchester Amateur Sunday League<br>   And through my act of disrespect we won.<br>   2 weeks later asked to play for the county and had scouts checking us out as we went on a run and voted by the league as the most entertaining.|`|6853e5e4c7ae6ceae6eb12f6da3bbdc4aa	Watching (on television)  when the mounted police cleared the pitch after a Rangers v Celtic 'game'.|`|9YOfDaSpaa	Each time I play football, its a memorable moment|`|0o8tXZagaa	I was proud to watch Henrik Larsson lift the champions league trophy ,just gutted that it wasn't with Celtic
ck1wvh91aa	This is a little different than some of Snyder's signings in that Haynesworth is in the prime of his career and is a true game-changing force. He will make an already solid defense even better. Where they suffered most last year was in late game situations when a weak pass rush allowed the opposing QB to make that one big play to win the game, or they would give up a big run to kill the clock. Unfortunately, the offense is the real issue. If we had scored even a paltry 20 ppg last season, we would have won 12 games easily.  Either Devin Thomas or Malcolm Kelly needs to step up to take the load off Santana Moss. The Skins have a solid core of offensive skill players in Portis, Moss and Cooley, but they need at least a second legitimate WR to really have a good offense that will put up some points. And as much as I love Jason Campbell as a person and want him to succeed, I don't know that he is the answer at QB. The signing of Haynesworth is a signal that the team is not in rebuilding mode and expects to be competetive this year, so why not go with whoever will give us a chance to win. If that player is Todd Collins or even Colt Brennan, then so be it.|`|94uOfeDRaa	guys arent supposed to say O.M.G. but yeah, the Redskins signed him|`|X8NGHSP8aa	No, Snyder continues to throw his money away. I don't think any player is worth the money that Haynesworth got. 100 million over 7 years with 41 million in guaranteed money is insane. Especially in these tough economic times that is just ridicules. Given Haynesworth past history with injuries I am willing to guess that he'll miss at least 2 games or more this year and it will only get worse as his career moves forward.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	OMG ur like 12 hours late dude|`|LuWT8KQBaa	Uggh, Haynesworth stuff is old news. So is Bart Scott. Redskins screwed themselves yet again. On to new business.|`|nMZqHaqCaa	Hope he learn soon Haynesworth had one good season now he want to take that to the bank wonder how the redskins going to look if he don't play as well  this up comming season|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Old news|`|ak44mIy3aa	they are broke now
NTvNFVkBaa	that is not possible unless you have previous trainning.either you made these up, or you older than 12, or you have some extreme training for a few years on track.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Are these times you claim to have run?<br>  I officiate track meets and have done so for many years.<br>  There are no 12 year old runners who can run 11.20 in the 100, or 52 in the 400, or 2:30 for the 800 or 23 in the 200.<br>  I have no idea if it is possible to run 5K in 17:22, but I doubt it.<br>  So the times listed would be very good for a human 12 year old.<br>  Of course if the times were done outside a certified track meet any time is possible.|`|EfaQpsd5aa	there is no way I belive you. 52sec 400m? 17:22 5k? 23 200m!!!!!!!! and 11.20 (i left out the 800m cause thats kinda adveradge) but there is no way u are telling the truth.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	WOAH! great job! that's fantastic! by the time you're in high school, you'll be breaking records for every event you run in. i'm impressed! keep it up!|`|TawKj9ZZaa	Are you sure you've got the right times there?

That is impossible!!! especially for a 12 year old! Taking the 400m time for example: 52:00 very competitive for a woman at the OLYMPICS. For men, you would only have to improve about 6-7 seconds to be way up there with the pros. For a 12 year old to 52 sec - Impossible!!!!<br>  <br>  same with 100m: 11.20 secs. You would only need to improve 1 second to be good enough to win medals at major championships!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I rest my case....these times are not correct!!!|`|WxWiP3QJaa	For a 12 year old? They are actually unbelievable.

There is 3 guars positions:<br>  <br>  1. Full: This is when both your opponents legs are wrapped around you, the hardest to get pins and locks from.<br>  <br>  2. Half guard: One leg inbetween your legs, you can break away with this and force them into more awkward spots.<br>  <br>  3. When you break their guard completely this means both your legs are around their body, and their legs are inbetween yours, even better they are led on their front. <br>  <br>  I suggest watching UFC to see some of the best technical wrestling, punching and forarm scraping is allowed but you will see how they get into these positions.  Leg locks and arm bars are signs of successfull technical wrestlers, you will find a lot are Judo black belts along side a carrier in wrestling before they joined the UFC.<br>  <br>  Watch:<br>  Take down<br>  Half guard to broken guard<br>  Unleash the punches on the opened opponent.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq2dOlf16Ls" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq2dOlf16...</a>|`|UDqMdvESaa	It is someone who uses suplexes roll ups & submission moves mostly for example Kurt Angle <br>  Were someone like Batista is a power wrestler because he uses alot of power moves like body slams & spear & power bombs<br>   Or someone Cena is a no wrestler because he only does four moves|`|IzgJpVgBaa	omg u frightened me she is my fav diva|`|fmUGHvgHaa	technical wrestlers are wrestlers need sufficient technique so that the entertainment they provide doesn't look too fake.
8cf6c177883935050c59f58b8921f092aa	I know exactly how you feel, because up until this season I had excruciating foot pain too.  It's most likely your boots.<br>  <br>  Options:<br>  <br>  <br>  Go see a foot specialist/footworks shop<br>  <br>  They will take a look at your feet and figure out exactly whats causing the pain.  In my opinion, its worth it to invest in some custom insoles(that you can take out and reuse in other boots/shoes) like Superfeet.  I had my footbeds custom vacuumed for an exact fit.  The shop also used a machine to widen the boot around my arc area where i was having pain.  This didn't take away all the pain, all the time, but it was definitely worth the investment.  Snowboarding is no longer unbearable. <br>  <br>  <br>  Buy just the custom footbeds<br>  <br>  Have them fitted to your feet or not, then swap them with the ones in your rental boots.<br>  <br>  <br>  Heat mold your liners<br>  <br>  Take the boots you rent at the beginning of the season to any local shop.  Ask them to heat mold your liners.  Sometimes they'll even do it for free..otherwise it should be fairly cheap.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask the renters for help<br>  <br>  Tell them about your situation..they might have resources to help you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would really recommend that you purchase your own boots and do all the above, IF you can afford it(besides, boot styles don't change all too much anyway).  It's okay to rent boards/binders, but it's nice to have your own boots.  In my opinion, boots are the most important part of a setup because you aren't going to have fun/ride well if your feet are killing you the whole time.  Your feet are always going to hurt, but it shouldn't be to the point where its affecting your ability to ride.<br>  <br>  <br>  My visit to the shop was about $100(not including my own boots).  If you can't afford that I would try the above steps in reverse order.<br>  <br>  Have fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other tips:<br>  <br>  Don't lace up your boots too tightly.<br>  Don't ratchet your bindings too tight. <br>  Check that your stance isn't too wide.<br>  Ride more powder.|`|gCPu04gTaa	It must be your boots. I ski and I know that if my boots are too tight (I borrow them from the ski centre), then they are very uncomfortable. Because the boots are too tight you are getting pressure on different areas than you are used to.<br>  <br>  My advice is to get some better fitting boots or go back to you old ones if they fit on your new board.|`|GXMTwCLTaa	Most likely the boots, try loosening them a little, or new insoles, possibly loosen your bindings more. New socks that don't bunch up help a lot. Possibly get thin but warm socks, do more research on that as that could possibly help. Something like this happened to me, it was the socks bunching up by me toes, that caused horrible pain, i got new insoles new socks and new boots it went away with the new boots but i never got to try out the insoles i just bought new boots. I'm not sure if you're season is almost over but next year possibly try these.... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buckmans.com/store/Northwave-Freedom-Snowboard-Boots---Mens-OSCARItem_525=1027.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.buckmans.com/store/Northwave-...</a>|`|qqt0GTW8aa	Because you don't mention that your feet hurt when you aren't wearing your snowboarding boots it really sounds like your boots are the culprit.<br>  See if they can give you a half size up on the boots.<br>  Out of all the things that you should buy for snowboarding if you are serious at sticking with it are a good pair of boots that fit you well.  Never mind style because if you don't have comfortable feet then you won't be able to enjoy yourself or ride to your full potential.|`|AAazuYzMaa	buy some better boots. or their the wrong size

FDMLiDLRaa	to get canter, you need to make sure you have a good seat and can sit tp the trot. if you are on a cirlce, you can pick up canter anywhere, but if you are going large, then it is easier to pick up canter in the corner. get your horse moving forward nicely, listening to your aids. when you want to ask for canter, take a small half halt to steady your horse, and bring your outside leg slightly behind the girth, to encourge him to bend. take sitting trot and squeeze with your legs, backing up with a stcik if he ignores you after the second time. if your horse rushes into a faster trot, then go back back to rising trot and steady him back up, then ask again. once in canter, keep your leg on, and allow with your hands, so your horse is not restrcted and confused. allow your body to flow with his movement, and keep your heels down and your bum in the saddle. to return to trot, take a half halt, and when he comes back to trot, praise him by giving him his head <br>  or your flatwork, stay relaxed with your best riding position on show, be firm but kind with your horse, and try your best.<br>  let us know how it goes, and i hope you do well. good luck xxx :)|`|8lsBBK62aa	Stay calm and relaxed!

PyJ3PMRnaa	Good question. I read some of the other answers, and it's very mixed. Some like Angle more, some like Benoit more. But I think I'd have to go with Kurt Angle. You can tell he is very passionate about wrestling; he is an Olympic Gold Medalist!! But both men are very talented, and I have the greatest respect for both of them, especially Benoit for entertaining wrestling fans all around the world for countless years and I really feel sorry for the guy. He was knocked around so much in the ring, his brain must've been pretty wrecked, which is probably what led him to the murder of his wife and son, and himself. His brain was so messed up, he must've gone insane. R.I.P Benoit you will forever be remembered.|`|bSsBGrZVaa	Kurt Angle|`|fmUGHvgHaa	WoW tricky Question ...both are kind of the same but i say Chris Benoit|`|3074it1Qaa	i'd go with Benoit considering they had several matches before and i remember watching one distinct match in which he kicked Kurt's u know what.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	They both suck.  Neither one of them know how to wrestle.<br>  Kurt is just after the gold.  Olympic gold that is.|`|Y3O8cW8Kaa	It's a tie. They are both evenly matched mat wrestlers.|`|Ac8QOD7Saa	Chris Benoit is better.  Each has his advantages but i feel Chris was much more stronger than Kurt when it came to winning a match.  Chris would have taken those Angle Slams or Angle Lock, and kept going.  Kurt's tolerance for pain was low towards the end of his career with the WWE.  Even as a rookie Kurt's tolerance was lower than Benoit.  Either way it would be an aggressive, long, and hard fighting match.|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	I could Lie and say Benoit Just Because i miss watching him so much however im not going to lie and yes i will Say Kurt Angle Not that there was much differece between there technical Abilitys i use to hate Kurt when He first Joined WWF/E but then as i got older i started to Respect him more for his pure wrestling Skills.<br>  <br>  who would Love to see that match again?<br>  if you wouldnt i think you better do some soul searching and ask yourself......Am i really a true wrestling Fan<br>  <br>  R.I.P Rabid Wolverine|`|SyYXzAt0aa	kurt angle is good hes an olipicgold medalist and beniot has a good history at the end of his life he was united states and wolrd heavywieght champion so chris|`|dQnQNpd5aa	I use to like watching BENOIT fight all the time|`|oAUOPiNVaa	I G2G with Kurt hes awesome. benoit was okay but not better than angle|`|lRSLi6REaa	KURT FRICKEN' ANGLE|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...the one that is " A L I V E "!!!!!!!?????????

kHLWDgmIaa	i think the best was when he won it from batista at armageddon|`|PniPsDmGaa	i would say Edge beating Batista and Undertaker at Armegedon, because he used Hawkins and Ryder as a disguise, so that edge could get rest. after edge tricked everyone, he won the World Title. <br>  <br>  Edge had to defend his title against Batista on the next episode of SmackDown! It was supposed to be 1 on 1, but Edge's wife and SmackDown! GM, Vickie Guerrero made the match a handicapped match. it was now 3 on 1 for the World title. Edge, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder vs Batista. Batista pinned Curt Hawkins later in the match, and became the World Champion, but Vickie Guerrero came out and said that he had to pin Edge. The match went a little longer, but edge speared Batista, and successfully defended the title. After he had Hawkins and Ryder hold Batista down. Edge got a chair dn hit Batista in the head.<br>  <br>  Rey Mysterio won a beat the clock match to face edge at Royal Rumble. At the Royal Rumble, it went back and forth. Rey went for a 619, but when he did Vickie Guerrero went in front of Edge to block it. Rey was looking at Vickie as she was on the ground. Rey Turned around and got speared by Edge. Edge won. On the next episode of SmackDown, Teddy loong came out and said Rey Mysterio was now Edge's #1 contender for No way Out! Rey and Edge faced each other, but Rey Mysterio lost yet again.<br>  <br>  Undertaker won the elimination Chamber at No Way Out! now it was Taker ve edge. This was one of the most intense matches at WrestleMania. Undertaker hit a TombstonePiledriver on Edge. But the ref was knocked out, then a referee had to run in, and counted 1, 2, and edge kicked out. later on in the match, Edge went for the spear, it hit, but Undertaker reversed it into the Hells Gate, and Edge Lost.

5GI6hmFpaa	Usually when skates click while you step down with them, the problem is an axle bolt that is a little loose.<br>  <br>  It is possible that you have bearings that are horribly worn out and need replacement.  Try to wiggle each wheel from side to side to see if a particular wheel clicks as you do this.

kqP7GwOcaa	Benn, like Eubanks, Hopkins and Jones in their primes would have all KOed Joe.  Joe's best fight was with an unproven Kessler.|`|V7lGsaR8aa	It would have been a real tough fight and to discount Joe so easily is down to the fact that he was never really known over here . Joe was one of the most versatile fighters of all time , a very tough man . I think i give to Nigel on points though .|`|ElH6jMEXaa	I think that if Calzaghe could have withstood an early rush from Benn, he would be able to use his unorthodox style and rhythm would frustrate Benn - that, with his handspeed would be enough to take a decision from the "Dark Destroyer."<br>  <br>  A prime Benn could just as easily catch Joe early, like other guys have done, but unlike those other guys he would have the youth to utilize his aggression and pounce.  <br>  <br>  I think it would either be Benn stopping Calzaghe within the first 5 rounds or Calzaghe weathering and taking advantage in the second half on his way to a decision.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick, I'll give it to the guy who found a way to win 46 times without fail.  Calzaghe by decision.|`|7domw3t5aa	come on dude u know like i know Nigel benn wouldve knocked Joe out easily. Joe chin is suspect he cant take a punch.

It's kind of inevitable that Detroit makes it.  Considering that the entire division has a losing record except for Cleveland, I'd say they have pretty good shot.  <br>  <br>  As far as the west goes, Denver would be third if they win that division.  Remember that division leaders now get the higher seed (even with a worse record).  That means if SA wins the division, Houston gets no better than 4th.  Also, if someone has to miss the playoffs here you are right it will be Utah.  Unfortunately, Dallas can't go to the playoffs twice during the same year (see #6 and # 8) so I'm going to give the final spot to...Phoenix depending on how they can play without Stoudimire.|`|b2OyCIqcaa	Quote" You have Magic, Miami, and Heat listed.<br>  <br>  And Dallas is listed twice.<br>  <br>  Besides that, it looks good. =]"<br>   <br>  Exactly.<br>  Kick Dallas out for Utah, throw the Sixers in the mix because they make it every year and east is weak.<br>  Theres no Detroit anywhere, there in a slump but theyll still make playoffs.<br>  and bump Denver above Houston<br>  <br>  This is for the playoffs right??|`|khbLZQHIaa	Dallas is on the list twice.

up010iaraa	Tell me about it, when I first started bmxing I thought it would be a piece of piss, but soon found out it was going to be trickier.<br>  <br>  The way I learnt was to first get manuals down to a t. Once you have them going for a good couple of seconds it's then probably a good time to try and move up to trying hops.<br>  <br>  Assuming you have them down, the basic idea is to push the bars up and away from you. A friend of mime uses clipless pedals but I told him that's cheating, and if you mess it up on the landing you could get some pretty nasty scaring to your face.<br>  <br>  You also have to use your legs quite a bit. Remember to keep the pedals horizontal to the ground and pull the back wheel up by gripping your pedals with your shoes. That sounds odd, but find a couple of videos and you'll soon see what I'm trying to explain.<br>  <br>  It's difficult to begin with, just take it in steps. You'll get worn out quite quickly and then hurt yourself, so mix it up a bit, try it for 15mins then practice something else.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmxbasics.org/new/bmx0703.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmxbasics.org/new/bmx0703.htm...</a><br>  and try using youtube 'bmx bunny hopping tutorials' or some thing like that.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7l4tR0aZaa	well i have a mountain bike and i used to never be able to bunny hop now that i have clipless pedals i can do it very very easily, what i reccomend is getting toe straps for ue pedals and do this, first u crouch down then jump up real high while lifting ur legs up with the pedals then when u get good doing it thayt way take the toe clips off then try doing ikt without them, it be hard at first but ujst keep doin it and in another month u'll be laughing at all the people who ask this same question just like i am|`|4ysjQhVOaa	If you are getting into bmx this is the most important trick you can learn it is the basis of almost every trick.<br>  <br>  Ok a bunnyhop is when you pull your front tire off of the ground followed by the back tire without the use of a ramp. <br>  <br>  To do a bunnyhop it is best to approach this trick with a moderate speed. <br>  <br>  The next step is to roll along and pull up the front tire.<br>  <br>  This is where it can get complicated because a bunnyhop is not only done with the brute strength of your arms.<br>  <br>  After you have pulled up the front tire you want to push the bike out in front of you NOT DOWN while pulling the back end up with your feet. Remember you are picking the back end up while pushing the bike out in front of you. Then you land flat and roll away.<br>  <br>  Okay so the motion is pull up and push out remember pull up and push out. PP pull and push.<br>  <br>  So you are probably wondering how you pick the back end up with your feet. To pick up the back end it is a similar motion to a jump. You bend your knees and pop up but your not trying to jump off the pedals you are trying to keep the scoop motion of what a bunnhop should feel like. So your feet should be planted on the pedals and they should stay on by themselves if they are not your doing something wrong. So bend your knees and pop out with a slight catch of the pedals.<br>  <br>  A common mistake is to just use your arms for bunnyhops. So learn how to use your feet in them and practice practice practice. <br>   <br>  Go to www.we-bmx.fairtopic.com to learn more tricks and things about bmxing.|`|K7ALWYTxaa	Try to lift up your back wheel whilst riding... just flicking it up and then pull up your front and just work on that. thats how i worked it out.
JKbvnwcDaa	I mean looking at the history of T.O., he systematically destroys teams from within. He is a one man circus.

He has had a bad influence on every team he has been on. He will sell tickets, both for the 7 games at Ralph Wilson Stadium and the one in Toronto, but it will be a circus. It is a shame that so much tallent is in the body of such a jerk.|`|AFLxMNt1aa	I think this was purely a marketing move.  The NFL is going to play in Toronto and Buffalo did not have many major marketable stars before T.O.  I think the signing will help Lee Evans get open in more plays; however, I don't think Buffalo has a chance of beating New England or Miami.  Another thing you have to take into consideratiion is this will be the first time T.O. is on a small-market team.  San Fransisco, Philadelphia, and Dallas all draw decent ratings and have large populations.  I think this could be temporary and next year he could be headed back out to a west coast team.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Well, Owens has cause some problems the past few years, but he's still one of the best wide receivers in the NFL.  I hate to say this, but I think the Bills made a good decision to sign T.O.  Buffalo hasn't been in the playoffs in a long time and Ralph Wilson Jr. is desperate to see playoff football again.  So, the Bills did not make a mistake and T.O should fit in nicely with the Buffalo Bills.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	Its not a mistake if shapes up his attitude. Other than that, he is a good football player.

QtdO1RlQaa	I thik it will, Sohail Tanvir held the purple cap last year and Misbah Ul Haq was doing well for the Bangalore Royal Challengers. However the difference will be minor, I think Rajasthan Royals will sufffer the most since Sohail Tanvir was their spearhead.|`|AA11088802	no|`|cWuumdy7aa	I wish there is no IPL biggest waste of time money. india should stop this tamasha.|`|GdJTQX6raa	no , no significant effect.|`|RGxMkT0zaa	They did little in IPL I<br>  <br>  Matches will go on and be well played despite all.|`|GllB4mPZaa	No.|`|Zl8svqUGaa	except sohail tanveer how many pak player played better?<br>  <br>  even if i think sohail tanveer is a kind of average bowler because of captaincy of shane warne, that's why he get so much wicket in the ipl.<br>  <br>  One player might play better in the ipl i.e. misbah ul haq. Even if his present form is not good.<br>  <br>  And shahid afridi is a kind of useless player, he just play international matches with the support of past record. He is one of most inconsistent player from good teams, i have ever seen. <br>  <br>  There is nothing special in a pakistan team players for t20 format, except misbah ul haq.<br>  <br>  We will definitely not miss any kind of pak players but yes we might miss players from other countries like australia, england. <br>  <br>  But definitely ipl will not miss any pakistan player even if little bit also.<br>  <br>  There cricket is on crisis and pak cricket is suffering a lot.|`|kgzMzRyKaa	i don't think so. there is always someone to replace every player. the 20-20 format goes on so fast that is isn't much any great player can do. if the player has a day he will shine if not he would fade out. face value would affect but performance won't be affected.|`|JJgnJlYFaa	I think that rajistaan royals will miss alot the Pakistani players like sohail tanvir, misbah ul haq and akmal without them speeed star shoib akhter will be missed alot.|`|g20ok8mHaa	aacha hain sale haraami nahin aare hain hai ,aake terrorism phalate hain porkistani. which means it is good that they are not coming nobody is gonna miss them there other international players who will compensate for them.|`|04Mvb5dmaa	NOT AT ALL !!!<br>  <br>  They did nothing in the first edition of IPL. They wont be missed at all. Only Shoaib Akhtar will be missed.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	No way. <br>  Apart from Sohail Tanveer (RR) did any Paki player had any impact in IPL last year?|`|H4BW2ALNaa	As last years est bowler was Sohail Tanvir so they'll be missed|`|t3lDmZLXaa	Not at all!|`|n46vkphRaa	Rajastan royals will definitely miss Tanvir, Akmal....

I'm an American instead of British. I like Zara Phillips and Phiippa Funnell, however. Those are names I do recognize. I also really like Mary King.
xRPjgGs1aa	Try to trade Quinn and Oneal for Nate Robinson. You will get a better starting lineup if you do that because Derrick Rose has been struggling a lot the past games.|`|AA11471458	Moon is the first guy to trade. He doesn't get consistent numbers. 5 points and 5 rebounds one night and 10 points, and 10 rebounds the next. O Neal should be traded with Quinn because no one wants O Neal but if you put a young, energetic guy like Quinn maybe you can strike a deal.|`|7qEjVGetaa	Find a team with a weak starting center(around a 75 and below rating) and try to work a deal out with that, but make sure the team has enough cap room within the deal. Trade O'neal for a couple of young players or young reserves. Maybe a Danny Granger for Jermaine deal and have Granger's team throw in an expiring contract and possibly a 2nd round pick. Then try and sighn a free agent center to a 1yr deal, but remeber it doesn't matter how much money you give the C but that his contract will be running out.|`|DvnuRfrIaa	Try to trade JO with another player like quinn or you can possibly add Moon and try to get players from teams with high cap space.
SdOUTvQWaa	if dhoni hurt then they can try 4 gautam gambhir in the ground provided dinesh is not playing in 11..........think differently.......|`|E4KqAjSnaa	Rahul dravid is the best substitute for dhoni.he has been touring new zealand twice|`|3zFQ83OLaa	dinesh karthik<br>  i dont thnk he is a gud option in odi|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Dravid.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Dinesh kartik is the second wicket keeper on new zeland tour|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	IKn the ODI squad, there is no substitute wicket-keeper.  If Dhoni get hurt, some-one from the playing 11 has to keep wicket.  Mostly Suresh Raina will bne assigned that task.  However, in the test team, Rahul Dravid can keep wicket if there is no 2nd wicket keeper in the playing 11.|`|7T4dvrm3aa	sorry 24 year old i misunderstood your question,,,i think the person who will keep wickets if dhoni gets hurt   is raina,,,in test matches its laxman he kept wickets when dhoni bowled one over against england in test match, and also dravid can keep wickets in test matches,,,,,|`|sBE3ewn7aa	Dinesh Karthik.|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	Dinesh Karthik|`|4YCouRDwaa	1.Dinesh Kartik <br>  2.Parthiv Patel!!|`|m29y4kCYaa	BhAJI joking<br>  Karthik|`|7l88B7yQaa	Dinesh Karthik|`|E5J8fEM5aa	DINESH KARTHICK|`|G0TYH0q6aa	DINESH KARTHIK|`|36uf5xlYaa	dinesh karthicK|`|iDmjwU26aa	kartik.........|`|YkdSShUbaa	One & only DINESH KARTHIK in the present squad

YwM8Z14oaa	Yes, I would look at the Nike Sasquatch Sumo2 5900, I think you will like that. It hits far, and straighter then any other driver. But it does take a bit of time getting used to.<br>  <br>  I like Nike drivers because they just seem to feel more comfortable, Like they want to make a great working club, that will also help you feel great.<br>  <br>  Go with a Nike, it will suit you best in the long run.|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	I would choose the titleist but honestly i don't really like the drivers on your list. I've never liked nike drivers but a lot of people seem to love them. I never trusted mizuno with drivers even though they make the best irons out there (which I use). The old Cobra's were amazing but I tried the Speed out earlier this year and did not like the feel of it at all. I currently use a titleist driver and i love it but it's not as forgiving as my cobra. It all depends on what you hit the best anyway.|`|Ubi6HBOqaa	Nike SasQuatch Sumo is cleary the best in my mind. If you are buying a nike driver make sure you test the 5900 series too! Because the square driver is ment for you to hit straight.(good if u suck at hitting straight)Also consider getting maybe a taylor made burner.Just ask you local golf pro in a golf store such as Nevada Bobs and GolfTown.|`|AA12283403	What do you mean by best? Do you want the straightest, the longest, the one that works the ball best?<br>  <br>  There is no best, just the one that's best for you and there's no way to tell that from a simple question asked here. Go to a golf store, try them all and see which is best for your swing and your game.|`|M5CamkWKaa	First off there are a lot better drivers on the market than the ones you listed. But, I've hit all of those and the Cobra - Speed LD is the best one I hit. If you go to your local golf store you can test the latest drivers out. They can check out all your stats: Lanch angle, spin rate, ball speed.|`|oblnqjenaa	The Nike SasQuatch is very good. I've had mine for 6 months now and its great. The huge head is great for maximum distance. *If you get it, you have to tee the ball up pretty high because of the size of the head. I hope this helped,<br>  <br>  TeamUSA4Life|`|7zqlfubvaa	The TM 580XD is the best of the drivers you have listed.  You might consider making a shaft change instead of investing in a new driver.  I would stay away from the NIKE and Mizuno drivers.|`|FWsv3Schaa	the Nike SasQuatch Sumo<br>  i demoed it when i was looking for a driver, it was a nice club. i personally like the club i have, the TaylorMade Burner, but Nike has good clubs|`|JSGLKnA4aa	of these i would go with cobra but i prefer wilson.
8T0Z0Y17aa	No. The fifties column is for innings that finished between 50 and 99 inclusive. Example:<br>  <br>  A batsman has passsed 50 twelve times and converted four of those into 100's. He record will show 4 hundreds and 8 fifties.|`|AA11088802	no...|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	No. <br>  Only hundred will be recorded.<br>  So, as on date Sachin has scored 91 50+ innings and 42 one hundred plus innings .|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	No<br>  <br>  Only the hundred is recorded.|`|IeM9MAPBaa	nope its considered a hundred not 2  50's|`|bN6S0FJEaa	No<br>  It will be counted as 100|`|H4BW2ALNaa	no|`|drDfqTF7aa	No
aN4SUKkRaa	Who'd hold the bowler's cap?<br>  <br>  Will they "mike up" all the players to record the slurs and abuse?<br>  <br>  Who will the fans from both sides agree should be strung up after the match?<br>  <br>  Who's gonna tell Ponting to "shut up and get on with the game!"?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, it's impolite to reply to a question with a question, but who else agrees with me?<br>  <br>  "Whoops I did it again!" Is Britney Spears using my computer??|`|AA11088802	no|`|mber3JoAaa	No. What will the bowlers use as coathangers?|`|pLrTfvo9aa	What will the Indians have to blame when things go wrong? Where will conspiracy theories come from when they are given out by someone they cant see who has access to banks of monitors and replay facilities. Who will prevent them from thinking they are being sledged? Sorry, this wont work. lol.|`|AU9r15xEaa	umpire shouldnt be on the field they are useless piece of bodies never would give a right decision .......... like today guptill's dismissal|`|sBKun272aa	How would that work? Would they broadcast decisions over loud speakers?|`|1WQdiPZEaa	well i dont think so. If you are removing umpires time will come when u think ok there is no need of players also. why cant we have robotic cricket. Its the same. I understand technology. But the technology cannot always see everything.<br>  <br>  If there is a fight between two players, what will happen.<br>  <br>  If there is bad light. who will stop play
2s244jGgaa	I think that each of these guys have learnt their lessons.<br>  <br>  Ben Cousins has been given a lifeline and he is hanging on a thread. If ONE SMALL thing happens, and he does the wrong thing, his AFL career is over in a split second. He has no more chances left, he can not stuff up again. He hopefully realises this and wont go off and do drugs or get himself into trouble, because even Richmond will not save him AGAIN. <br>  <br>  Didak got in serious trouble and lost alot of respect from the footy world, he was ban for a string of matches and did not get to play or help out in the finals series for the pies. A big blow to the star player, hopefully he has learnt from this too.<br>  <br>  And Buddy franklin knows how fantastic it is to kick 100 and be the most dominant player infront of goal. He wouldnt want to give that up.<br>  <br>  Lets hope none of these blokes get into trouble,<br>  they are all stars - and to see them play footy at their full potential is what we like to see best! :)|`|mXFOru11aa	Didak|`|VLCUDZlcaa	It will be FEVOLA for sure....he hates it when Benny, Buddy or Didak get more publicity than him.  Look at his antics when Judd was monopolising 100% of the media attention at Carlton...he tried his darnest to get some attention like pissing in public etc....|`|W8SgRKo7aa	buddy he already is this year. injured bullshit.|`|xmg9CBnCaa	buddy. purely because he is a wanker.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	Who knows.|`|ImHvd8F0aa	I think Buddy already is, just called an injury to mask a drug suspension or issue.|`|qUBWjHq0aa	Its a toss up between Buddy and Cousins<br>  <br>  Didak prob wont be stupid enough to get into trouble again altho i wouldnt say he wont coz anythin is possible|`|Dn1VnPmFaa	Didak!!!|`|HgA4wHYxaa	The media will decide|`|378GRzrnaa	ben cousins - sooner the better.. get him sacked - i will laugh haha|`|DAQf6k6Waa	buddy, i can just tell it will be him|`|NMDUPd8paa	neither, it'll be someone you would never think of|`|ZXGRJuI9aa	Ben Cousins...it's just a matter of time|`|mYmh4a7Zaa	Umm Definately not DIDAK hes a collingwood player....<br>  but I think Brendon Fevola will he's very i dunnoe but u cant trust that guy he pulls his pants down infront of a pub and does his buisness<br>  thats a trouble making scene for him and plenty more to come|`|okOxlu4Faa	Buddy will be first, the other two have too many media bloodhounds on their trail to even start to get into trouble|`|k6sFZ5rYaa	benny will never again =) buddy or didak i think. they are both enept idiots.|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	Buddy as he is not in the spotlight at the moment|`|ENsfHlWCaa	NONE IT WILL BE MICHAEL GARDNER FROM SAINTS|`|EIS976Gvaa	buddy coz he is a c.u.n.t
gprdq8E2aa	Sorry they don't have any championships.<br>  <br>  I beleive with the team that they have they could take it all the way to the finals and win.

4lyAGOkbaa	Lecaire is "unproven" in this league.  When he was healthy he did play well.  He will be number one once the season starts next year.  Elliot will be a good backup.<br>  <br>  As for the trade, the Sens came away big time winners.  Vermette has done nothing for the Sens.  He has shown potential but hasn't amounted to anything.  Getting a potential number one goalie (ottawa has never had a true number one goalie... Hasek = terrible) and a second round draft pick, is an incredible deal!<br>  <br>  if you like hockey, there is a good website with lots of fun hockey trivia, and games, etc.  (link below)|`|GyGhHpRraa	I think it's going to be a battle between him and Billy Elliot, but he should pull through.|`|MHJ3ZjV7aa	yes|`|747d07e85b30f9f5d0d77ed33080a98daa	only time will tell..certainly we hope he works out better than Gerber...ps...bring on the Leafs|`|5f048cd93967c79a0ffc734f1e6da22baa	the sens have no choice but to make him the number 1 starter for next year.  I feel that they have given up a little to much for him in the trade and they haven't showen any of their goaltenders any confidence this year as to who actually is number 1.|`|fbG7kjynaa	I think he'll be the number one goalie for the sens, out of all the goalies they've had thus far.|`|AjZyj7zfaa	100% he is a way better goalie than any the sens have|`|jwPf5rsiaa	He SHOULD be...but with every goalie he will need to prove himself. We'll see how he does once he's able to play starting next year. He IS a #1 starter...something Ottawa doesn't currently have. Auld is a good back-up and Elliot still needs time in Bingo.|`|0qNbEif3aa	I don't understand why people don't see how good of a goaltender Leclaire is.he had an amazing season last year and was easily top 5. <br>  <br>  So to the answer the question, yes, obviously. Elliot will be backup.
CkV2UtAJaa	I think its absolutely fine!! I just trained my 12 year old paint qh gelding to run barrels and he is great!! Just make sure the horse has the right conformation and that he/she is willing to put the effort along with yourselve. :)|`|Vy7PuWViaa	Why would you want to put a 14 yr old in barrels? most start them young at like 4 or 5. let it just be a horse at this point.|`|BFvxkrBkaa	i am sure it would work some people train younger<br>  <br>  <br>  xxx
fS8joiTaaa	Ok since you are going to be sticking to pavement you wont need to buy a nice bike. As for the frame size your most likely going to get a 20 as thats the standard and you will have to pay more for a bigger frame. The 20 should fit you just fine though.<br>  <br>   You can just get your standard 20 inch bike from wallmart which is considered a bmx bike but not reccomended for frestlye but like all bikes will eventually go bad if you dont give it proper maintnance.It will probably be a little heavy but thats what you get for the price.<br>  <br>  Your probably better off geting a walmart bike because an actual bmx bike will cost you around 300 for a light one.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped and if i did best answer would greatly be appreciated
VXQFT341aa	Umm no!|`|X8NGHSP8aa	No, even with Pryor the Buckeyes will lose again to USC. I'm not even sure if OSU will be the best team in the Big Ten this year.|`|jIONJZSJaa	Ohio State going to get beat by at least 10 points to USC this upcoming season.

3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	At times he shows hints of brilliance but in truth he couldn't have gone to a worse side... they have ruined so many players in as much that they appear to go backwards Bale for example was raved about and now he ahrdly gets a game. They acquire near enough whole teams every transfer window and then they go the following season.. Dos santos needs to leave if he wants to progress.|`|BdR6eQWOaa	Giovani needs to go back to Mexico.|`|tfotPdeZaa	First of all do you think that a person who doesnt live in England cant answer this question???? <br>  Dos Santos is Ok, he needs to work a bit harder to be EPL material. Idk if we should hold onto him, hes a bit a waste of space for now.

"Kobe's probably a better outside shooter, Michael a better post-up player."|`|qa1bKUzmaa	Hmm...<br>  On one hand, Michael Jordan won like, what, six championships? In a row, I believe. On the other hand, Kobe Bryant is an extremely gifted and talented player, and he even managed to score 81 points in one single game.

If you are a girl you'd be lucky to get to 5'8"<br>  <br>  If you're a guy.  NO.  You're genes just don't have it in them.  You should end up somewhere around your brothers height...though he has outdone your parents.  That means your parents may have come from another country or just didn't grow up with enough protein in their diets (their height was stunted by poor diet).  Men grow up to about 21 but most of the growth occurs during your growth spurt and you gain a couple inches after that.<br>  <br>  Growth Hormone?  LOL.  No chance.  1.  Human Growth Hormone is very expensive.  2. It would be illegal to prescribe it to you as you are normal height and are not deficient.<br>  <br>  Growth Hormone might add an extra couple of inches taken at your age, but the side effect would make you look like a freak.  It would affect your jaw, your cranium, and all other parts of your body in odd ways that would make you look unlike anything you want.....it doesn't just work on height.<br>  <br>  Growth Hormone taken later in life cannot add height, at your age it can add minimal height....but it's not worth the money (thousands or tens of thousands of dollars) and it isn't worth the risks.|`|mK06dus9aa	Listen to the Rosso lady, she tells it how it is.|`|k2AmQylBaa	idk man u just have to wait and see...

Gameplay Enhancement<br>  <br>  I'm not looking for gimmick stuff, as much as I am looking for enhanced gameplay mechanics. I'd like to see THQ/Yukes implement some interactive wrestling holds to be preludes to the moves themselves. For example, in previous games you had to press a button to lock up, and then another button to perform the acutal move. I say instead of having the "lock up" as every option, add some more and make them interactive. <br>  <br>  One option they could use is an arm lock or pre arm drag position or some sort. Then here's where the player interaction is a factor. From a (nicely animated) arm lock, players can drag the opponents by the arm around the ring in the similar manner you can these days, and "work the arm" as an in ring tactic. It would work in the similar fashion as an UCM, but if players wanted to they could easily perform the moves of the superstar. Also from the arm lock players could walk around their opponent in order to perform moves from behind. <br>  <br>  Gameplay options like these would help THQ to multitask and provide a fun, option filled, gameplay strategy without making the game too technical and unenjoyable. <br>  <br>  A similar system could work for a bearhug/body scissors, where that could lead to irish whips, german suplexes, slams, or trapping opponents at the turnbuckle in the form of a tackle.<br>  <br>  Or perhaps they could implement this system for leg traps which could lead to any ground moves. Picture taht move leading into a figure four, boston crab, or single crab. Again, let me reiterate, their new gameplay could be all about multi tasking so that the game feels enhanced and strategy based but not hard to pickup and have fun with. <br>  <br>  2. Show the highflyers some love<br>  <br>  The SvR has yet to include moves off of the ring apron. This one is pretty self explanatory. Players should be able to step out from between the ropes and choose from a wide variety of moves. Now that tag team gameplay has been enhanced for non legal tag partners, I know my idea would definitely work if done right. Both (or three) players could be allowed to be on the ring apron at once and choose attacks. Let's say one player is on the apron, and the other is in the ring. The highflyer should have options to weaken is opponent with apron based shoulder thrusts, kicks, spring board attacks (in addition to the ones already present), turnbuckle smashes, and other grapple moves. Also if both are on the apron, one player should be able to attack the other so that the opponent falls off onto the floor. This animation should be similar to how in SvR 08 and 09 you could shove your opponent off of the annouce table so that they falls off. Similar. We could see off the apron attacks like suplexes and dropkicks. Also the same would workd with 3 players on the same ring apron just maybe with limited ability because of the number of wrestlers. <br>  <br>  Now lets say one player is on the ring apron and the other is one the floor. This could lead into ring apron exclusive moves. We could see the asai moonsault, RVD's ring apron moonsault, Rey Mysterio's seated sentons and hurricanrannas, cross body, and also some attacks. By that I mean like some highflyers mule kick or back kick their opponents so that they stand in place for a dive.  <br>  <br>  3. Add ons<br>  <br>  THQ has the right tools, but they need to bring their game into the current generation. There are four directional buttons yet we can only do two diving attacks off the turnbuckle. Am I missing something? Also with the face button, we should be able to do 5 diving moves.<br>  <br>  Same with grapple moves. HCTP had more moves because of no UCM. Give the UCM moves another mechanic, as well as the gameplay mechanic I suggested in my first few paragraphs. Same with pins. I think pin attempts should all be controlled with one button. That would create a variety but not interfere with the ground moves players wanted to choose but couldn't because they REALLY wanted to use the Oklahoma roll.|`|PniPsDmGaa	*i would like to have the GM mode back,<br>  *create a finisher where you can create finishing moves that have you go to the top rope. <br>  *Bring Back the Create a championship mode<br>  *Have Gauntlet matches.|`|KVTW6mCzaa	Gm mode<br>  Create a Belt<br>  Create a PPV<br>  IN DEBTH story line<br>  Hornswoggle as wrestler <br>  Made up midgets so Hornswoggle can wrestle them<br>  Diva Legends <br>  Old titles

8x8FIm9zaa	He's a sixth round pick, so people think the Pats got lucky, but in reality it's because Belichik is unbelievable at finding talent.  He is good looking and a pretty boy, which apparently you can't be a good looking football player and have to be ugly as hell like Manning or Rothlisberger (both great QB's).  He never says the wrong thing, ever.  People consider him a "system QB".  He used to only throw dink and donk passes, then he couldn't throw the long ball yada yada yada then he ends up breaking the TD record.  He is very, very competitive and one of the hardest workers off the field there has EVER been.  He already has won 3 Super Bowl titles, 2 SB MVP's and the list goes on.  He is still fairly young.  People are just jealous.  But let me tell you people, we have had our fair share of crappy QB's, Tony Eason, Hugh Millen, etc.   And by the way he never "cheated".  That was the coaching staff, and it's not considered cheating.  And if your team doesn't do it or has never tried doing it they are morons.  Everyone does it.  And it hardly ever helps.|`|HjS2tlTDaa	He is disliked by fans of other teams because they wish he was their own quarterback.

However, a 5 foot guy dunking seems very difficult, but it is definitely possible.|`|AjZyj7zfaa	if some is 1 ft and have a Vertical leap of 9ft he can dunk the net it is possible to do|`|CKyvU4kuaa	Son impossible is nothing|`|VHphDgrhaa	hmmm. Nate Robinson and Spud Webb could so i say. like 5' 3"|`|7domw3t5aa	um dumb question dude.
S0u3HKzhaa	Yes definitely,Shawn Micheals has been known to do what people think is the impossible by ending many peoples winning streaks and being the size that he is just beating a much larger wrestler.Shawn has done a lot of things like that in his career.So he is for sure just about the biggest threat to The Undertaker's streak.Honestly the last time I thought the streak was going to be broken was Wrestlemania 13 The Undertaker vs. Sycho Sid.I really I don't know why thought Sid was going to beat the Undertaker.Although then the streak wasn't to big.But with Shawn Micheals and The Undertaker's long history together and long history of doing things that no one though was possible.And this was brought up to be a few weeks ago and correct me if i'm wrong but I can not recall a time wear the Undertaker beat Shawn Micheals fairly.And with all the hype of Shawn Micheals and The Undertaker in their home state of Texas after there long history together,and two great careers,working together for so long,being very loyal to Vince over the years.I think people are now honestly starting to believe that Shawn will end the streak.Opposed to the past like what?I don't know I've really haven't doubted the Undertaker since he was 7-0.So the frist time in years people really believe Shawn will do what no one else has done.Just like he has in the past over come all odds.(Although the Undertaker has said if his streak does end it will be against an up comming star not somone he has faced 1000 times before like Shawn,Kane,Triple H etc.).But I think Shawn is really the first one in a long time to honestly threaten the streak to really have people wondering.|`|2KIRdfIcaa	Yes because the two are two great veterans and know each other so well, they had a really great feud (Hell in a Cell, Casket Match that messed up Shawn's back).<br>  <br>  So no one knows Taker more than Shawn Michaels and vice-versa. I'm really not sure who's going to win that match and know it will be a great one.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	Oh yeah, this maybe The Undertaker's greatest victory at Wrestlemania when he defeats HBK and goes 17-0 at Wrestlemania *25*!|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	at the guy above me....naw brah.....umagas was broken by cena<br>  <br>  And At YOur Answer.....According To The Character Of The Undertaker<br>  <br>  It Is And Always Will Be Kane|`|2Ms54b2Laa	wrestlemania 25 is gonna suck|`|IgDCjui5aa	I say yes, nobody ever has defyed undertaker, everybody in the his streak  were always just afraid of him, even the rock and triple h. Shawn Miacheals is not going to end taker's streak but it will be his last match. thats why they promoted it as the 25th aniversary, to make it a very emotinol wrestlemania. tear.|`|V2EAMLelaa	Yeah id say so, Theres the biggest legends in WWE today. Theyre the only 2 men to have appeared in the first episode of RAW. This could be the greatest WM undertaker will have.<br>  <br>  So Clown Prince, you really are hyped for this match arent ya?|`|08c83c602388f929bd8807d854eaf1bcaa	Yes he is. Shawn Michaels is the biggest threat for The Undertaker. <br>  <br>  Umaga, Chris Masters & Koslov's winning streaks have ended by Shawn Michaels. <br>  <br>  I think Shawn Michaels will end The Undertaker's winning streak at WrestleMania 25.|`|LKKpu0l4aa	yes probably. hbk and the undertaker are the only real legends competing in WWE today. shawn michaels is one of the greatest wrestlers of all time so if anyone can beat the phenom its hbk|`|QbY18bjkaa	yes him nd when Kane 1st broke in<br>  <br>  hbk defeated the undertaker each time they met 1 on 1|`|XDTNSPO2aa	no undertaker has had worse|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	We all know your just gagging for Madison to answer.<br>  <br>  Is this your form of chatting up?|`|FNwxcBPpaa	No, the Undertaker has wrestled bigger and better wrestlers.
6ueL0gkAaa	Hell no. Kozlovs streak didnt last nearly as long as Takers, and lets face it, the majority of Kozlovs winning streak was squash wins over jobbers on free TV, while Taker defeated many top superstars at the PPV Wrestlemania. Also, alot of people emotionally invest in the Undertaker and actually like him, while Kozlov, not many people care about, including me. I find him extremely boring.<br>  <br>  Im not sure if hes smiled since his Deadman return, and I dont think it would be in the characters best interest to do so|`|PniPsDmGaa	Undertaker went a whole year undefeated before too. His year long streak was ended by Hulk Hogan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kozlov's Streak wasnt as huge as the Undertaker's WM streak.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ2-LMAO!! I cant see Undertaker Smiling!!!<br>  <br>  hey but here is a pic of Kozlov Smiling<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/pictures/o/olegprudius/08.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/pic...</a>|`|V2EAMLelaa	Of course not, Are you kidding me? Kozlov's streak is nothing compared to the Undertaker's legendary 16-0 streak..hell Kozlov himself aint nothing compared to Undertaker, Kozlov is just an overrated freak.<br>  <br>  WQ2 = I dont recall the last time  he did|`|QouSk1E7aa	You can't Brock Lesnar had a streak like that too, so did Goldberg|`|vyGyLV7paa	no.  u just cant|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Kozlov - The Kansas City Royals winning four in a row in September, while 26 games out of first place.<br>  <br>  Taker - The New York Yankees sweeping to a pennant in September.<br>  <br>  'Nuff said.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	No, you could never compare Koslov to The Undertaker. The Deadman is the ONLY Wrestler in the WWF/E to go 16-0 at Wrestlemania and soon....it'll be 17-0 with HBK next on his hit list! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WQ#2: Don't think so?|`|EZf00NJJaa	That is pretty funny , thanks .<br>  Can't believe some people compare Taker to Kozlov .<br>  <br>  I'm not going to dignify this topic too much .<br>  It cannot be compared , <br>  any comparison to the streak is stupid .<br>  <br>  That's all I have to say about that .<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ2 : Has The Undertaker ever smiled since his return as The Deadman?<br>  <br>  No ., I have never seen him smile .<br>  You should ask him why he's so serious  .<br>  ;)<br>  Backstage , when he is with Michelle , he always smiles .<br>  She's so sweet , he loves her , apparently .|`|MVvxfEIzaa	u cant , look at the people kozlov defeated in his streak and look at takers! not even close ! <br>  <br>  WQ2 : Has The Undertaker ever smiled since his return as The Deadman?<br>  <br>  i really doubt that he ever smiled !|`|QbY18bjkaa	Nope really who did kozlov really defeated<br>  <br>  in the words of the undertaker, I've seen the best i've fought the best nd i've defeated the best<br>  <br>  <br>  wq.NOPe|`|VENyKvgaaa	maybe<br>  <br>  when Ric Flair left he smiled
XZTwrn2Qaa	Cause they match up well against them. Colts have no running game so they pass all the dam time and the Charges got a good secondary. And the Colts have a lousy Run D while the Chargers have LT, Sproles, and Bennett!|`|XaFYUMRSaa	The Chargers were just playing better at the time.|`|cdQryr7paa	Because they score more points than the Colts do.<br>  It's pretty simple.|`|0ZqJbmVyaa	The Colts have no running game, the D is still a work in progress and now without Dungy they won't make the playoffs for awhile.  At least until they hire a real coach.<br>  <br>  And one thing it is not the quality of the chokers, they are a team in dissarray.  Norvy has won a playoff game so now they will keep him forever, LOL.|`|GWA3NTVpaa	"Is it because of the Colts weak run defense against LT and Sproles?"<br>  <br>  That and the Colts have struggled with teams that run a 3-4 defense, especially in the playoffs: Chargers the past 2 seasons, the Steelers, and the Patriots (several times).|`|msxGICJvaa	well the colt are weaker  than S.D. Because their O line And D line is stronger than the colts.|`|AA10225723	They've got the Colts number. A weird phenomena in sports.|`|xYRl0KABaa	Yes, I agree the colts running game sucks! But, I think we lose to them because of the officiating. There are always horrible calls against the colts during the regular season, but it gets even worse during the playoffs. I know that San Diego is a good team, but the refs deffinitely win the game for them|`|paIUgtLRaa	Relax...<br>  <br>  It's only been twice, and the Colts have been beaten by the Chargers once.<br>  <br>  It's not the end of the world. Prior to this past year, the Chargers beat the Steelers twice. The Steelers had never won. Until last year.|`|xt4vcVIiaa	As a colts fan there are several reasons<br>  1. Our running game<br>  2. Our health<br>  3. Our run defense<br>  4. San Diego matches up well.<br>  <br>  Not to mention that ridiculous defensive holding call. Total bs|`|fiaFQAWWaa	They don't, but if it makes you feel better to think so......|`|YyUlidtAaa	That, and that the Colts run offense just sucks. even Peyton Manning admits that.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	Run defense.

Of course I can think of Rashan Saalam as well.  Both of them could have been hall of fame running backs.  Instead they are hall of fame dope smokers.|`|AA11434842	Ricky "he's so high" Williams<br>  <br>  aka "The Green machine"|`|0MJRD9sYaa	Ricky Williams|`|M2UoFbZ5aa	Ricky Williams|`|Q9mdMnVvaa	ricky williams|`|Bd4gIzwXaa	You will need to be more specific.

He's a stupid goat (in the nicest words) ;) *yes, i hate him*|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Hang on a second honey. When he's scored 300+ goals we can then start to talk about him as a great. He has potential but so had Van Persie!<br>  <br>  OQ: As of now it's David Villa|`|c4GykfVkaa	yeah that wa sbeautiful and with the LEFT foot, but i liked Vela's goal more|`|XU1KaWXwaa	torres best pure striker messi is a winger i think.|`|FNiWMyhkaa	yeh but his second chance wasnt great lol ( the header ) <br>  <br>  and i dont like to answer the best striker in the world questions lol, because i really dont know...people will say messi.|`|uUitKmJMaa	Good goal yeah.<br>  <br>  OQ-Messi, Villa, Torres,<br>  Tbh i can't give one answer.|`|56ItcoTOaa	Rooney,Benzema,Pato and Aquero|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	Yep it was a touch of pure class! Blimey Arsenal have missed his skill he is a great person 2 have in the dressing room 2!
YyEOi1Tpaa	I'd say out of the list is the monday night wars<br>  but my favorite is Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon <br>  Pillmans got a gun is the explanation of the attitude era|`|kZPFCPHVaa	The Ladder Match DVD is great. Get that one.|`|MVvxfEIzaa	the best one to buy is servivor series 2001 (winner takes all)|`|vyGyLV7paa	its up to you man, you have to OPEN with these wrestling DVD's maaaaannn...|`|Rfv15ldlaa	Triple H; The King of Kings|`|lr68XuMFaa	I say the The Monday Night War DVD|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	All of them.
a5X1sHHpaa	Vince is mad at all the spoilers getting leaked so he decided to plant fake storylines everywhere in the internet. This could be one of them because The Rock told interviewers that he will never wrestle again and only wants to continue his actor life.|`|cDJ9Ntskaa	I Really Hope So But I Read An Interview With The WWE Corperates And The Rock And They Are Trying To Get The Rock To Return At WrestleMania 25 But It Said That He Has No Interest In Wrestling Again...... But I Am Just Like You... I Want Him To Return His CANDY *** To The WWE!!|`|lpi0FoPCaa	I dont wanna believe the rock 'never wants to return to wrestling again'<br>  he must still have a love for it, i think saying he will NEVER return is kinda sad, the passion for it cant of just gone LIKE that.|`|lr68XuMFaa	I think they have just given away who is going to be at Wrestlemania 25|`|db7e40dd5354decef471fb1fb7b3d134aa	He could appear, but doubtfull to have a match<br>  <br>  Here are there plans for Wrestlemania:<br>  <br>  Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels, with Taker going 17-0 at WM<br>  <br>  Triple H vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title<br>  <br>  Edge vs. The Big Show vs. John Cena for the World Heavyweight Title<br>  <br>  Some surprises in the MITB ladder match, as Kane, Mark Henry are rumored to be in the match. Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|vyGyLV7paa	that would be soo awesome, he is still in the perfect shape to wrestle, and he isnt a very good actor, so he'd probably be better off in the WWE|`|JvSCCiKfaa	The Rock is to good for WWE.|`|97jqpA54aa	yeah rumor has it that he and Stone Cold will face Jerico in a lumberjack match with the legends as the lumberjacks|`|aEB5p3pPaa	we would love to,but probably impossible.but i hope he will.because Cena needs to get his @$$ kicked by The Rock!|`|3yNmclJgaa	I would bloody love it if the Rock was at WM25|`|xvg1QBnzaa	I hope so.<br>  <br>  i'd love to see a legends battle royal :)|`|6LQNK51uaa	I hope but I know not a chance b/c he will be busy in post production of his latest Disney movie.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	That would be great! We'd have Hulk Hogan, The Rock, and Stone Cold at Wrestlemania together!
xQFWjFyZaa	Right now, Huston Street. But, by midseason, you're going to prefer Brad Ziegler whether he has the Closer role or not.|`|92e74b5c9571c9dcdd15573e4a3ba0b4aa	Huston Street<br>  <br>  1) Ziegler doesn't even have the closer spot secured yet as he is competing with Joey Devine. And most reports are that they will split time during the season. I don't want a split-time reliever as my closer.<br>  <br>  2) Hard to say who's the better team between Oakland and Colorado, but the NL West is a much weaker division and thus Street should get more save chances.<br>  <br>  An argument can be made for Ziegler as his ERA and WHIP were terrific last year and Corpas is a threat to take Street's job eventually, but overall I'd say take Street. It'll be tough for Ziegler to put up those numbers again as he was eventually figured out towards the end of the year after his long consecutive innings streak without giving up a run. And at least Street has the job officially as opposed to Zielger, I'm just saying if by July Street has blown some saves here and there Corpas could definitely snatch the job|`|SuHwCVDFaa	Take Huston Street...Ziegler had a good rookie year but he is injury prone.
13gbXfvfaa	i don't think he can|`|UzHt495Saa	from what i'm seeing,it looks like HHH will be the one killing Orton.|`|2Ms54b2Laa	Not me.|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	who doesnt know that wwe is now rated PG.|`|PniPsDmGaa	Orton has beaten Triple H in the past, has never beaten Triple H fairly. when i say fairly i mean like at No Mercy, Triple H had to defend his WWE title against 3 guys, then Orton. And Randy Orton could never beat Triple H for the WWE Championship after he lost it to Triple H at Backlash. Orton is only able to beat Triple H with Legacy.|`|GtW5KC4Zaa	Randy orton sucks, triple  is old enough  to be his father so he there not try it|`|08c83c602388f929bd8807d854eaf1bcaa	don't you mean that Randy Orton can tame the beast inside Triple H?|`|rsqO9vUnaa	if with legacy yes,but without legacy no.|`|IRzYJSlaaa	no|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	Triple H is old and his children have made his character soft.  the best answer is yes he can.|`|caczNImxaa	i think thy are evenly matched
irljnVkAaa	I like it. Middlesbrough have one of the nicer kits this season. I didn't know abouth the material but that just makes it better.|`|uXXbegw5aa	Yeah :)|`|tfotPdeZaa	Its not bad actually.. the material looks nice.<br>  <br>  Spurs kit didnt come out yet i think.. i cant find it :(|`|0s8uOZHCaa	I think the kit looks terrible. Just because your kit is made of 'good' material doesn't ignore the fact that your team is crap and is probably gonna be relegated under Gareth Southgate<br>  <br>  Edit: You were trying to boast that your team has the most advanced kit, but all this nanotechnology does it prevent stains.|`|uUitKmJMaa	Haha.Good material. But its still a boring kit.<br>  :P<br>  <br>  Edit- I luv my liverpool Jersey..And carslberg...(Y)<br>  haha you think your boro one is nice, and i think my Lfc one is nice ok.? :L|`|5dc44f1c97d196e64cd52bb0686a1abbaa	its better material than other seasons, aslong as we beat everton today, i dont care. C`MON BORO!!!|`|tTuRfzyQaa	k
buPeIIreaa	very good goal! <br>  vela will be a world-class striker in no more than 5 years. and big teams like barcelona and real madrid will be sniffing him around. but he'll hopefully stay|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Not watching the game but according to Eurosport it was very good!|`|4BppP7Mkaa	That was truly AMAZING.|`|l4bETJslaa	Yeah I'm a Manchester united supporter and it looked world class.<br>  <br>  What is great about it is he misses simple chances and yet can give goals like that.|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	I completely agree with you.<br>  <br>  Brilliant<br>  <br>  This is coming from a manchester united supporter also! lol|`|uUitKmJMaa	Yeah good goal.
c4GykfVkaa	i said just the same ! the goal was amasing and everyone was just talking about Eduardo's goal. i liked eduardo's goal as well, but Vela's one was truly amasing

Others would laugh at the "Who would you not want to babysit your kids" kind of questions lol.  But for the most part, I don't think many would be surprised, because a lot of the points expressed on this site are what the general public feel.

BMn7l54Haa	First of he would be 16-1 if he were to loose at Wrestlemania 25, and if that happened I would actually be satisfied because I personally believe that the WWE should just stop determining the winners for matches altogether because people like me are really starting to wonder do some wrestlers actually have what it takes to win mathches against ceartain wrestlers. I believe Taker vs. HBK could most likely become a draw though. It would have me wondering where that would leave Undertaker's Wrestlemanina streak.

ABoo1doVaa	I can't think of a bad QB that won a national championship. Krenzel was the perfect QB for that OSU team. He was smart(degree in molecular genetics) and he didn't make many mistakes. He could make things happen with his feet. Charlie Ward at Florida State was never going to be in the NFL, but he was a great QB. Tebow isn't that great throwing the football, but he runs his offense great. Leak was a good college player, but was never going to play in the pros. <br>  <br>  That kid from LSU and Krenzel pretty much played the position exactly the same. Since I can't think of a bad QB to win the NC, I will go with Leak.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the officials comment, Miami had 1st in goal at the 1 yard line and couldn't punch it in. The fact that they are still crying about that call shows you why they didn't punch it in. They weren't man enough. That game would have never made it to over time if the officials wouldn't have blown a call on a catch that would have given Ohio State a first down late in the fourth quarter.|`|jisJ1Bj3aa	Krenzel- technically he did win a national championship, but the officials had more impact on the game then he did|`|YH375R9jaa	Toretta.or Griese.|`|8x8FIm9zaa	Gino Torretta|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Tee Martin.|`|XDTNSPO2aa	tom brady he cheated|`|AA11434842	Totally agree<br>  <br>  Screw Krenzel and screw Ohio St.
Vyz5YnZqaa	The first close game they lose that TO is open and Edwards doesn't throw him the ball.

He didnt destroy them so I dont know what the anwer will be.

The fact that he signed with Buffalo shows that no good team wanted to pick him up either due to his reputation or age and durability concerns.|`|AA10263761	I Say Week 8|`|q9D1mCJnaa	He won;t he is a boy scout the first year, and its a 1 year deal<br>  <br>  This is T.O.'s last shot at a big payday, if his a model citizen puts up his usual big numbers the Bills get to the second round of the playoffs <br>  He will cash in big time|`|pR0pJNJkaa	T.O. will make them better. they will be in the playoffs.

He's 35 years old now and this is his 4th team he has been on, so I think that he will be a team player and just try to win some football games and eventually bring a playoff birth to Buffalo.  I think T.O. coming to Buffalo will be good for him because it is such a low key place.  I think with the Bills being such a young football team he'll step up and be a leader that they need.  Whatever happened in San Fransisco and Philadelphia happened, but all this crap about him tearing the team apart in Dallas is a bunch of b.s.  The biggest problem in Dallas was Tony Romo.  <br>  Oh yeah campNsmoke....what the hell are you talking about that its such a tough division with the pats and jets? I agree it is a tought division but why would you say with the jets?  Who's their quarterback? Clemens? yeah he's gonna take them real far...lol.....I agree the pats are definitly the powerhouse in the division but other than that its wide open.  I will be that the Jets don't win more than 5 or 6 games this year if their lucky!!!! and I will guarantee the Bills sweep them this year|`|L68Sd6obaa	The second half of the season. The first half, he will try to fit in and when he isn't getting the ball as much, because Trent Edwards won't be able to, then he will start crying and making trouble for the team.

He gives them a premier Receiver and they have an adequate running back so who knows.<br>  Every touchdown he gets will be an indictment on the Cowboys move...like what Kurt Warner did this year was on all his former teams. I also wanna see how horrible Romo will be this year without T O.|`|6N8aZlhbaa	I was watching a story yesterday and Buffalo doesn't play any of Owen's former teams this year.

kqP7GwOcaa	"If Floyd was White"?  Give me a break, I can't even see how the race issue is part of this discussion, Sean G has his head up his  @ss farther that the red necks who hate on Floyd do theirs.  <br>  <br>  The fact remains that Floyd Mayweather was along with Roy Jones Jr. the best of his era.  An undefeated White guy named Joe Calzahge doesn't get or for that matter deserve the respect that his last two victims get.  That has nothing to do with race either, it's when and who they fought during their careers that define a historical legacy.  It boils down to quality of competition, and in that regard, Floyd absolutely and completely dominated the lighter weights, beating everybody who was anybody from 125 thru 140.  Mayweather ducked no one at the lower weights, and simply cannot be criticized.  The fact that Floyd was never a true welterweight, much like Hatton and Pacquiao are not true welterweights has a lot to do with Floyd's careful selection of opponents at 147 lbs.<br>  <br>  Is it spineless cowardice or smart business to avoid the dangerous, talent packed group of Mosely, Cotto, Margaraito, Clottey, Berto or Williams?  That is a murderer's row straight out of the history books, and truth be told if Floyd comes back and beats them all, (a distinct possibility) history and his critics would be forced to acknowledge his accomplishment by putting his name right along names like Henry Armstrong, Sugar Ray Leonard, Carmine Basilo,  and Thomas Hearns, the best of history's great welterweights.<br>  <br>  That said, if Floyd came back, beat all the great welterweights of today, and then continued on up and knocked off Pavlik, Jermaine Taylor and Joe Calzaghe, he still wouldn't be mentioned along side Sugar Ray Robinson.  If Floyd retired 75 and O with multiple titles and an even greater resume than Hector Camachos' he still wouldn't measure up to the 200 plus fight career with 175 wins and over a 100 KO's that Sugar Ray Robinson posted during his incredible career.<br>  <br>  It's no knock on today's fighters, it's just a simple fact that none of them fight enough to surpass the all time greats of the past.  As little guys go, Floyd is already among the historical elite, but P4P he doesn't even crack the historical top ten, and unfortunately at the rate he his managing his career he never will.<br>  <br>  His legacy as a hall of fame P4P great during his era is secure no matter what he does, but to compare him to history's P4P best is a tall order for a little guy like George Dixon to fill, let alone Floyd Mayweather.  Floyd simply cannot be held responsible for the time frame he lived in, but that is the reason he won't ever reach Dixon's stature, let alone Ray Robinson's.<br>  <br>  I totally disagree with ElmerFuddstein and Boxing Fan since 06 on this one.  Floyd might have been the best of his era, but could never be considered the historical P4P best the sport ever produced.<br>  <br>  Floyd coming back against Juan Manuel Marquez is a spectacular move, and a must attend for any boxing fan.  If Floyd does it, the Welterweight division is his to conquer.  But Sugar Ray Robinson's legacy is a head and shoulders above any plateau a modern fighter could hope to reach.  The P4P best will always be Ray Robinson.|`|daad940e9bc0b3b1281557caf3a3f195aa	There are too many good Welters for Floyd not to be fighting them. Fights against Marquez and Pacquiao would just be high profile money fights that Floyd knows he can win because both those guys, as good as they are, are not really big enough and not true Welters. The 147lb division is overflowing with talent and good fighters, and Floyd really had a chance to cement his legacy and be mentioned in the same breath with Ray Robinson, Ali, and Ray Leonard by beating these guys. But he chose to retire rather than fight the best Welters like Cotto, Mosley, Williams, Margarito, Clottey, Berto, etc while these guys continue to go after each other. Cotto-Clottey is very close to being signed for June. All the other top Welters have no problem fighting each other and it's kinda sad that the so-called best former P4P top dog was never in the mix with the rest of those guys.|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	Greatest P4P of all time?  I don't think so.  At welterweight he beat Gatti, Judah, Baldomir and Hatton.  At superwelter he beat Delahoya.  Gatti was entertaining but not a top fighter.  Baldomir only beat Judah.  Hatton has never looked good at welterweight.  Delahoya fight was close but boring.  He had better fights at the lower weights but even with this plus a Pacman win he doesn't deserve a P4P greatest of all time.  Don't you think he should have fought more fighters at welterweight?  He retired when there was some big names for him to fight, Cotto, Margarito, Mosley.  Being P4p greatest of all time not only requires skill and talent but also balls and a competive spirit to fight the best around you.  Mayweather obviously doesn't have that and thats fine.  He certainly was P4P the greatest of the last couple years but its laughable to put him as THE all time great.  Anyways isn't Chad Dawson the best P4P fighter out there? LOL|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	It wouldn't really change my thoughts on him at all, if he loses to either they are very great fighters, if he beats both of them well the truth is that They should of never moved up that high in weight. He has a long way to go and a lot of questions to answer before he should even be considered a top ten in history and it will take more then a win over both of them to do that.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	No media outlet has heard anything directly from Floyd himself.  I saw a vid of him at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and he looked to be in as good a shape as most fighters do when they get into the ring.  Dude looks the furthest thing for an ex boxer.<br>  <br>  As far as the p4p all-time moniker?  I suppose that's the most frustrating part for me.  He has missed about a year and a half of his prime, and it will be 2 years if he comes back now.  That time could have been spent beating guys like Cotto, Margarito, Berto, Paqciou, Mosely and such.  A string of wins against those guys would almost definitely force everyone to put him in the same category as Ray Robinson.  There are so many delicious fights out there for him, the field of competition will never be this rich again.  As a fan, I'd like to see all these guys square off.  But Floyd is on the sidelines.|`|bqrLJeceaa	I would consider him the best pfp but not the greatest of all times he claims he is. Floyd has hardly been in a fight with someone that actually has the chance to beat him and does not want any hard fights. Its actually a shame because i dont think anyone below 154 can beat him, he beats cotto, williams and mosley but not easily. If he fights marquez and pac it will be because he views it as a big money fight that he knows he can easily win and not to test his ability.|`|2e9d4f6fa0162f9318139ea5f2260b1eaa	if he beats cotto,williams and mosley he would be considered P.F.P. the best. <br>   cotto vs mayweather-   cotto by UD<br>  williams vs mayweather- williams by KO<br>  mosley vs mayweather- mosley by split decision<br>  <br>   thius is the reason why gayweather retired, he knows he can't beat these guys.<br>  <br>  marquez vs mayweather-  draw<br>  pacman vs mayweather-  pacman by UD<br>  <br>     MY opinion mayweather should stay retired, i think it would be a disgrace if comes back to fight the small guys like marquez and pacman. he should fight cotto first.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	Floyd alreay is the most perfect boxer I have ever seen. He's undefeated. He has superior hand speed. He's the best defensive fighter that I have ever seen (Pacman's big weakness). He has radar on his punches...and no one is ever in his level of shape...that's why everone drowns against him after round 5. He spars 6 minute rounds. He spars against guys in different weight classes. People always discredit who he fought but he fights the best. He is a prize fighter though and goes after the biggest pot. Pacman is a big pot right now so I can see that happening. Like its been said. Gatti was suppose to knock him out. Baldimir was suppose to beat him. Oscar was suppose to knock him out. Hatton was undefeated and was suppose to knock him out. (Went and hired his daddy...no that's being on someones nuts). Also there was someone who put race in the game. Race has always been a part of boxing since the days of Jack Johnson, Joe Louis and Ali. It still is. Larry Merchant and Ring give black fighters no credit. I don't think Floyd wants Marquez either, not for fear...but because it wont make dollars or sense (cents).<br>  <br>  If Floyd was a white American fighter with his record and his resume he'd be the best thing since sliced "white" bread.|`|6sjirqA7aa	Well I dislike him for being a coward but I want him to come back and make this year exciting for boxing in the hot welter weight division. I would consider him the best P4P if he beat Mosley, Cotto, and Pac-man, He has to make up for being off boxing for almost 2 years. THEN I would give him respect.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Mayweather sucks, but guys like you will never get off his nuts no matter what.<br>  <br>  Best P4P in history?    LOL!|`|AA12139128	we have 2 options for lb 4 lb fighters right now, pacquiao and marquez. (but let me make it clear when i refer to marquez that even though hes a top lb 4 lb fighters, hes the least probable in ANY plans because hes the smaller draw). mayweather has the skill to give them both tough fights so he shouldnt duck eighther. if he unretires he better not just come back for one fight, he has to handle his business. id say this is the best scenario business wise for floyd and most likely the scenario he will chose, even though i dont like it because it involves some ducking..<br>  <br>  mosley is a probable next opponent for pacquiao, but cotto is more likely, and maybe a 3rd fight with marquez... pacquiao has to beat hatton, maybe beat cotto and maybe even face marquez too. then maybe mayweather will unretire to face pacquiao or whoever beats pacquiao. floyd probably dont want no part of cotto or marquez so he will probably want manny to beat them so he doesnt have to face them. but mayweather HAS to face who ever dethrones pacquiao and then some maybe, at least to be seen as good as he thinks he is. but if mayweather beats pacquiao before pacquiao gets to cotto or marquez then he has to fight at least one of them and then he has to fight mosley.<br>  <br>  so theres basically 2 mandatory fights out there for him to be the best. pacquiao (or whoever beats him first) and mosley.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	Well Marquez calling him out was pretty stupid and I think it was only for publicity and he doesn't really want to fight him. Marquez is 35 and is a brawler not a boxer, someone with a defensive style like May would have a field day with that. It would be a stupid fight and a waste of a comeback. Next although I would love to see him fight Pacman and it would easily shut a few critics up, I would prefer him to fight someone more his size and more at 147 pounds. People accuse him of retiring because he wanted to duck guys like Cotto and Margarito and the fact that whoever won their bout would become number one contender for May's title and him retiring right after it was announced doesn't help discredit his critics. A fight with Pac would certainly quiet a few people and add to his bank account comfortably, a fight with Cotto is needed. He was accused of ducking the welters, so why not fight the person ranked 1 in that division and that people accused you of ducking. If May wants legacy instead of more money and more critics he should fight Cotto and Pac.

I used the histories of the 30 existing teams, overlooking any major league teams of the 19th century that have long since been contracted.

The Spiders' run differential: -723.<br>  <br>  Not surprisingly, that was the Spiders' final season, as the NL contracted from 12 to 8 teams.

jTaW3goeaa	It goes both ways.  90 percent of the people in the terrain parks that have no freestyle ability and are just skiing the hill without hitting the features are skiers.  <br>  <br>  And whenever you go to pass a skier they flip out and say you get too close to them, but if they actually let you have a little room to get around them, you wouldn't have to be so close.  <br>  <br>  My personal favorite is all the times skiers cut me off or run into me.  Or how they ride unpredictably during the busiest part of the day, thats a great way to get run into <br>  <br>  Skiers show no respect towards me so they get none in return.  <br>  <br>  The next time you think a snowboarder is crazy, think about all the stuff skiers do to cause problems for snowboarders|`|qyATAaeXaa	There is red paint on both sides of this fence.<br>  <br>  No matter what you ride, if you are uphill of another person, it is YOUR responsibility to steer clear of those below you. If you come up on the blind spot of a snowboarder and get run into, it is YOUR fault. It always helps to call out when passing...but skiers and riders alike often have their damned ipods jammed into their ears so they won't hear you anyway.<br>  <br>  Bristol is correct when he says most skiers in the park are just skiing through. In that case anyone who skis below a feature is asking for it. Once a skier or rider starts their run to hit a feature, anyone skiing on the downslope side of the feature needs to steer clear. However, before starting the run it is the responsibility of the person hitting the feature to make sure the LZ is clean. <br>  <br>  NO ONE should ever park their butts or stand in the middle of a piste. If you gotta stop, get to the side. Likewise, you should never stop under the crest of a headwall where an uphill rider or skier cannot see you. <br>  <br>  Ski Patrol has no right to discriminate. I don't target people, but I will watch skiers and riders who I know I've given a warning to already. <br>  <br>  There's just as many park-rats on skis who offend in the same way snowboarders do. There are riders and skiers who go down terrain well beyond their ability level in a snowplow or sideslipping...and there always will be. If you are a more experienced skier or rider, it is easier for you to move around them. If you can't...then you have no right to complain because you probably shouldn't be on that terrain either.|`|VBSURuKtaa	A percentage of snowboarders and skiers alike are "crazy." It has to do with a difference of style. Snowboarders ride differently and turn differently than skiers. The problem is that neither party really understands the others', so it makes it impossible to determine what someone's next move will be. I personally have been hit by about 19 skiers since I started riding five years ago. Unfortunately, the majority of snowboarders are teenagers, and skiers tend to swing the other way. The reason that I point that out is that teenagers are likely to have attitudes, be aggressive, or be competitive, whether they ride two boards or one. Unfortunately this demographic has given snowboarders a bad reputation, so they receive no respect from skiers, and therefore see no reason to give respect. If people simply stuck to trails that were in their skill reach, everyone would be better off.|`|p3qMXuPGaa	It goes both ways so next time you think its them, think about it because they can view you the same way.  I can remember when skiers used to spit on me and throw stuff off the chairlift at me when I was a teenager.  Hell 3 weeks ago I got my seasons pass pulled by a power tripping ski patroller who openly admitted they were discriminating against snowboarders.<br>  <br>  The problem isn't what the person is using to get down the hill the problem is the people who are using the hill.|`|DvXlfiI6aa	beacuse skiers can't do **** and snowboarders own... they are the best... you see snowboarders hitting all the rails and boxes and jumps.. tell me when you have ever saw a skier hit a jump or do a box or grind the rail..............|`|OOeoFvB6aa	The skier responsibility code says that if you're uphill, then you are the one who has to be able to stop or avoid whatever is downhill from you.<br>  <br>  That said, if you're merging and don't look uphill, the same as you would do if you were crossing the street, then you're an idiot.<br>  <br>  It isn't just the snowboarders!  The problem we see on our mountain isn't about skiers vs. snowboarders, but about people skiing on trails that are way beyond their ability.  They take the beginner lesson and then want to be with their friends on the intermediate or advanced terrain.  They have no control yet and don't know mountain etiquette.  <br>  <br>  We have a run at our mountain called Last Will & Testament.  You've got to know that with a name like that, saying that you've skied it is a rite of passage for every boy aged 8-12.  It doesn't matter that they can't ski at that level yet, it's all about bragging rights. What a nightmare!<br>  <br>  We also have a problem with terrain park etiquette, skiers and snowboarders BOTH, going in, not knowing the rules for dropping in, clearing landings etc. and causing collisions.<br>  <br>  Another problem I've been seeing is the high speed lifts that many areas are putting in seem to significantly increase the number of people on the hill.  I was at Bristol a few weeks ago, a gorgeous, sunny NY day so the hill was mobbed.  I'm a skilled skier and had trouble not getting hit or staying out of people's way.  My son, a skier, got taken out by a snowboarder who hit him so hard he got knocked out of both skis and got a bloody nose.  But the boarder stopped and helped and apologized, which was the most important thing.  It really was just an accident.  And on a crowded hill there are going to be accidents.<br>  <br>  Snowboarders aren't the bad guys.  Look around next time you're out, there are some awesome and very polite riders out there.

Orton on his own isnt so good, and he proved this in 2007/2008 when he was WHC. He used to cut very dry, boring monotone promos, and back then I questioned the WWE on why they were pushing him. I think over the past 6 months though, especially since he came back from shoulder surgery, that Orton has improved tremendously on the mic and in the development of his character. So as of right now, I find him tolerable, when before I didnt.
Wo2TEbHPaa	Lmao i think they just do it to piss 2k9 off. They have there game on every sytem and still lose in sales.
A8mKCXuUaa	Yes,they should coz a country should take part in every sport.|`|NR4hbYPiaa	This is what happened last time USA 'tried cricket' against Australia<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004/OD_TOURNEYS/ICCCT/SCORECARDS/AUS_USA_ICCCT_ODI5_13SEP2004.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004/...</a>|`|gfxXikenaa	no i dont think so. they better stick to baseball because you arent allowed steroids in cricket.|`|cWuumdy7aa	just to avoid the britsh colonial influence American devised Base ball . they dont want any linkage with British Rule|`|7T4dvrm3aa	they are trying it but they are not good enough,,,they played in champions trophy 2004 and they lost badly,,,their cricket board( so called) is almost bankrupt,,,,their players are not really from USA,,they are generally the unsuccessful west indies players,,,,,,and some of them made their debut as 40 year olds in champions trophy in 2004 in england,,,i think their goernment is not taking it seriously ,,,they are more into baseball,,,they are not interested in cricket,,,in fact some americans stupidly think that cricket was originated from BASEBALL,and some of them ,infact many of them say it's boring game,,and on top of it some people say cricket is just another form of BASEBALL,,so i don't think they will be doing anything good in cricket for next 50 years,,,,,,hope it gave you information ,,,have a nice day,bye|`|NDbx9CSvaa	No for a few reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Crappy countries ruin the sport for spectators. In a tri series that involves 2 test playing nations and 1 new nation, 66% of the matches get ruined since they involve the new nation. eg. Tri series held in SA sometime ago involving South Africa, India and Kenya although surprisingly Kenya did defeat India in 1 match. I would also love to see Bangladesh leave cricket. They too suck, god knows how many years it will take them to get better.<br>  <br>  2) Americans have a sad choice in sports...baseball, american football (from what angle is it football?? the occasional contact of foot and ball? hey, even in cricket the ball hits the legs of a batsman at times), basketball, WWE (LOLOLOLOL) etc<br>  <br>  3) It's way too complex. Trust me, baseball (which is the lame version of cricket) is way too simple.<br>  <br>  But, I'd say the biggest reason is #1. A USA vs a established country match just ruins the mood for a lot of people. A USA vs established country series would be even worse.|`|lVKwnFvjaa	No, because they would eventually use their power and wealth to take over administrative control of the game, as they have with golf, and make rules and other changes to suit their side.  <br>  <br>  Leave them to their glorified Rounders.|`|G0lO7djeaa	You think,you like a cricket becoming for big fiasco?|`|kCNInRgUaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...

Also, they should be able to live off their millions til death.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	^<br>  |<br>  |<br>  |<br>  |<br>  |<br>  |<br>  <br>  Shaq is one of those gods
hMkb7H31aa	The rule is that the manager has to be on the 25 man roster in order to be able to insert himself into the lineup.  Pete Rose (Cincinnati), Frank Robinson (Cleveland) and Lou Boudreau (Cleveland) were Player/Managers.<br>  <br>  Each team is allowed 25 players on their roster at the Major League level.  Some players come and go between the majors and minors - but 25 is the maximum (until Sept 1st when it is expanded to 40).<br>  <br>  If a team runs out of players before the game ends, the manager can not insert himself unless he is on the roster (before the game started). The game would have to be forfeited.  And that situation is enforced. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps you.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Only if he was on the active player roster at the time, and we haven't seen a player-manager since Rose in 1986, as others have noted.<br>  <br>  Slightly more recently, the 1988 Yankees activated then-coach Chris Chambliss, who had not played since 1986, and had him pinch-hit in one game. Unfortunately, he struck out, looking.|`|gMTatFZBaa	A couple of the good regulars here like Frizzer and Fungo are right.<br>  <br>  The manager would have to be on the 25 man roster to be inserted into a game. That's the only way. No current managers are and the last one was Pete Rose in the 80s.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	You have to be on the 25 man roster to play|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	The maximum number of players on a MLB team is set at 24.  There have been player managers in the past, such as Pete Rose in '85 and '86, that have taken one of those roster positions.  However, There are no player managers active today in MLB and since these managers are not listed on the 24 man roster they can't participate in the game as a player.|`|kDNE2kw5aa	A player can only enter the game if they are on the roster, a manager can be on the roster as a player also I doubt it has happened in a long time but it is possible.  Normally Managers are older and have long seen their playing days pass them by.|`|oblnqjenaa	Mangers could probably do that, but its never happened, And probably never will happen because managers are usually retired baseball players and they are very old.|`|0VbAMZccaa	no way. The managers are way too old to play|`|V430UrvFaa	In the past, there used to be managers who played the field also, but they were still young. Today there aren't any player-managers because they are too old, and they have too much time on their hands to play. A team always carries about 5 bench players for any injured players and has a huge minor league system.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Probably not.<br>  <br>  But, if the manager was young enough and still in shape to play, someone would have to be moved from the active roster, and then the manager would have to active himself to be placed on the roster.<br>  <br>  Pete Rose was the last player/manager for the Reds, and Joe Torre had one at-bat as the Mets' manager before he took himself off of the roster in 1977.
0ZqJbmVyaa	If Ryan follows the family pattern, the offense doesn't really matter it's all about the Defense.|`|KTp27Fokaa	They're probably gonna draft Mark Sanchez, if he falls to them. I don't think the Jets have any confidence in him.|`|cdQryr7paa	I doubt they think that.<br>  But since the screwed Pennington over and cut him last year, Clemens is all they have left after the great Favre experiment.<br>  So unless they draft or sign a better QB, they are stuck with Clemens.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	They should trade for Matt Lienart<br>  <br>  He would love NYC and he is stuck behind warner <br>  the Card could get something instead of wasting that cap money sitting on the Bench|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	Actually, I think they have more faith in Ratliff than they do Clemens, and I think by the time the season starts, if they don't sign a veteran player, Ratliff will be the starter.|`|gRXy66dOaa	I believe he can<br>  and besides I think we now got the best defense in the league<br>  <br>  The lasttime he played QB, he didn't have a good O-line and the WR's and TE's were droping passes|`|zCSBVAbyaa	No he is terrible. The Jets need to be careful this year as the Dolphins just won the division, the Patriots have Tom Brady back, and the Bills are looking good with the TO signing. If the Jets don't get a quarterback, than all of the free agent signings will look stupid as it was only on defense and they neglected the offense. If they have Clemens next year, then the Jets will be around 6-10 and miss the playoffs.|`|xYRl0KABaa	No, they're just keeping him so they can build a team during the next few years and all he has to do is manage the game.|`|g0LP0Cx0aa	Clemens has a strong arm, I think he has potential to be a starter. He also played behind Favre last season,so I think he got a few tips to help himself.

rsqO9vUnaa	Bring back Bra and Panties match!|`|gXHxf2G9aa	Here's two suggestions:<br>  <br>  1. Queen of the ring: Similar to the superstars version only difference is that every diva match will have a different stipulation which can range from Falls Count Anywhere, Ladder or Tables match.  In the second round it gets more extreme.  The matches to chose from would be TLC, Hell in a Cell and First blood.  The divas who make it to the final match would be in for a surprise.  The final match is an elimination chamber but the stipulation is that the chamber is filled with the diva's with 5 randomly selected divas who lost matches previously but they're in the cells and every minute one diva would be released and it would be up to them which final competitor to help win the match.<br>  <br>  2. Divas Elimination chamber but with a huge twist.  Five are placed in a cell and two start off.  The only difference with this is that they will have access to foreign objects but the most important is the ladder because the only way to win is to climb the ladder and escape through the roof of the chamber.  Never been done before so might be interesting to watch especially when you have 6 divas fighting it out.|`|Voa3zqGFaa	Yeah they should have Divas Do these Matches!<br>  But they won't bcuz WWE is PG and they don't<br>  have xtreme matches any more!|`|iWcTmuhAaa	" Lingerie " well I am bored of such stuff.<br>  " Chocolate Pudding "  sweet idea, would love to see.<br>  <br>  you mentioned some other matches that are good but unfortunately we don't have such divas that are to talented for it.

S0u3HKzhaa	1) Although all are very interesting options but I'd go with Stone Cold Steve Austin.Him and Jericho have a great history together.They have great chemistry together already and they have faced each other on many occasions.And Chris Jericho is bashing legends and particularly the HOF and with Stone Cold leading the HOF this year it is perfect.And the fans have been chanting one more match at Stone Cold for years.And really who better then someone he has a long history and great in ring chemistry and has been bragging about the night he beat Stone Cold and The Rock on the same night.I would like to see Stone Cold vs. Chris Jericho the most.<br>  <br>  2)Evan Bourne,usually I don't like these young wrestlers right away.But Evan Bourne is very impressive.His moves are amazing.And I'd like to see the wwe actually push him.So I think the MITB would be a good push for the kid his career is very bright ahead of him.It really has just started.<br>  The Brian Kendrick for the same reasons.He is good and should be pushed.<br>  <br>  3)Evan Bourne,for all the reasons I listed above a world title would be a great push for him.<br>  <br>  4)Gail Kim the womens division really needs a change.A different Diva in the mix who is hot and can actually wrestle.Not like these Diva's who are there based on looks alone.<br>  <br>  5)I think that girl that one American Idol a few years back from Texas.Carrie Underwood.I think her name was.Sorry if I'm wrong.But she has a nice voice.<br>  <br>  6) Hell In A Cell.After all the Undertkaer never beat Shawn in a Hell in a Cell match.And it would be a great match for Wrestlemania.And it is already an amazing hyped match already and that would make it even better.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	Stone Cold Steve Austin<br>  Vladimir Kozlov<br>  Hurricane Helms<br>  Kane<br>  Hulk Hogan<br>  Hilary Duff (Houston native) <br>  Last Ride match (haven't had that at WM yet)<br>  <br>  and that's the bottom line 'cause Stone Cold said so!|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	1) Chris Jericho's Opponent should be:<br>              Stone Cold Steve Austin.<br>  <br>  2) The Last two contenders for MiTB should be:<br>                           Evan Bourne, Rey Mysterio<br>  <br>  3) Who do you think should win MiTB? <br>      MVP or Shelton (too early for Evan Bourne to win, start him off with a smaller title and build him up)<br>  <br>  4) Who are you looking forward for a return this coming May?<br>                         Mr. Kennedy<br>  <br>  5)Who Do you think should sing the National Anthem at WM25?<br>                       Idk<br>  <br>   6) Taker vs HBK should be in a:<br>               Singles match, these two have nothing personal, no need for a gimmick match|`|hL3eS2zKaa	1.

ScCZh0vQaa	Well, the more relaxed when running, the more endurance you have. When you have more endurance, you are able to run faster and longer distances.<br>  <br>  Mouth should be open so you are able to breathe easily. Breathe in through your nose and out of your mouth.<br>  <br>  Arms shouldn't be swinging everywhere, they should be close to the body. Your thumb should be on the top of your index finger, NOT making a tight fist. A tight fist doesn't make you feel relaxed. <br>  <br>  Good running shoes help with running. Front of the foot should be landing first then the heel. Knees should be moving like you are riding a bike. <br>  <br>  Make sure your friend stretches before and after running so she won't get sore.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zZtAYBowaa	14sec is goood!!!Ask her to run barefoot on the beach and tie some heavy thing on her hip<with a rope>!!<br>  <br>  and ask her to hit the nearest stadium gallery!!!ask her to stride across to or more steps!!!!<br>  <br>  hope it'l help!!:)|`|lJ9tKzdvaa	thats pretty fast for a female, depending on the age.<br>  <br>  im going to be helping with middle school track this year, and the record for boys is a mid 10 sec. and the girls is a high 11.<br>  <br>  to get faster at it, the 100m is all about the start.<br>  <br>  the 100m is decided in the first 5 steps usually, so thats the area she should work on the most.|`|eELS8zSRaa	If her endurance is high enough, along with her power she should do great. She should really focus on her start, make sure that she always uses blocks and talks to her coach about using them properly.

br1kwegaaa	Right now, yep.  They won at Illinois and at Michigan St. and ended up 10-8 in the Big 10.  But very soft non-conference schedule (ranked #309) can come back to bite them.  They need to win a game in the Big 10 tourney to feel secure about making the big dance.<br>  <br>  Last 4 In:<br>  Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, South Carolina<br>  Last 4 Out:<br>  Arizona, Providence, St. Mary's Virginia Tech|`|O0zfwHnwaa	Penn State shouldn't be in over some teams.  Michigan and Wisconsin should be ahead of them due to better nonconference victories.  However, Penn state is with Minnesota and Northwestern at the moment.  Minnesota beat Louisville on the road, but that was the only game they played against a decent team nonconference.  Northwestern beat someone good from the ACC and are 8-9.  If Northwestern beats tuos today I think they're in, PSU and OSU are in a lot of danger of going out.  If that happens and either team loses their first round match up, they're done.
I1w0HfQbaa	Since this is a BOXING section I will answer it in a boxing manner. Ali-G starts off round one throwing left jab but Borat counters with a straight right hand and sends Ali-G reeling on the ropes and he is against the ropes and Borat hits Ali-G with a couple of left hooks and sends him on the canvas. The result: Borat KNOCKS OUT Ali G in the first round of an epic and thrilling fight right up there with such one round classics like Bowe-Seldon and Benn-Barkley.|`|AA12139128	ive seen only a couple things from both on you tube but id say borat because i saw the movie and i was cracking up....but in this category you should be asking who would win in a fight, i say borat because hes from a poor country
vPpiHZSSaa	I'll update you. While Ted Dibiase got his head kicked in, Randy Orton Recruited Manu, Deuce, and Cody Rhodes. Things started to heat up with Legacy and Orton Said if Deuce and Manu do not win their matches, then they are out of "The Legacy"(But Cody won his match) Deuce and Manu Got Pissed off at Orton and wanted to mug Randy. So Deuce and Manu said they were bringing back ted dibiase. While Randy and Cody are left in the ring Ted, Manu, and Deuce were "Teaming up" and they surrounded cody and randy. Then Manu and Deuce strike Orton and Cody But Ted Dibiase Stabs Deuce and Manu in the back and now cody, randy, and ted dibiase started to mug manu and deuce. Deuce gets the "Cross-rhodes"(Cody's new finisher) and Manu gets the "million dollar dream" russian leg sweep thus making the legacy Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes, And Ted Dibiase. Manu gets released from the wwe but I think deuce is still in the wwe. In January, Orton goes on to win the Royal Rumble 2009 last eliminating HHH. HHH then wins the annual Smackdown Elimination chamber at no way out 2009 by pedigreeing the Undertaker and capturing his 13th wwe championship. So when Vince Mcmahon returns from His "accident" Back in the summer Vince makes a huge announcement about the wwe. Randy says he wants a re-match at cena's title, but vince does not give it to him. So Randy argues with Vince. As Vince is about to say "You're fired" Randy Orton slaps Vince in the face and Vince falls to his knees and Randy kicks his skull in. Vince is now "Sidelined" So Shane gets pissed off and Randy and Shane had a great mini-feud that culminated to no way out 2009. It has a no holds barred match that was bloody but Orton wins with the RKO. The next night, Shane And Orton have an Unsanctioned Brawl that lasted for about 10 minutes but Legacy helps Orton And Shane gets his skull kicked in too. Stephanie then comes to the ring and says "Stop it Randy!". But Randy gives her the RKO and Smackdown's Triple H comes to his wives aid but Randy Escapes in time. So HHH and Orton are going to fight at wrestlemania 25 for the wwe championship but It is very personal rather then competitive because HHH wants to destroy Orton after what he did to his family. HHH said in Quote: "Randy last time we wrestled I Broke your collar bone, At Wrestlemania I am going to break your neck!" So It will Be HHH vs Orton at Wrestlemania. By the way, Only cody and ted have the priceless theme, but Orton keeps the "Voices theme". They don't have their own titantron yet.|`|VENyKvgaaa	well manu got kicked out and released<br>  <br>  randy punted vice, than McMahon and rko'ed Stephine McMahon<br>  <br>  and currently randy is feuding with HHH<br>  <br>  p.s. whats it like in boot camp, how did you get there|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Orton won the Royal Rumble and is guaranteed at title shot. Triple H won the WWE title at No Way Out. Orton punted Mr.McMahon and Shane in the head. Then he RKO'd Stephanie causing Triple H to come out and help his wife. They revealed that they are married and have children. Triple H is pissed off and he wants a piece of Orton but Orton is hiding behind doctors, lawyers, and security and he is threatening to sue. Orton makes a deal with HHH to have a match at Wrestlemania but Triple H can't touch Orton until Wrestlemania unless he is physically provoked. On Smackdown this Friday, both Orton and Legacy beat up Triple H.<br>  No they use Orton theme song and titantron. Sometimes if Rhodes and DiBiasi are tag team partners, then they use their Priceless song.|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	nope<br>  <br>  they currently helping randy orton fight off hhh so he wont get his azz whooped<br>  <br>  randy orton punted vince, shane and RKO'D steph<br>  <br>  the writers finally telling fans that hhh and steph are married with children<br>  <br>  hhh vs rko at wm25<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Krithi; stop editing ur answer like it was already there.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	wwe. com <br>  <a href="http://www.lordsofpain.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lordsofpain.net/</a><br>  will help<br>  have fun on all the watches in the navy because i loved them

But dont just concentrate on your legs, build up on train your whole body.|`|u9HfvzL9aa	dude dont listen to the rest of these people...im pretty much built just like you.... im a martial artist and breakdancer so flexiblilty is one of my main focus....i assume your pretty strong ..more so then the average person because you dance and kickbox...i stretch every single day for the past 7 years and it takes along time to get splits trust me...it just varies ...front and back splits come faster then side splits.....dont expect to get them within the year...|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	It gets harder the older you are in most cases...most 2 year-olds can do the splits!<br>  <br>  I would say about 2 months, if you are sensible and consistent.<br>  <br>  But for improving flexibility, I would work on other areas too.|`|h1e6TvFpaa	all summer, unless you stretch every day for two hours in which case it will take like 1 month. it takes a long time!|`|psDSVWpKaa	a month if you try hard enough you may get it down in 2 weeks|`|lANbovGvaa	a month if you do it everyday|`|VABATohgaa	not too sure, but i did gymnastics for eight years! and i went gym once a week for 2 hours and practiced at home and could only JUST do the splits before i quit! it took a long time and alot of pain from my teachers pushing on my legs making them go lower and lower so i would say a long time but i dont know for you it could be a very short amount of time like in a phew months but maybe it could be a phew years like me! its differant for everyone! bt good luck tho you need to keep it up cause i cant do the splits very well anymore!|`|DI5jDFubaa	it depends how flexible you already are,<br>  it only took me a couple of weeks <br>  just keep practicing a couple of times a day go down untill it starts to hurt hold it there for a bit then just before u let it go push a little bit further, youll soon notice how far down you can get very quickly|`|Yo7CNsq8aa	it took me the whole summer kidoff .<br>  the best thing to do is get two pillows .<br>  put each foot on one and slide farthest apart you can .<br>  hold it for 2-3 minutes . do this once everyday .<br>  yuo will see results :) goodluck !<br>  & dont forget to stretch before .|`|bQFiZbDvaa	My dance teacher could never do the splits until she was 15 when her dance teacher just assumed she could do them, so her not trying to luck stupid just went into them and from then on she could do them. maybe you should just try going into them and you may suprise your self!|`|GQi9wRLZaa	If you want to see the result quickly, you got to have somebody to push you while you stretch.

He fights on, and he does not care where on the ladder fremantle are or how badly they may be going - but he stays true to his club (he even elected to stay within western australia in the hope of one day achieveing premiership glory with fremantle, unlike chris judd) and he is easily fremantles best player.<br>  <br>  He is the one player that steps up at all occassions and never gets envolved in off field bad behaviour. I feel sorry for him at times because out on the field he may seem to be the only one that is actually playing like they mean it - sometimes its as if he has to do the whole job himself because his team dont help him, and I really admire him for this. <br>  <br>  Regardless of the margin in a game, he will always play as if the margin is one or two points.

a1xU4KsOaa	The weapon is essentially a jib noodle.  Really soft board.  The Hero is like an all-mountain board that's freestyle/playfully oriented.  The MLF...not sure if this is rockered.  I don't think so though.  I actually heard that the Hero holds a pretty good edge.<br>  <br>  For another easily pressable board, look to see if you can find an Capita Horrorscope in any shops.  It's probably sold out, but it's a sick park deck.  The Signal Park Rocker is also a ridiculously pressable deck.<br>  <br>  My vote is either the WWW rocker or Hero.  I'd go with the WWW if you don't have EST bindings though because the Hero can't be fully used to its potential without them.|`|6XbQXRbRaa	UHm depends<br>  <br>  Are you loooking just for park and rails? cus then go for the K2 rocker<br>  <br>  if you want freestyle and park- go for DC<br>  <br>  and i dont know much about the hero but i know its not a good gripper.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :}|`|el007rWxaa	all boards are good but the dc mlf is more of an all mountain board. dc's park board would be the PBJ. anyway since you want more pop a reverse camber or rocker board may not be the best way to do because the rocker design does take some pop away. the only difference between a rocker board and a normal camber board is the way it rides, they will both jib the same. i just recently bought a k2 www non rocker and sadly it broke the 1st day i used it. i got it fixed twice since then and now its riding very well. even though my www broke id still recommend it simply because i see 500 kids at my mountain with it and they are all in perfect condition, just ad luck for me i guess. other boards to look into would be signal park series non rocker, and if you must have a rocker board try the stepchild jibstick|`|p3qMXuPGaa	Each one of those rides completely different and has its pro's and con's.<br>  <br>  Here's my review of the Hero: <a href="http://www.angrysnowboarder.com/2008/11/burton-hero-with-triad-est-my-view.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angrysnowboarder.com/2008/11/...</a><br>  <br>  Here's the WWW Rocker: <a href="http://www.angrysnowboarder.com/2008/11/k2-www-rocker-with-k2-sweaters-second.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angrysnowboarder.com/2008/11/...</a><br>  <br>  The thing with DC boards to realize is the construction is flawed big time. Look at where the tip and tail spacers meet the sidewalls and you'll notice all sorts of issues whether its too much space, overlapping, filled in with epoxy and what not.  DC boards are essentially older Rossingnol shapes with a lower end quality.|`|GXMTwCLTaa	hmm.. i don't want you to have no answers but i'm not familiar with these. the board shouldn't matter too much. If you ride park, Get a park board, Longer is for speed, smaller is easier tricks and move ability, i'm not sure why they make wide boards, Maybe for big feet? I say the one that you think has the best design if the specs of them are close to the same.

Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|ptrGNp3Qaa	Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels is a great match, the MITB will<br>  be very entertaining but the Triple H-Randy Orton match is all<br>  about making Trips look like a badass against a guy he's already<br>  wrestled on numerous other Pay-Per-Views and finally the triple<br>  threat match with Edge, Big Show and John Cena is probably the<br>  least interesting World Heavyweight title match in WrestleMania <br>  history.|`|PniPsDmGaa	I think this WrestleMania will be the best!

Hopefully the two other slots will contain two athletic guys that can really put on a good performance in this kind of match.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	I have no clue why they put him in the match and I think its a bad move. He'll stink up the match. Hes the total opposite of someone who should be in it. Kane is big, but at least he can do some highspots (like the top rope clothesline to the opponents outside). MITB is suited for smaller high flying competitors like Evan Bourne.|`|PniPsDmGaa	i dont know why, but i think a ladder will be broken! and your right, he needs to think the briefcase is a box of chocolates.<br>  <br>  <br>  They need people like these in the MITB<br>  <br>  The Brian Kenndrick<br>  <br>  R-Truth<br>  <br>  evan Bourne<br>  <br>  Rey Mysterio|`|LKKpu0l4aa	to balance it up probably.<br>  they've got to throw in some big slow guys to make the smaller fast guys look better when they win. it is quite obvious that mark henry wont win because im not too sure if the ladder would support his weight|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	I would prefer to see more talented, high flyers.<br>  <br>  But also some powerhouses to add more emphasis to the match.|`|aEB5p3pPaa	Kane is ok,but Henry is a different issue.can he manage to climb the ladder and reach the briefcase with his short and fat arms?!

Then it will be Jerry Lawler vs. Chris Jericho for tomorrow night's Raw show.  Jericho will win definitely.  With next week being march 16th or 3/16, expect Austin to return then avenging his friend Jim Ross and other Legends.  Also, next week's Raw  will be in San Antonio, Tx so there's another clue as to Austin's return.|`|wzG9zUd9aa	Well IMO they should reveal the Legend who will fight Jericho at Mania on Monday cause they need at least a 3 week built up. I think it will either be Stone Cold, Hulk Hogan or Rourke. The thing is Hulks has the ack surgery that was meant to be pursponed, Stone Cold doesn't want to wrestle again and Rourke has been told not to wrestle. And Ric Flair won't wrestle because he promised Shawn he wouldn't. So i'm gonna be suprised for the first time in a while from WWE. I actually don't know whats going to happen.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	I heard a rumor that it will be Jericho vs. a hollywood star at Wrestlemania, and it won't be Rourke.

a021df0ab6e534d274ebf06943f6d64faa	I would advise you to play catch with him A LOT.  At age five he is still learning to control his muscles, balance, body coordination, hand/eye coordination, etc.  Playing catch with him on a daily basis will do all of the above and increase his arm strength using a regular baseball.  There is plenty of time and opportunity to take extra measures for increasing arm strength when he is older and his body is ready for it.  I am a ball player and a child care giver  :)|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	you will damage his arm if you do that<br>  5 year olds should have fun playing no matter the ability<br>  t=and once he gets older work on leg strength for a better arm because you push off on your legs for speed|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Five years of age is way too young to start anything like that. Just let him go out there and have fun and don't be concerned about his arm strength.  At that age it is all about mechanics which he can learn from a good coach.|`|oblnqjenaa	Yea you can but do NOT use a really heavy one. Use one that is just slightly heavier than the one they normally use because you don't want to damage his arm. When you get it, play catch every day with him. Start really close to him and every day take one or two steps back.<br>  <br>  TeamUSA4Life|`|r9bq0jqLaa	definetly dont do that its only going to hurt his arm alot sooner.<br>  just play catch with him ALL THE TIME. His arm shouldnt hurt by just playing catch at his age but it will get his arm strength up.|`|qDBeG26Saa	just play outside a lot and hope he improves<br>  wait 2 years befor weighted baseballs, they might hurt him

XuGFt3boaa	Crosby and Malkin are the best one-two punch in the NHL right now, but the all-time one-two punch is Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr.  The two have combined for 1721 games played, 1129 goals, 1673 assists, and 2802 points.  Not even Gretzky can beat those numbers.  Crosby and Malkin have combined for 500 games played, 232 goals, 427 assists, and 659 points.  One day, Sid and Geno will catch up to those prolific numbers, but right now, the greatest one-two punch in NHL history is Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr.|`|CNKBGVgQaa	Woo go pens! I am looking forward to seeing the two-headed monster take on Alex today, but better than Mario and Jagr? People are going to say crap, and how theres other better pairs, such as Vinny Lecavlier and Marty St. Louis, or Alex and Alex in Washington or the red wings, but they're wrong. The offense these two create is amazing. If you just watch them on the ice, you can see. Sure neither of them is Ovechkin, who goes on the ice and is like "Give me the puck, I am going to score." They are more about making the perfect play and finding each other and the other players on the team, and not trying to be the only star. They try to make their team better also. If Crosby is coming down the wing to an open-net, he usually wont shoot and will let the other person have a moment to shine. When people think of Pittsburgh, they think of Crosby and Malkin, but there's so much more than that; Letang, Gonchar, Fleury, Staal, and now Kunitz. <br>  <br>  I wasn't around to watch them live, but have watched taped Stanley Cups, and re-runs of their games. I think Mario and Jaromir were amazing in their time, and still the best one two punch ever, combining to win the 2 Stanley Cups, but the stars of today are only going to get better :]|`|UzhfaJH2aa	A lot of folks are overlooking the obvious. When anyone compares Mario to Gretzky the usual arguement is "look who Gretzky played with ..." Well ok, look who Gretzky played with, Jari Kurri.<br>  Gretzky/Kurri and 4 cups. I'll take them over any other duo, any time.<br>  <br>  Total together in Edmonton only:<br>  games - 600<br>  goals - 929<br>  assists - 1451<br>  points - 2380<br>  cups - 4 (in 8 seasons)<br>  <br>  Careers: since they played the majority of their games together, including LA and New York <br>  <br>  Points - 4,255|`|nVhP1Bteaa	Having watched Mario throughout his career, there's no way I'd go against him. However, I think Crosby,and Malkin will leave their mark before it's all said and done.|`|5f048cd93967c79a0ffc734f1e6da22baa	Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr will always be a better line than that of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, but I'm a Ottawa fan but I give credit when credit is due so I would have to vote for Brett Hull and Adam Oats.  They were like Ken and Barbie without the romance.|`|GyGhHpRraa	Mario & Jaromir.  Just Lemieux, alone, wins that.|`|Ul9rMdseaa	Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr (shame they retired) but Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are the best of their time|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Lemieux and Jagr..........And they have 2 Stanley Cups to prove it.|`|l5CKKXD3aa	Neither, I like the Euro Twins, Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Keep the thumbs downs coming.

0eCbujn3aa	My advice is to go to a gym of any kind (24hrs Fitness, Bally Total Fitness, etc.) and to get an individualized fitness plan. I go to a gym called Better Bodies that do this.. they have people who work there that specialize in creating workout routines for various sports. For example: I am trying out for a spot on varsity, and I needed to bulk up. I went to my gym and had workouts designed for me. I had a lot of excercizes focusing on developing my upper arms, legs, etc. I also did some moderate running and abdominal work,,<br>  <br>  I hoped that helped.|`|LfFdQwcdaa	Focus on your core because in tennis you use your core to move.|`|ubp8YKU5aa	you don't need to build muscles.

They're the players who will be the key to another championship or to win the whole thing. If you just scrutinize the previous championship team, there are always unsung heroes. Example of it is PJ Brown from the Boston Celtics last year, who give Pau Gasol a hard time in the paint, and made some big shots down the stretch. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, in order to be on the top, you need a support not only the source, but the clamp.
2s244jGgaa	What a shocker, he obvoiously had about 5 players around him which would have created pressure but he wanted to make the kick look better, and so he played on.

8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Start simple with a proven technique. Mornings and evenings, trouts come to the surface to eat insects. Get a simple rod and reel, a beginner's kit will do. Stuff a worm on a hook, fix a float one to two feet higher on the line and throw it as far as you can from shore (30-50 feet). When the float dips, swing the rod slightly and quickly upwards to hook the fish.<br>  It is true though that this technique will work fine in particular spots and fail in other spots. You have to try different spots until you find a good one.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Trout are among the most fun fish to catch, and are also mighty tasty!<br>  <br>  Just buy yourself an inexpensive small rod, some spinners or flies, and a bucket to sit on...<br>  <br>  Here are some links that will help:|`|KJWxqQHiaa	You need a ...<br>  <br>  Cheap light-action spincasting rod and reel, and fill it with quality 8 lb. test.<br>  <br>  Some plastic, or weighted floats (AKA bobbers.)<br>  <br>  Small non-removable split-shot sinkers, to hold the float up. <br>  <br>  Size 4 baitholder hooks.<br>  <br>  2 dozen of nightcrawlers, or a can of corn.<br>  <br>  That's all you need.

sPrBxmuqaa	I am answering this under my wife's log-in.  I ran 800 and 400 with great success in high school and in college.<br>  <br>  400 and 800 runners hate to hear this - but you need a good distance base.  At the end of the season, typically championship season, that's where you can work on sharpening and speed, but in the early season - you need strength.<br>  <br>  MOST importantly - you need to get some miles in on the weekends.  I call these garbage miles.  Get a nice base underneath you so that you can handle the strength workouts.  Doesn't matter whether you run 3 miles or 5 miles on the weekends, just do something every weekend day.<br>  <br>  Work on form every time you run.  Work on breathing, work on your arms and work on making your stride both efficient and easy.  Don't bunch up your arms and shoulders and don't flap your wrists in long runs.<br>  <br>  The 800 can be brutal, you'll need strength over the last 300 meters, so nothing beats distance as a base.  Inexperienced runners think of the 400 / 800 as a middle distance, which it is, BUT - you need strength to cover it in a race.|`|FEsbvKMKaa	i LOVEE the 800 :] just thought i'd put that out there. <br>  the 400 is HARD but okay<br>  300m . sorry i have no idea.<br>  <br>  I have a fairly rigorous training schedual. I run 6 days a week for about 20-25 miles. on two of those days i have workouts. i do things like 1000m at Tpace (click on the link below) and 200m at Rpace. or 200m at Rpace and an 800 at Rpace. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coacheseducation.com/endur/jack-daniels-nov-00.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.coacheseducation.com/endur/ja...</a><br>  ^^ thats a vdot chart. depending on your races you update it and train with those various paces :]<br>  <br>  good luckk !|`|ddfae77ad513804eb5a554f098841df5aa	Well i run both 880 and 440 in track as well but its my third year. For both you do need to put in some mileage if you don't your body will just quit and you wont get any faster it happened to me. But yesterday i had a race and it consisted of an 880 and a 440, for the 880 the main thing is to know when to speed up. The parts in which i do is the first turn and half the straight away and the finishing straight away. But it might be different you based on how fast you can sprint at the end. and the 440 i am having issues with so i cant really help you there but a rule of thumb is stay right behind someone in the lead and he/she will help you get places and energy, I got first in my 880 race and that's what i do. :) good luck though your races are among most  brutal all! :)
1wLVszLDaa	either you boots or bindings are way too big/way too small, or you are tightening ur top binding strap too much ( u dont want to go as tight as possible. if your foot starts to hurt just loosen the top strap one click and continue if necessary ( i had this problem for a while)|`|p3qMXuPGaa	It sounds more than anything that you're in a boot thats too big and you're using muscles you normally don't.  What you're actually feeling is a lack of arch support in the meta tarsal arch.  Its slightly collapsing and thats stressing the tendons.  Or you might have planar faciatus but I doubt that.<br>  <br>  Make sure when you're in your boots that your big toe is just touching the end of the boot when you're standing straight up.  When you bend forward from the ankles and knees you want the big toe to come a hair off the end.  This will ensure a better fit.<br>  <br>  Stock insoles in 98% of all snowboard boots are garbage so take them out and throw them away.  You can start by going the cheap route with using something like a Super Feet insole.  They have these in different widths and arch heights so see which one matches up best with your foot shape.  The more expensive route is to go and get a full custom orthodic from a specialized ski/snowboard boot fitter.  I recommend this route as it will help make your feet happy.<br>  <br>  Stance has a very minimal play into foot pain.  The only way this could be affecting you is if you have the angles pushed way too far out or you're stance width itself is too wide and changing the alignment of your legs.|`|GXMTwCLTaa	This has happened to me, unfortunately i had to get new socks, this helped, i got new boots and it went away. But this might be different, i suggest you don't tighten you're boots down their that much and the toe binding not as much. Is it possible that you're socks are bunching up their causing pain? That's what happened to me. Undoing your binding or airing out you're boot might help but if it was you're first time, i say, go rent a boot a different one, if it works for you, find it somewhere else and buy it. Plus it takes time to get used to a new boot. Possibly get new insoles. try everything if you really care because that will affect you're riding a LOT.

A1ohtlWsaa	Harbhajan Singh has taken 300 wickets for India and Spain won the davis cup in 2008.
Z0aJFf4Qaa	General tactics? Defend, and push.<br>  <br>  First match you'll be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your team if you don't know already, so keep a keen eye on what's going on around you, and don't be afraid to make changes during the game if you feel someone is struggling.<br>  <br>  2-3-1 is a good formation to use, but you need a striker confident of holding onto the ball to allow the midfield to push up, and a midfielder who will pull back to defend. Quite a lot going on at any given time.
7uCfW237aa	I think bmx has a much bigger emphasis on strength, simplicity and low maintenance. some MTB parts are lighter but they are also overcomplicated and require constant maintenance and adjusting.<br>  Also remember that the cranks have a larger span and are designed to withstand more than double the stress in BMX.|`|9Y2Csr3iaa	EXACTLY, BMX bikes don't have any suspension. But YOU are correct also... I mean, the BMX fads definitely ARE getting lighter but weaker as well. Also, I think the majority of BMX riders need reliable, affordable parts. Most BMX guys don't have the kind of money MTBers do for their rides. That's actually y I just recently switched back to BMX from MTB lol. That's also why the titanium Eastern Grim Reaper never made it in the BMX world. WAAAY too expensive and probably isnt nearly as strong as a solid chromoly frame w/o the holes in the BB and seat tube and all<br>  <br>  for some reason, the first half of my response wasn't posted... wtf???<br>  <br>  Anyway, I said that Joby is exactly right. Plus, BMX bikes don't use any suspension setup. I mean, you don't see any guys ripping rigid MTBs through rugged DH courses or launching off of rock formations in the desert. The suspension absorbs a LOT of the stress form the cranks and BB and all so they are able to run lighter and weaker.

XhexwM1faa	Michigan will beat Iowa even if Cyrus Tate is playing. The Wolverines were uninspired in that road loss to the Hawkeyes, and it still took iowa overtime to beat us. Michigan will have much more fire in their belly on wednesday, and combine that with the fact the game is on a neutral court as opposed to a road game and you have a 10 point Wolverines victory. I also think Michigan will have a good shot against Wisky, but will they beat them? probably not. Wisky's huge size advantage allowed them to sweep us this season, and plus Michigan won't be as motivated to win having locked up a spot in the big dance with a win over Iowa. I think the Wolverines will beat the Hawkeyes and then lose to the badgers. Either Purdue or Michigan State will win the Big Ten tournament<br>  <br>  Go Blue!|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Michigan will probably win,unless Iowa plays like they did against Penn State, and you guys might be able to beat Wisconsin.|`|O0zfwHnwaa	We might play Indiana depending on how games go down today, but I think we're in regardless and that we win the whole thing riding a hot hand from LLP.|`|dwU9lkajaa	Michigan will most likely win, and then continue on to beat Wisconsin.

I mean not all ppl that train Muay Thai do, but once in a while low knee kick does break bones if they land it wrong. (not fun watching those...)<br>  <br>  They do have special exercises for strengthing the bones, but you are better off doing with a person that knows what they are doing.  The reason is is that you can get health problems later in your life if you do them wrong. (if you really want to, go roll a stick up and down your shin and go kick banana trees)<br>  <br>  PS if you are asking how to make elbows and knees stronger there is almost no need.  Elbows and knees are very strong part of your joints and can naturally stand a lot of force.  The down side is that they don't give you much range to work with and their range also happens to be grappling range.|`|gBO908P6aa	Bone hardening is the process by which thai boxers (and many many other martial artists) condition themselves with to withstand and deliver crushing strikes.<br>  <br>  A theory known as wolff's law from the german anatomist, julius wolff, states that a bone under heavy load or stress will gradually grow and adapt to it.  Over time it becomes stronger, thicker and more resilient to stress.    <br>  <br>  Thai boxers literally develop bones as hard as steel from countless hours of hitting the heavy bag and thai pads.  Every hit creates microfractures in the trabeculae of bone tissue, leading to calcification and thus thicker denser bone tissue.  <br>  <br>  Even so, accidents can happen and bones can break.  Proper diet, conditioning and learning how and when to set up successful techniques will help to minimize such accidents.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	because over the years they condition their bones and they calcify and be come rock hard, shins, knees, elbows, knuckles|`|6p9I889Iaa	Hit the bag|`|sJrnFCrgaa	They do break their bones. every time you strike something with your bone you create microscopic cracks, over a period of time the cracks fill with calcium. bones are mended together by calcium. if you break your arm the spot where it broke will be almost imposable to break again cause calcium is much stronger then bone. <br>  <br>  the act of strengthening bones and body parts is called conditioning<br>  its a long and slow process without proper training you can cause permanent long term damage to yourself.|`|4glmxCa7aa	We do break some bones sometimes. If we're training then we stop and get treatment. If we're fighting we don't stop because that shows weakness towards your enemy.|`|h1e6TvFpaa	i take it and you have to hit thee object on just the right spot or else you will break yourself
HlD9dRF2aa	If someone told you that they could run for hours but couldn't swim 100M you'd probably point out that their balance and breathing in the water is wrong; that they use arms muscle instead of core, and their kick is from the knee instead of from the hip, etc. When you are running, good form is just as important.  Also your body is used to processing O2 with swimming muscles, not running muscles.<br>  <br>  Aspects of cadence, stride length, foot strike, posture, core, arm swing, hip movement, etc. are very important if you want to be injury free and go from a beginning runner to an experienced one.<br>  <br>  If you can swim, then you may be familiar with "Total Immersion" by Terry Laughlin.<br>  <br>  Become familiar with "Chi Running" by Danny Dryer.  Take it slow and increase time/distance by no more than 10% per week.|`|CmcB9P4xaa	Oh I am like the same way! I swim all the time, but Im not on the swim team or anything, but when it comes to running, its practicly impossible! I balme it on my legs- theyre really muscular, so thats good 4 swimming, but they're short, so they can't get me anywhere. i just deal with it. Another thing that's wierd is that I must have good lungs cuz I can hold my breath for really long, but when I run, Im breathless. I feel ur pain =[|`|M8uQ3LS7aa	Go to a sports doctor. I would say that's a little strange though. I was on the swim team for 6+ years and i was really good at it even went to state, and never got tired, but tell me to run or jog forget it im slow. swimming is also good for ache joints and muscles they say its the best thing to do and alot of doctors recommend it. try swimming as a sport, plus if your looking to loose weight that will do it alot faster ill tell you that.
c3b47df14624635ce55365f4d86e0963aa	I think Yusuf Pathan should come around 20th to 25th over when spinners are around.|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	The batting position should depend upon the position of the match.  If not more wickets have fallen after 30 overs or so, Yusuf Pathan can be promoted to get some quick runs.  However, if couple of wickets have fallen before 30 overs what is required is to steady the innings and not<br>  hard hitting.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Yes,he should be promoted and I would like to see him open the innings.He is currently wasted in 7th position.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Not always.<br>  Now and then he may be promoted up when situation demands.<br>  But he must be used more as a bowler.|`|ef56bd96b503e5dca6a012f5887d1215aa	I think he should be sent inat no. 4, because that's the time the spinners come on to bowl and he simple whacks them around the ground for biggies.<br>  <br>  Yusuf coming down the order isn't helping, as he isn't much good with fast bowlers, only spinners. He likes the ball coming slowly and fuller on to his pads.|`|5VeXOv5Aaa	no.<br>  yuvraj,sachin,gambhir,sehwag are playing greatly in their positions.|`|T22QClBxaa	Yes, he should be!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	Nope, he cant.All the ones above him are real talents!!|`|G0lO7djeaa	I think M.Dhoni know better what he should do,|`|MwjDCSLpaa	no. it is team work; there is a sound batting lineup... need hitters with power play.|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	yes|`|7T4dvrm3aa	no|`|iDmjwU26aa	Yusuf pathan is the batsman which can change match in 4-5 overs the best example of this was in srilanka when he turned the table from srilanka to india in an over yusuf pathan is a great hitter of ball he plays very well against spinners i think so we should promote him but not by seeing number that he should be come at no.3-4-5 but should be come when spinners are bowling then he should come to play if he hit runs in an spinners over,,, the new zaeland captain should call back their best fast bowler and second batsman who is on cris playing with him should defend in that over,the new zealand captain can not take risk for bowling 5-6 overs from fast bowlers because the batting power play is lest to come so he will bowl 2-3 overs from fast bowlers but after that he will call spinner again then yusuf pathan can play his own game by doing this the fast bowlers overs also will be wasted and spinner had to bowl till 40-41 over if yusuf play his own game we can see century made by him but if yusuf dismiss early so the runs that he can make in end he will not able to make it and when indian batsman which play on number 5-6 had the advantage and confidence that yusuf is left to bat will be end but if on top he will score good runs in speed we can again see the score more than 390.....................|`|AA11088802	no|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no
gUMucKOkaa	There is a list in the rules someplace but IMO more than a half dozen or so of each is overkill and not something that you really can manage. Using things like doubles, triples or innings or complete games can be mostly just pure luck.<br>  <br>  Good luck though.

92e74b5c9571c9dcdd15573e4a3ba0b4aa	Drop Hermida for Werth. Hermida has been talked about since like 2005 for his potential. By now you think we all would have learned. Werth was big last year and now has his spot in the OF all to himself from Day 1. He doesn't kill you in any stat and even steals bases. He should do much better than Hermida.<br>  And not going to lie, I would be afraid of an OF of Cruz, Milledge  and Wert depending on league size. They compliment each other well hitting all power, speed and average hitting categories.<br>  The Marlins are improving, as will Hermida, but he won't put up the same numbers as the other 3. I'd say Hermida's ceiling for this year is .260 and 22 HR's. Again, the ceiling. He'll be lucky to put up those mediocre numbers. Werth probably has the same ceiling for HR's, but playing in Philadelphia he will get more runs and RBI's, will steal about 20 bases, and should put up an average of about .275.<br>  <br>  Go with Werth|`|0kEc1aJgaa	well i would rather have werth anyday|`|AA11471458	Drop Cruz and Milledge.

If you mean the name that would have been on the decal, it isn't the brand of the frame.<br>  <br>  With the exception of a few high-zoot bike models and KHS bicycles, just about all bicycle brands source frames from a variety of builders. Some companies like Trek and Cannondale do make some of their own frames but most of them come from Asian suppliers.<br>  <br>  If you want to know WHO built the frame then it is possible to narrow that down but most frame manufacturers sell to many assembly companies who in turn paint and decal the frames to their customers spec.<br>  <br>  So, is it possible to determine the factory where the frame was built? Yes. Is it possible to figure out the bike brand name that was originally on the frame ? Not usually.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	yes have fun.|`|yMM1nNnfaa	you can just google the #... hope i helped
BNqbOfBsaa	Rampage Vs Evans is the most likely scenario. Jackson looked like his usual self. Not sure what your talking about! If he was twice as strong he would have knocked out Jardine in the first round!<br>  <br>    Rampage should be able to give Evans a good fight. I think he would beat him. <br>  <br>     I am one of the few that really like Lyoto Machida and I don't think it matters whether its Evans or Jackson. Lyoto will be champ|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	"After watching Rampage and Jardine go at it, I think Rampage proved he has got twice the strength"<br>  <br>  I have to disagree. You need to watch his previous fights. Kieth Jardine was going to win the decision, a judge told him, except for the last 10 secs when he got knocked down. Read the article.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	Well one CAN disagree. Evans lost to Ortiz. It was just a matter of ZUFFA, LLC. protecting its product that he was conveniently deducted a point by the referee in a three round fight; convenient in that he prompted the draw between the two. With that being said, Evans and Rampage fight at UFC? 98 in Las Vegas, NV [Mir/Lesnar II is postponed due to injury]. Tickets are already on sale.<br>  <br>  E|`|009wtvVeaa	i just read on yahoo that rampage might not take the fight but he said most likely he will. but if he doesnt i think it said that theyve already asked machida to take the fight and he said yes. so either way rampage or machida i think evans will lose. rampage and machida are both two of my favorite fighters and idont really like rashad but either way i think he will lose. i think rampage can take him but i would honesly think that machida would have a better chance of beating him only because he moves too much for rashad to get in a lucky shot. God bless|`|x9S6KBejaa	honestly, i don't know why lyota machida isn't in the picture for a title shot against evans...or at least a rampage/machida fight @ UFC 98 then the winner against Shuga Rashad Evans @ UFC 100.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	It's probably going to be Evans vs Machida.  Rampage wants time to recover, seeing as how he pretty much just fought two fights back to back.  And it's only fair that he gets his time.  But Dana White wants everything NOW, and he'd rather make fights that don't make sense than to let fighters sit on the shelf.  So he'll make Evans fight Machida, and Evans will lose, which will blow his chances of making a championship fight between two very popular fighters that people actually give a damn about.  And it will blow his chances of attracting a new fan base that could potentially bring in even more money.  The UFC should be patient and let both fighters come in at or near 100 percent.  But they aren't going to.|`|JhN3o7qXaa	Actually it might not even happen...yet. Since Mir is hurt they're gonna flip flop the Heavyweight & Light Heavyweight matches. So it might be Evans vs Machida.

53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	His promo reminded me a lot of his ABA days. It was a pretty long promo, and he made some interesting points. I do think it indicated a possible short heel or neutral turn leading up to his match with Shawn Michaels. This, I believe, would only be done to build a more storied rivalry between the two and so fans can form opinions around that match. For example right now, fans, casual and proper, are pretty much set on the fact that it's two legends battling at the grandest stage. Nothing has been done for the hype factor, so I think Undertaker's change in demeanor indicated his feelings towards the match. I'm guessing Shawn will be promoted as the guy who is looking to slay the dragon (the streak) and Undertaker might be hesitant to face him (even though he wont come out and say it). I could tell because of the way he said that he never "speaks of the streak". However, now that Mr. Wrestlemania comes along with a challenge, Undertaker will have to "face the music" (no pun intended, as in HBK's finisher)|`|KIOR56r6aa	Hell yeah!|`|7wVsKuQraa	yeah it really did<br>  <br>  and his promo could indicate a possible tweener role for him|`|UzHt495Saa	longest Undertaker promo (with deadman gimmick) for now.<br>  <br>  no one will turn Heel.|`|ou7gpgRpaa	Yes it did.<br>  It also kinda indicated a possible heel turn.......?|`|QB3LvbVaaa	It was pretty cool but I still prefer the deadman|`|db7e40dd5354decef471fb1fb7b3d134aa	Yeah, but it was great to hear him talk for a reasonable length of time.<br>  <br>  He didnt seem to be putting on as much of a accent to his "deadman" gimick either, speaking slightly more like he really speaks.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|V2EAMLelaa	Yeah he was talking like a normal person like in 2001-2003<br>  Kinda took me back, and it was pretty cool|`|RmNVL1RWaa	yeah. <br>   <br>  undertaker might turn heel before his wresltmania match w/ HBK|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Somewhat.

Second, if you are you already a pretty fair surfer, you might be able to make the most of it, otherwise, you are just out of luck. (and yes, I have the pictures of poor frozen guys trying to surf the Great Lakes on YouTube). However, if that is what you want to do, who am I to stand in your way. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.surfline.com/travel/surfmaps/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.surfline.com/travel/surfmaps/...</a><br>  <br>  Read the article from the above link and form your own opinion.<br>  <br>  And, as far a snowboarding goes, the terra firma in Ohio is a flat as Lake Erie. You'll have to drive the West Virginia or Pennsylvania to find any real mountains. <br>  <br>  But, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is in Cleveland (okay, it is that bad, but don't do anything to hurt yourself).|`|c8BjUxQjaa	i have seen surfers at presque state park in erie - if you watch wjet tv channel 24 weather does give forecasts how high the waves will be for the day<br>  <br>  at presque isle check with the ranger station for which beach allows surfing as it is designated to i believe only 2 beaches|`|MTfvcWgYaa	you could probably pick up on skimboarding at that lake if the water is pretty shallow at the shore.|`|9t16Y3pyaa	i live right on the lake and i have only ever seen them surf in the winter time.  <br>  <br>   =/ burr|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	your gona surf on lake erie?<br>  <br>  let me know how that goes.<br>  <br>  snowboarding...go to ellicottville.
gUMucKOkaa	And when he gets back around May 1, is he going to be ready to perform? I am not facing this problem, but I believe that I would let him go. <br>  <br>  Team 1 - Probably Teixera even though 2B is a more shallow position. Braun is excellent but OF is a deeper position.<br>  <br>  Team 2 - I think that Votto is going to be an excellent player. Santana is the consensus guy. Hopefully he won't get hurt.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GFvcoK2Uaa	i thought you meant your rod, rod. <br>  <br>  <br>  x)|`|YSBxf1pgaa	Man, that is tough but I would go with Votto. I think he's gonna pop this year. Santana and Haren is a wash, I think either here is great. To not cloud your judgement however I'd say Santana.|`|AA11471458	Team 1: Get Braun. Teixeira is older and actually hit less homers.<br>  Team 2: Get Votto. He may be young but he is promising.
8Nlcxf3Waa	Well I must say that you are very specific as to what club you are looking for.  I too this year had tried the Taylormade fairway woods (including the tour burner) I was hitting those 3 woods about 255 yards on avg.  I ended up with an Adams Insight XTD a3 3 wood at the end of the process though.  Why?  Because I was BLISTERING every shot about 270 yards.  I recommend trying them out and if you like it then it goes for $129 at Dick's Sporting Goods.  If you don't like it then you can still get a Taylormade wood for roughly $159 brand new.  If you are interested in hybrids you can get a low loft 3 wood replacement for about $129.  The rescue clubs are very nice.|`|pOlTrXQlaa	check eaby.  i got my burner 3 wood for $125 off ebay|`|jO1YCneoaa	Hello, if none of the other locations have it, I would recommend golfclubexchange.com.|`|nGliL9s4aa	<a href="http://www.golfpgashop.com/shop-by-brand/lyle-scott.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.golfpgashop.com/shop-by-brand...</a><br>  <br>  test = 20% discount code|`|rqnTGYouaa	you can just check this one<br>  wowogolf.com<br>  all items are under discount price now
9CdID9RNaa	You want foods that are high in protein to help build muscle, as well as carbs to burn while playing.<br>  <br>  I'd go for energy and protein bars. Protein bars are great for vegetarians (even non-athletic ones) because they're a common substitute for meat. If you want something more than a bar, go for vegetable and fruit salads. Most people don't get enough during the day, so finding any excuse to snack on them is great.<br>  <br>  Be sure not to eat right before a game though. You know the whole "wait half and hour after eating before going in the water." Well, it does hold true. Eating causes blood to go to your stomach to help with digestion, which means there's less blood to help your muscles work during a sport.

1LWJMQemaa	It doesn't matter. Dale Steyn is supposed to be the best pace bowler in the world. Australia have just lit him up these past two tests and dont look like stopping. They'll probably let a few younger players play the next game as they've lost this test. Australia will probably play Bollinger as well to give him a run.<br>  It doesn't matter what teams try against Australia, they are just too good!|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	S.A wil come back with a great win!!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	It's hard to say.

A7QROnjLaa	Keane is a really good player............ and Rafa is an idiot.<br>  <br>  Wow six thumbs down says I must be very wrong indeed!|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Keane is rubbish. I saw enough of him at Liverpool to say that with confidence. Jamie Carragher would have done a better job up front. Igor Biscan scored a few important goals during his time at Liverpool - that doesn't mean he was a good player. He was still rubbish.|`|TKDi70uTaa	robbie deserved more of a chance at liverpool and could have done a good job for them if he was treated with a bit of respect especially when torres is out. torres prefers to play as a lone striker but keane is very effective just behind a target man and is creative in link up play as well as instinctive finishing. rafa spat the dummy out because keane was bought by others at the club which shows him to be petulant and short on knowledge of british based players.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	He was good enough to play for pool but did not fit in. He was used in a power struggle between rafa and parry thats all it is. Some players are decent but do not fit in with a team.

He should never have left.<br>  <br>  As a Liverpool fan I never thought of him as rubbish.<br>  He never scored that many goals and goals count.<br>  But I actually felt sorry for him, especially cause he was a Liverpool fan since he was a boy.|`|tfotPdeZaa	Hee Hee Rafa is the rubbish one! Keano is world class, and he shall continue to net those goals. Cant wait until we play Liverpool and Keane scores one or two or three!

He's always been a good Striker. Nearly another player ruined by Rafa.|`|V7lGsaR8aa	He is still rubbish just he feels more at home now !|`|svU3xeotaa	lol keane is one of the best strikers in the world for sure, rafa is an idiot all he wants is spanish players i bet if keane was from spain he would play 90 minutes every game, but if keane joined chelsea arsenal or man united then he would def become better coz teams like dat give players chances<br>  <br>  ex:<br>  <br>  berbatov started out horrible at united and look at him now.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	rafa is a knob,he practically handed the premiership to the manc's and gave you a lifeline in the premiership by selling keane back to the spurs at a loss too|`|hhhMmDpQaa	Hes a top four striker but not a title winning striker Liverpool were looking to partner Torres.<br>  <br>  That said, I reckon Liverpool should have loaned him to Spurs rather then selling him after about 6 months.|`|Jqpq9MDAaa	LMAO @ ''Jaime carragher would have done a better job''....<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  my kinda language.. but when I post it... no one likes it.. ?|`|VLhUltSTaa	Keane didn't get too many starts at Liverpool.

rC6RD8Wcaa	If you have some speed then you can use that against the big offensive lineman....but dont worry about your size right now you will still be able to make plays without being the tallest person on the field....you will grow a lot by the time you reach highschool which is when you start making money (scholarships) for playing football....keep working hard on your technique and you can succeed|`|ABoo1doVaa	Can you make outside contain?

Your coach knows it will be hard for the Oline kids to match your speed and that they won't get as low as you already are, so listen to the man and exploit the opponents weaknesses with your strengths.

S0N3BRecaa	I think if he's come this far he deserves at least a shot. Brock Lesnar is in the same situation really. At least what kimbo was doing was real fighting. :P|`|gMjHph9Eaa	I guarantee you I'm the number one follower of Kimbo. So trust me...<br>  Kimbo's great. He came from the streets, worked his way up for money to eat. He was homeless, and sold drugs at one point. He did what he could to get by. JARED SHAW (elite xc's promoter) is the 1 who Hyped him up so high. Kimbo said after EVERY pro fight that he's "got a lot to learn still"     He NEVER bragged or talked trash. He was a great sport, and he had a slip, just like any MMA fighter. Trust me, I've been training and following MMA for a long time. <br>  Kimbo signed to strikeforce since Elite XC went bankrupt. The shutdown cuz Jared Idiot Shaw made ALL of his fame and fortune off of Kimbo. Strikeforce is not gonna promote kimbo like that. They refuse to put him as the Main Card fight of the night for a long time. He will draw a lot of fans. He's been called out by former boxing heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman... So hopefully we see him fight very soon. He didnt train well because he wasn't used to training. Bas Rutten is no longer his trainer, but I'm sure he can get any great trainer out there.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	I tend not to judge people and i think it's ridiculous to hate him because of what his stupid fans have made him into.<br>  <br>  My only problem is that I don't approve of his 'street' fights. They're really just mindless and barbaric and only serve to fuel the ego.|`|cFMFNVj8aa	I like Kimbo but he needs to adapt his style around the rules because he isn't use to them yet because putting  him in MMA is like putting a Judoka in a Boxing match.|`|x9S6KBejaa	i hate rick ross...thus, i hate the inevitable.|`|cvwsP2Wdaa	I don't care about him.

For others, the "right" solution is just to ignore him.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	I dislike him because of all the HYPE he gets.

SweUcu3Caa	Most commonly when the water from a freshly filled pool turns color after adding chlorine to it especially from a well it is from a high mineral content in the water chemically reacting with the chlorine. Try adding a mineral remover to the water. your local pool store should carry it. Seeing how you just filled it yesterday I doubt your dealing with algae. Stop adding chlorine to the pool as well until the ph, alkalinity, and stabilizer are all in balance even if the water is clear get these in balance first. You can use ph decrease to bring the ph down if its really high. The free chlorine is high because you have shocked the pool and there is nothing in the water yet for the chlorine to kill off this will come down over time as the chlorine does it's job. Also take the floater out for now until you try the mineral remover. It should take a good day of filtering once you add it before the problem goes away and the water turns clear again depending on the filter type. A D.E. filter can take minerals out of the water with out the extra chemical but adding mineral remover will speed up the process. Also be sure to clean your filter thoroughly when doneand keep you eye on the filters pressure gauge while you are filter the minerals out and clean as need. usually about 10psi above normal means time to clean. Keep some mineral remover on hand and each time you add water from the well to the pool add some more remover with it and don't shock the pool for a day or two after. I offer an informational blog and a place to post pool problems as well at www.swimtodaypoolservice.com if anything else comes up that you would like help with.|`|2VCYL0F3aa	balance the chems alkalinity first 100-150(for those to question these numbers this is a vinyl liner pool)then the ph 7.2-7.8 calcium hardness 250-600(if higher due to well water use a stain and scale inhibitor)chlorine stabilizer or cya 20-30 next the chlorine it is ok that it is high now but will need to be 2.0-3.0 when pool is ready to use give the filter time to do its job last test for phosphates if the yellow will not go away you may need to use a yellow out or an algaecide if there is a phosphate use phos-free

I have seen some "chicken legged" people run very fast. Maybe not run powerfully but fast. They this:<br>  <br>  Use proper technique. Running with good form, such as standing tall and keeping your head, feet and toes up, is one of the easiest fundamentals to change in order to sprint faster, and can help to eliminate muscle and joint injuries. <br>  <br>  Improve your starting stance. In order to determine which foot goes first in the starting block, stand upright with your feet together and have someone slightly push you from the back. Whichever foot moves first, this should be your rear or "quick" foot<br>  <br>  Perfect your first step. Having an explosive step out is key to learning to sprint faster. You can do this by practicing several starts and videotaping it for review. Use the tape to determine if your leg angle is correct, which should be about 45 degrees, or if your stride is too long, which makes you lose speed<br>  <br>  Bring your heels near or in contact with your behind. At this point, your thigh should be parallel to the ground and not pointed down. And be sure you are using a circular, not an elliptical, motion when your foot leaves the ground. <br>  <br>  Pull your toes and feet up towards your shin as soon as your feet leave the ground. This is dorsiflexion and helps you to sprint faster by causing the calf muscle to contract and propel the body forward. <br>  <br>  Strengthen your legs with various weight machines and exercises. Skipping for height or distance, doing squats or calf/toe raises with weights are good strength exercises for sprinting. <br>  <br>  Train with people who are faster than you. If you are training by yourself or with someone who is slower, you're going to be less likely to push yourself to sprint harder.<br>  <br>  Was in top 5 of state, 100m, a three years of high high school.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Won't happen.|`|ABoo1doVaa	it's easy. It's called running. If you run a 6.1, you just aren't running enough, or you don't know how.|`|L68Sd6obaa	Practice sprinting up a small grade, not a flat level. Then do it in sweats. When it comes time for the real thing, you should be a little faster.|`|8iCzrsGmaa	yea do alot of leg exercises and run alot|`|rV4uJVWmaa	train with one of those parachute things.|`|5uRCSk9saa	calf raises<br>  squats<br>  run the mile a lot<br>  work on 10 yd sprints then 20 then 30 finally 40
aEwd0f5Waa	It's okay.  Votto in the first round was a dumb pick.  Although he's good, you could have picked him later.  You're pitching is great but I'm not sure why you took pitchers in 5 of the first 6 rounds.|`|AjZyj7zfaa	no that's a good line you might be first or secound
qs9QHvy9aa	4.5mm and .177 cal are the same thing.<br>  <br>  Just about all BB's are this size, I recommend copperheads, but hey, that's just me.|`|9Djep77Vaa	It is most likely .177 cal bb's, but if it isn't, I don't know where you could go. Good luck!|`|s1zvwm9faa	NO, in fact most take .22 Caliber because of their age.|`|RxnI9mFFaa	no
8caee7090c48436f326e0f2dd5b622d6aa	yes i wonder if hull will join us lol...|`|52zgCmLYaa	well whether it be Everton or Arsenal/Hull, it will still be better matchups with teams that don't play anti-football, as those teams were knocked out already.|`|7LrD3PRJaa	Not really.<br>  It tends to make things rather boring !<br>  It's one competition in which it's nice to see the underdogs doing well.|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Not really... Shame there is not a bit of difference every year..... And i can see this is a stab at Liverpool but as much as you hate them, they are better than arsenal|`|LReOvHEdaa	Liverpool has only been better than half strength Arsenal side.<br>  For the last 15 seasons Arsenal has always been a better side.<br>  <br>  DrBad has a point 3 best teams suits perfect ;)|`|XU1KaWXwaa	very funny. at the end of the day it only matters who wins it.|`|kxMQXhuAaa	There's only 2 teams in the semis at the minute doc.Arsenal are only into the quarter finals.<br>  <br>  EDIT:What do you mean 'the 3 best teams in english football'?.How dare you!,lol.<br>  <br>  EDIT:You know i didn't mean it.......much,lol.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Well just to be on the safe side I wish it was Man. U. and 3 other no hopers from the 2nd division!<br>  <br>  ... and Liverpool and Chelsea would keep screwing up in the premiership .. that would be just hoopy as well!|`|wurimjbnaa	We will win it, don't worry dR bad, we will beat the remaining teams.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	surely you mean 4 great teams
27fd034847d3d27fde933f822451de7baa	yeah i love slalom because i can do it without thinking and i hope it carries me til i get much older. <br>  <br>  i started wake boarding 2 years ago and i don't care if i ever ski again.<br>  <br>  here's my problem. making these 2 sentences go together.<br>  <br>  i'm in my late 40's and want to try an invert this summer.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	Of course! There's tons of people. We are in a tournament ski club locally, and the majority of the skiers are at least 40. I think it's a sport that when you get really into it, you will do it until it's no longer physically possible. I know I will!|`|qubLyvcRaa	I don't water ski, but have you seen the advertisement on TV featuring an 80+ year old female water skier?  They actually show her in action!  She's amazing!
QHqrJcmPaa	YES YES YES YES! I broke my $400 dollar exo just bc of tht!|`|OQ0T1J02aa	omge yes! do not at any time use a the rubber balls with a composite bat the micro fibers inside can get frayed or ruined! i "broke" my brand new Halo bat only used it 4 times because i used it with the rubber balls in practice.. hard lesson to earn:( just get a practice bat and than one to use in a game|`|oblnqjenaa	I know they CAN ruin your bat but not always.

EgLdNAusaa	No, and they never will.  Players that are being paid millions of dollars are not going to jeopardize their career playing in an exhibition game against wannabes.
