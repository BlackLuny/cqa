5P6m4Gs4aa	Materials: <br>  Warm sunny day <br>  Tarp <br>  Large plastic garbage bag <br>  Undiluted Ammonia <br>  Windex (a glass cleaner) <br>  Paper towels <br>  Fine steel wool <br>  Razor blades <br>  <br>  Tips: The difficult thing about removing tint is that most film is constructed of two layers of tinted polyester. When you try to peel the film off the glass, the top layer will usually pull right off leaving the second layer behind. This second layer will not peel off, it will just flake and tear like a price tag. <br>  <br>  Step 1: To over come separation between layers you must soften the adhesive so that both layers peel at the same time. This is very important, if you peel the just the top layer, you may as well just use razor blades as there is no way to peel the second layer off without picking at it for a few hours. You MUST try to peel both layers at once. <br>  <br>  NOTE: You are more than likely to damage one or more of your defroster lines, when this happens, the cut line will not work anymore. Some cars have radio antennas mounted alongside the defrosters made of the same material. If you damage these, your radio antenna will not work! Be careful! Taking it to a tint shop to be done greatly increases the odds of saving the lines, but even a tint shop can not promise to save your lines, sometimes the film is just to far gone. <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 2: First, clear the window of any obstructions, like the brake light, speaker covers etc. <br>  <br>  Step 3: Next cut open the garbage bag so that it will be big enough to cover the entire window. Spray some water on the outside of the back window and the lay plastic bag over the glass. Cut away excess plastic so that it is now roughly the same shape as the glass. <br>  <br>  Step 4: Next, lay a tarp over rear deck and seat, spray ammonia liberally on the inside of the back window. (Ammonia is very strong, I suggest you hold your breath during this step) and cover ammonia soaked tint with the plastic bag so that it won't evaporate. <br>  <br>  Step 5: Park the car with rear window facing the sun for about an hour. The film should now be ready to peel. <br>  <br>  Step 6: When you are ready to start peeling, leave the plastic in place so the ammonia wont dry. Get the peeling started with a razor blade in a corner where there are no defroster lines. Try to peel film off in one piece. If the ammonia dries as you peel, the glue will get hard again, so spray a bit of ammonia on the area as you peel. <br>  <br>  Step 7: Once the film is peeled you will need to scrub the adhesive off with ammonia and fine 0000 steel wool. Mop up scrubbed areas with paper towels before they dry. Finish up with window cleaner and paper towels. <br>  <br>  Jack|`|4qT0TfMZaa	You can't.  You'll have to pay to replace the window - a rather expensive and stupid option - or live with it as is.|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	a hairdryer...when its off Simply remove any sticky residue with thinners.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	The defrost "should" be inside of the glass. If the tint was added, and not factory installed, ammonia sprayed on the tint will usually remove the glue. You start peeling the tint, and spray. Still a pain in the butt. The adhesive for after market tint is plain soapy water.|`|UNnCxxQaaa	i dont think you can.the defrost is usly wires stuck to the glass.but if you have the one with the wires inside the glass then yes|`|c8NNxwjtaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArywWyjV592l0.cPaDAaFknsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307071330AAUTfL3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> <br>  some one ******* answer this|`|Xj1VC3hhaa	Blow Dryer and patience.
AA12261615	the manual was good but  the automatics are hard to beat,the older ones has either a 350 turbo or  the 400 and both was good transmissions to own,both are really durable and tough,if i wanted one for an older car i would choose one with a good turbo 350 in it,they,ll last and can be built to with stand 400 horsepower real easy,good luck.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	If you want an older Camaro  defiantly go with the 4 speed manual.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	If you can get an old camaro you better just get what you can.  They had powerglides and turbo-hydromatics of several types all of which were better than the current FWD transmissions.  They are cheap to rebuild also.  But they have only three gears, no overdrive and no lockup torque convertors.  The manuals were find with 3 and 4 speed both available, the 4-speed being the recommended transmission of course.  All this applies to 60s models and somewhat to early 70s.

Normally you don't rent new cars, you might lease or buy with cash or with a loan. You can learn about financing and leasing, and find a loan/lease calculator, on the following website:<br>  <a href="http://www.firstcarguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstcarguide.com</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jQ1qLxEoaa	thats impossible to answer right now..it all depends on how your credit is going to be, and if you will have a cosigner. see interest rate on your loan will be a big part in what you pay monthly.   <br>  <br>  I just bought a 09 Corolla after all the waranty at taxes and other random fees it came to around 21000.  Unfortunetly i have a 16.5% interest rate and am financing 31,000... about 540 dollars a month.  <br>  I plan on refinancing the end of the year.<br>  <br>  Its going to be hard to get a good interest rate when your young, unless you have outstanding credit or you have a cosigner, so start building your credit as soon as you can.<br>  <br>  Also, who knows where the economy is gonna be 5 years from now|`|fr5ImqW9aa	best way to calculate average payment would be to go $20.00 per thousand..so on a $30K car your looking at about $600.00 then you can go down from there with money down, good interest rates and dealer incentives.|`|HP4eFPHjaa	Depends on how you finance it and if you have good credit or not maybe around like 200-500 a month

Z6ghljeGaa	IIRC if you're financing a car you're required to have full coverage on the car so if the car is totaled you're able to pay it off instead of leaving them with nothing more than a chunk of scrap metal if you can't make payments. It would have also been a good idea to have gap insurance to cover whats left of the payments if the value of the car dropped.  <br>  <br>  Who holds the title to the car you or the dealership?<br>  <br>  It shoulds like you should have gotten an insurance check to pay it off, and that you went with the buy back option on your car (since the insurance company gave you the value of you're car they scrap it, but allow you to buy it back for a very low price if it is still drivable or you want to attempt to restore it) in which cause you should have gotten the R title in you're name.|`|G5R8B0Wpaa	You owe the dealer money.  Since he has the title, he has the right to repo the car to get what is his,  and if the car value will no longer cover the balance,  you are responsible for the extra.   <br>  <br>  Avoid these hassles,  don't finance cars.  Very rarely do you end up not losing money as cars depreciate faster than most people can pay them off.|`|Ejc2WxcRaa	It looks like a non easy cracking nut,looking around here <a href="http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...</a> ,you may find something useful for you.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Of course it can be repossessed.

AA10299265	I know it sounds simple, but I think the correct answer is, "When it gets dirty". A lot depends on how well filtered your oil is, how hard you drive, what kind of shape your piston rings are in, the gasoline and additives you might be using (or what's included in the gasoline). Just because synthetics are tough and long lasting, does not mean that they can't get too dirty and cause problems as a result. For my truck, that's between 3,000 and 4,000 miles. When in doubt, pull out the dipstick and lay it on a paper towel. You'll see what I mean.|`|riFDDdscaa	Do not fall for that every 3000 mile, BS. 15 years ago, Consumer Report did a test using a fresh rebuilt fleet of New York city cabs. Even they did not need oil changes more than 6000 miles. Mobile One advertises 15000 mile interval. Amsoil has 25000 miles or 1 year. Longer if you add a special filter system and test it every year.  Amsoil's cheapest synthetic is designed for 7500 miles which is what many new car manufactures recommend under ideal conditions. I would stick with 6 or 7000 miles with that blend. Did you know that the only real synthetic oils are Mobil One and Amsoil? The others start out with petroleum base and chemically modify it. Does that sound like a real synthetic? Of course that is according to the "petroleum" manufactures group.|`|01eFxezvaa	Well this advice comes direct from a UK site which is a Major manufacture for many of the well known synthetic motor oils.

i38Ev1Zaaa	Price (Lowest to highest)<br>  VW Jetta Sportwagen<br>  Subaru Outback SPORT<br>  Audi A3<br>  <br>  Comfort is really a variable. It all depends on what trim you go with. the A3 is the smallest, so it'll have the least amount of room in it, while the Outback has more room, but less MPG and the Jetta is somewhere inbetween.<br>  <br>  <br>  Handling, the A3 wins. It's smaller, and pretty powerful, and it hugs the road. The Jetta comes to a close second, because it does have less power, but if you buy the TDI, the high MPG makes up for it. The outback has power, but isn't comparable to the other two in handling.<br>  <br>  Price:<br>  The A3 is the most expensive, and the most expensive to own in general.<br>  <br>  The Jetta is probably your best value, because of their poularity, your giong to get good resale value, the room of the outback, the luxury of the A3, and half of the maintenance costs of a luxury car. Not to mention if you buy the TDI model, your getting a tax rebate back, and upwards of 40 MPG. <br>  <br>  The Outback is somehwere inbetween; its a good value but since it isn't really that popular of a car, and isn't a luxury car the value doesn't stay as well as the others.<br>  <br>  It really varies on what your using it for though. For a family, the Outback or the Jetta will be the best, while if its just you for your joyrides, the A3 will be the best choice.<br>  <br>  Personally, i think your best off with the Jetta. Cheaper, keeps value, luxurious, and room for the family (or snowboards, and cargo room for moving). <br>  <br>  Test drive them all out, and see how you personally feel about all of them.|`|OLpWRv2uaa	Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagon TDI.

Jetta is an excellent car, comfortable, and gives a great mileage. On the other hand A3 is also great!<br>  OK... Go for the AUDI!!!!<br>  :))<br>  Enjoy them!<br>  The Audi and the Volkswagen are great cars, well manufactured, rezilient and comfortable. They're not too big, you can easily find a parking space for them. Hatchbacks are great when parking.

12FUwqKpaa	if its the rear pads it will need a wind back tool to get calipers to go back. so dont try pushing it back with things like c clamps (may cause damage). the type of wind back tool for your hyundai should be available for your parts stores tool section, as there not anything to special like new audi' which need diagnostics. the piston will need winding back until it just fits round the pads (not all the way back) if you go to far you will not be able to get a good handbrake.<br>  you should be able to get a suitable tool for around ￡15|`|zruhNGKbaa	If the caliper is too stiff to compress with a set of channel lock pliers then use a C clamp.  If you have to use a C clamp compress the piston all the way in and then back off the clamp 3/8 of an inch and stroke the brake pedal until the piston moves out to the clamp, compress the piston again, repeat several times until the piston moves smoothly. After installing the new pads on both sides press the pedal several times until the pedal is firm then check the fluid level in the brake master cylinder reservoir and if necessary top it off using New brake fluid of the correct specification ( DOT 3 or DOT 5 as specified in your owners manual ) from a sealed container -  fill to the marked Full line or the bottom shoulder of the fill opening.|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Some cars like Nissan use ratcheting caliper cups for the parking brake.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to compress the rear calipers, they may be the same type.<br>  <br>  Using a paint scraper, or really big flat screwdriver, turn the cup to the right, or is it left....? while pushing in.<br>  <br>  No guaranties.

You need to remove the filler cap on the brake fluid reservoir, make sure that if it close to full that you remove some of the fluid or it will over spill out of the top of the reservoir and ruin your paint. The you need to push the two sides of the pistons back in at the same time, this can some times be a little difficult as the pistons can pop out from one side of the other. The way I normally do it is to use a small "G" clamp to push them together.<br>  Ja.|`|MLxkvms6aa	Is it front or rear brakes you are doing?Front pistons,go into a caliper, doing one side at a time,get some one to slowly press the brake pedal,this will bring the piston out,then lever it back in. keep doing this until the piston is full back.Rear pistons may have to be screwed back into the caliper if they wont go back like the fronts?|`|AA11705978	Use a c-clamp to push the piston back in.|`|1a61d1f4b2e04686142a2290e726268faa	go to a mechanic|`|zOIgzIy4aa	after you loosened the bleeder and the piston still won,t go back then it,s froze up and you will have to buy a new caliper.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	it may req a piston wind back tool too push the piston back<br>  <a href="http://www.shop-com.co.uk/+-a-brake+piston+wind+back+tool-p31029647-g1-k24-st.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.shop-com.co.uk/+-a-brake+pist...</a><br>  does it have two little indentations on the piston face if so a wind back tool is best it can be wound in with a clamp and turning  with a pair of grips but it would probably damage the dirt boot
zhJOZhKEaa	I wouldn't... I know in your situation it is very tempting, but I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Experts recommend not only a 40 pound minimum, but a 4 yr minimum as well.  And those are what they suggest for 'minimum' safety... *that* is when I'd feel ok about a 'just this once' switch for grandma's time.  <br>  <br>  <br>  In my child's *regular* seat I go for more than the 'minimum' in safety.  A 5 point harness is *always* safer... even race car drivers still use a 5 point harness when they race!<br>  <br>  At your daughter's age and weight... it is just too much of a risk to me.  Here is video offered by grieving parents of a child very similar to your child discussing the whens and whys of boosters vs 5 point harnesses: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LFo8vVi04" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2LFo8vVi...</a>  <br>  <br>  However, this child *had* reached 40 pounds... from what I understand in Australia at that time there were no seats that would keep her in an actual 5 point harness.  The parents are working to see those seats made available and to encourage the use of a seat that *is* available that harnesses better than a booster in their country... and to encourage those of us with high harness weight seats available to use them!<br>  <br>  My children are nearing 40 pounds and we will be getting them a seat that harnesses to 65 pounds and *then* converts to a booster.

cWuumdy7aa	Air pollution comes from both natural and manmade sources. Though globally manmade pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.[8]<br>  <br>  Motor vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of air pollution.[9][10][11] China, United States, Russia, Mexico, and Japan are the world leaders in air pollution emissions. Principal stationary pollution sources include chemical plants, coal-fired power plants, oil refineries,[12] petrochemical plants, nuclear waste disposal activity, incinerators, large livestock farms (dairy cows, pigs, poultry, etc.), PVC factories, metals production factories, plastics factories, and other heavy industry. Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides[13]<br>  <br>  Some of the more common soil contaminants are chlorinated hydrocarbons (CFH), heavy metals (such as chromium, cadmium--found in rechargeable batteries, and lead--found in lead paint, aviation fuel and still in some countries, gasoline), MTBE, zinc, arsenic and benzene. In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called Fateful Harvest unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal landfills are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, commonly called dioxins for simplicity, such as TCDD.[14]<br>  <br>  Pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. For example, hurricanes often involve water contamination from sewage, and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats or automobiles. Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil rigs or refineries are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.<br>  <br>  In the case of noise pollution the dominant source class is the motor vehicle, producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide.|`|NJbLm7Pyaa	by air and water .|`|H6cAdg9eaa	the pollution through vehicles are noise and air pollution and through industries it is air pollution.<br>  the pollution through vehicles is in the the form of smoke and sound<br>  the pollution through industries is in the form of smoke<br>  fo detail syudy refer XI std E.V.S text book|`|oke9WHZUaa	by air

Since you work at a car dealer you already know the troubles in that industry going on close to a year now.  I know Hyundai's sales were actually up in January, but industry wide sales are down over 30% every month since last summer Hyundai's included.  Based on the depreciation of my Azera, I wouldn't buy a new Hyundai, better to wait 1-2 years and buy used for 1/2 price.  Maybe if the economy wasn't bad the depreciation wouldn't be so high, but nothing to compare it to.|`|hFkc9RB6aa	I would if i had the money.

If you need a vehicle for the short term before you move simply pick up anything cheap and disposable to tide you over.<br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to buy - Pay cash. <br>  <br>  The best possible car for you to buy is one that you can pay cash for. Period. It is less expensive to maintain and repair a used vehicle than it is to make payments and pay interest on a new one.  <br>  <br>  And by all means never ever Fleece (Lease) any vehicle for personal use – the actual costs are far higher than that of financing and at the end of the lease you will have nothing – except the likely hood of a massive over mileage charge and excessive wear and damage charges.  <br>  <br>  Even worse than a fleece are the “Buy Here – Pay Here” lots which will give you a nice low weekly payment on a car they are selling for usually twice the fair market value at an interest rate that would make any loan shark smile, on a note that will enslave you for the next 5 years at least on a car which is almost guaranteed to die in 2 years or less! <br>  <br>  It is far more cost effective to purchase and maintain a used vehicle and save the difference for a newer and nicer vehicle a couple of years down the road.  An older vehicle will also save you money in the form of lower insurance costs too! <br>  <br>  Avoid the clutches of the predatory lenders – Buy Cash, Pay Cash. Live Cash and build real wealth.
G5R8B0Wpaa	When checking the specs,  it is important to know the total weight of the boat as it will be towed,  and the tongue weight.   Having these will allow you to find the answer on the spec sheet of the pick up.      If you need,  you can weigh your boat at most truck stops,  grain elevators,  or scrap metal dealers.   Park only the boat on the scale,  not the tow vehicle.   Most boat dealers could give you a good approximation of your boat weight as well.

If it was flooding with salt water i would think about tearing it down, sand blasting it and then putting some primer on it to protect it at the minimum if its something your going to have for a while, and if the rust damage is really bad then any repairs will only be temporary.

The numbers for the license stay the same until it changes states. For instance, a boat registered on Florida will have "FL" numbers. "FL 3553" for instance, will always be it's number in Florida. That won't change with ownership, either. If I owned it, the FL-3553 would be the same when YOU own it.<br>  If the registration is in Tennessee, it will have "TN" numbers. <br>  That registration number is the "minimum 3" tall" numbers displayed on the first 1/3 of the boat by law.<br>  <br>  If you have a boat "name", that has nothing to do with registering it. It can be "Mary's Dread" one day and "Grounds 4 Divorce" the next day.<br>  The only way that I know around the boat registration thing is to decalre it as "homemade" but the Secretary of State may want to sse the boat and if it's stolen...RUN!|`|77063eaac80f48b4794472b9cd1aada0aa	If you are changing the name of a documented vessel, you will have to also change the documentation, last time I did this, there was a $75 fee.

cd2ff6d9798215d0536899c2ea1dd9d5aa	Slimcolo is on the money on how to replace it. Just don't get crazed if the oil slinger gets hung up on the generator drive gear in the gearcase. You'll swear that the generator ain't ever gonna come out and start beatin the **** out of it. It'll come out if you get the right angle on it. Before you go thru all that BS make sure your voltage regulator is good. The old style, which you would have if it hasn't been changed over, was the mechanical Delco or Delco style that worked off of internal points and electromagnets to charge the battery. Piece of crap because the internal points would hang up and the generator would fry. Some guys still use them because of the OEM look. If they're hung up and you put in a new generator guess what? Check and see if you've got the solid state regulator, if not get one. The old style has a cover with 2 screws and 3 external screws for the wire hookups. If you already have a solid state regulator, no cover no screws, and your generator had been workin good one of the armature brushes is probly not makin contact. Easy fix. If you have the mechanical skill to take it out you definately have the skills to take it apart. They still sell rebuild kits, with instructions, which are alot cheaper than a new generator. The old generators were pretty bulletproof with the solid state regulator. Also, you might have an original HD generator. Better to fix one of those than get a new one made in Hanginwang China.|`|31a01635b23c8c57234b2b1fdfb85735aa	I thought harley went to alternators about 1966 ?

Check out what curmudge said. good luck|`|XBUeYE41aa	At that year I think you have a 25 amp Delco generator with 2 long through bolts holding it to left side case casting. Remove the 2 wires from generator and remove mounting bolts, slide to right to clear gear and front frame down tube. Best bet is take it to industrial re-builder for commutator clean and cut, new brushes and bearings. If you have kick start only you may have a 20 amp generator with regulator mounted on the generator- but I think by 1972 regulators were mounted to front frame.  I had 6 volts on old Panheads, about 15 amp/12v  on magneto sportster .  Alternators were a couple years later?|`|ttbXQEJ8aa	First of all either get a manual or photo copy the pages about generators from one.<br>  Disconnect battery.<br>  Disconnect wires at generator.<br>  Remove two long generator bolts out of cam case (right side) <br>  Now pull generator out from left side of the bike (the oil slinger washer may hang up but will eventually clear, do not force)<br>  Remove bolt on end of armature.<br>  Remove slinger and gear (you may need a puller for gear but can usually be done with a screwdriver)<br>  Flatten slinger if bent.<br>  Reinstall slinger and gear on to new generator.<br>  Install a new generator to case gasket.<br>  Install new generator in opposite order not forgetting to polarize system.

Not all electrical parts can be repaired, such as overrunning clutch of the starter motor. Many of the new 'Green" parts/components have shorter life span due to the use of environmental friendly material, resulted in more frequent replacement or service - causing more effort, time and money. <br>  Used parts or new parts is better?<br>  :-)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	because used parts usually are factory parts and new parts usually are after market parts.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	There an up side and a down side to this.<br>  In many cases, such as engine blocks, a used part is "green" and better suited to refurbish and overhaul - it has been seasoned and done all of the stretching, expanding, contracting and stressing already.<br>  In the case of normal wear and tear items (starters, alternators, etc.) I would go with a rebuilt unit.<br>  In any case, rebuilt or used is certainly better for the environment because it is truly recycling.|`|74644bc7eb458f91e191386d24a97a33aa	Of course individual cost is the first benifit.

You drift your BMW stock as is...you will wear down your tires and suspension/sway bar bushings. You are concerned about the ease of braking traction as I see because of limited HP of your BMW. With lots of HP that makes it easy to break traction you will need a lot more skill to tame it. If I give you a 400 HP sports car, you will keep spinning out at first.<br>  <br>  Please do not follow advices of others on using public spaces for these exercices. When you start doing these things at first, you will be surprised how different it will seem from behind the wheel, it is not safe.<br>  <br>  You can take your car to BMW autocross events or to your local track for practicing.<br>  <br>  As for the car's setup: You will not be able to gain any usable amount of HP with your 4 cylinder without adding turbos or supercharging, not for drifting at least. The most you can do is to upgrade the chip, intake, add adjustable fuel pressure regulator, etc. This will give you maybe 10HP gain at best with this engine. The throttle will be more responsive, but as far as the power goes it will not add anything for drifting.<br>  <br>  Once you have a proper amount of skill, you can learn to do manuevers like the scandinavian flick to get the rear end sliding, then you will have to accurately feather the throttle to control the slide once you get the correct opposite lock on it. This takes time to master, but can be done with 4 cylinder cars like yours as long as you have rear wheel drive.

9ada98f9404e7f25534f557148752544aa	Hope you are mechanically inclined.  The CTS or Computerized touring system relies on the shocks, all electronically fitted for the system.  The front and rear are adjusted to make the vehicle more stable.  What you are saying about the brakes sounds like you have worn down to the metal plates of the brake pads.  Because the car has front and rear brake discs and has an anti skid system built into it, the system will keep trying to keep the car from going into an uncontrolled slide and that makes your pedal pulse.  So if you are mechanically inclined, put the car on jacks, take the wheels off and change out the brake pads and get the discs resurfaced.  If they are beyond limits you may have to buy replacements but they are not too expensive as far as the rest of your woes, I have purchased new front shocks on line for around $2,000, then for the rears got smart and went to a local parts yard and those ran $35.  Hope this answers your question, the cars are great but need to be taken care of, the brakes, by the way have a tab on then that make a squealing noise, a fairly reliable indication of that is the looks you get from other drivers when you stop because they might hear it and the Cadillac is well sound proofed.

xLZGbS9Yaa	Yes, Alternators come pre-installed! Your Battery is used to start the engine. Afterwards, it can actually be removed, since the Alternator is what supplies voltage to the ignition and electrical system. You do not need to be attaching any wires to the Alternator itself. Make any accessory attachments at the positive battery terminal. Better yet, in most circumstances, you can usually find an available slot in your fuse panel to insert a spade connector. Grounds should be made to a sheet metal screw or body bolt (chassis). Be sure that your circuit is fuse protected, with an inline fuse, if necessary.<br>  <br>  Bumper to Bumper is a good source!|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Automotive alternators<br>  Alternators are used in modern automobiles to charge the battery and to power a car's electric system when its engine is running. Alternators have the great advantage over direct-current generators of not using a commutator, which makes them simpler, lighter, less costly, and more rugged than a DC generator. The stronger construction of automotive alternators allows them to use a smaller pulley so as to turn faster than a DC generator, improving output when the engine is idling. The availability of low-cost solid-state diodes from about 1960 onward allowed car manufacturers to substitute alternators for DC generators. Automotive alternators use a set of rectifiers (diode bridge) to convert AC to DC. To provide direct current with low ripple, automotive alternators have a three-phase winding.<br>  <br>  Typical passenger vehicle and light truck alternators use Lundell or claw-pole field construction, where the field north and south poles are all energized by a single winding, with the poles looking rather like fingers of two hands interlocked <br>  <br>  Read more:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternator" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternator</a>|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Of course an alternator is already on a vehicle when you buy it,unless someone has taken it off.It is pre wired to recharge your battery and goes to the voltage regulator unless it has one internally.For a general view of automobile workings,try misterfixit.com|`|onbwN4csaa	A car comes with an alternator. alternators electric output is between 14 and 20 volts The electric current  passes through a voltage regulator that  regulator keeps the output volts at 12 volts.<br>  and have as much as 100 amps. you can attach other electric items to the system using the    -  and  +  terminals on the battery.

GokGEXfiaa	i just got an 02 porsche boxster S for 10k. that was a month or so ago, even better deals now. just make sure its the S version boxster.<br>  <br>  im extremely happy with it, and i think its a hell of a lot of car for the money. i would say it is also in a different league in terms of build quality to the bmw and audi.....and also in terms of FUN :)<br>  <br>  EDIT........<br>  <br>  when buying a car, dont look so much at the actual price (of course must be within budget), but try to determine when you will sell and what you will get for it. that way you can see what cars are really good deals long term. personally, i think you would have to do quite a bit to get a boxster S to drop more than a few grand of 10k....its already rock bottom.<br>  <br>  insurance is bad, i wont lie...but worth it for the fun :)<br>  <br>  petrol isnt bad if you drive it like a saint. but you wont, trust me. budget for about 25mpg and you should be quids in. but if you do drive like a saint, its surprising how far the tank lasts cause you never get above 2000revs!!!!!<br>  <br>  service/maintence.....yes some people have nightmares....but most dont.....remember, you dont hear the people who have trouble free cars banging on about them. they are too busy driving them ;)<br>  <br>  but 2k a year should be more than enough for all the brakes oil tyres etc that you will need plus a bit left over for a part or 2 that might break.<br>  <br>  generally, if you drive it like a nutter, you will pay for it. to me thats ok cause im getting enjoyment from it. so petrol bills are ok, and if i use a good bit more rubber, or break something in the engine (god forbid it be bad) etc, thats fine too :)<br>  <br>  its ALL worth it.<br>  <br>  ps, im not rich at all. im just stupid with money!!!!|`|HsNilMC9aa	If having a BMW , for the money you have you may as well treat yourself to a M3, whenever you buy a car always try to buy the best in the range . you will find good cars on Piston Heads or auto trader , its your money and your in the driving seat(lol) to bargain.|`|G5R8B0Wpaa	Buy the best car you can get with only half of your savings.

If you need replacements because yours are messed up, then look for another set of stock headers on eBay.<br>  <br>  If you're just looking for better power, and the engine is stock, simply replace the muffler with something different - leave the headpipes alone.

dPofu5SAaa	Buy a cheap bike first.  you don't have money to waste, neither did I.  That's why i bought a 1975 Suzuki for 300 bucks.  I loved that bike, but didn't care if i dropped it in the driveway(which i did).  Don't put too much thought into engine size for your first bike.  Mine was a 750 but definitely not overpowered for a new rider.  If it was a GSXR 750 it would have been.  But mine was heavy and slow(like the harley i was building up to!) but still fast enough to have fun on.  I suggest that route to anyone looking for a 1st bike.  Never pay more than 1000 bucks for a learner.  <br>  <br>  oh, and i sold that $300 bike for $700.  another bonus.

31Ttgqlbaa	Don't pay any attention to the other answers. It's illegal for a car to speed up while being passed. So, this ticket is not your fault. You did what any reasonable person would have done including myself. As long you still had dotted lines and a straight clear shot and no oncoming traffic to worry about, you did fine. I would fight the ticket. If you can get the reckless driving charge dismissed or reduced to a lower change that would be a plus. If your cousin that's a lawyer is willing to help you for free or very little, I would use him; it can't hurt having a lawyer on your side. But most people who fight a ticket in court don't have a lawyer. You can do this on your own by explaining to the judge what happen, that you were passing a car that was going under the speed limit and sped up while you was passing and put you in a bad position. You can question the cop by asking him if he saw another car you just passed. <br>  <br>  Don't volunteer to go to driving school before this is resolved. If the judge asks you guilty or not guilty, say you're not guilty and either another court date will be set to explain your side or the judge may ask to explain your side then. Tell the judge what happen. If you can get this dropped entirely, it won't affect your insurance, but as long you can get the reckless driving charge dropped and just pay the fine for speeding, that will be a plus. Good luck!|`|BUPiXrxVaa	Always fight a ticket and yes get a lawyer.|`|G5R8B0Wpaa	What happens to you depends solely on the judge,  if it makes it that far.   Best seek some local legal advice as those guys will best know what the judge will allow,  possibly getting a reduction or dismissal.  Perhaps a defensive driving course will satisfy the judge,  ask before paying a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  Even when passing, you have no right to exceed the speed limit.    Whether the other sped up or not doesn't matter,  you were responsible for your speed.  If you had to slow and fall back in line,  the other car that filled your spot would be at fault for following too closely.   No one should ever be following so closely that another vehicle couldn't fit in if need.   If there had been oncoming traffic,  you would have had to get over.|`|WO68RZdIaa	You didn't say if you were on a 2 lane road (yellow stripes) or a multi-lane road (white stripes). <br>  <br>  If you were on a 2 lane road, not only is what the other driver did unsafe, but it's also illegal. You made the attempt to slow down & fall back into line behind them, but couldn't. You also have to worry about getting hit head on now since you are in the wrong lane. Your only safe option may have been to speed up then & overtake the idiot that put your safety & his in danger. If this is the case, then you should contest the citation & if nothing else, at least try to get the reckless charge off of it- that's up to 6 points on your license. You can see if you can get representation at a reasonable rate or try going it alone in court. That's between you and your piggy bank on if you can go with representation. Still call an attorney & use your free consult to see how to proceed even if you can't afford one.<br>  <br>  If you were on a multi-lane road, then you had no oncoming traffic to contend with or worry about & you could have held the posted speed limit until you could safely merge back into the right lane. In this case, you had best just throw yourself on the mercy of the court & hope that the judge takes your spotless driving record into serious consideration.|`|XLXncQu9aa	First of all, its perfectly normal to be a little worried about something like this especially if it was your first ticket.  Generally what happens for a first timer like yourself is that you will have to pay a hefty fine and your insurance rates will increase.  Secondly, court isn't something that is mandatory unless ordered so by the officer that pulled you over.  Don't worry about an attorney.  This was a ticket that was 100% your fault.  When I say it was your fault I mean you were guilty, so you would not want to contest this.  Thirdly, if you do have a court date then you are required to go.  In court you will basically have your sentence read to you, which is likely your fine and if you are required to go back to traffic school.  But the bottom line is that the only thing you must do is pay the fine.  So even when you go to court if you are required to go, you must pay.  Don't worry about volunteering to go to driving school.  Chances are since this is your first offense you won't have to, unless ordered by the court.  My suggestion to you is to pay the fine.  Its most likely a hefty fine, but other than that you shouldn't have any issues, just don't make it a common occurrance.

JcZnB3bRaa	Definitely check your sway bar mounts. I would even suggest removing them and regreasing, Or replacing the bushings. It's a 10 minute job. <br>  <br>  Also, be sure your wheel lugs are torques down properly. One loose lug could cause the sound as the wheel can flex and return metal to metal making a popping noise. <br>  <br>  Could very well be a hub or a bad inner or outer tie rod as well. Jack the front of the car up and with the wheel still attached, try to wiggle it to see if there is any play.|`|jEdBLJsQaa	Yes, it could be a dry bushing. Look to see if the mounting brackets for the sway bars are intact. A broken, or cracked one could make that sound. I think this happens more frequently on the front than rear. You could try disconnecting on end of the sway bar and drive the car. If noise is still there, look for other possible loose or broken bolts in the suspension and brake systems. It could also be a broken/loose motor mount. Replacing the bushings is a fairly labor intensive  project, so hopefully it is something else. Good luck
aafTqjV1aa	Well, the battery is probably bad. I would remove the battery from the car, charge it for 4-5 hours, and then take it to an auto parts store and get it checked. <br>  A fully charged battery has some resistance to freezing. I do not recall the exact temps, but it's pretty low for a charged battery. A dead battery, on the other hand, will freeze just slightly under the temp for freezing regular water. So probably what has happened is the battery went dead, then it froze and buckled the plates inside, so now the battery is internally shorted and is no good any more. <br>  If you try and charge the battery up, and then take it in for a check, I'm pretty sure  you will  find it is a bad battery. You also could swap in a known good battery and see if it makes a difference. These are all things you can do that won't cost you any money. But if the battery is bad, you'll just need to get a new one. Don't forget to turn in the old one as a core. They are usually worth about $5 for the lead in them. <br>  Good Luck!

x7yKGaEDaa	Most older GM cars and trucks have this sticking and jumping problem with speedometers.What happens is the speedometer cable gets dry over time and causes this problem.You can unclip the cable from the back side of the speedometer head and remove the center cable.Once the cable has been removed from the housing you can clean the cable and install fresh lube from your local auto parts store.Once the cable has been lubed it will work fine for years.If you dont want to lube the cable you can get a new one through your local chevy dealership.Best of luck.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	In your year truck, your speed is cable driven. The cable clips onto back of speedo, runs down under truck tothe rear driver;s side of transmission and screws on. <br>  <br>  Just take cable off and replace with a new one for $20 or so at local auto parts store. <br>  <br>  You can put that auto meter in yours but will need a diff speedo cable, mods to the gauge panel, etc etc to make it work. <br>  <br>  It still will not be any more right or wrong than yours is now, due to the speedo just reads a gear signal. <br>  <br>  In the rear part of transmission where cable goes. heres 2 plastic gears that turns speedo cable. A drive gear and a driven gear. The tooth count on each gear, changes the amount the cable turns per mile, and thats what your speedo reads. <br>  <br>  So if your speedo is wrong now, its due to the rear axle ratio or tire height being changed for OEM specs, and the stock OEM speedo gears still in the transmission <br>  <br>  Now you can buy digital, programable speedo for $175 or so that needs an elec speed sensor for $50 or so, that you can re cal to be right with any trans speedo gear, axle ratio or tire height. <br>  <br>  That one will still need mods to gauge panel to make it fit though|`|fefea25d32d84e4e20a7a00602d67062aa	Why not just put a new spedo cable in.

7GyWMhcoaa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty. I would prefer Honda or Toyota... First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car. You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - autoinsurance.hotusa.org|`|3MTYGEbWaa	You should save up more money because any car that only costs $230 is probably going to cost you a lot more just to keep it running. And also don't forget about sales tax, insurance (big cost), gas, oil, tires, tag and registration fees, and annual inspection fees. It costs a lot of money to own and operate a car.|`|AA10788612	Sorry, but used cars, especially an suv, will cost you considerably more than $230. At your age I would suggest waiting a while longer.

Hang in there. It wasn't until I was 30 before I was able to start buying really cool cars. That was when my employment & pay started to catch up to my expectations.

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Fact is, they used to be. <br>  The old radiators had a huge dome on them to allow for expansion - then along came a separate tank which allowed the smaller (cheaper?) radiators to be 100% filled with coolant all of the time and the expansion took place into a separate container.|`|ndVtjPKYaa	NO they are not.

AA11435704	Leasing is an alternative form of financing. Both have fixed terms and payments. With a purchase you finance the whole price of the vehicle and pay that amount, plus interest, back to the finance source. With a lease you also finance the full price of the vehicle, and pay all the interest. You only repay part of the principle of the loan. A lease has an estimated value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term.  (Residual value) This is deducted from the principle and you only pay the difference in your monthly payments. <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  Assume a vehicle that costs $30,000 and a trade in worth $5000. Also assume you are financing, or leasing the vehicle for 5 years. A final assumption is that at the end of the 5-year period, the vehicle is worth $7500.<br>  <br>  With a purchase you would pay back $25,000 plus interest over the period of the loan. You would own the vehicle (worth $7500) You can keep it, or trade it in on a new vehicle<br>  <br>  With a lease you pay back $17,500 ($25,000- $7500 residual value), and the interest that is charged on the $25,000.<br>  <br>  Your payment is less, but at the end of the term you have nothing! <br>  <br>  With a lease there is a limit on the number of miles you can drive and a per mile charge after that. You are also responsible for any and all damage to the vehicle. At the end of the lease, when you turn the car in, you will have to pay for any and all damage and over miles charges! <br>  <br>  With both a lease, and a purchase, you are responsible for all maintenance. Some leases, but not many, may have a maintenance program, but that does cost extra, and will increase your monthly payment. <br>  <br>  It would be very rare to find bank that will lease a 5 year old car. Most leases are fro new vehicles. The 2004 model has already depreciated, and after 3 or more years it will have much less value. With a low final value (residual) the payments for leasing and buying will not be that much different. <br>  <br>  Any down payment required for a lease is determined by your credit history and income. You need to qualify for a payment amount, and down payment reduces the monthly payments.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	The process is essentially the same as for buying with a loan. Leasing and buying with a loan are both forms of financing. Leasing is not renting. Therefore, you must be 18 years old, have good credit, have sufficient income, and have no excessive debts.<br>  <br>  Most lease don't require a down payment, although most manufacturer-sponsored lease deals do. However, you are required to pay some things up front -- first month's payment, possibly a security fee (about equal to one month's payment), sales tax on down payment (if you make a down payment), and official tax, tag, registration fees.<br>  <br>  Having said the above, you can't lease a used car anymore. Leasing, these days, only applies to brand new cars. You could look at swapalease.com and leasetrader.com to find a lease takeover, but you still must qualify in the same way described above.
Em2TJrILaa	Unfortunately you cannot seem to get reasonable priced prom transport. I live in Wadebridge and had my prom in Newquay last year and I could not find any reasonable priced transport. However if you get more people to go then the price per person is cheaper and hurry!!!! dont leave looking for transport to late because limos are very limited in Cornwall. <br>  <br>  I got a quite from Liskeard limousines last year. I think it was ￡204 or something and base.d on 8 people travelling it was ￡38 each. I really cant remember the exact details. Try googling them and sending them a email or phoning them.

12QJ9QMRaa	without building a whole box, have you tried a BAss Tube?

PAceoX2oaa	It'll work up to a point. The AFC won't stop you from getting fuel cut, unfortunately, which is a likelihood if you have boost leaks or run your injector duty cycle too high. A Walbro 190lph pump is nice to have with any 16g-sized turbo. Larger injectors are highly recommended to keep IDC's down. Put this way: On a 14b (slightly smaller than a 16g) I was maxing out the stock 450's at 16psi on a slightly-built motor. Granted, every car is different, but the 14b is stock on the 1g cars, and here I was running out of injector with it. So you could easily do it with a 16g if you don't have a way to log IDC's, knock, timing, and air fuel ratio. <br>  <br>  Before you start touching the AFC, get yourself a wideband O2 and a datalogger. Then you'll have the tools needed to really tune the car for the safest amount of power you can get. BTW, the 16g likes to creep, so keep an eye on your aftermarket boost gauge. If it creeps, you'll need to port the turbine housing and O2 housing. Or go with an external gate and piss off your neighbors. :)|`|KzAl5QLwaa	Yes, the car will function fine.  It may not be able to safely run as much boost as you could with larger fuel injectors, but at stock boost levels you won't have a problem.  If you start to raise boost above stock, you will need additional tuning with the SAFC to:<br>  <br>  1) Avoid fuel cut<br>  2) Optimize the air/fuel ratio so that it's not too rich or too lean (around 11 or 12 to 1 is right depending on who you ask).<br>  <br>  You'll also at some point need, as you mentioned, a larger fuel pump when the stock pump is unable to maintain fuel pressure at the flow rates needed to maintian the correct air/fuel ratio.  This can be determined definitely by monitoring fuel pressure on a dyno.  Most people will not do this though, so the less systematic approach would be to either upgrade the fuel pump proactively or upgrade when setting your SAFC richer and richer does not actually give you any more fuel.
HFrsH9MRaa	The dipstick usually only shows the top part of your oil pan. Chances are that you had a least 2 quarts in the engine, anyway. If you had NO oil in it, the bearings would seize up and the motor would not turn over. You may have damaged the bearings from low oil pressure, though. If the oil pump cavitates (sucks air instead of oil) due to low oil volume, the bearings will not get lubricated and will overheat a little. If they heat up enough from friction or lack of the oil, they will burn or partially melt. Check your engine for signs of oil seals or valve cover leaks. Have this repaired. Top engine up with oil, for now. Have someone clean your idle air control valve with Gum-out. How many miles on this engine??? If you are lucky enough not to have hurt your engine bearings, change the oil to Mobil One synthetic, designed for Mazda engines. This way, if you run low on oil again, the engine should remain protected. THis way you don't have to cvhange the oil but once a year. NO MORE WORRIES!!!!|`|AA10331789	Well, there's usually some oil in the engine crankcase even when the oil dipstick barely shows any oil on it. So the oil that's remaining still may have kept major damage from occurring. You can now switch to synthetic oil which is more expensive, but will help protect your engine better in such cases and extend it's life in spite of your lapse in maintenance. <a href="http://www.mobiloil.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobiloil.com</a>  One way you'll know the condition of the engine is once you start driving it again. Record the number of miles you go starting from a full reading on the dipstick until you have to put one quart of oil in the engine to bring the dipstick back up to full. If that's at least 1,000 miles, be happy!|`|fsxFebCOaa	Your car was cold. Most cars rev high when they first start up. There cant have been no oil. You would have heard grinding and the shifting would have been rough and loud. The most damage you did is grind the gears in your transmission box down a little. If its too bad and your shifting gets worse, you did permanent damage and need a new transmission, which can cost over a grand, its not reversible, only repairable.<br>  <br>  Mechanics exaggerate anyway. Everything is always burnt up or busted, when all it needs is a good cleaning.|`|8290750de398a0cfad0df45a64d531c3aa	I suggest you have a licensed mechanic check out and quote you for repairs. It wouldn't hurt to take it to multiple places for a free quote.<br>  <br>  After that mechanic looked at it and said there was no oil, did you confirm that by checking the oil level yourself or did you take their word for it? Never take their word for anything.<br>  <br>  Just keep driving the car, until it breaks down. In the mean time, be saving up for another one.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	ok if the car descent have oil it means that you have some kind of oil leek other than that it all depends on how much wore you driving your car. the only thing you can do is just add oil and hop for the best. theirs all ways a good chance that your going to need to rebuilt the motor or get a new one.|`|dISHCaqhaa	You should not drive the car without oil. if you do like that the the engine will get damage , the rust will form inside the engine. and it will be let the engine to get damage early. <br>  So please use oil and change once in two months.|`|AA11653600	if damage has been done it is not reversible and i suspect if it was that low that you could hear knocking then the bearings will have taken a beating,running low on oil will shorten the life of the engine for sure.You must have done several thousand miles without checking it i dare say.No point in fretting,just keep an eye on the oil level and see how it goes.If it has knackered it you could always have a replacement engine fitted,can pick them up from breakers for about ￡500 for your car|`|L1AxI6XTaa	It depends how long you drove withoout oil...<br>  <br>  If you didnt drive without any for like some months, then you most likely have severe damage (LIKE YOUR ENGINE LOCKING AND SEIZING UP!!!).<br>  <br>  If youve only been doing it for a little while, then yes its reversable. <br>  <br>  The next time you hear that noise, just put some oil in it so that the gears may be lubricated enough to move smoothly. Then immediately get an Oil change...<br>  <br>  I suggest Firestone. I dont know anywhere you can beat $16.99...
MTF0Rz90aa	It not really a DIY job as the chemicals involved are very nasty.<br>  Have a look on the internet for any local plating companies, give them a call and ask them is they can do it for you.<br>  The vast majority of the cost of Chroming is in the surface prep, you need to get the wheel polished up to look almost like chrome before you can chrome them.

aafTqjV1aa	Well, your boyfriend sounds like he is mechanically inclined so it might be worth a try. He can try to melt it, but there are 2 types of plastics, thermoforms and thermosets. Thermoform plastics you can reheat and melt. In fact they make plastic welders that work with a thin stream of hot air rather than electriciy, but you wouldn't bother buying one of these, they are $300 or so. Thermoset plastics will mold once, and if you heat them a second time, they just char. They won't remelt after the initial molding. So he can try and melt the crack with a cheap soldering iron and see what it does, but I don't think it's going to work. What you CAN do is, at auto parts stores they sell little epoxy adhesives, usually in a block or a ribbon. You mash the 2 colors together like chewing gum, and when it is all a uniform color, you apply it to the problem area, and let it set up. Depending on how accessible the area is, you can maybe cut into the crack so you can open it up enough to pack some of this epoxy in there. You want to cut away some of the plastic. Don't just force the crack open, because what you will do is make the crack spread further, or worse, get a fracture and wind up holding a piece of the tank in your hand.  Cut gently into the crack until you have a thin opening. Then mix the epoxy and press it into place. Make sure you wait the required time before you try to use the car.  Top off your water, and  drive the car and see how things turned out. This is about the best I can think of for a cheap repair on a plastic radiator. I hate those things!. If if were brass, you could just heat it up, and put a little solder on it, and that would be it. I think this is probably made with a thermoset plastic, because it is subjected to high temperatures. So they wouldn't use a thermoform plastic there, so you will probably be out of luck with melting it and blending it. <br>  Good Luck!|`|GsSRY7quaa	you can try a radiator sealer from the auto parts store. but it only works on very small holes. most likely you will have to replace it.
d9ECb7N8aa	You need to have oil run to the turbo shaft bearings. If it isn't lubed, it won't last, just as you need oil for your engine.<br>  <br>  The pressurized oil line is attached to the center of the turbo (between the intake and exhaust portions), then the oil drains back to your oil pan (the reason for the tapped oil pan).|`|k10O80XYaa	you need oil fed to the turbo for cooling and lubing bearings. pressure and return|`|e8tJENFdaa	in most cases turbos use a constant oil feed as a bearing for the shaft as a metal to metal bearing would not last long high end performance do use roler bearings how ever but still need an oil feed. the temp gets well over 2000 degrees and the turbo in use will glow white hot. a constant feed is needed at presure if this is not met you start to get turbo chater then large emounts of smoke and play in the tubine and thats the end of the turbo <br>  <br>  as to youre needing now where to place the feed normaly there is a central inlet normaly a lot smaller than the out let. these are placed oposit each other. the out let normaly goes to the oil cooler near or in the inter cooler hope this helps
goJAW4VCaa	No, it's going to run like crap and just make things even worse.  Your injectors will still be working and dumping gasoline into the cylinder, which wont burn since there is no spark, you are just creating more problems by removing the plug.  Just deal with knock, you will need to have the engine pulled anyway to have it fixed or replaced.  Or just don't drive the car.|`|AA11914369	No.  Do *not* drive it with a knock.  Park it and when you're ready, tow it to your mechanic.<br>  <br>  And if you think it's making noise now, wait until you try taking out a spark plug and running the engine.  Don't.|`|1d49d4b833b1cb811e40ed14dba31c4aaa	If you've ever removed the head cylinder you'll realize that the spark plugs are positioned too high to knock against the pistons.  So removing your spark plug may not be the cause of the knocking inside your engine.<br>  <br>  However, the valves in your head cylinder can require periodic adjustment.  If the gap adjustment for your valves increase, it can permit the lobe on your camshaft to knock against your rocker valves causing the pinging sound.<br>  <br>  Your solution is to get your valves properly adjusted.  <br>  <br>  If you have a screwdriver, box wrench, feeler gauges, and a crankshaft holder tool, you can do this yourself for free.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

xLZGbS9Yaa	Are you sure it is actually overheating?<br>  I know that might sound stupid, but if you are going by the temp gauge alone, it is VERY possible that the coolant temperature sender is faulty (making it look like it is running too hot).<br>  Of course, I am assuming that your antifreeze mixture is at least a 50/50 ratio. Does it boil or bubble?<br>  Did you bother to flush the cooling system, before you started replacing everything?|`|AWXa01Zgaa	Yes, thermostats are notorious for being bad from the factory.|`|d9ECb7N8aa	It could be as simple as a bad t-stat. Just because it is new doesn't mean that it is good. I've pulled 2 right out of the box that have been bad...<br>  <br>  You could also have a blockage somewhere from crud build up. Or it could be an air bubble in the system. Open up the radiator and then start the car. As it reaches operating temp, the t-stat will/should open and you will see the water level drop slightly (this is the air bubble). Add more coolant; this also tells you that the t-stat is working correctly.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't have the t-stat upside-down.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It's difficult to believe, after the work you have done, that the problem is either the water pump, the radiator or the thermostat - although I would suspect the thermostat first if I had to guess.<br>  Does it have a radiator shroud?

RbsRpcIyaa	In order to obtain the title, you must pay the lender in full. So, even if you did find someone willing to purchase your car for $12K (very highly unlikely), you'd have to pay off the loan before you could request the title. <br>  <br>  Don't try to sell the car for less than what you owe. You will have to come up with the cash difference in order to satisfy the note. If the buyer tried to register the car in their name, they couldn't do it. Then, a whole world of trouble ensues upon you. <br>  <br>  Honestly? Keep paying on it, try to double-up as often as you can. There is no easy way to get rid of negative equity.

Which you could buy a 502 from GMPP for that kind of money.  Then a good set of heads at about $3500.  Another $4000 on ancillaries such as roller cam kit, rollet arms, good pan etc and you would approach 800hp on pump gas.  Then $4000 or so for a Vortech supercharger and you should have your 1000hp.

Now by the way I did this and used a magneto for the ignition and in a Z car was able to be doing 35mph and light up the tires.  So if you want to develop more HP then start adding accessories, but my suggestion would be to use a blower not a turbocharger.  A blower with a pop off gives you the power increase now, a turbocharger relies on the exhaust spooling up a compressor to supply the extra air.  You can find blowers in the parts yards and they are not very expensive.

d9ECb7N8aa	If your good with wiring, you could do it yourself.<br>  <br>  All you would need is a 4-pin relay (couple bucks from any auto parts store), an inline fuse, and some time.<br>  <br>  Find a keyed power source to connect the coil of the relay to. Then the other side of the coil to ground. Then connect your inline fuse to a constant power source (directly to the battery or to an aux battery lug in the fuse box under the hood). Then the other side of the fuse to one side of the contacts of the relay. Then the other side of the contacts you will connect to the wire that go to your low-beam headlights. Then your done... You will NOT be able to turn off your low-beam bulbs if wired this way.<br>  <br>  If you want all of your lights to come on, it would be better to wire the contacts of the relay inline with the power source to your headlight switch. The you would just leave your headlight switch turned 'on' all the time, and all lights would illuminate when you turned on the ignition. You would still have the ability to turn them off by simply changing the headlight switch to off.

It has an approximate gear oil grade of about SAE 80W and can be used when temperatures range from -40oF (-40oC) to 300oF (150oC). According to Pennzoil's product description it is "formulated with high quality paraffinic base stocks, a fluidity modifier, multifunctional performance additives, corrosion inhibitors, a foam suppressor and a shear stable viscosity index improver additive. It provides excellent oxidation stability, low temperature performance, excellent synchronizer performance and compatibility with yellow metals, such as bronze, brass and copper components found in manual transaxles and transmissions."

This is how GM designed the radio circuit; it's a feature, not a bug.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want your radio to work this way, then you'll need to connect the radio's red accessory power wire to a voltage source that turns off with the key.  I'd probably tap it into the thick brown wire in the key switch harness.

6eed191f92816934ee83412350490737aa	Yes, that could be the problem.  No, it is not as easy, sorry.<br>  <br>  You can remove the drive shaft and check for either play or difficulty moving.  Either of these could indicate a problem in the u-joint.  You might also check for play in the differential gears.  You would have to remove the drive shaft, grab the yoke, and then turn it back and forth.  It shouldn't move very much, a max of about .007in is normal.  I will check back to see if you update with any other questions.

PFOaiQhkaa	It would be very easy for you to arrange a tour of an air traffic control facility.  This would be the best way for you to get a feel for what the job is like.<br>  <br>  First off, there are three different options for air traffic controllers.  They are Tower, TRACON, and Center.  <br>  <br>  The Tower is what most people relate to when they think of air traffic control.  The controllers in the Tower are responsible for the movement of the airplanes on and immediately near the airport.<br>  <br>  The TRACON (Terminal RADAR Approach Control) is a RADAR environment where controllers separate aircraft in a specific geographic area around an airport.  This would include small TRACONS that have only one primary airport and other "Super TRACONS" that are responsible for many airports in larger geographic areas such as New York City or all of Northern or Southern California.<br>  <br>  The Center option is where all the high altitude traffic is separated including traffic that goes over the ocean.<br>  <br>  The hours and pay are all dependent on the exact facility you work at and the operating hours of that facility.  Most small Towers only operate from 7am to 9pm; therefore, the work shifts are within those times.  At 24hour facilities such as Towers at major airports and most TRACONS and all Centers, shift work is mandatory.  <br>  <br>  Day's off vary based on seniority.  A controller with less than 15yrs experience will not likely have weekends off.  Instead, they would have something like Tue/Wed or something else that didn't include a weekend day.  A work week would consist of five 8 hour shifts.  The first couple days of the week would be swing shifts that started at around 3pm.  The next couple shifts would be during the day and typically start at 6 or 7am.  The final shift would be a graveyard shift that started at 10pm on your fourth day ending at 6am on the fifth day of your week.  Two days off after that then its back to work at 3pm.  Of course, this doesn't include the mandatory overtime you might be scheduled or the phone call you get telling you to come in 2hrs early on a shift. Or the 2hrs your mandated to stay after.  During the shift you can expect to spend up to 2hrs banging away, pushing tin with your supervisor standing over your shoulder telling you to tighten up your final.  Of course if it's too tight, then your pulled off position, and de-certified kissing any end of year pay increase goodbye.<br>  <br>  The pay scale right now is a little different than it was a few years ago do to the FAA imposing a contract on the National Air Traffic Controller Association that lowered the pay scale.  An entry level controller now can expect to make only about 40k where as an experienced controller in a high level facility can expect to make 150k.  <br>  <br>  All in all it's good job with good pay and benifits.  It does take a specially skilled person who's cut out for the job though.  <br>  <br>  I could go on for days and days, but that's just a little insight into the job.  If you have any technical or specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them for you.|`|QsOBvOSvaa	Yo, im da air traffic controller. i work da long hours and shifts, and its a stressful job dog, ya feelin me?

YrrKLkpgaa	Yes it will, however, if the wiring for your kit is only good for 500w then you will have to buy a larger gauge of wire, both positive and negative. Also the fuses may be different amperes based on the wattage. Your best bet would be to buy a wiring kit that is made for 800 - 1000w systems because if the wiring is too small it could possibly heat up and melt or catch fire. If the fuses are too low they will blow every time. If you are feeling cheap, however, I'm sure as long as the fuses are within the required ampere range then you should be able to make it work.|`|v5fEfmO8aa	Yes. Shouldn't have any problems.

PRx6j6YQaa	new or used? go with the Civic|`|PHyVkmPyaa	all three are proper reliable car...<br>  <br>  Honda civic, has better quality, better driving, better look, better comfort, and better resale value, than Hyundai.<br>  <br>  Hyundai has good value when you buy it, but when comes to resale value it goes down by a lot, but they really have good deals for them.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	i'll go for the honda.  it may cost you more upfront, but when it comes to selling it after you're through, you'll also be able to sell it for more than the hyundai.  also consider cost of ownership.  the honda is the benchmark of reliability and known for fuel efficiency.  hyundai has come a long way and much improved in terms of reliability over the past few years but honda reliability is proven.  if you're a wrencher, hondas are also pretty easy to work on yourself for simple repairs. and parts are easy to come by too.|`|AA10788612	Without a doubt the Civic is the best choice. Even Consumer Reports says it's the most reliable compact car on the market. Even used they are still great cars. I would advise against the Hyundai brand.<br>  <br>  Edit note: The 3rd guy is right. Both Hyundai's will be cheaper. But reliability and good resale go hand in hand. I would also say that reliability is the resaon why the Civic will cost more. But what good is a cheap car if it won't start at 0300 while your in the hood. You need one that will start everytime when you need it too.|`|i38Ev1Zaaa	The Elantra and the Sonoata will give you more value, because of their low resale value while the honda will give you more reliability.<br>  <br>  Hyundai has upped its game quite a bit, so if it comes with a nice warranty, i say go with the elantra or the sonota- it'll cost you thousands less, and they're REALLY fun to drive.

Just not worth doing, mate.<br>  <br>  Right, a 'moped' is a classification of machine which has an engine of 50cc or less, and a maximum design speed of 50km/h (31mph). Your Derbi is classed as a moped.<br>  Altering or 'derestricting' your moped will take it out of this category & therefore, as I said, invalidate any insurance or licence conditions: If you had a licence to allow you to ride a bigger machine, I assume you'd do so rather than try & wring another 5mph out of your moped.<br>  <br>  Everyone's 'permitted' to 'drive' at more than 30mph, it's just that your moped isn't designed to do so.<br>  <br>  And seeing as you asked a question 5 months ago saying you were not yet 16, I assume you're still restricted to a moped licence......

daw140ceaa	Interestingly, I just installed a 4-channel Infinity amp together with a mono Alpine amp yesterday.  The head unit had two outputs in that car, though.<br>  <br>  I'd run a single set of RCA cables to the Infinity amplifier and use splitters to connect it to all four inputs.  The Infinity amp should also have a pair of RCA outputs, which you can connect to the Alpine mono amp.
mlgkbnToaa	The RD350 would prob have the edge in a straight line, it has 100cc more over the other 2 .

Cross the adjacent plug wires on the coil pack (I believe it's #1 and #5) and see if the misfire swaps cylinders - if it does, you simply have a bad plug wire.<br>  If it still misfires on #1, and only on #1, you need to do a compression check.|`|mzP5FmlMaa	Dave how are you fine I hope, I need for you to check the plenum and make sure it's not leaking to much air will give you a gas smell .Also make sure the fuel rail is secure and everything is ok .

The diapragm inside it is internally leaking into THAT particular cylinder. It is getting flooded with fuel, and causing a misfire.
