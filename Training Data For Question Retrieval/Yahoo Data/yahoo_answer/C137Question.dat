Could my baby have FAS (fetal alcohol syndrome) from the two times I drank?? I am so worried!!
20090205192225AADwcXD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Having name problems .... STILL?	I cannot for the life of me pick out a name for my son. Well, he's had one since 20 weeks and now i've decided to change it. I LOVE the name Brycen and I really want to choose that as his name, but my best friend hates it. I want to just go with it because I like it. His middle name will be Anthony and he will probably be called Bryce for short. Do you all think Brycen is a cute name? Do you like a different spelling better? Any suggestions are welcome also!! Thanks so much!

My best friend's Mom tries to act like my Mom (my real one is deceased) except she is never nice just yells at me, threatens me and tells on me all the time (she keeps track of everything) and gets me in trouble with my daddy.  She is very religious and is always telling my friend I am a bad influence which I think is very offensive and every few weeks or so she bans me from seeing her but then will invite me over and give me advice I don't want.  Whatever I am wearing she criticizes too even if my friend is wearing pretty much the same.  I stayed with them for a few months several years ago when my daddy was overseas and I had never been so miserable (her daddy is unpleasant to me too), she got me in a lots of trouble and then she convinced my daddy to become much stricter.  My daddy says she actually has affection for me but has a weird way of showing it but he is friends with them and listens to their bad advice.   She won't let my friend come to our house and we go to different schools so going over there is the only time I see her and she is strict about where we can go and what we are wearing...she'll order me to change or tell me to go home, that type of stuff.  She is one of the few people who intimidates me as well and I am afraid to talk back to her because she would smack me.  What can I do?      Thank you and good day
20090205192442AA0QBVG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why won't he fall asleep in his crib anymore?	Hi there,    My little guy is 8 weeks old and since he was 3 weeks he's been sleeping in his crib.   I try and get him in there before he falls asleep so he knows that we fall asleep in our bed, yada yada.   But for the last couple nights he's been super fussy and won't fall asleep in his crib or if we put him in his crib he starts screaming!   How can i get him to fall asleep in his crib again, and stay asleep??   I do let him cry for about 10 minutes to see if he'll calm himself down, but he just gets louder till someone gets him, but by then he's so overtired he screams anyway!   Plus, he won't keep a soother in his mouth.   Is he too old to swaddle him?
20090205192508AAkBs4x	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Once you sterilize bottles, how long are they good for?	I thought that once you did it, they were good until the next use (unless you touch them with dirty hands, drop them...whatever would really contaminate them). Someone made a comment earlier today that "the bottles are good longer" when they were talking about a certain sterilizer. Just a bit confused.....I mean, if you sterilize them, what would you do with them if you didn't use them right away.....put them all in the fridge? That's a little much to me!

20090205192623AA4zEAr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why is my 2 month old fussy ALL the time?	My 2 month old is fussy everyday, most of the day.  It's not that he's crying so I don't think it's colic.  They tried him on Zantac which hasn't made a difference.  I've tried Similac Advance, Soy, Enfamil Gentlease and am now going to start Enfamil Nutramigen to see if that helps any.  I don't know how much more I can deal with it.  I have to but it's SO hard!  Another thing is he has a rash all over his body which last week his ped told me he didn't know what it was.  he said he's too young to diagnose it as eczema.  So I made appt with a dermatologist for next week but in the meantime, has anyone else gone through this and what was the problem and how was it fixed?  I'm in desperate need to find out why he's so fussy.  It just doesn't seem normal to me.

I had read on different websites that if the line was blue and not any other color then she was pregnant but either way were still not sure and were wondering if she possibly was  or not.

I had a miscarriage several years ago when I was with my ex-fiance, and honest to god his reaction was "Whatever. It's not like I wanted a kid anyway. It was your fault." We're both in relationships now, and he texted me a month ago or so and told me he thought his girlfriend was pregnant. He ended the conversation on by saying "At least she won't kill our baby".      Why would anyone say that? What makes a man so cruel? Was it really my fault this happened?      How would you feel if someone said this to you? The reason I'm even thinking about it because my boyfriend and I have talked about kids in the future, and it just makes me think about what would have happened if I hadn't lost the baby.

My little girl was going for reg poo's when we was in hospital, she did her black poo and then filled her nappy nicely with a yellowy brownie poo when we got home but has not been for a poo in the last day and a half. I have given her water to help her go, moved her legs and rubbed her belly, she is being burped fine and bringing up her burps no problem but not going for a poo and sometimes can tell she is a little constipated, making faces and drawing up her legs. I have done everything i can think of to make her go including giving her a warm bath but she has still not been for a poo. Is this something i should be worried about?

20090205193433AAo1SBK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Sleeping and Feeding Schedule for a 5 month old?	My son just turned 5 months old today and I was wondering about his schedule. It doesn't seem as though we have made any progress in stretching out the time between feeds. I am exclusively breastfeeding and I feel like he wants to eat all the time. Could that mean that he should start solids? Here is my daily schedule:   5:30am - Wake for feed and right back to sleep.   7:30am - Wake and feed   8:00am - Play time   10:00am- Feed and put down for nap awake   11:45am - Wake up   12:45pm- Feed    1:00 pm - Play time   2:45pm - Feed and put down for nap awake   3:45pm - Wake up and feed   4:00pm - Play time   5:30pm - Walk around the neigborhood   6:00pm - Feed and possibly a short nap in the swing   6:30pm - Play time with dad   7:30pm - Bath to get relaxed   8:00pm - Feed and put in bed for the night awake      Suggestions are so welcomed. I started out when he was little trying to follow baby wise but I was unable to get him to sleep for more than 15 minutes with out feeding him first. My ped said that was ok as long as I was putting him in his crib awake so he could learn to fall asleep on his own.   Not every day is the same. The day before he didn't take his early afternoon nap, but slept for 1.5 hours at 5pm.

My son is 2 years and 7 months old and for the last 4-5 days he sleeps in his big boy bed, but there is a problem. Every time i put him down to sleep he happily says "by, goodnight" and i leave his room, but later i find him out laying on the flour asleep,so i put him right back to his bed, and then he wakes up around 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning and never goes back to sleep, turns the light on in his room, starts playing with his toys.i go in there try to tell him that it's too early, he should sleep some more but never works. Please tell me what to do, when is this gonna stop.He could jump out from his crib anyway, that's why i thought that it's a big boy bed time.Was i wrong? is it still early for him?
20090205124716AAN7TEA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I am going to see a child who has RAD this weekend. I have not seen this child in a year.?	Due to trying to tracker her down, parental rights taken away, just all the system junk... BUT now I am on the "list" to see her and have made the commitment to visit her once a week. (since her therapist said no one visits her) but my question is this, what are some games or activities or even advice on A) how to deal her when it is time for me to leave (I keep thinking it may be like all the other times and her screaming and latching on) and B) what are some activites I could do with her that aren't "too close" at first, because I think even though she will be happy to see me, there will be this underlying anger of how long its been.. if that makes sense..

When she was 4 months old i tried the CIO method something im not proud of and it worked for about a month then she started rolling over in her sleep , so at 6 months i let her start sleeping on her stomach and she get a lot better and the CIO method starting working again but lately she just wont go to sleep doesn't settle her self down and she would scream all night if i let her,So i have to stand in there for 30 minutes or more to get her to go to sleep,she is happy to play in  her cot until she settles down but only if im in there if i leave the room she starts screaming and since she wont put herself to sleep anymore she wakes up in the night screaming and i have to go in pat her back until she goes to back to sleep, the worst thing she does is when i leave the room instead of lying there and going to sleep she sits herself up and gets really hysterical until i come back.   I have tried dummies, music, cuddly blankets and rocking her to sleep but none of it works.

He is breastfed on demand throughout the day and has one bottle (expressed milk) before bed. Up until recently I have just added the supplements to his nightly bottle - he has now discovered that he doesn't like the taste of his vitamins (or possibly doesn't like the bottle) anymore and will refuse to drink anything that has the supplements in. I have tried watered down apple juice and milk. He is just starting solids and is only eating cereal now - but next week he will start veggies.

20090205174539AAVl8wi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What am I doing wrong?? Why is my 7 month old always whiney?	I am starting to go nuts. I stay home with my son every day and its been 7 months of him AND I being miserable. He was really colicky the first 4 months but it went away. Now it just seems he is whiney and irritable all day. I put ibuprofen (8 hour) in his bottle for his teething and give him many things to play with, chew on, keep occupied. I read to him every day and play patty cake, go on walks, put him in his bouncer, encourage him to walk...all the things a mother should do. I dont understand why he is miserable? I know I was completely stressed out my WHOLE pregnancy. My husband was deployed and I was living away from family. Could this be a reason? He is always kept clean with two baths a day (which he loves) and has never had diaper rash or anything of that sort. Also, he will not fall asleep without a fight. He cries and cries and cries. We try to just let him cry it out but its like an hour of screaming. Now he has like crib anxiety or something because when I put him in there to just change his outfit he screams bloody murder. I envy those mothers I see with happy babies. I feel like why is my baby so unhappy when I do my best to take such good care of him? I even try rocking him and singing to him and he just pulls away and fights me. Anyone else have/had a baby like this? Will it EVER get better? I have been waiting a very long time and refuse to put him in daycare until he is 'happy and content'. I dont want someone losing their cool with him. ANY advice??? One last note, Ive taken him to his doctor and asked and he said he's healthy so this just might be his personality.................

This time around I would LOVE to go into labor naturally without having to be induced or at least dilate to a few centimeters before i get induced, unlike my others not being dilated at all and being induced. i know baby comes when ready but i know there are steps u can take to help your cervix thin and dilate or make your water break. what can i do that REALLY works? Pls give details and stories..thanks =)

20090205200507AAS8rVO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	My body is going crazy.. whats going on?	This might be long...   I had a miscarrage about 3 1/2 months ago. My doctor put me on birth control for a little while.. she put me on YAZ since I am so sensitive to higher dose of hormones. During the 2nd week of my 3rd month I lost them (we were on a trip) and so I had to stop taking them. Well my husband and I had unprotected sex about 3 days later which I found out I ovulated the next day (I can always tell when I am ovulated). A week later I wiped (TMI sorry) and I had a glob of CM with pink/tan spot in it. When I wiped again it was gone. I did this during my last  pregnancy I had implantation bleeding a week after I ovulated.   Well I was suppose to start my pd a week ago and nothing so far. I have been getting alot more cm... its clear and sometimes white globs (I had that with all of my pregnancies). My breast has been very sore, nausea sometimes, hungry all of the time, moody, pee alot, and sometimes I have cramps here and there ( which I did that with all of my pregnancies). I have taken 2 tests so far and both were negatives. I took one the day after I missed my pd and one yesterday (6 days after). I have no clue whats going on... I am having preg symptoms and yet the test are negative.. could it be the birth control pills, the trip I took or am I preg but for some reason I can not get a pos... what do you think it might could be?      Thank you for your opinions!

Then i had sex with my bf on the 21st and the 25th of Jan. My cycles are usually between 21-24 days..so that would make me about 10 days late. i took an hpt last night and got a negative.

20090205194117AAdIBtZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Can some of the anti-adoption people explain this please?  Open to everyone?	First off I do not mean anti adoption as a derogatryterm, I simply mean to describe those who are against most adoption practices.    I do not support pre-birth matching, or agencies or anything like that but I do however support adoption where needed and I do support termination of parental rights in cases of abuse or neglect.A lot of the evidence I see stated on this board points out the trauma that exists when babies and biological mothers are separated, which something I used to assume was true.     Then I read about the ways in which adopted children show this trauma-feelings of emptiness, lower academic performance, lower immune systems, an inability to be calmed or comforted, etc etc.    This is where it all breaks down for me simply due to experience.  Both my experiences with being adopted and as a foster mother.  I never felt empty.  I was curious for sure.  I never felt loss or grief or trauma.  No,  it wasn't repressed, I just didn't experience those feelings-not that I'm for a second saying that nobody does.  Also as a foster parent, I've adopted and raised many children who were separated from their mothers, and many at birth.  Yet the vast majority of those children didn't want their biological mothers. Literally they would not go to them without a fuss.  Including those who had never known abuse or neglect at their hands.  They were instantly comforted by me when I picked them up, they had brilliant immune systems and were never sick.  Yet within a few hours of separation from me and time with their biological parents they would exhibit signs of stress.  I just haven't experienced ANY of the common explainations of trauma caused by adoption.  Yet we're constantly told by some people that this WILL happen to ALL adoptees.    My experiences were that many of my foster children bonded to me, especially those who I raised from birth.  Many returned home and then began having problems that had never before been evident.  And I'm not alone in this.  I have a huge network of foster, adoptive and foster/adopt parents that I have discussed this at length with.  Most of us have correlating stories and experiences, as do most of our children.  I guess what I'm asking is do people truly believe that their experiences will always be true for others?  Does all the 'research' in the world really mean more than actual real-life experiences?    Anyway, sorry this is so long but I would be very interested in everyone's opinions and discussions.

My little brother has autism and my mother eat, sleeps, breaths autism which is great but she has a huge tendency to annoy me with it and try and make everyone feel guilty about it. My mother on many occasions has told me she doesn't like me because I'm just like my older sister and every time I try to do something she always tries to throw my brother into the mix as well, if he can't do something I can't either, if you haven't bought him anything you can buy me anything either. She openly favors him and on another hand let's him do what he wants and he runs this house but I can't do the same things he can her excuses are always he's the only boy or he has autism. I love my brother to death and understand what's going on with him but I don't treat him any different or put him on a peddle stool higher then the rest of my three siblings. What do I do and how do I cope until I graduate High school? Don't say talk to her because we've been there done that (my eldest sister and I)
20090205191821AAykNpW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about my OB during first pregnancy check-up?	I recently found out via home pregnancy test and doctor's urinalysis/bloodwork that I am expecting.  I'm very excited about the news, but when I went in for my first check up, the doctor really made me feel a bit concerned.  First off, I had an internal ultrasound and the doctor seemed worried about the gestation age of 5 weeks, since we both thought I was further along.   The thing that concerned me though was the trouble they had with the equipment saying that "they had just gotten it"... so now I am worried about the possibility of a miscarriage.  Secondly, the doctor never prescribed me any prenatals.        Now I'm very worried--is there anything anyone can say to qualm the fears?      Thanks!
20090205194401AA7JIzB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Tips for getting 2 year old to sleep in his own bed?	My 2 year old soon to be 3 in May will not sleep by himself. I admit I have spoiled him by letting him sleep in my bed ALOT, but I feel that he is old enough to be in his own bed.      Obstacle #1: My 2 year old and 5 year old share a room(for now) and they have different bed times. If I try to put them to sleep together they just end up playing around and not sleeping.      Obstacle #2: I have tried letting him go to sleep in my bed and then once asleep I put him in his but 90 percent of the time he wakes in the middle of the night and crawls back into my bed.

20090205194727AAWwcqX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Motivation to lose weight after baby.... please help.?	This is technically a weight loss question but I thought this may be the place that I may find more people who have experience in situations such as mine.  Thanks.   My son is 9 months old and I cannot find the motivation to do what I know I need to do to lose the weight.  He's still up at least once most nights crying, he's had some health problems so letting him cry it out is not always an option.  Sometimes he needs the closeness of me.  My husband will rarely get up with him.  He is a baby that really needs to be entertained, and watched!  He's into everything.  My husband seems to make sure his need to relax is met but cannot seem to help me out by maybe taking over with baby now and then.  I've talked to him about this and he says "OK" but then I have to ask him all the time.  THEN he will just sit there with our son in his lap while he watches TV.  If baby is playing on the floor he won't even play with him.  So I feel like the time I take for myself is time when my son is not getting all of his needs met. Then at night or at naptime when I get baby to sleep I'm so tired that I just want to sit around and can't seem to stop the snacking habit.  And by snacking I mean eating entire meals!  I don't want to come across as whiny and I've almost given up on getting my husband to see that I need some time too.     Does anyone have any suggestions for me?  Even the small changes I try to incorporate like drinking all my water today or not eating after dinner never seems to work.  Because I find when I'm tired all the cares go out the window (until I finish eating that 5th meal of the day! - then I just feel like crap)      Thanks everyone:)

We chose a name for our son when I first found out I was pregnant with our first child (who turned out to be a girl, as did our second child), but now I want to change it.  The problem is, the name we chose for our son carries my father's name, my father in-law's name, and my husband's maternal grandfather's name.  My husband agrees on the name we want to give him now (we want to name him after our three closest friends who have helped keep our marriage together over some really rocky times).  Each of these men have been very influential to us in their own way over the years and I really want to honor them by giving our son their names.  The problem comes in that my husband's mother is dead set that our only son HAS to carry her father's name and my husband's father's name.  My dad doesn't mind one way or the other so it's not an issue for him.  Does anyone have any advice?

20090205205929AAMH0gM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I tell my friend nicely not to text me?	So in 6th grade there was this girl named Emily that was in my elective class. We became friends and then she had to transfer schools. We didn't keep in much contact. Around September/October she started calling me again. She got a cell phone she started texting me...   She texts me a bunch of crap. Like those stupid forwarded messages. It annoys me! I only have a certain amount of texts a month. When she does text me something worth my time, its something I can't read like 'h3ya w@tch@ d0!ng'. Its getting really annoying. She always wants me to text her when I'm supposed to be sleeping. Then one night I told her I was going to read my book and she started texting me can you read quietly? I can hear things through my phone. WTF?! And then she texts me at bad times. Once she texted me at school. I wasn't in class or anything. If we have our phones on at anytime at school if we're not on the curb we get them taken away and only a parent can pick them up. The day I got my first phone, my mom said that if I EVER got my phone taken away in school, she'd turn off the service and I wouldn't get it back. She's not even really my friend anymore. She REALLY annoys me now. If I don't text her or call her, she gets mad! And when I do, she wants me to make her laugh. How can I tell her to stop texting me nicely?

I don't feel like doing yoga and it's too cold outside to go walking or swimming. I've been doing a series of low-impact exercises which last about 10 minutes. Doing them will get my heart rate up slightly but I get to tired to do them for more than 10 minutes at a time. If I do the entire set of exercises 1 or 2 times a day is that good enough?      I should mention that I was pretty out of shape before I got pregnant. Also, the reason I didn't do much exercise up until this point is because I had morning sickness so horribly bad that doing most things would induce vomiting!      One other question: I feel like my lower abdomen/groin area is "weak." Any ideas on exercises that can help this? I have been doing leg lifts from a standing position and I have yet to see much of a difference.

20090205201519AAy7tnY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What is your husband like? What do you love about him?	I have to ask this because I am bored and also I like to brag on my husband because he's AWESOME!!! He is one of those men that women consider "one of a kind" to say the least.       We've been together for 4 years, known each other for almost 5. Anyway, we were neighbors at an apartment complex and I just had given birth to my first son-- I left his father when he was 2 months old, and my husband was my neighbor. We met and became best friends for 7 months and had strong feelings for each other and began dating when my son was 1. We moved in together shortly afterwards, and have the most amazing relationship! We got married 2 years later, and he assumed responsibility for my first son and has now adopted him....      Now we live in a nice house, our relationship is better than ever, and we're still best friends! He treats me like a queen everyday, and we just had our first baby together after 2 consecutive failed pregnancies. We had another boy 14 weeks ago! Anyway, he takes care of both kids, works full-time, and we love every minute we're together! It's great!! His sense of humor is awesome, and we spend our time together joking and laughing all the time...he goes OUT of his way to be a great father and husband! He never disrespects me.... I could not be any happier!!!      What do you love about your husband???

I have a two year old son, and when I was buying things for him I just bought everything that looked good and spent way too much money.      I'm now 25 weeks pregnant, with triplets. I want to really save on stuff this time, although we're not short for money at all, I really don't want to waste it again.   The triplets are going to be girls, and I can't re-use hardly anything because everything I bought was blue and for boys.      So does anyone know any tips on bargain hunting when buying for a newborn?

She has a real bad diaper rash that keeps getting worst. I change her diaper frequently and she has pooped around 6 times today. I took her a bath around 10:00pm again to make her feel more comfortable. I just changed her diaper again around 20 minutes ago, it was diarrhea. And the rash looks worst. I put rash creme and she started screaming, am guessing it burned, so I took her a bath again. I asked her what hurts she touches her rash spot and her right ear. She has had 3 ear infections already. But I am more concerned about the rash. She has ate things that she usually eats except some honey maid cookies that her grandma gave her. What can it be? Please help am desperate.

20090203070829AAyPq2S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	13DPO, negative HPT and no AF... I think the Vitex worked?	Well, I took another HPT this morning and a BFN! I usually only have a 10-day luteal phase, so I was kind of hopeful that it was my month. Alas... I think the Vitex I started taking this cycle is just doing its job and lengthened my luteal phase. I'm starting to feel more like AF is on her way today (cramping and such) and I'm afraid she'll show any minute, especially with negative HPT's today and yesterday. But, I guess I'm grateful that the Vitex helped me. I ovulated about four days earlier than usual (around CD11 instead of CD16) and apparently my luteal phase lengthened as well (from 10 to at least 12, depending on when AF shows). So ladies, any troubles with luteal phase or late ovulation, I'd definitely suggest Vitex. I saw changes in the first cycle taking Vitex. Good luck to everyone out there and tons of baby dust all around.

20090205201534AAHkD9n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Obama and abortion, what do you think?	Obama stated that he believes in women having the right to acquire an abortion and if his daughters were ever in the situation "he doesn't want his daughters to be PUNISHED by a baby."        Does anybody else feel that way? Really a baby is a punishment? How so? Isn't the baby being punished by ending up in the wrong womb? Furthermore, if his daughters did get pregnant do you think the Obama's would keep an abortion private or be proud to exercise their rights. AND...if an abortion were needed by the first family, do you think the abortion "doctor" would make a house call or would the mother be required to walk past the protesters at the abortion clinic like everyone else?

20090205204013AA9eInC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Possible Implantation?	I've posted a question here before but here's the background before I get to the question.      SO and I BD on the 28th. I ovulated on the 29th OR 30th. Either or, on the 30th, I had a huge glob of EWCM. Now, I know that we NORMALLY get that during ovulation but this was a LOT! The day after, I had pink & brown cervical mucus.      Ever since then, I have been having twinges on the left side (ovary).      Well, starting yesterday (which would put me at either 6 or 7 dpo), I have been having cramps. They feel exactly like AF but not quite as strong. I have not experienced spotting and my breasts are not sore but I have been ridiculously tired and even ate a weird food combination today (Pringles and French Toast sticks...umm yum?). I also have an abundance of spit in my mouth (I don't even know if that's a symptom or not). I can't tell if the metal taste in my mouth is a sign or if its due to my braces (I am in my late 20s, by the way)?      My period is not due until the 14th and I refuse to test before then, as I don't want to get my hopes up, only for it to amount to nothing.      But from your experience (pregnant women or women who have already given birth), does this sound like implantation to you? How many days should you feel implantation cramping?      I never cramp before the onset of my period. My cramps for my period always have started the day OF (or sometimes the day after it's started).      Any thoughts?

But Ive never had my PMS symptoms last for  3 weeks without having one.      Am I pregnant? or should I wait another week and see what happens?      (by the way if I were pregnant me and my fiance would be EXTREMELY happy and excited)

20090203070410AAvg8nU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im new to this... so can anyone offer some advice?	Im not actively trying to trying to conceive but Im not preventing pregnancy either.       Well this month I think I ovulated on the 25th Jan.. Ive noted down all the symtoms Ive had and when....      -27th= nausea   -28th/29th = was sick once on both days.   -29th= Brown discharge started   -30th/31st= nothing   1st=small bleed (dark red, almost brown colour) and brown discharge which had black stringy bits (only way I can describe it)   2nd=discharge becomes very thick and has bright pink blood with it (not very much of it)   today= light spoting, (brown)      All the bleeding as been very light and does not need any sort of tampon or sanitary towel because its that light. The only time I see the discharge/bleeding is when I wipe.      Does this sound like I may have conceived to you... or just an early period.      Thankyou for your help

Is that why it's sore, because the placenta and cord are right there?  It's not BAd sore...just a little sore to the touch.  I don't know why I didn't ask her while I was there.

20090203070738AAlebHn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	38 weeks pregnant, I'm in dire need of some advice on swelling and what to pack in my hospital bag?	Guess this is a two part question, first, my feet are so swollen I can't even stand it!  I went to the doctor yesterday since they were so bad.  Doctor said there is no problem, just a big baby in the way of circulation, no high blood pressure or anything.  I was put on "modified" bed rest and told to stay off my feet when I'm not at work.  My question is what can I do at work to help with the swelling or pain, I can't very well sit at my desk with my feet up in the air!        Just wondering if anyone had any advice from personal experience or otherwise to deal with this awful swelling!      Second question, short and sweet, what do I REALLY need in our overnight hospital bag? Right now the bag looks as pregnant as I do! Just wanted to know if anyone could tell me what you really need and what isn't really necessary. I'm a minimalist!

As it turns out, my house stays neat, and I don't see much difference (except for a few "alien" objects lurking here and there).   I'm just wondering if people would notice that a woman now lives in my home.   Do you think you'd notice the difference?      Btw, both of us happen to be parents of a toddler. So yeah, you may see her kid's stuff lying around in the playroom, but those stuff could have easily been my son's.

20090203072418AAIvKij	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Korean kids getting plastic surgeries - isn't it child abuse?	I read this article www.time.com/time/asia/covers/1101020805... before but couldn't quite believe it until I actually saw a few little korean kids all about 10 years of age who had received cosmetic surgeries to alter their eyes during my short trip to Seoul. When I saw the girls I had to confirm my Korean guide, and she said yes. She also added that the reason they get surgeries at such young age is mainly because they want to leave their "pretty" faces on their first graduation books... I was shocked and somehow outraged. What kind of sick culture would make such young kids to think "being pretty is the key for all success" and they need to get their little faces screwed up if they aren't pretty?? What the F*** their parents are thinking????? It's just sickening...

20090205203827AAGxPnX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	For women who couldn't conceive or had trouble trying, did you ever feel like there was a problem beforehand?	I'm 23 and have been having sex with my now husband for about 6 years.  In the beginning of our relationship, we had a lot of sex where he would just pull-out.  There were two times where he ejaculated inside of me accidentally (broken condoms when we decided to use 'em, go figure!), didn't follow up with Plan B or anything, and I didn't get pregnant.  I've been on the pill (with pretty regular, proper use of it) for several years, so I know why I've not gotten pregnant.  I just feel like with so many times of him just pulling out and then not really being very vigilant with my birth control the first few months after we were married, I should have accidentally gotten pregnant by now.  I just seems like so many people get pregnant when they didn't mean to; while on the pill, with pulling out, etc.  Maybe they are just fibbing though.  We're not trying, but will be within the next few years.  I just have this feeling that it's not going to be easy for us though.  Anyone else have that feeling?  What was the outcome?        Thanks in advance.  :)  I've even come as far as bracing myself for infertility and thinking I'd be fine as a "doggy mom" forever.      I started my period at age 11 and I'm relatively healthy.  I've had severe periods and pains (have had ultrasounds on my uterus/ovaries... said to be fine), but probably have some endometriosis (you can't diagnose or prove it unless you go in surgically; it doesn't show up on ultrasounds).  But, with the pill, it makes period pains almost non-existant.

I used to be on this same birth control for over a year, and I never had problems like this with it.      I'm worried that I might be pregnant, and it scares me. I wouldn't mind having a baby now, but I've been drinking alot of alcohol lately :( My bf thinks there's no chance I could be pregnant, which caused a fight between us this morning.      Please help!

20090205211557AAF5mT8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	36 weeks pregnant with constant stomach pains!?	I am having pains that are associated with having a bowel movement. I'm not constipated by any means but I get this knot-like twising feeling right above my belly button which signals to me that its time to go to the bathroom. However, most of the time I don't have the urge to go right away. In fact mostly I go within hours or even the next day! MIL says it could be a hernia that will go away after I have the baby. My doctor says there's no way he can check until after the baby is born. My question is could it be hernia (and what is it exactly)--also is it possible that I have a blockage somewhere. Please help I would really like to know!
20090205211719AAAlxuL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Favorite tv show or movie for toddler?	My 2yr old is really into Kung Fu Panda. First it was Curious George and now he loves his Panda. (his birthday was.a Curious George theme). I was just wondering if any of you mommies have a toddler who's really into a specific movie or show.    Before I get any rude comments he doesn't watch much tv. Just some pbs kids in the mornings and its not often. When he does watch tv its usually for an hour, 2 hours tops. And movies are a special treat. Through out the day we work on learning colors, numbers and so on. I was just wondering what other kids his age are into. Thanks.

20090205213048AAZI0ht	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Just found out im 11 weeks pregnant & got put to sleep for surgery... is baby unsafe?	i asked this question yesterday, but didn't get any good help.   i've always had very irregular periods, so missing months at a time was nothing strange to me.    last week i got 4 wisdom teeth pulled, and was put to sleep using general anethesia (inserted via IV).   a few days ago i found out i was pregnant when i went to a doctors appointment i had made. i found out i was 11 weeks and 1 day pregnant. so i was about 10 weeks when i was given the anethesia.    i'm so scared that something is going to happen to my baby. i had the ultrasound and week after surgery, and the baby was kicking and i saw the heart beating. the nurse told me that the baby had a normal little heartbeat.    but i still can't get it off my mind... im so scared. i don't know what to do. i can't stop thinking about if i hurt my baby, if theres any possible risks of miscarriage, or of birth defects.    has anyone gone through this? anyone have any advice? i have an OB/GYN appointment on the 25th, but i'm callling tomorrow to see if i can get in ANY sooner. i'm driving myself crazy, i'm so nervous, and scared. ANY advice would be appreciated. thank you.

20090205213455AA9H0h7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My husband and I are new parents...is this normal?	Our baby is now a month old and I stay at home while my husband works.  Sometimes I get frustrated because I want to get things done around the house, or just get anything done for that matter.  But the baby wants to be held pretty much most of the time.  By the end of the day when my husband gets home I'm tired and want a break and somtimes I complain about having to spend 24 hours a day taking care of her.  But he acts like I'm crazy and I should just love every second of it.  Like I'm a horrible person and I don't love our daughter, just because I think it's hard, tiring, and trying.  Is he right?  Or how can I help him understand what I'm going through here, while he's working hard to earn money at work?
