4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	[1] It happens everyday in the local newspaper, worldwide newspaper, and on the news stations, channels, and radio. It's called freedom of speech, they can give any opinion they want on the subject.<br>  <br>  [2] Similar thing happened to me. Although, they do not list names int he paper, re-read the article, I'm almost positive they did not put the passengers name nor your brothers. Therefore, nobody knows who they are talking about, besides the person they're talking about. The news just wants citizens to "know" what happened in the community, it doesn't matter to the citizens, "who" it happened to.<br>  <br>  [3] Do you really think anyone is going to care or defend you, your brother, or families word? He was selling Marijuana, in today's society, a "drug" in which the government has done a well-job of brainwashing enough people to think this "drug" is the devils grass. Thus, people are going to fight back towards your brother if anything, rather then defend him or go against the papers word.<br>  <br>  Come on now, your smarter then this...|`|350f9ffc73066e35023422c1d71183fcaa	<a href="http://www.benefitsofmarijuana.com/benefits.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.benefitsofmarijuana.com/benef...</a>
046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	The fact that this story has popped up just shows how many ignorant, stupid adults there are out there. They are the ones who should be banned from having kids because they will be the ones passing on their thick viewpoint onto their innocent children, who probably didn't even give this presenter's disability a passing thought. Children are rarely bothered by disability, only curious, and it is adults who are the ones who tend to have the problem.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	Yes but he also has 18 thumbs down!! I have six thumbs up and i completely disagree with him.<br>  <br>  Why the seven up? Well there are those that have a weird sense of  reasoning, those that just agree with him cause they think he's a rebel and the others are just following 'Mr i'm a wind up'!!<br>  <br>  As for the theory of children with disabled parents. I know a mum who has cerebral palsy. She can walk but uses a wheelchair when needed. She has never needed any other support apart from the occasional weekend off and her kids are the most down to earth, loyal, caring and well behaved kids I know!!|`|Uz16kQEYaa	Do you know,my kids have never took a second glance at a disabled person.No matter what degree of disablement.If they ever have questioned it,it has been fully explained to them why people look the way they do,act the way they do,whatever.From being babies my kids have been 'exposed' to disabilities,i have an aunt with Down's,a nephew with Costello Syndrom,a friends son who had one leg took off when he was 2 years old.My kids look at the person,not the disability..and have done for years.<br>  You can't shelter children from any age,,disability is all around us.|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	My kids now all grown up with babes of their own were brought up with my niece who is Downs, they saw no difference in her just loved her the same as the rest of our family, they and their children are accepting of others who are different for whatever reason, be it disability, age, colour, fat ,blind,and even TV executives,  they seem to have the worst disability of them all, STUPIDITY!!!!|`|sIv9gaolaa	I totally agree with you. My aunt was severely disabled from a young age due to an allergic reaction to a vaccine. I grew up alongside her, was used to her from a young age whereas some of my friends and even adults were startled by the noises she sometimes made. I loved her and was hurt when she died when I was 9. I think the whole experience was positive for me, and alot to do with me choosing nursing as my career. A child is never too young to be "exposed" to disability. It never done me or my brother any harm.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	This sickens me. My husband is half blind and I knew that by having his children there would be a 50/50 chance his kids would also be half blind. So what, we had a child and yes she was born blind, does that  make me/us bad people? no because medical advances have come such a long way our daughter now has fairly good sight, she attendeds a normal school and okay she'll never drive a car, but she's doing alright thank you very  much.<br>  But just because she has a disability does not make her a bad person or a murderer. <br>  Disabled people are still human, and they still have the right to have children and anyone who says otherwise needs to remember that tomorrow they could suddenly find theirselves disabled. They only need to get hit hard enough by a car and thats it.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	i guess it means disabled people should not have kids and if they do they child should be taken away and introduced little by little when the child is ready to cope....what a crock of s h i t there are many able bodied people out there that should never be allowed within ten miles of children we have druggies and paedophiles and child abusers turning kids out every day is this ok then because they are able bodied.sorry no and what about children born with deformed limbs and or limbs missing should they be kept in the attic away from public view in case they scare anyone.grow up people why cant we all accept that some people are different special but the same as us.|`|ESKslyfsaa	Where will this silliness end.  Don't take your children out the house in case there is a disabled person about.<br>  Disabled people are everywhere, you don't notice them because it's not a big deal.|`|xywgBurHaa	Kids aren't scared of the disabled: only adults|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	So should young people too DISABLED in their minds!! B-K-A the California Octuplet Mom!!|`|fXDKPbbBaa	your a lame one but then you know this dont you|`|WzKrZoHQaa	TUT TUT - come on ladies ..... this is the 367th Q about this so far !!|`|RK5FsCw1aa	Im a paraplegic. Im as normal as the next person. I drive an adapted car, ski on adapted skis, I go flying, I have my own flat. I really do need a normal life. My chair is not intimidating. <br>  When children see me, sure, they stare. Who dosen't? <br>  Its human nature and they are curious. <br>  <br>  I have severe epilepsy, im blind in one eye, and i have four fingers on one hand (all caused by my accident). Does this mean that im banned from going outside incase I scare children? Do I have to hide if I see a child walking along? Or am I banned from seeing my neice incase I frighten her?<br>  <br>  If disabled people are stopped from becoming parents, then this confirms what a sick world we are living in.<br>  <br>  People are being murdered daily. There is knife crime, gun crime, sex, drugs and alcohol being splattered across the media. There is a huge recession. The concept of disabled people being banned from parenting, compared to todays life, is laughable. <br>  <br>  I find it hugely insulting that disabled adults may be banned from having children. One day I might have children, maybe I won't. <br>  Its an independent choice and thats how it should stay.|`|AA11427825	I think children should be exposed from a young age. I've got a disability, not one that's overly obvious and my mum and dad never treated me any differently, it's good for them to know not everyone is the same and teaches them not to treat people differently if it's explained properly by parents. Why wouldn't you want to explain to your child at a young age that people have disabilities?|`|v811KD7raa	the parents who complained about this are the scary ones.  people with less than the ideal number of limbs are a fact of life.  society shouldnt be hiding them from children, they should be represented on tv so that children can see that theyre a fact of life<br>  <br>  suppose an established kids tv presenter born with 2 arms loses one in an accident.  are we saying they should also lose their job?|`|UpR95bVfaa	when my brother was having his medical for his National Service the MO commented upon his manhood<br>  my brother responded by telling him that it was hereditary,as all his brothers (blushes modestly) were similarly endowed<br>  ah, so your Father is a big chap<br>  no, all down to mother<br>  hows that, women don't have penis's<br>  no,but she only had one arm, and had to get us out of the bath as best she could|`|6LJvAkF3aa	That is COMPLETE BULLSHIT. If they want perfection for any length of time, they should live in an utopia. God knows those work out so well. Hopefully no one will lose an arm in a tractor accident.|`|xcdHd7G0aa	And what about children with disabled siblings? Should those siblings be hidden in the attic until it is deemed they will no longer be "scary?" Sometimes I do wonder if some people ever left the dark ages.|`|qCaVjt0Maa	I disagree.. but aslong as they have help.. and the baby is in no harm.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	As someone who has two obvious disabilities I find his view both patronising and offensive. It's just that sort of attitude that led to a miserable childhood for me.<br>  <br>  If someone is capable of having kids, they have the right to do so. It disgusts me that people can be so thoughtless and mean about someone. He'll be suggesting that disabled kids should be blindfolded in case they see themselves next.<br>  <br>  The school I went to had a special unit (I wasn't part of it) and seeing kids with all sorts of disabilities getting on was good for us all I think.<br>  <br>  It all reminds me too much of the Arian "master race" and what they did to disabled people.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	would they want a black person off the screen if the child didnt like it? the parents should be ashamed of themselves
OIQvZ87gaa	The magic word is should.This man is tripling the size of this government.<br>  His claim to cut the deficit by 2012 is pure rhetoric and nothing more. <br>  He signs the largest spending bill in our history and on the other hand stands there and tell us the government is going to go on a spend as you go program. Only spend what you have.  Now which one is it??? This is the biggest liar ever to become President.  He makes Clinton look like a saint. This is going to lead to the collapse of our economy. He merely tells people what he wants them to hear,not the truth.|`|5DBVCyA9aa	When the government stops driving it downward with out of control spending and foolish regulation.|`|mno4Qd5paa	I don't expect to see any improvement for a couple of years.|`|nYCuCYfvaa	We should start seeing some improvement in 2010.|`|xywgBurHaa	Don't know I'm British|`|2szs8zp5aa	When Puppet Obama gets his walking papers in 2012.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	>>>The American economy will rise again ; If israeli support removed from the US budget.<br>  <br>  >>> Just try this idea for one year and enjoy healthy economy

We are hearing more from Hamas and Hezbollah these days.<br>  <br>  Are Al Qaeda in fact still a force to be reckoned with? Are they just laying low, or are they dealt out of the game by the more active radicals?<br>  <br>  We'll only know for sure if they actually attack somewhere - and it might be anywhere in the world. What's special about the USA?|`|e6f0256206b1ea8c927abbd5ed521df9aa	your question is silly and stupid.there will be no prediction for anything.so do we expect for terror attack.you can't read devil's mind. infect you are inspiring them by asking this question.remove it for god sake.|`|2szs8zp5aa	Chicago and Detroit are exempt since they are full of Arabs or prior Arab senators who go on to the presidency.<br>  <br>  I'd say some city in the south or Texas.|`|OUWTvtVVaa	No one can predicts that except the FBI.

kvm9MWdZaa	No I would go to the school and sort it out with them, schools are there for the good of children and deserve our support whilst they try to do their best with what they have.|`|WLCpLU0jaa	It would have to be for a good reason. But there are many schools and many teachers that are in the wrong. Sometimes, going to the press might be the only option to get something done. Any admin types I ever saw weren't too interested in making any needed changes or even willing to talk about situations.|`|MCNm1oIKaa	Plastered all over the media? definitely not. But if as sometimes happens I should come up against a "brick wall", I may find that I have no other alternative. I would of course explore every available avenue first and it would have to be of a very serious concern for me to go public.|`|xcdHd7G0aa	No absolutely not. If you have an issue with the school then you deal with the school directly. If you're not satisfied you make a complaint. There is no need to get the press involved, if anything it will only make the situation worse.|`|GmwgtWeUaa	It depends in what it is but i would never do that if i were you because the child might get bad publicity and probably so would the family.<br>  hope it helps<br>  this is only my own opinion. <br>  <br>  kelly fore|`|TIeI4rThaa	No way. I hate the press.  I would prefer to come to some arrangement or agreement with the school and if that proved impossible I would change schools.|`|xIacCxEwaa	I would have to really believe in what I was doing before ever involving my children in the media. Probably not.|`|FO1XCZc4aa	Not likely unless it was in the interests of my child and class and I was getting nowhere following correct channels for complaints. <br>  If something drastic like finding a hypodermic needle in the playground was not dealt with effectively then I would be shouting from the rooftops I would think....I have written to the papers over my son finding one in a busy shopping centre before. Photo's are a no no for me though plus I would not want my ugly mug there for all to see, it's the kind of thing that reeks of white trash|`|nxrEuJsRaa	No<br>  <br>  These parents are just craving the media spotlight and assume that going to the papers is going to make any kind of difference|`|RKUrIHI5aa	They do not all go to the Daily Mail - do you not get The Sun (newspaper, not yellow ball up in the sky) in Spain? Or The Start? Or The Daily Mirror? <br>  <br>  Your question: No I wouldn't - I can't think of any circumstances that would lead me to do so.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	When my child was in second grade an issue arose where I vehemently disagreed with the school he was in.  I NEVER considered taking it to a public forum.  I would have felt stupid, and immature.|`|S8RL9lieaa	No just unleash the ex wife on the school.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	no way, how embarrassing for the child.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Sometimes schools ,education authorities,even to the Director of education ignore parents yes loads of parents they are played for fools by the establishment they pay for. These parents in turn get desperate when they come up against a brick wall of of the establishment,so they go to the press.<br>  Using children's photos and names is not a good thing I will grant you that,however education held accountable for anything? no way is a closed shop.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	No, i'd never want to push my child into that sort of environment. Twisted words, people pointing.....I'd try to deal with it as privately as possible. The press would only be involved if there was absolutely no way forward, and even then, i'd be very reluctant for their picture to be shown.<br>  <br>  <br>  Talking of pics...lol you got the OB back but now your a wee grey box lol xx....<br>  <br>  <br>  ohh thats better lol|`|6gYK8tzoaa	I would say no way !!! BUT if my child was having real problems and for instance was scared to go to school and the school was not doing anything about it then perhaps that might be the only way to get something done.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	if it was for a good reason yes. schools and teachers can comment no law preventing it they just are advised by their attorneys not to.|`|doLyOac0aa	No, i hate the TV Media & the Press in Britain,|`|FP49kXBsaa	no I would not I have no right to have my child's picture put into the public domain,,,|`|2d4d4d8f449f8266d3033948651354acaa	No.|`|207dFmdHaa	no
fSdSuMHOaa	Only by a few, stubborn, blockheads (that can be a pun...those who block users they differ with), who use the report button & thumbs down to make their point or lack of it.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	I think so. Y!A isn't a forum and so debate is relatively difficult because one has to edit and re-edit the same answer, which if someone disagrees with you will have thumbed you down and hidden your answer thus your point doesn't get across.<br>  <br>  I think people who ask questions are mostly expressing their opinion and will chose a best answer according to the person who agrees with them the most, not to the individual who expresses a reasoned, justified and truthfull answer.<br>  <br>  The feature that thumbing down an answer also hides it is the main barrier to debate on Y!A.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	You may want to review the Yahoo TOS.

In order to claim larger amounts of SS, you need to be in a State Recognized partnership.<br>  <br>  MediCare is a Federally funded Medical Program that get's taken out as Taxes like SS is. When you claim SS you also typically claim MediCare.<br>  <br>  Then there is adoption. If you let gay people get married, you also let them adopt. <br>  <br>  These are the biggest things in overcoming as far as letting gays get married.

JhC6BvPpaa	The media controI that I know about is as follows:<br>  <br>  I think there is self control and moderation that we often experience in many organisations including Yahoo, and in particular at the BBC, censorship departments set up within each organisation. There are laws obviously laid down to 'govern' what the media can and cannot say. In law cases such as the Baby P case there are still certain facts and names and photos that the press and TV cannot reveal. On air, there is a safety barrier / delay of several seconds where a censor or moderator can cut off a talking person.<br>  <br>  I cannot comment on the USA or Germany, but I can tell you that when I worked in Saudi Arabia, the Arabs were obsessed with moderation. All newspapers coming into the country had huge parts blacked with a felt tip pen, even entire pages were removed, their TV news was very watered down and you never heard any anti Arab statement like you do anti western reports in the UK.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	I have no source but the build up to the Iraq invasion appeared dubious, especially the claim that Saddam could detonate a nuclear bomb to reach the UK within 45 mins.

It seems to me that there are rather intangible cultural factors involved, including the notion of collective social responsibility and the need for approval from one's peers. It seems to be societies where individual liberty is trumpeted as a paramount value against the social expectations of the society as a whole which have the biggest problems with this kind of crime. It is no accident that social democratic societies in Europe, where there is a very strong sense of social expectation from the individual and collective responsibility for the actions of others, have much lower rates of anti-social crime than the 'Anglo-Saxon' nations with their ethos of free-market capitalism and 'do what thou wilt' individualism.|`|cPuicv06aa	Several reasons come to mind:  the amount of violence not only in society but in the media, tv and video games even music I guess;  perhaps families aren't spending the quality time they want to because of stress and schedules, so our younger generation isn't getting the discipline and time they need.  This is my opinion!

9BeUbORtaa	My preference is strongly for the Guardian Weekly - I try to read it whenever I am out of the UK. This is probably because it accords strongly with my own political views, which are liberal-ish and left-ish. However, it has quite a strong British-European focus. The Economist is, to my eyes, a lot more right-wing. It has some good journalism, but it tends to be rather pro-US and - for example - virulently (hysterically) anti-Russia. I've been extremely annoyed by the fatuous coverage of some Middle Eastern issues in the Economist as well (since this is my area of study). On the other hand, it probably has better coverage of East Asian issues than the GW.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you can get most of the Guardian Weekly's copy from browsing the Guardian website: www.guardian.co.uk<br>  And most of the Economist can be found online at www.economist.com<br>  <br>  So arguably you don't need to buy either.|`|JCJVi8Qraa	the economist.

8ftxES2Zaa	I don't know what the context was today but last year he said "Brevity is the soul of the wit."  He did not coin the phrase though; he is quoting Shakespeare's Hamlet.  The character who said the phrase (ironically) was Polonious, a man that just talked and talked and talked and talked -- just like Rush.  Anyway, here's what Rush said last year:<br>  <br>  "So I wrote the Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning, while at the same time doing feverish show prep, and sent it off.  They liked it.  They said, "Wow, this is pretty hard hitting."  So it's going to be on their website, it's going to be in the newspaper as well in the Friday editions.  They asked for 800 words. When I finished up it was about 700, which they also love.  They love you coming in under the word count, and I said, "Brevity is the soul of wit."  The shorter the time it takes you to make the point, the more power the point has."<br>  <br>  I respect that you are admitting the irony, though it takes some of the fun out of my response... because that is about as ironic as it gets ;-)|`|NMpbLtuTaa	I can't find your quote but did find this:<br>  <br>  "brevity is the soul of wit" - From Shakespeare's Hamlet, 1603<br>  <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/74850.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/74850...</a><br>  <br>  Brevity is "the quality of being brief in duration; Succinctness; conciseness".<br>  en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brevity<br>  <br>  "Wit is a form of intellectual humour.

rrkmmbnEaa	It was RACIST. Those 12 pakis should be hung drawn & quartered for committing such a hideous crime.|`|tFi26EMpaa	i completely agree with you! but that's what happens when a country loses its balls. britain's to scared to be "racist" to actually prosecute those criminals. they don't want to offend asians or anything... as if asians would be offended. if 13 white people almost killed an asian, i wouldn't be offended if they prosecuted the jerks! but no, they'll sacrifice real justice in order to appease criminals.|`|2EHpbdwIaa	Im 30 years old and ive been attacked so many times by black gangs on racial grounds that ive lost count. Ive lost teeth and got the stab wounds to prove it. I was first attacked in a school play ground by an asian gang at the age of 13, then hospitalised at the age of 16 just before I took my GCSE exams which lead to me failing them. At school it happened all the time, black gangs used to roam the place handing out beatings to any white school boy unlucky enough to be caught on his own, everyone knew it was going on including the teachers but no one could do anything about it. If you fight back against an asian then dozens more appear out of the wood work & you could end up loosing your life. Ask any secondary school pupil and I garantee you will find that this sort of thing happens all the time in all different sorts of schools, as well as on our streets, in broad daylight as well as the dark. When I was 16 I saw a white teenager get stabbed to death by a black gang. From what I saw & heard it was definitely a racist attack, but the police refused to listen to anyone. Less than 7 years later the black youths that carried out that killing are walking the streets again. Any white gang carrying out such a crime would never see the light of day again. <br>  <br>  Id say that for answers to why this is allowed to happen in this country you have to look at the Polititions. For some reason theve made a country that openly tollerates black on white racism, but shams white on black racism. My guess is that they are too scared to take on anyone from an ethnic minority group anymore for fear of violent reprisals. It seems so pathetically stupid because by giving people from ethnic minorities the right to be racist they are loosing the core of their voters; the white working class. This is one of the reasons why many are turning to the B.N.P. <br>  <br>  When people say Britain is a racist country I completely agree with them. Its a racist black mans paradise.<br>  <br>  I feel extremely sorry for the poor lad & his family. But I feel that theres nothing anyone can do about it. If your white & you try & claim that you have been racialy attacked you just get given the cold silence treatment from the authorities & the Police. I wish him the best of luck with his case.  <br>  <br>  As for you "Obsessive"....Your a prime example of what im talking about. A legalised racist pig faced waste of blood & organs.

A white school boy was almost beaten to death with a claw hammer by a mob of 13 asians...and you think they should have killed him??<br>  <br>  Sorry in response to the question.....Yes it was probably racist. The text would have proven that. yes they got jail sentences but that poor wee kid deserves better. If he believes he was racially attacked then this should be followed tho' till the end. Just because he is white and the attackers were Asian doesn't mean the school can treat is as another gang attack.<br>  <br>  I can 100% guarantee had it have been the other way around it'd have been racially motivated!|`|FP49kXBsaa	it was perpetrated by Asians, so yes it was racial|`|TPN1yIj7aa	this poor lad. you're right. if it was the other way around there would be a huge outcry and the press would be all over it.|`|Uz16kQEYaa	I wouldn't even listen to the views of the school..I'd go way much higher and not stop shouting until i was heard.|`|CqAK1uiNaa	Its appalling, of course it was a racist attack.

e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	Great article. Persian Jews have a tradition going back thousands of years. They even have a proud record of serving in the military and have full state support for their synagogues and holidays.<br>  <br>  Iran, surprising to many who have been brainwashed by the American media, is advanced and cosmopolitan in many ways. The 25,000+ Iranian Jews can attest to this and are proud of their Persian identity.|`|NI0cNU22aa	Yeah, it's not like the government can arbitrarily take away all of their rights and throw them in prison if they complain, or anything.<br>  <br>  ..oh, wait.<br>  <br>  It is.<br>  <br>  I also question the journalistic integrity of the article when the author says that the man in the store has visited relatives in Israel, when the Iranian government doesn't allow Iranian citizens to travel to Israel (and if they do, they aren't allowed to reenter the country) and the constant mistrust and imprisonment of Jews in Iranian jails for "spying for Israel."|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Here I thought that all the Muslim countries forced their Jewish populations to move to Palestine when the lands were granted to Israel by the British.|`|vlRf70fjaa	good point,|`|JCJVi8Qraa	i just hope they continue to prospse, in a difficult environment. jews are second-class citizens in iran, after all is said and done. that is also made clear in the article, which i also read.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	This is just another reason i think that Iran is not so bad.

I will post it too.|`|fc2992c5a9f11dc05f28a29f5a9c0dd8aa	I think it is about time for all the jewish to know that they can live peacefully in their original countries.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	I think that these Jews, who are living in fear for their lives, will say whatever they think the government of Iran wants them to say.

54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	The "Pals:" the ones that live in the Gaza Strip and West Bank-- have not been willing to live peacefully under Egyptian or Jordanian rule, respectively.  Even when they belonged to these nations, their obsession was to wipe out Israel.  They caused a lot of trouble to Jordan and Egypt.  So why would Jordan and Egypt want them back, if they can get rid of them without losing face?  It sounds magnanimous:  "Go ahead and become an independent nation!"  <br>  Israel has also encouraged them to form an independent nation, but they are still obsessed with wiping Israel out.|`|RoLcpujNaa	for example, they caused too much problem in Jordan<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_in_Jordan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Septe...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3141156,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,...</a><br>  <br>  as you can see the Jordanians and the Egyptians have no qualms shooting the palestinians en masse, and for sure no arab country want them.<br>  the arab countries and especially iran use them as puppets in the international arena. instead of letting peaceful coexistence they fuel hatred, sponsor the terrorists, giving enormous amounts of oil money to spend on weapons against israel (never on the development of the economy but always buying weapons) providing training for terrorists, <br>  <br>  <br>  israel still provides Gaza with electricity, water and all essentials freely<br>  'cause the Hamas leaders are too busy (fighting israel and launching rockets at us daily) to provide for their people's basic needs|`|swiOhDo2aa	If you were in charge of any country (Islamic or not) would you want to offer them a home? Would you want Hamas next door? Would you want to support a crowd guaranteed to bring grief to anyone who has anything to do with them?<br>  <br>  Enough said.|`|ki55GqjYaa	Um.. Maybe because the palestinians already have their own land that was invaded by the israelis? Wouldn't you want your own property back?|`|xywgBurHaa	Who cares. Not me !! Show me another.|`|F9MeMPY8aa	we love them a lot we no we wont take them! bec palestine belongs 2 them and if we take them no one would be there to try to take the land back!! mmm we will not give israel the self satisfaction!|`|FO1XCZc4aa	I think there are many reasons for this. Firstly Egypt do not want the land back as they have borne the brunt of Israels force. Secondly, Syria and Iran will not allow palestinians to be rehoused within their borders since it would enable Palestinians to become citizens - something that will ultimately remove their identity. I know Syria take the stance that they will always have a claim to the land if they never leave it and will become a similar situation of them needing a homeland as was the case with the Jews. I do not think any country is prepared to take on Israel/USA. Syria and Iran want Palestine to remain Palestinian territory and refusing their citizens entry everywhere ensures they remain a sect and a problem for Israel who want all the land|`|Vjb9qXZfaa	Because, all those other counries, Egypt, Jordan, and whatever else, are traitors.<br>  And Also Lebanon has been siding with the Palestinians.<br>  And no, they are not just using them, I know for a fact that Lebanon has taken in the Palestinians as refugees and has helped them out.<br>  The only reason those Arab nations hate Israel is for what Israel has done to the Palestinians for the past 60 years.|`|AA10404097	The Palestinian people were offered full Jordain citizenship at the time of the first two influxes they have steadily refused. It is their feeling that at some point they will be able to return to their homes in Israel. None of the Arab states has done much to improve their condition. The impact of a body of stateless people on the border of Israel is seen as a good thing by most Arab states.|`|YTasscmKaa	They would be a destabilizing influence wherever they went. They would come into conflict with the native peoples and become a strain on the local government. Why not make them the Israelis problem?|`|HQKuzxulaa	The Palestinian people want their land. It was taken over by some neo nazis. Palestine for the palestinians.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace will be so far , and what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force.
nYCuCYfvaa	The Arabs only seem to whine after they fail at genocide, and not during. Funny that.|`|S8RL9lieaa	These phosphorous bombs as you describe them are anything but. They are a marking device for the actual target and unfortunately they have been used in residential areas. Targets are not usually found in this situation, but when you have an enemy hiding in schools hospitals etc what do you expect.|`|tguEmxVyaa	All is fair in love and war..I love the smell of white phosphorus in the morning.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	No it is not, but they get away with it.<br>  Because, they feel they are the victims.<br>  It has already forgotten in the media, the next day after it happened. <br>  Few media sources commented on it, but it was really not talked about. <br>  My newspaper never mentioned it. As a mater of fact the hole enter city i live in has no ideal about the true history behind Palestine's occupation.|`|tod8jy9Paa	The purchase of phosphorus bombs is legal but the use of them against innocent civilians is not and Israel well know it despite their pathetic denials. Israel should be charged under international laws but as usual they will hide under the wings of their US protectors.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	It is illegal by international law but USA and so called Israel always do every thing which is illegal. Criminals always like crimes.|`|bRBZ5KX3aa	i think this quote sums it up best:<br>  <br>  Concerning the U.S. use of white phosphorus in Iraq, the British Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell, said<br>  <br>  "The use of this weapon may technically have been legal, but its effects are such that it will hand a propaganda victory to the insurgency. The denial of use followed by the admission will simply convince the doubters that there was something to hide".|`|InW0bIkwaa	Sounds like you need to do a better job collecting evidence.  I suppose the haphazard launching of rockets at anything and everything is alright with you, as long as it doesn't kill someone you personally know.
