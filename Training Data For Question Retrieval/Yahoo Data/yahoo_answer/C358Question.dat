20090131172013AAdJ2tf	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Are most people who get psychology or psychiatry degrees annoying?	I have never met anyone as annoying as a psych major or a person trained in psychological counseling or psychiatry. They think they know it all. They will try to argue with you that they know how people behave because they have a degree, or took a class in psychology or psychiatry. Most of them like to plug the phrase, "You're contradicting yourself" in their conversations. Some of them even like to feel they're intellectuals, even medical professionals at times.      Is it just me, or do you find these people as annoying as I do?

There's probably more people talking about him than there were voters on election day.      Why is this? Are people more interested in politics? Or just the people involved? What's going on?

20090131174433AAvCmF0	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Twilight movies are going to be changed!?!?	I read an article on Aol that said that Stephanie Meyers has agreed to make the movies different then the books. She said to many people have read the books, so she is changing the movies completely from the books, so there is surprise and more suspense. She said they will change the movies, so they aren't anything like the book. I am mad, I love the books and she said something is going to change with the werewolves. She said possibily kill them in one part. What do you think about this, I think it is stupid and many fans will be mad.

20090131182613AAaFhOM	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: Reask: Do you think Nirvana ripped off Boston for Smells Like Teen Spirit (plus BQs)? ?	Wow, I thought R&P would get excited at a chance to bash Kurt Cobain and Nirvana! I didn't get as many answers as I expected, so I'll reask for the hell of it:      When I heard 'More Than a Feeling' by Boston for the first time, I felt like I heard the riffs before.....      I'm currently doing a project on Kurt Cobain for English, so I've been learning way, way more about him and Nirvana. One website said that the "opening guitar part [of Smells Like Teen Spirit] is a small variation on the main riff of Boston's 'More Than A Feeling'. This was noted by a Rolling Stone magazine writer years later, but not as an accusation of plagiarism."      Do you guys think that Kurt Cobain ripped off the main riff of 'More Than a Feeling'? Or was he just inspired by Boston? Do you even think the riffs sound similar at all? Here are some links for you to compare:      Smells Like Teen Spirit- Nirvana    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXO3OMGKP...       More Than a Feeling- Boston    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcsVPis1i...       BQ: Which song do you think was more influential? 'More Than a Feeling' or 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'?   BQ2: Nirvana or Boston (personal preference)   BQ3: Brad Delp or Kurt Cobain (who's the better vocalist, don't be biased please!)   BQ4: Favorite song from Boston   BQ5: Favorite song from Nirvana      I have 140+ contacts and over 200 fans, where the hell are you? Please answer! I know that many of you would love the opportunity to bash Kurt Cobain freely! lol ;)      Isn't it ironic that both Kurt and Brad died of suicide?       R.I.P. Kurt Cobain and Brad Delp

They told me that they never knew I had a talent in singing.      I don't really think it's a talent. I just sing 'cause I love to and I'm not trained so I don't really know if I can sing.      Anyways.   I noticed that my voice seems to get to a higher pitch on a mic but without one, I can sing lower. So, there are some songs which I cannot reach the notes on karaoke but I can reach out of karaoke.      My mother says I need to learn to modulate my voice.      So, any tips, suggestions or advices for me?   I'm still only 16 yrs old so my voice is most probably not yet fully developed.      Please and thank you!   :)

What the walls would say.   Mhmm.      Chorus:   Ever little word/ever little fight,   may cause me my life.   Ever little whisper/ever little lie,   may shun you out of my life.   Oh no.   I’m so scared/if these walls one day decide to talk.   Oh my.   I don’t know what to expect.   oh…      If these walls could talk/I wonder what they would say,   Maybe they will talk about everything I’ve done great.   It’s a mystery to me.   I wonder what they would say/and to whom.   I’m scared of letting you/finding out what these walls would say.   What the walls would say.   Mhmm.      Chrous
20090131163511AA34kmL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Extreme Metal crowd. your thoughts on BlastBeats?	Do you like them, do you hat ehtem, somewhere in between?      Are you convinced that being able to wail out blastbeats at 180bpm is the epitome of being an AWESOME drummer?      I like them when used in extreme moderation, like an exclamation point, but have to admit, just like a tweenie girl using 50 !!!!!!!!!! after every statement, I find repetitive use of them to dilute ther effect and become pointless noise, rather akin to a baboon smacking on a trash can lid over and over.  Tis why I generally feel that Deathcore and Black Metal have on average the worst drumming of any genre.  But that's just me.

20090131124958AA53ijN	Entertainment & Music;Radio	Have you noticed more and more radio talk shows are nothing but hosts whoring themselves between commercials?	These shows all have ads, which constitutes almost 25% of the air time.   But what's really infuriating is that the host is subliminally plugging the advertisers DURING THE PROGRAM. The result is that 100% of the air time is commercials.   Examples -   Handyman radio shows - when the "expert" gives advice to the callers, he only recommends the products and hardware stores that advertise. Result? The best answers to the questions are not given - only the most lucritive ones are given.   Example 2 - Financial adviser shows plug their own books, their own business, their own franchise.   Example 3 - Even Rush Limbaugh works his advertisers into his show. While he's making fun of Obama and Democrats, he's telling us that we should buy ____________ and __________ to make life easier.      Rush and his posse are spending more time thinking of cute ways to sneak their products into their show than they are trying to make the show better.   Then again 100% commercials on regular radio, is a lot better than 100% communists on NPR.      Have you notice this or not?

20090131193457AAJQBd4	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Lost - Who's advice should Hurley have taken? (spoilers)?	When Hurley was driving the passed out Sayiid around and Ana Lucia stopped him, or her ghost, or her imaginary person... she told him 3 times "whatever you do, do not let yourself get arrested by the police" and made sure he understood.      But when Sayiid was awake he told Hurley, whatever Benjamin Linus tells you, it's a lie.      So should Hurley have run out and gotten arrested on purpose to avoid Ben?      It seems to me he was already mad at Sayiid for making him lie about the other survivors on the island.  He wanted to go back to the island.  Ben was saying he'd get him back.  Ana warned him not to get arrested.  And Hurley very carefully followed all of Ana's other instructions.      I'm thinking the island makes him see the ghosts somehow who will give him good advice, maybe...  And I pity him for his confused mental state.      What's your take on it?  What do you think he should have done?

A biker was riding along a South California beach when suddenly the sky clouded above his head and, in a booming voice, the Lord said,   'Because you have TRIED to be faithful to me in all ways, I will grant you one wish.'   The biker pulled over and said, 'Build a bridge from South Carolina to Bahama so I can ride over anytime I want.'   The Lord said, 'Your request is materialistic. Think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the Atlantic! The concrete and steel it would take! It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. I can do it, but it is hard for Me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more time and think of something that could possibly help mankind.'   The biker thought about it for a long time, finally he said 'Lord, I wish that I and all men could understand their wives. I want to know how she feels inside, what she's thinking when she gives me the silent treatment, why she cries, what she means when she says nothing's wrong, and how I can make a woman truly happy.'   The Lord replied, 'You want two lanes or four on that bridge?

20090131193127AA4KEFp	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Corporate fun for anyone ?	Dilbert's "Salary Theorm" states that "Engineers and scientists can never earn as much as business executives and sales people." This theorm can now be supported by a mathematical equation based on the following two postulates:      Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power. Postulate 2: Time is Money.      As every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time Since: Knowledge = Power and Time = Money Then: Knowledge = Work / Money      Solving for Money, we get: Money = Work / Knowledge. Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity, regardless of the amount of work done.      Conclusion: The less you know, the more you make.      Example: Managers and sales people make more money than the engineers and scientists.

I'm looking to preorder a Japanese CD by the idol group Arashi, listed as "曇りのち、快晴 / Believe (DVD付き初回限定盤 B)(日本版)." Basically, it's the Limited Edition version which includes a DVD with the music video for "Kumori Nochi, Kasei (曇りのち、快晴)." The thing is, no matter where I look, it's no longer available (even though the CD won't be released until March).      The other editions of this single are still available, but I'm looking for this one specifically.      The main Japanese import websites I use (Yesasia.com, cdjapan.co.jp) are already sold out, and Amazon.co.jp is not selling it yet, and I'm not entirely certain it ever will. I really want to find a copy before it's released, because at that point I'll have to start paying $50 or $60 rather than the $20 it's going for now.      I've tried Googling the name, in both romaji and kanji, but either it's not listed or is not available for sale. Does anyone know of somewhere I can purchase this without traveling to Japan?

Its clear who wons, right?   rap is garbage compared to rock, right?      i mean, i'm watching right now "From G's tp Gents", and its now clear to me that "Hip-Hop Culture" is a pile of shiiiteee !!!.         .....P.D., i just remember, all the instrumental music on those "classic rap albums" i mentioned before, are mainly composed of samples, samples from other genres, thieves !!!.

20090131153326AAv5ryj	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	The Concert & The Father?	I would like to go to the Death Cab For Cutie concert in the city during their tour this year. I will be 16 years old and will have hopefully had my license for 3 months. I plan to go with 2 or 3 friends. One of them already has his license but I frankly do not trust him to drive us. It is not only his driving why I do not trust him. When I go to a concert in the city my Dad has most often driven us and picked us up. I know I will have my license in May but I am not comfortable    a) driving into the city or any highway unless I am getting off next exit.    b) It is the city. It will be in the night. This is Atlanta, baby.            These are just my feelings, but would I be too paranoid to have my dad drop us and pick us up while one of my friends and I will both have our licenses?       Thank you

To me RZA's beats for Wu-Tang were hard but there aren't much songs that I know of that he did with others outside the group. Like Premo who has a hot track for like every famous artist plus gangstarr. so i guess what i'm asking is is Premo better because of his beats or who he worked with.

20090131182001AA3Gvrp	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	I Love ____ But I Wish They Had Never Done _____?	Okay, if you're HONEST you know there's a song (or even an entire album) somewhere in your favorite singer's discography that you wish you could get them to deny that they had ever done.      Here are examples of mine:      I love Warren Zevon, but I wish he had never done "Werewolves of London."  Not only does that song stink, it presented him as a novelty singer.  He had so many great songs.  This was not one of them.      I love Jimmy Buffett, but I wish he had never done "Margaritaville."  He said he wrote it in 20 minutes.  It shows.      I love Jim Reeves but I wish he had never done the "A Touch of Velvet" album.  We didn't need an album of pop standards when country was starting to get overrun with a pop sound.      So, what song (or album) do you wish you could erase?

Mike has played for such acts as Morphine, Guster, John McVey, Duke Levine, Mark Sandman and Either/Orchestra. This is the 10th anniversary show of Club d'Elf and features John Medeski of Medeski Martin and Wood fame.

I mean a lot of the characters have similar qualities, are put in similar situations, and have similar things happen to them. Like how  in school based series, the main charecter is usually either "average" or "below-average" in terms of looks, grades, wealth, ect. yet they always seem to become considered "cute" or "so-nice-and-sweet-that-it-makes-up-for-... and get all the girls/guys. Ex.: Shounen: Suzuka, Ah! My Goddes!, Midori no Hibbi, Rosario+Vampire. Shoujo: High School Debut, Moe Kara, Random Walk, Cat Street      My head hurts so I'm not going to keep listing other similarities. I'm just posting this as food for thought. Give me feedback!      PS: DON'T LEAVE ANSWERS LIKE "THAT'S STUPID" OR "YOU SUCK". I only want your deeper thoughts, not your hate.

20090226073150AAab1tu	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	American Idol - how will the voting go?	I think the voting will go as follows from most to least:      1. Adam Lambert - insanely talented, but what will he do if he wins?  He is not contemporary and will only shine as the lead singer in a rock band.   2. Allison Iraheta - Where did she come from?  The song she chose was made for her.  She will struggle in other genres.   3. Megan Corkrey - Another really good song choice.  Very current style.  Not much range.   4. Nick Mitchell - Does not deserve to be this high but he will get alot of votes.   5. Matt Giraud - I had high hopes and was very disappointed.  Terrible song choice.  Now's the time to sing what you do best and save the attempt at being current for the final 12.   6. Kai Kalama - He's just not very good.  I thought it was a good song choice and he did about as good as he could do.   7. Jasmine Murray - Cute Girl just not very good.   8. Kris Allen - He's got potential but doesn't have a very strong voice.   9. Matt Breitzke - Nice guy.  His performance of that Tonic song was completely lacking the Angst which that song requires.  He just went through the motions and failed to sing with passion or connect in any way.   10. Mishavonna Henson - I actually thought she did really good and has some talent.  I agree that she does seem too serious, but she performed a very difficult song and showed she has some range.   11. Jesse Langseth - I wanted to punch her in the face.  Open your eyes and stop squinting!  She really annoyed me and sang a very safe song with no vocal range. completely forgettable.   12. Jeanine Vailes - shes just not very good.      Therefore, I think that Adam Lambert, Allison Iraheta and Megan Corkery will get through.        If they take 4 wildcards from each group for wildcard night, the ones from this group will be:   Matt Giraud   Kris Allen   Kai Kalama   Jasmine Murray

20090131180047AAtX2jd	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Why does Odis on "Back at the Barnyard" have udders if he's a boy cow?	I guess they couldn't draw a p****s on a kid's show (why would that be bad to draw a male part if they draw female parts on the cow anyway?), but that would be more correct than udders on a boy cow. They would've been better off not drawing anything on him, don't you think? That's kind of misleading to have udders on a boy cow which would make little kids think all cows have udders.    So why do you think Odis on "Back at the Barnyard" has udders if he's a boy cow?    Also, why do you think it would be okay to show female parts rather than male parts on a kid's TV show? If you see either animal (male or female) out in the wild, both of their kind of parts are exposed anyway.

The first 2 Kanye West albums, Be, Reasonable Doubt, Madvillainy, Raising Hell, the First 2 Public Enemy albums, illmatic, Only Built 4 Cuban Linxx, By Any Means Necessary, New Danger (Mos Def), etc...      It's just that i discovered  alt-rock/prog.rock, and some electronica albums too.   I'm not kidding, i was a REAL hip-hop fan, contemporary hip-hop fan.      And I have always despise mainstream hip-hop, Lil Wayne songs are pieces of dirty toilet paper, and 50 Cent rhymes are as clever as the literal value of his name (50 Cent), actually mainstream hip-hop is what made me try rock music.      listen to :   "Army of Me" by Bjork   "Time For Heroes" by The Libertines   "Ever Fallen in Love" by Buzzcocks   "Walk on the Wildside" by Lou Reed   "Exit Music (for a film)" by Radiohead      And then have the guts to come here and comment that "rap is sooo much better than rock".

20090131182406AAqXUNZ	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Is this the wrong path? Horoscope question?	My friend use to be so shy and quiet, but now IDK. My friend lost her virginity to this boy after dating him for seven days. Now she's basically sprung over him. She stays out of the house 2 or more hours after her curfew. She disobeys her family and lies to them so much just so she can sneak out with him. She comes to school late because she wakes up late from being on the phone with him till morning. But Her grades are not dropping, Although she spends all of class time texting him.      P.S he's 17 she's 15...   I don't want to sound like her mom, but I feel like shes going down the wrong path. P.S her dad and mom knows they secretly found out. They are very mad.      My friend is a Pisces   Her boy friends a Aquarius   I'm a Scorpio

They are pretty, talented, and still making music. I'm still hung up on the age thing when i listen to the talented baby bops. Should i care? am i too hung up on age?

Alright, so I absolutely hate Busta Rhymes and think he sucks and ruins every song that had the potential to actually be good. I don't really understand how he's known and he can make it on top 100 charts. i was just wondering if I was alone on this? cuz i really must be if he has songs that get onto the top 100 charts. so just tell me if you like him and why. if it's a song like Arab Money, I'm talking about the verses where HE is the one singing rather than someone else. so if you buy one of his songs cuz of a catchy chorus, say that. I wanna know if you actually like HIM though.

20090226072431AAyvMHx	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I'm still looking for that italian movie since I watched it in CCTV in 2004.?	Two main roles:one is the barber,named George(sounds like this,because i'm watching the chinese version)who experienced the big depression of his career.One night he saved a young man who was going to jump into the river(Not sure about this detail,anyway he was going to kill himself),and persuaded him to live along.Right,this young man's name is Gooth(sounds like this..)Then with the time flowing,they feel both better,and oneday the young man persuaded barber to participate in a World Barber Championship,(i feel its in Paris in the movie,not very sure about this).And there,the barber met the biggest rival who he was acquainted with when they were both apprentices of one great barber teacher.....And during the game,I remember they somehow had a fight or anything like that,then the young man decided to take the train to leave him,but finally the barber found him in the train station,and they went back to the match spot together,and finally the barber won the world champion....      A very touching movie,that makes me cry at that night of 2004,when I was still at the beginning of my teen age.   And after that I was searching for it all the time when I was online,but I dont know its original name,(the name of the chinese version is "Barber Champion"),and I cant find it in Chinese websites(most of them are other barber movies,alas...)      I really hope anyone can help me,if you happen to know this movie,please please let me know,I wonder if any italian people would know it,or italian friends,can you search such a movie in your own lingual websites,I think maybe that would help...

20090131183536AACoK0x	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	TAURUS EX GIRLFRIEND HARD TO READ!!! HELP!!! =[?	My ex girlfriend and I have been broken up for 6 months now and I was the one that broke it off with her. I broke it off with her because she told me that she wasn't happy in the relationship and that she "had love for me" and was attracted to me but was NOT in love with me. That she cared deeply but her feelings were not as strong as mine. So I broke it off with her since we weren't on the same page as far as feelings were concerned. I've tried a few times to get back with her but she always decline and says that she can't guarantee that will happen, and that she has been thinking about us alot lately and that she's put it in God's hands. That if we're meant to be, then it will happen. And that she doesn't want me to put my life on hold for her and that if I should date anyone else, she doesn't want to hear about it. That she doesn't want me to tell her about it because it will upset her. I also have a Myspace page and it's public, and she visits my page 3 to 4 times a week. I know because I have a tracker and it logs my  visitors. And sometimes she hits me up with a text message and says good morning. But she doesn't make an effort for us to see each other...where as in the beginning when she was the one chasing me, she was always inviting me over or asking to see me. I've never cheated on her but I have hurt her a couple of times. I don't know, I guess what I'm trying to say is should I move on or is she still interested? She's hard to read and it frustrates me. I love her and she knows I do. She's a Taurus (April 21) and I'm a Scorpio.  Please please please no smart remarks...keep it sincere. Thanks everyone!

I just got into them recently, and thought i loved their sound, I wasn't able to understand their lyrics. I tried analysing them over and over in my head, but there were so abstract, and there can be millions of meanings. They sound good, I know, but it's like psychedelic music... Is it psychadelic music? Am I not listening deep enough? I know that The Shins are an awesome band, and I feel like I'm missing out on something big.      My favourite senseless line:    God speed all the bakers at dawn may they all cut their thumbs,   And bleed into their buns 'till they melt away.

20090131195725AA0CrIY	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Aquarius: cold during the day and hot at night?	So I have a question, do you Aquas tend to become more open about your feelings at night? Because when Im with my bf, he always acts like just my friend when we're out during the day, but then when we go to his house at night he becomes so much more affectionate. He says he doesnt know why he does that. It's like he's always polar opposite... to the extreme. Overly distant during the day, and then overly sweet at night (not that Im complaining about that one) haha.       But I dont get why he does that. Why cant he be a little more affectionate when we hang out during the day instead of when we're alone in his house? I wish he was just a BIT more affectionate during the day. Nothing big, just have him hug me or hold my hand for like a second. Would it be a good idea to ask him to do that? Cause I dont wanna sound so demanding or anything.

20090131201258AAC0cdK	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What is this song about?	By the way you brought me here,    it makes me believe    the best is still yet to come    and I don't want to leave.    Forgive my hesitation- oh, but I'm learning to trust in you.    Help me to dream these dreams cause I don't have a clue.      If you'd be honest and say what you mean    you know I would promise I'd do anything    cause I know that without you I'm giving it away.      Is this what you wanted?    Cause I'm willing to change.    Now that I am certain,    that there's much more to gain.    You've introduced me to the moment    oh but I'm looking to stay for good.   Yeah.   You've asked me to stay forever.    Well, you know that I would, I would do anything.      If you'd be honest and say what you mean    you know I would promise I'd do anything    cause I know that without you I'm giving it away.      The nights are forever and maybe I'm wrong,    but it feels like I'm so lost without you.    So I step towards the heat, it's the way I can see,    and it makes me believe that it's you.      And by the way you brought me here    it makes me believe   the best is still yet to come    and I don't want to leave, I won't, but anyway...      If you'd be honest and say what you mean    you know I would promise I'd do anything    and the nights are forever,    I can't get to sleep cause I know there's a reason.    I'm in this too deep    and I'm sure that without you,    I'm giving it away. Yeah.      Giving it away...          http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R2QbmIdn...

And this one is my fave;  http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4284274/1/Ev...    It's about Inuyasha, Kagome, Rin, Jaken and Sesshomaru being pulled into Barney world XD omg! if you dont feel like readin the whole thing, atleast read the last chapter; I just about pissed myself laughing!      anyways, ENOUGH about fanfictions! Gosh, you people wont leave me alone about it :P       ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ...      1 Someone is making a theme park. The dude hires you to create a ride based on any anime or anime character. Describe the ride that you created.   ==>>I would call mine, The Dragon Strike. It's named after Sesshomaru's dragon strike. anyways, it would have a lot of twists and turns and higher drops than ever imagined and it would be the fastest coaster in the world!      2 Why is your fave anime your fave anime out of all anime?   ==>>Inuyasha; I honestly dont know. I am completely obsessed with it! I guess it's cause it has a great story line and the fight scenes never get old or boring no matter how much you watch em      3 Why is your fave anime character your fave out of all anime characters?   ==>>Sesshomaru from Inuyasha; I dont know.... I remember when I first saw him I thought he was a complete jackass who had no life. but as the anime continued I guess my fave went from Inuyasha to Sesshomaru somehow :P      4 If the cartoon network decides to stop showing anime, how much do you think their ratings will drop by (no this isn't actually happenning, just randomly thought of this question)   ==>>I think it will go down quite a bit, but I cant pin point on how much, maybe about 30% which is a lot      5 last one; wanna ask me something random, again.....

Okay, South Park, the episode "Over Logging",  when Randy asks to watch a video of Japanese girl puking in each others mouths, was that a parody of "2 girls 1 cup"?   Haha, I just thought about this because I just answered a question, where a girl asked if you would go to the site "lolhello.com", and I was scared, so I googled it, I found out what it was about, and now I'm SURE I'm DEFINITELY NOT going to that site, where I had found out what lolhello.com was about it said something about 2 girls 1 cup, then I found out what THAT was about, and I know that I should never visit that either, haha.    So was what Randy asked for a parody of 2 Girls 1 Cup?   If so, I finally get it, lmfao.

20090131200315AA8MIke	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Isn’t The MET Opera Audience Supposed To Be A Little More Sophisticated, Cultured Than This?	So I’m listening to the Live From The MET broadcast this morning of Verdi’s Rigoletto and three times that audience, like love-struck rock star groupies, burst into enthusiastic applause before the two more famous arias and the popular quartet were even finished. Poor Gilda didn’t get to finish ‘caro nome’, the Duke didn’t get to finish ‘la donna’ and the ‘bella amore quartet? Of course not. The applause started before the last few words were finished. And of course the last few bars of each musical piece was drowned out by the applause.      Yes, it was a wonderful performance (other than the interruptions) but wouldn’t you think this seasoned NY audience would have a clue, a collective instinct, as to when to start applauding?      Perhaps the MET should cue them on the teleprompter?

I saw a movie on t.v. the other night but I didn't see what it was called, I'd like to see it again tho. It was in black and white and it was about a movie producer who wanted to make a movie about this isolated island. He put together a crew and they sailed there, when they got there, some natives of the island rowed to the ship and kidnapped the girl who was the star of the movie and tied her up to be a sacrifice. The movie guys went after her, but first this giant gorilla came out and got her, he didn't kill her, but he took her away. They chased the gorilla all through te jungle, there were dinosaurs and teradactyls and stuff that killed people. They finally knocked the gorilla out with gas and took him to New York City to put on display, and he escaped and went on a rampage thru NYC! It was great! I don't want to ruin the ending but he climbed up a building and had to fight military planes. It was sweet! Have you ever heard of a movie that sounds like this at all? If so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me! I want to see it again SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad!!!!

"GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep.       A while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep.       Then the teacher asked April a third question. "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ****!"       The Teacher fainted.

Sorry if there are a few misspellings I typed this all from an iPod touch and emailed them so myself. it was at a moment when I was suddenly struck by a bolt of inspiration. remember, constructive criticism welcome! I know they are not the best but hey its who I am and who I am is a life of corny lyrics and stupid, over used phrases. Enjoy! As if your not bored already tehe. yeah i know this song is kinda short. here you go have a ball!!!!!   oh and there is 1 line that some1 said sounds like the lyrics  from take a bow and no that is not where i got it from.i just thought if it.      verse 1:   Surrounding me with words you refused to say up until now.   That was quit a show come and take your bow.   You have done all the things you could have done to make it right.   But now that it's done, we won't put out the light.      Chorus:   put on your cement shoes, I'm gonna take you for a swim.   Take in these words through satin and sing them as if a hymn.    The battle is far from over and barely just begun.   It's been so long but victory has been set on me, I won.      Verse 2:    As if nothing is wrong is how we all must be seen.   But they can see right through you with your eyes of blackened steam.   Rushing through the halls as they all file in.   One by one they march in a room full of deadly sin.            *REPEAT CHORUS*               Verse 3:   Something so profound, leaving once again.   Take this to heart and never let it mend.   The sky will open up, releasing your own will.   Watch your own hunter get swallowed by the kill.   Never losing sight of what's right in front of you.   It's sometimes hard to see when standing next to you.         *END WITH CORUS. LAST 2 LINES REPEATED TWICE*

Needless to say, I didn't finish it.  I think I watched 30 minutes of it.  I'm just wondering what everyone else's thoughts on the Sci-Fi movies were.

20090131180849AASLL1R	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Where is this Seto Kaiba quote from?	(May not be exact):      "I'm just here to chew bubble gum and kick ***... and I'm outta bubble gum"      I've heard that this is a quote from Seto Kaiba from the show, Yu-gi-oh! and I've heard different stories behind it. I want to know where it's from. I heard that he says this in the original series in the japanese version. But my friends think that it may be from the abridged series. I want to know whether Kaiba does actually say it in the original series or not. Also, if you can, can you tell me which episode of Yu-gi-oh! (original or abridged) that it's in. I want to know. Thanks!

20090226080934AAtpGie	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Can anyone help me? I need a good name for my rap group...?	Me and my best friend Mark started a little group where we just "hit a beat". We need a good name for the group... we still are in need of a rapper or something...   How the group started:   Mark was beating in night class, and I told him that I could beat him at hittin a beat. He said, "Come on, try me." I hit that beat so good he was in shock!!! He said, "Come on, Edwardo" (another boy in the class). "Lets go to the bathroom and record me beating." He did really well. I said, "come on, Raven" (another girl in the class) "Let me kill him at it." She forgot to save the recording on edwardo's phone, but she thought I still did better. We had a competition after that. Ontario (another boy in the class) said, "Fool, you got killed by a white girl!" I blushed... He said "lets be on the same team!"      So now we are on the same team, but I cant think of a name... any help???

20090131190108AAcFBf3	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Does Anybody else hate Ti?sto (and others like him)? Real Electro fans only plz!?	I Hate Ti?sto. this man has put a huge dent in the possibilities of electronica music. Guys like Justice (who dj magazine put as  73 on their best dj list. Absolute BS), and Daft Punk ( 23, again total BS) should be considered the superstars; not Ti?sto ( 2, at least not  1) and  his army of guido techno followers (who dominate the entire list) should not even be allowed to make, or spin records. While Girl Talk is pushing the creative boundaries of electro, Ti?sto keeps on making the same worthless garbage. now I'll give him some credit, he did make many more people interested in electro. but he still sucks. Now agree with me, or at least put up a good argument.
