Antes tenía la buena costumbre de escaparme cada vez que lo necesitaba, me cogia mis bártulos y me iva a pasarme la horas en un lugar en el que hubiese muchas plantas, agua y animales a ser posible. Desde hace un tiempo me he quedado estancada. Mi trabajo me quita casi todas las horas del día y apenas me entero del tiempo de un dia para otro. Me gusta hacer fotografías y antes me cogia y me iva al campo, sacaba fotos a montones de plantas e insectos que me encontrase .Ahora me da miedo ir sola y es algo que nunca me pasó. Sé que eso es una tontería pero el caso es que lo que me suponía una maravillosa aventura se ha convertido en una ilusión que no llego nunca hacer. El caso es que siempre me lo propongo pero al final me retracto.

L'avvocato si sporge verso la ragazza e le chiede se vuole fare un giochino con lui. Lei in realtà preferirebbe fare un sonnellino, ma lui insiste dicendo che il gioco é facile e molto divertente. Il gioco consisterebbe in questo:   - Io le faccio una domanda e se lei non sa rispondere, mi da 5 euro, e viceversa...   La ragazza cortesemente risponde che vorrebbe riposare un po', ma l'avvocato insiste:   - Okay, facciamo così, se lei non sa la risposta, mi da 5 euro, ma se sono io a non saper rispondere, gliene do 500!   Pensando di avere a che fare con una biondona é convinto di poter vincere facilmente il gioco.

20060804061748AATiu7F	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Second dream, can anyone interpret these for me?	Next dream was still looking for houses, but not with Steve (my bf)  We were looking at small houses and apartments trying find one my grandma could live in and easily get around using her walker.  The thing is, my grandma died over four years ago.  Anyway, we were looking at these places, and another weird thing is, they seemed to be places I had had dreams about before.  Then I recall calling my brother and asking him to meet me with something I had lost or forgotten or something, I can't remember what it was.  I am kind of thinking I had forgotten my car keys or something like that.  In my dream I had to wait on him for like four hours, and I was getting annoyed.  He finally showed up and gave me whatever it was I needed and some cigarettes.  I don't smoke.  I used to, but not anymore.  Another weird thing is, my brother died over 8 years ago in a motorcycle accident.   Any interpretations?

20080623130033AA9yX4O	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Dicen que se puede morir por el fútbol y ?de amor?. Qué pensás?	Ute Wilbert-Lampen y su equipo realizó una investigación, publicada en The New England Journal of Medicine, la cual arrojó datos preocupantes: ser fanático del fútbol puede ser peligroso para el corazón.      El grupo comparó los registros de 4.279 problemas cardíacos de alemanes, los cuales fueron atendidos en Munich, en los servicios de emergencias, durante el desarrollo del Mundial de 2006, con los registros del mes anterior y posterior al campeonato, y del 1o de mayo al 31 de julio de 2003 y de 2005.      En base a esto, se observó que durante los siete partidos que disputó el combinado de Alemania, hubo 2,66 veces más pacientes por infartos y arritmias, siendo el encuentro jugado contra la selección de Pekerman el 30 de junio de 2006 cuando se registró el máximo de afectados, seguido por la eliminación por 2 a 0 a manos de los italianos.

20070601041208AAeXQaz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Do you know the southern rules??	The 'Rules of the  South' are as follows!!!*    1. Pull your droopy pants up.   You look like an idiot.        2. Turn your cap right, your head isn't  crooked.        3. Let's get this straight; it's called a "gravel road."   I drive a pickup truck because I want to.  No matter how slow you  drive, you're going to get dust on your Lexus.  Drive it or get out  of the way.        4. They are cattle. That's why they smell to  you. They smell like money to us. Get over it.  Don't  like it? I-40 goes east and west, I-65 goes north and south. Pick one.        5. So you have a $60,000 car.  We're impressed.  We  have $250,000  cotton strippers that are driven only 3 weeks a  year.        6. So every person in the south waves.  It's called being  friendly.  Try to understand the concept.        7. If that cell phone  rings while a bunch of doves are coming in, we WILL shoot it out of your  hand.  You better hope you don't have it up to your ear at the  time.        8. Yeah, we eat catfish &; crawfish.  You really want  sushi & caviar? It's available at the corner bait shop.        9.  The "Opener" refers to the first day of deer season.  It's  a religious holiday held the closest Saturday to the first of  November.        10. We open doors for women.  That is applied to all  women, regardless of age.        11. No, there's no "vegetarian special"  on the menu.  Order steak.  Or you can order the Chef's Salad  and pick off the 2 pounds of ham & turkey.        12. When we fill out a  table, there are three main dishes: meats, vegetables, and breads.  We  use three spices: salt, pepper, and ketchup!        Oh, yeah.... We don't care  what you folks in Cincinnati call that stuff you eat...  IT AIN'T REAL CHILI!!        13. You bring "coke" into my house, it better be  brown, wet and served over ice. You bring "Mary Jane" into my  house, she better be cute, know how to shoot, drive a truck, and have  long hair.        14. College and High School Football is as important here as  the Lakers and the Knicks, and a dang site more fun to watch.        15.  Yeah, we have golf courses.  But don't hit the water hazards --  it spooks the fish.        16. Colleges?  We have them all over.   We have State Universities, Universities, and Vo-techs. They come outta  there with an education plus a love for God and country, and they still  wave at everybody when they come home for the holidays.        17. We  have more folks in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.   So don't mess with us.  If you do, you will get whipped by the  best.        18. The south is the greatest!!  If you are from the south  you are part of the best people in the USA!!

Well, I went to the 25-DAYS-OF-CHRISTMAS website on ABC family and it turns out that there is a reindeer movie (TV show - whatever!) called "A Very Barry Christmas".      Here are the details I promised:   1. The main character is a reindeer that isn't one of the eight original ones.   2. One of the plots of a story is these reindeer games. I think the main character reindeer beats the gloating reindeer.   3. It involves a wise old man (not Santa!).   4. It's NOT Rudolph.   5. Clay-animation movie!      Hope you guys can help me. :-)      :0)

20090226120221AAA3ixI	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Lost: Your thoughts on the Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham?	This was a great episode, still lots of things to speculate on, but this episode handed you a lot of things on a platter, and it provided for some good entertainment.      After last night, I'd have to say that Ben is probably the ultimate bad guy and always has been.  At this point, you have to wonder if he has for all this time frauded the Island and the Others.  He claims he talks to Jacob and even looks like he is when he first takes Locke to the cabin, but is he really?  Has he always told the Others that his decisions were Jacob's but really lying to them to do what he himself wants to do?      Widmore actually seems pretty honest here.  I've never seen where he has actually lied about anything.  He wants Locke to go back to be the leader.  Widmore was exiled, but what has prevented him from ever going back and actually fighting the war? He's always had the capability to go back, so why hasn't he?  He could've easily infiltrated with the rest from the freighter.  He could have just as easily used Ms. Hawking to map him a way back, but he never has.  So, apparently the island is keeping him from being there maybe until peace is restored?  Someone, perhaps Jacob has kept up with Widmore and kept him informed of who is to be the island's leader.  So Widmore knows what the agenda should be.      An all encompassing war for the island is about to take place.  The sides are unclear, the time is unclear, the place is quite clear the Island.  Who all will be involved?  Locke, leading the Island, leading Richard and perhaps the Others, leading the 815 survivors.  Who else?  Ben, Dharma, 316 survivors, Desmond, Faraday, Lapidus, maybe more of Widmore and those exiled with him      Last thought.  Locke's resurrection.  Will we see a major change in him?  Since he came back to life on the Island, does he seem more at peace now?  Is he ready to lead?  Even in last night's episode, his faithfulness was still led astray because of Ben.  Locke was ready to do his duty for the Island to die by his own hand, but Ben shook him down and got him to reveal what needed to be done so that Ben could return.  Was it kind of like Ben spitting in the face of Locke and the Island's will saying Locke is not ready to lead, the Island's making the wrong choice and with one piece of information, he can still get everyone back to the Island like the Island wants?  Looks like Ben is fighting hard to keep his job, but at this point who is likely to follow him?      What is everyone else's thoughts?  Anything to add?

20090226113659AAuPpWx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Open Music Challenge: Vote on the Song/Album to Cover?	For those of you who didn’t see it, this is a follow up on this question:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Basically, I am proposing that interested Yahoo Answers musicians all cover the same song or all pick a song from the same album to cover, and post their results for some nice constructive criticism followed by a vote for the best song. This question is to pick what song or album to do. Vote on one of the following options, if a song wins out, we will do a song, if an album wins out, we will do an album. Pick either 1 song or 1 album that you would like to see us cover or that you would like to cover.      The nominees were based on people’s suggestions, I got more song suggestions than album suggestions, and so I balanced the list by switching some of the songs suggested to albums.       Song options:   Summertime blues    I Shot the Sheriff   Good Morning Little School Girl   She caught the katy   I fought the law      Album options:   Collected works of Robert Johnson   The White Album   Led zeppelin IV   Loaded- Velvet Underground   Bringing it All Back Home- Bob Dylan      If you are interested in participating and have not indicated interest on one of my previous questions about this please do so now so that I can put you on the list of people to email.      When this question closes I will email everyone who expresses interest with:    the song/album picked, a more complete explanation of the general rules, the date on which the final question will post, and some helpful links for those who have never tried to record before.      Thanks everyone

Like in thier old interviews when the interviewers used to ask them about what thier rings were for, they used to say "its a promise for us to stay pure till marriage", and in recent interviews when people ask them the same question all they say now is "the rings are a promise to us that we will treat every lady with respect" they hardly ever say the stay pure till marriage thing now.      Why do you think they do this..?   do you think its because thier finding it hard to keep that promise?   Opinions..?      ? I stilll love them =)

Next time I talked to him he said it was and he wanted to see where it goes w/ her, even though he still loves me?!? I asked if he just wanted it to be over for us and he immediately says "NO no no, I'm not saying that at all, I just need time to think, YOU"RE the one who initiated this to begin with remember?"      The extent of his 'relationship' with this girl is meeting at a bar and getting drunk together, we still talk and he says he wants to see me, but it's not a good idea right now b/c he is seeing someone. Meanwhile he carries my pic around in his wallet and has framed pics of us up at his house where he stays now.

20081106005327AA820Aq	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Jokes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	Three men were using the urinals in a public restroom in the UK. The first man finished relieving himself, zipped up, strolled to the sinks and proceeded to wash his hands, using plenty of soap and water and doing a splendidly thorough job.      As he was drying his hands (with lots of paper towels), he loftily announced to no one in particular "At Oxford, I learned to be clean and sanitary." The man then left the bathroom in a cloud of self-satisfaction.      The second gent zipped up, marched briskly to the sinks, and scrubbed his hands with much less soap and water than the first man, doing a splendidly thorough job nonetheless. As he was drying his hands (with only one paper towel), he severely announced to no one in particular," At Cambridge, I learned to be clean and sanitary, but I ALSO learned to be thrifty and environmentally conscious." He then strode from the bathroom with a purposeful air.      The third man finished relieving himself, zipped up, and ambled past the sinks to the door, muttering to himself, "In Australia, we learn not to piss on our hands."

20080928084238AAgqb1i	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Is it any wonder it didn't have the desired effect?	I was watching a movie on tv last night. Not sure of the name, Savage Beach or something along those lines. It was obvious from the start that it was made purely for titillation purposes. Almost non-existent plot overlooked in favour of action and gratuitous nudity. The cast members were chosen for breast size and mens overly muscular bodies rather than acting ability. It was laughable. But what got to me most was the fact that it didn't titillate me as much as it should because the women had out of proportion mountains of silicone on their chests and had a processed, airbrushed, completely unnatural look that would only appeal to innocent virgin teens or insecure men who only judged women by their breast size. The men seemed to have an image of what some men think women find attractive. I know your not supposed to take these movies seriously. But the women were so unnatural they were not attractive and I went to bed. What does it say about women that have their bodies altered to look like plastic sex dolls in order to make money and advance their "careers"? What does it say about the people that get off on watching these movies? It's comical that people can get away with putting men and women like that in movies like that. I'm still laughing at the thought of it.
20080928085342AArXC52	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of the movie?	It's been a long time since I saw the movie and I missed the end of it. It was about a man who was poisoned but the poison had a delayed effect and he was given a certain length of time to live by the doctor. So he wanted to find his murderer before he passed away. It was probably made in the late 60s or early 70s. I seem to remember a couple of scenes involving strippers or burlesque dancers in the movie also. But it's been that long since I saw it that the details are a bit vague. I'd like to see it again to find out whether he died or not and if he found his killer. If you know the movie please don't spoil the end for me so that I can look it up and try to see all of it.

20090226114413AApKGVd	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Please help me with my sheet music and the 2 clef problem?	Okay I didn't state this question very well last time.  Firstly look at the sheet bellow in the link ok.  Okay there are 2 G clefs here AT THE BEGINNING WHERE I put the big circle around the G clefs.  So if you look at the first two chords that I circled it's D and D played at the same time however one is a lower D than the other.  So Would I just play this normally just as if it was showing both those D'S in one G clef instead of two?  Then the second chord shows that you play two E's so wouldn't you play them the same way as if they were showing those same two notes in JUST ONE G CLEF?          http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k96/de...

20090225110131AA8pkS6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Did the rise of rapping lead to the demise of DJing?	Hip hop was all about the break beat and the b-boys who danced to it at its inception.    The 3 big names in hip hop then were all DJs (Herc, Bambaataa, Flash).    People talk about how hip hop was all about lyricism at the start, but it really wasn't because there were no lyrics. Rapping didn't happen till later.       But now, most people, when they talk about hip hop, they only think of rapping. If you ask people for a list of the most important people in hip hop, 80-90% of people will only put rappers on the list.       Do you think that as rapping became more popular there was less place for the DJ?    Or do you think other factors have been the cause?

Into the Wild- Emile Hirsch is one of my favorite actors. And that movie is simply beautiful. Makes me cry every time.      The Weatherman- One second you're laughing, the next second you're crying, and throughout the entire thing you're thinking.      The Prestige- It's beautifully filmed, and a very original idea. The script is also really great.      Fight Club- It's been one of my favorite books for a very long time, and the movie follows the book almost to a T. Plus, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Ed Norton... David Fincher. How can you go wrong with that?      Big Fish- The movie is pretty. The acting is great. The writing is really nice. There's something about the whole thing that just makes me happy. Plus, if you read the book... and then see what Tim Burton did with it, it's amazing.

For a few moments everything was silent in the cab, and then the still  shaking driver said, 'I'm sorry but you scared the daylights out of me.'    The frightened passenger apologised to the driver and said he didn't realise a mere tap on the shoulder could frighten him so much.    The driver replied, 'No, no, I'm sorry, it's entirely my fault. Today is my  first day driving a cab. I've been driving a hearse for the last 25 years..

What is your favorite example of a show you loved when it came out but then it just got worse and worse in your opinion?  Here are 3 of mine:      1.  The Simpsons - one of my favorite shows up until about the year 2000.  The writers changed and it just wasn't clever anymore.      2.  Arrested Development - The first season is a work of art.  Then about halfway through the 2nd it just got too silly.  I'd say it fell off right when Buster lost his hand.      3.  Sealab 2021 - The first season is brilliant.  Everything else is unwatchable.

20090225110244AAqHwZL	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Today's joke from the Scoobster?	Two builders go into the pub after a hard day's work. They're sat drinking for a while when a very smartly dressed man walks in and orders a drink. The two began to speculate about what the man did for a living.   "I'll bet he's an accountant." said the first builder.   "Looks more like a stockbroker to me." argued the second. They continued to debate the subject for a good while until eventually the first builder needed to use the toilet. On walking in, he saw the smartly dressed man standing at a urinal.    "Excuse me mate, but me and my friend have been arguing over what a smartly dressed fella like you does for a living?" the builder said to the man.    Smiling the man replied, "I'm a logical scientist."   "A what?" asked the builder.   "Let me explain" the man continued, "Do you have a goldfish at home?"   A bit puzzled, but intrigued the builder decided to play along, "Yes, I do as it happens."   "Well then it's logical to assume that you either keep it in a bowl or a pond. Which is it?"   "A pond" the builder replied.   "Well then it's logical to assume that you have a large garden." The builder nodded his agreement. So the man continued, "which means it's logical to assume you have a large house."   "I have a 6 bedroom house that I built myself." the builder said proudly.   "Given that you have such a large house, it's logical to assume that you are married..."    The builder nodded again, "Yes, I'm married and we have three children."    "Then it's logical to assume that you have a healthy sex life."    "Five nights a week!" the builder boasted.    The man smiled a little, "Therefore it's logical to assume you don't masturbate often."   "Never!" the builder exclaimed.   "Well there you have it" the man explained, "That's logical science at work. From finding out that you have a goldfish, I've discovered the size of your garden, all about your house, your family and your sex life!"    The builder left, very impressed by the man's talents. On returning to the bar the other builder asked, "I see that smart bloke was in there, did you find out what he does?"   "Yeah," replied the first, "He's a logical scientist."   "A what?" the puzzled second builder asked.    "Let me explain" the first builder continued, "Do you have a goldfish at home?"   "No" replied his mate.   "Well, you're a wank3r then!"

20090225111522AALywJ4	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Excessive Indian euphoria over 81st Oscar awards?	this may not be a Q, but nonetheless i want ppl's opinions. the fact is that there's excessive Indian chest-beating and ga-ga over SM's 8 oscar win. indians are falling over themselves to congratulate the white filmmakers and invite more white men to make movies over the ugly-dark side of India. let me dampen the spirits :      -oscars celebrate anglo-saxon film, not world films. the fact that the world is invited there has more to do with colonial attitude of anglos rather than achievements of other countries films.    -anglos believe that since their film industry is more profitable and has more investment than rest of world combined, they can dictate to the world what is good and not good. they believe they can judge the rest of the world's art forms b-c theirs makes the most money.   -America gained more by awarding oscars to Indians than India itself. Hollywood is trying to take over Bollywood, and 81st oscars are one step to that end goal. with all due respect to ARR, Gulzar, and Resul however.   -don't Indians realize that their country's image took a plunge due to SM? why are we happy over the fact that our ugliest side is being celebrated the world over?   -when will Indians makes films abt the ugly sides of UK and USA? just ask any black or latino man, they will gladly tell all.     -Indians will now not win any oscars for next 10 yrs, as oscars has a quota for rest of the world. India has filled its quota with 3 oscars on sunday nite. Indians shld quit dreaming of more glory, it will never come. sunday was bollywood's turn, next yr it'll be some other country.    -a mainstream Bollywood film will never, ever win oscar in any category b-c Hollywood wants to make sure that Bollywood will aways be its subsidiary and copycat.    -all awards are determined beforehand by some anglo-saxon big wigs and everything follows like military maneuvers. there are no surprises.       that's my 2 cents, now waiting for ur rxn.

20090226123015AAB6oUR	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What does this Twilight dream mean?Beat answer 10 points.?	Ok i was in some type of corridor that was part of a school.I think it was like a museum.So there i met Jacob Black and he told me to get a country painting.So i rushed to get one and found a Taylor Swift painting.But then i came across my classmates so i got caught up in a conversation.When Jacob came looking for me,the bell rang.I started heading for my math class and told him that i would bring the painting after class.He kept on following me and just as i reached my math classroom door.The light started to go off.I got scared and Jacob picked me up and started running out to the door.I was scared he was going to change in to a werewolf.After a while we were out in a courtyard and he told me that we had to go on a mission to retrieve a medallion that belonged to Edward.I got excited and just as we we were about to go two ninjas came from behind us.I started to frak out but Jacob Started running at such a high pace and threw blades at them which destroyed them immediately.It was breathtaking.       I think it is jus the things i think about during the day.What do you think?

20090226130057AAKnCsa	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Darkthrone: Death metal or Black Metal?	Of course they have had albums of both styles, with them starting out as a technical death metal band...but then changing styles to more well known Black Metal style. since that was the trend in Norway at the time.      I love their Death Metal since I admire the technical aspects of it as well as they were able to create a distinct dark sound.  Plus for all you who get tired of the constant Blast beats of Darkthrone, this has none. You are also able to not only hear the bassline, but its quite good IMO.      Death Metal:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z029ii_oc...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A6NnsrwN...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FiSJKcZf...       With that said, I still enjoy their Black Metal albums(a Blaze in the Northern sky being my fav).  They accomplished what they wanted to do with their sound...I just don't like that they dumbed down their music so much when they are obviously talented enough to play better      Black Metal:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OETblpJX5...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT3AIX3_...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkPL98Sn4...

But I can't remember the name and the actors were of such low profile that while their faces are clear as day their names are an absolute mystery to me. What movie am I thinking of?
