iKV2fNeTaa	there are plenty of free from the app store and once there on your ipod you dont need internet unless you want your high score posted|`|Lf4LlQQfaa	Simple-yes.
IHD5ywLiaa	No there is no way dude...Use the computer you're using right now...
Vq3COSvTaa	dunno|`|fdd5c5b5d35c694b40560fd4c8109e54aa	Wth? then why would you use wifi anyways if you are "claiming you get charged"... Why waste your own bandwidth if you are going to get charged anyways...      Anyways bottom line is YOU DON'T GET CHARGED FOR WIFI!!!    IT'S FREE... THEN WHY ELSE WOULD THERE BE SO MANY PPL AT STARBUCKS    You can call your service provider to block data... then u can turn on wifi in a hotspot and browse on phone.
1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	call them http://www.fujifilmusa.com/support/Servi...|`|7SXA5dhDaa	Learn from your mistake and teach others.  Share what you get from their service department. Did you research Fujifilm before your bought? A brief search shows them very low in the ratings.  If you're not in to research, stay with the name brands: Canon and Nikon.
b69Gm5fPaa	I would recommend calling DTV to upgrade and get the correct receiver. You risk buying stolen property off of e-bay. And if the access card is not the card that the receiver is paired with, then you will have to pay for a new card. If you have DTV then you will have to pay the extra six dollars a month for DVR service. Your HD/DVR will not record until the service is on your account. This is all done with computers and connot be avoided.     If you decide to go with the e-bay route, then look for a HR21 or HR22. The HR20's are older processors and the new HR23's are have problems here and there.|`|KnTRaVLiaa	I agree with the direct TV guy but I would like to add no matter what dvr you get off of e-bay you will have to get a new access card because the access card carries the account number of the person who was using it last legally. As soon as you would connect a phone line to it to receive the recording capability they will know where it came from. As your phone line will provide a direct connection to the direct TV  computer and will block your service till you get a replacement card. This can take three days mostly. You need to remember that when you get a box from direct TV you are just renting the box and it is the property of Direct TV.Anyone selling it unless it is over 5 yrs old is probably selling you a unit that is not theirs to sell. Think about going to costco and having a look at them they are technically rentals also. Some TIVO's are not capable of carrying DTV either you have to read the data that comes with it. Its because for a year or two they decided to pull out of their exclusive agreement with DTV. I heard they are back now however but in their absence DTV developed their own product which they now rent. So be careful I recommend you get one from your DTV installer or from costco.

2jMFurDoaa	it requires internet and/or media messaging but it doesnt cost extra.|`|khGDqPMnaa	Basically. if it comes pre-installed on the Cell phone. it SHOULD cost Sms, but if its like the iphone and its a 3rd party app. it would cost data.
AA11525080	Cydia is the App that's added when you jailbreak.
2jMFurDoaa	is the sim card in the phone right?    call ATT, customer service, and get it straightend out there could be something wrong with your phone!!

The only advantage PS3 has is free online network ( Duh MS wtf? ) 360 has the ONLY pay to play online network.  Graphically they're the same. and don't give me that crap about wait til the developers get used to it. There won't be that much of a difference. PS3's got Blu Ray? So. Stand alone Blu Ray players are not that expensive anymore.   It all boils down to exclusives...Gears of War or Metal Gear 4?     360: Marketed to the hardest of hardcore gamers with a  pinch of family games. RRoD, but is usually fixed if in the first 3yrs & the original owner. Paid Online.    PS3: Balanced marketing, but more towards the high-end (big bankroll) gamers & technophiles. More family content than 360 though. Free online.|`|AA12159925	ps3 has better graphics and of couse you pay nothing to go online|`|5SDn1J2Faa	Same thing as everyone else said but 360 has better online play and currently has more shooter games which are pretty popular.|`|P29NzRXJaa	Xbox 360|`|nAoU1jA9aa	PS3:     Pros:     Slightly Better Graphics   Free Online  More Fututre-Proof   Blue-ray Technology  1080p  Shooters  Racing    Cons:     Controller is crap  Online is worse than 360  More Single-Player Games     XBOX 360:    Pros:   Better for Sports Games  RPG's   Fantasy  Great Online Service  The Best and most comfortable Controller out there      Cons:    No Blue-ray  Less Fututre-proof   60$ yearly online subscription   Smaller HDD Capacity (Except Elite)
2KjMxlmJaa	I don't think that you can put Word documents on the iPod and have then format properly.  Although I haven't tried. Plug the iPod into your computer.  If Itunes comes up, close it.  Open up My Computer.  Find the Word Document you want.  Your iPod should be listed in the drives area of my computer.  Open it.  Drag the Word document into the Notes folder of the iPod.    like i said, I don't think you will be able to view the document on the iPod. If that is important, then save the Word document as a text file, then drag the text file into the iPod using the above instructions.|`|Lf4LlQQfaa	I'm sorry but there is only one way,copy the whole thing onto notes. :(|`|DrsOjw4Maa	what kind of document? and what kind of ipod? if its a touch then try the app called Readdle by ReaddleDocs it does cost $10. however if it a jailbroken touch then get the app called Docs by BigBoss through Cydia|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Wow, Idk.

Qt0qnSRCaa	You will have to learn to only download and install applications (or themes) which are specifically declared compatible with your phone in particular (i.e. E51) or its software platform release (S60 3rd Edition, aka S60 3.0).    If such an application fails to install on your phone seek help at the source of the application (developer's web site must have a support section) or in a forum for Nokia users, such as http://discussions.europe.nokia.com|`|LzSj90pbaa	If its not supported, its not supported...the alternative is to make your own theme, or find a different one.|`|LXiqhR3Haa	actually this phone is S60 version 3 ... so not all S60 programs or themes will work on it    try mobile9.com or dotsis.com ... and download specific themes for this device .... some will work (I tried it myself)

You can do it by using the Memory Stick Pro Duo and downloading from the internet ( http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/Sy... ), or by going to: XMB > Settings (far left) > Network Update (first one).  You will then need to select your internet connection.  Once you do that, it will tell you "Network Update has found a later version."  You need to have a enough room on your Memory Stick in order to download it.  Once downloaded, you will need to install it (press X after download, or go to games and download from Memory Stick).  Once it is installed, you can delete it off your Memory Stick.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	yes you do try updating it
3CJAUyqPaa	The BEST tripod will be one with a fluid head... but what is your budget? There's a SunPak PlatinumPlus 72" Tripod/Monopod for $90 at BestBuy (no fluid head, though) that is about as low-end as I would recommend. A "plate"? This comes with a quick-release plate... Two, actually.    If you can afford more, something from Bogen-Manfrotto or Libec in the $300 range will get you to a low-end fluid head. Check bhphotovideo or adorama.

CKRfaRYvaa	The only way she can see the content of your text messages is to subpoena the records from Verizon Wireless' legal department.  However, this is expensive and she'll only be able to get a subpoena if it's necessary for an ongoing investigation.  In other words, she can't just call up a lawyer and say "I want to subpoena these texts!"
Cl8FwsI2aa	One of the reasons I would recommend PlayStation 3 is it's built-in Blu-ray player. It's a true next-gen console (high-definition). I just don't know where to start. Here's a review based on my 40 GB PS3 model:-    The Good:-    The 40 GB PS3 comes with increased Wireless and Bluetooth range and reliability, and new components that reduce energy by 32.5% of previous models. The heat difference between this and other models is incredible. This thing runs very cool for hours.    All PS3 models can connect to the Internet for online gaming, shopping and web-browsing. It is nice that the PS3's user-base tends to be older and it doesn't come with a headset, so you don't get much of the 9-year-olds running around screaming during games.    Another huge feature is that the PS3 plays high-definition movies on a format dubbed Blu-ray. The picture of Blu-ray movies is 3D-like and incredible. Games are also played on Blu-ray discs and several games have already maxed out on Blu-ray's massive storage capacity. In other words, as HDTV's become more popular, this format will likely become the medium that people watch new movies on. The games on PS3 in the very near future will not fit on the DVD discs that the Xbox uses. Another great thing is that the PS3 upscales regular DVD's, which means all DVD's, despite their age, look outstanding on my television.    The Bad:-    The 40 GB PS3 doesn't get everything right. While the 40 GB model plays 100% of PS1 games it can't play PS2 games like other models can. But after playing recent PS3 games like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, I realized I don't want to play my old PS2 games anymore, since they just can't compare to this experience.    Second, it doesn't let you keep your music playing once you launch a program, enter the store, or go to a settings menu & you can't message friends in a game like the 360 can. What's more, Sony's store has a hideous interface (especially on Standard Definition TV's). It's clumsy, and needs a serious redesign.  Also, unlike Xbox, the service is free, which is awesome and has caused me to buy several great inexpensive games from the PS store.    Another issue is that the PS3 uses new Cell processor technology so developers have to invest a lot of time to learn how to use the PS3. This has meant that the games for both the 360 and PS3 have tended to look much better on the 360 with the PS3 versions being half-hearted ports. However, developers like Midway, Capcom, and many more are starting to realize this problem, get the hang of things, and prioritize PS3 development first. So recent PS3 games like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune are looking spectacular.    And finally, this model only has two USB ports and they don't include a HDMI cord or component cables in the PS3 box. Hence you have to buy one of them separately otherwise the picture will look terrible on a HD or digital TV. They also don't include an ethernet cable, which was a surprise.    The Verdict:-    The main factors for me were quality assurance, longevity, and value. The PS3 simply feels like it is a more sleek higher end unit. It has never frozen on me, and has a 1% failure rate. Furthermore, the PS3 is projected by many financial analysts as lasting for a long time. The PS3 has a ton of untapped potential.    Several recent exclusive games like Lair, Heavenly Sword and Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction have looked incredible despite the product being less than a year old. In my opinion, they look better, have more characters and action on screen than any game I've ever played on another console. You get a high-definition player, wireless capability, an optional use as a home computer, a web browser, media center and a cutting-edge video game machine.    In addition, the variety of games on the PS3 is astounding. There are Playstation Eye Camera games that let your body movements interact with the game, Sixaxis controller games that focus on tilting your hands to steer, the whole gamut of traditional game types, arcade games you can download from the Playstation store, and revolutionary games like Echochrome, LittleBigPlanet, and the Home social network. There is something for everyone which I feel is a balance that isn't struck as well with the PS3's competitors.    I have both the Xbox 360 Elite and a Sony PS3. While both the 360 and PS3 are great systems, the PS3, without doubt, is a better long-term investment because it can do so much more than just play video games and will only get better with each firmware update. Basically, the PS3 is "future proof."    Some good PS3 games include Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Fallout 3, Final Fantasy XIII, Killzone 2, Resistance: Fall of Man, Resistance 2, MotorStorm, MotorStorm: Pacific Rift, Time Crisis 4, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, LittleBigPlanet, Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter IV, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: World at War.    To sum up -- it's a superb gaming system, it's capable of playing Blu-ray movies, it has an acceptable free online service titled PlayStation Network, it looks pretty slick, it's reliable & it's worth it...    Good luck.|`|FIL4vngsaa	Because its made by a trusted company - SONY and it has great titles like LittleBigPlanet.   It is also the 3rd TV console in the list of the consoles that changed the gaming industry.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	They rock dude they have blu ray and awsome graphics.    they have awsome games also.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	bbplayer is right|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	are you kiddying???    the ps3 is the least popular console.It sells the least and you can easily find them    the wii is the most popular console not the ps3.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	right now i think 360 is more popular.    but soon PS3 will become the most popular console for a real gamer.

They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.    The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.  With the PS3, you get:  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi  -Web browser, just like a PC's    On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers    So heres a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:    PS3:  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300  Game $60  Controller $55  Total: $415    Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)    Xbox 360:  Console $300  Game $60  Controller $60  Xbox Live $80  Wi-Fi $100  Total: $660    As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.    On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. Its just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.    So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|pl2SocVKaa	wel its because ps2 was popular and ps3 improved on it so it just amazed everyone and got famous|`|IHZwUDtqaa	because it is made by sony and its technology is fun and easy to use and it could store photos, music, videos, and even browse the web and it uses an advanced technology called bluray. i also love how there is no disc tray the disc just slides in and it stays quiet while you play and ps3s very rarely break down and have exclusive games like uncharted, mgs4, lbp, motorstorm, ratchet and clank, and heavinly sword plus more that might come later on like MAG, god of war 3, Jak and Daxter, sly cooper, gran turrismo, twisted metal, tekken, final fantasy versus, and infamous. also online is 100% free. i love the ps3 it is the best console ever made! (i own all three btw)

GmyUtcLraa	It will be a bit of a process of elimintation on your part to work it out...    If it is is Plasma or LCD and you get the lines in ALL of your different scenarios (e.g. you get them whether you are watching a DVD, playing a game on a console, watching TV from the internal receiver and watching TV from a PVR or external receiver) then you are looking at a fault with the TV, most likely the power supply.    If you only get it while you are watching TV (test from both the internal receiver and an external receiver like a PVR, Set top box or VCR) then you have interference with your signal - so aerial or aerial cabling.    If you get it on your internal receiver and not an external receiver or vice-versa you can figure out what is faulty there.    And yeah if it's a CRT then things like power packs/transformers, speakers, fridges or anything with an electric motor can interfere with those. Try switching everything off you can think of that may be interfering (incuding the fridge because sometimes when the condensor swithches on and off it can cause interference - don't leave it off too long though :) ).    The only other thing I could think of would be the power outlet could be given dirty power. Two things to try - 1) Run an extension chord from another room in the house and run the TV off that power outlet. 2) See if you can borrow a power board with a battery because that will maintain a steady flow of filtered power (or if you know any IT friends borrow a UPS).    Good luck, hope that helps...|`|o9lQrcsYaa	Sounds like make you have a bad connection. If you have cable or Direct TV call them up and ask them to come a replace your cables.|`|VfvZLTO9aa	If it is a CRT television, it is most likely EMI (electromagnetic interference).... get other electrons a bit further away from your television.|`|1BGWAsC5aa	1. it may be your tv and you should get it fixed or get a new one    2. it might be just on the tv program(s) that you are watching|`|aa1QzDyWaa	Yes it can be fixed. Your TV cards have been messed up and need to be fixed ($100 est). Also your cable company might have screwed up on something, and this would be hard to fix

It has the third installment of Super Smash Bros, Zelda, No More Heroes, etc. The Wii will basically have any game genre you could ask for. Graphics may be brought down by just a little, but you'll get used to it since the gameplay for it's games are just so awesome, well for some. You may think that the Wii just has minigame compilations, but there's much more. So don't get a PS3. Plus the Wii an online store, so you can buy from your house safely.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	let me tell you one thing, that nintendo is crappy.    psp is far more better because it has better and more action games.  nintendo wii only has childish games|`|fb5de56f6a4615feae7b4153edaf01d6aa	wii, with psp    with any other console...    wii-xbox 306 get the xbox  wii- Ps3 Get the Ps3  wii- gamecube- lol get the wii|`|mzzzhIdRaa	it depends on what ur interested to play. if you want to have more fun and be active. wii definetly. but if u wanna just sit around then a psp. wii games use lots of movement. i have one and absolutely love it. one good thing about psp tho, you can play it anywhere.|`|hhljqmxlaa	a wii is more rare then psp and you really dont know how fun it is to you tryed it ever psp i got (4 btw) they got lost broken got the blue or stolen|`|AA12159925	wii rules|`|5SDn1J2Faa	PSP doesnt' have that much games but majority is better than the Wii.

AbRfd29Haa	The Azden SGM-1X is some kind of electret mic, not a classic condenser mic, so you don't need phantom power for it (regular condensor mics like 48V for bias), just a AAA battery for the in-mic amplifier (electret elements use a stored charge on the diaphragm, which needs some kind of amplification to drive out of the mic, usually a FET-based amplifier).     So technically, you can run this via a cable to the HF-100's 3.5mm (1/8") mic input. You do have to watch out, though... most of the adaptors I've seen run XLR to stereo 3.5mm, which is not what you want. An XLR cable is said to be "balanced" (if you're an audio guy or musician... if you're an electronics geek, you pronounce that "differential".. that means there's one normal signal from the mic and one inverted signal.. normally the inverted signal is inverted again an an XLR device's input, then added to the original, which causes noise to cancel out. This is used for mics largely because they have low signal levels and run across dozens of feet of cable... it's not usually an issue for your 5" camcorder to mic cable.    Anyway, if you do the XLR to stereo 1/8" cable, you probably get both phases of the audio recorded by the camcorder.  That's fine, until you go to play it back in stereo, at which point they cancel out... or worse yet, combine them together in a video editing program. It's also possible (with most mics, anyway) ground the negative connection, perhaps through a small load (resistor, like a 50 or 75ohm value). You can find cables of the stereo to XLR online, XLR to mono is commonly available in XLR to 1/4" microphone cables, but I have not seen it for XLR to 1/8"... but shop around.     Some professionals swear by the XLR to 1/8" adapters from Beachtek. They do the job just fine, give you a proper differential termination at the camera, and may allow level adjustments (depending on model). They can also provide phantom power. Such a device will also do the job for you, but it's extra cash you may not want to spend, and won't give you much (since your mic doesn't need phantom power).     Curiously, there's a video here from a kid who did just this, with your mic: http://www.vimeo.com/1675953    As for wireless adapters, there are dozens around. Technically, anything that's not at around 48MHz, 900MHz, or 2.4GHz requires a license... most mics run in TV space, at 400-800MHz, and people use them like crazy without licenses, but not legally. In fact, the 700MHz band is being re-purposed as soon as the "digital transition" is complete.. ok, now that's June, but they were still selling 700MHz wireless online last week, before the procrastinator's bill went out this week. So just beware.     Many mic companies sell wireless items, too, here's Azden's:  http://www.azdencorp.com/shop/customer/p...    On the other hand... your mic is a hyper cardioid, also known as a "shotgun" mic. It's way too directional to be used up close, it's intended to be mounted AT the camcorder. So until you add some other microphones (and more than one more requires either a mixer or a separate recording device), you have no use for a wireless audio sender.

lkqjJisaaa	a) the transmitter go in de hot shoe    b) the receiver go into one o' de lights    c) make sure dey all hav' batteries and that receiver/transmitter R on same channel.    d) de second light, it should have slave flash sensor active all the time.    e) second light will see first light go off and fire almost simultaneously.    f) to test: set up strobes.  Push test on one and it fires; other should fire too when it sees flash.  If not, something wrong with sensor.    Next, put transmitter in hotshoe.  Receiver in strobe.  take photo.  flash goes off.  If no flash, then something wrong with transmitter or receiver...like no battery or wrong channel.    Oh yeah, put your camera in M mode too.  Set shutter speed to 1/125.  Adjust aperture to get good flash exposure.  Done.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Your camera does not have a pc sync plug so what you will need to get is a hot shoe adapter that you can plug the sync cord into.     The Nikon AS-15 will work fine. I have used it with Canon and other cameras. Canon does not make one of their own. Costs about $25    http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/...|`|bo54Lw59aa	My first suggestion would be to contact the seller and tell them to send you the instructions.    As far as setting them up for proper lighting, that's way beyond what to answer here.  That takes a lot of learning.    1. Plug the receiver into one of the lights.  The transmitter should slip into the hotshoe on your camera.  You may want to test it first by plugging the receiver into the light and pressing the test button on the transmitter.  Should fire the light.    2. The 2nd light probably has an optical trigger, meaning it'll fire when the first one fires.  Again, test this out.    3. You'll have to put your camera into flash mode.  Not sure how to do this on the XSi.
maLzjlgXaa	1. Yes, but I've managed to repair it myself.  2. You will still have your rank because it is linked to your gamertag and is also stored on the COD4 network.  3. I personally think the Pro is the best. For $100 you get a 60 gig hard drive which is infinitely useful. (You also need a hard drive to play online games and store downloadable content). The elite does have twice the memory, but that is it. I don't mind not having my system black like an elite, since I will be focusing on the game I'm playing, not on the xbox 360 itself.      The difference between the Arcade and the Elite is price and some accessories/color. The arcade is the cheapest model and comes with 5 arcade games and a sonic game I think. It also has a small memory card to hold onto some game saves and the machine is white colored. It also has basic composite cables. An elite is the most expensive model. It is black in color and has a 120gb hard drive to store your saves and a headset. It doesn't come with any games, but does come with an HDMI cable if you plan on going High Def.    The difference between Xbox Live Gold and Silver is what you can do. Silver is free and comes with every Xbox. All you need to do is create a gamertag and put in some information and you are set. You can download demos, expansions, buy arcade or full games, and download updates for your games. You must pay to be a Gold subscriber. With Gold, you can do everything Silver does plus play with other people on Xbox live. Gold varies in price depending on what type of subscription you get. you can get a month for around $8, 3 months for $20, and a year for $50.|`|I7r6y2rgaa	mine broke, nothing ends it just rins almost as it was new when they fix the problems and i would have been so pissed if mine 6th prestige in cod4 would have been reset so no nothing happens to it.

KiVENZoBaa	It takes a while to get used to using the Brush Techniques. Sometimes you gotta draw the line in a certain way. You don't have to draw a straight line Horizontally all the time, you can do it vertically or diagonally. Though I think Horizontally works best.     My guess is, that you should start from the left side of the screen and draw a line, not too long and not too short. And make sure you use power slash on something you can cut, like a rock or a tree. Practice using power slash before you move on to future missions in the game, because if you don't master it, you willl have trouble passing through various levels. Study carefully when doing this, because I too had trouble using the power slash.     Heres a little tip, try drawing a fast and short line on a tree or rock it should work. Good luck and Have fun with it! I hope you will master this technique real soon.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	hold your hand steady and aim at the sensor bar|`|lcMWoe8xaa	I tried doing it fast but that didn't work sometimes.

It is possible you need a better antenna in order to pick up Fox2.  Antennaweb should also tell you this.    3 - It wasn't broadcasting when you scanned for channels.  Do a search for more channels and see if it picks it up now.    Although some boxes have the ability to manually set channels, your box does not have that capability.  All you can do is search for more channels - which is actually ok since I have seen tuners that don't remember previous scans and wipe out all channels when doing scans.
BsV2TQAvaa	This like comes from their "HOW IT WORKS" page.     http://cleanplaymovies.org/?OVRAW=dvd%20...    It seems that they review all new movies and create cut lists that you download to a memory stick. So your standard off the shelf movie DVD can be played while skipping whatever catagory of content you find offensive. They didn't show the details of the sexual content options but they did show the "language" option and under that were several catagories you could choose to eliminate like "Ethnic slurs" seperate from "strong profanity" to "cursing".     So it appears under each general catagory, you can choose various levels of content to block.  I suspect you will find what you are looking for. But you might still call the manufacturer to be sure.    I looked a little further down their website:    Sex and Nudity:  Sensual Content: Removes highly suggestive and provocative situations and dialogue.  Crude Sexual Content: Removes crude sexual language and gestures.  Nudity: Removes nudity, including partial and risque art nudity.  Explicit Sexual Situations: Removes explicit sexual dialogue, sound and activity.     It seems to me that if you choose to filter all the options under sex and nudity, that should cover everything you are concerned about.

I really like Windows Media Encoder although I don't know if it will recognize how to convert your video clips, its worth a try. Then upload the converted WMV file to youtube. I have done a couple of hi quality video clips that I wasn't able to upload to youtube directly.

Leaving a light on is a throwback from the old fluorescent lights that didn't consume a lot of power when they were lit but required a lot to get them going so if it was frequently used it was cheaper to leave it on.|`|SeKR3zncaa	I'm not sure however I've always been told that switching the light on and off consumes more energy than simply leaving the light on so maybe that's what she means.|`|BsV2TQAvaa	S. is correct. There's more energy consumed getting a light to light than keeping it lit. So flicking it on an off is a little wasteful. Its not a big deal. Otherwise, people wouldn't use Christmas light that blink all the time.     Somewhere on the outside of your home, is a power meter. It counts EVERY watt you use. But it only goes up by 1 for ever 1000watt/hours you use. So it would be very hard to see the power wasted by flicking the light on and off a couple of times.   But if fact it is a little wasteful.|`|H2v3QFWRaa	sure is

It's like the Sightseer trophy for GTA IV. there's six helitours, and certain tours are only at certain times of the day. so a tour may have been missed. So something may have been overlooked for the trophy. Otherwise, there may be a problem with the game or the trophies.

7Ylxp87Baa	i think all the speakers get wired up to the sub. the way they used to do it back when i worked at circuit city, was that you had to run speaker wires from the output on the receiver, to the sub. then back out of the sub to the speakers. its been a while but i think that was how it was.  if the wires dont plug into the sub, because i think there was a plug at the end of wires to go into and out of the sub, then you might just be able to hook the speakers up directly to the receiver. be careful with doing this because that 606 puts out 90 watts of power continuously, and if you turn it up too loud and have some low end going through those little speakers, you might blow them.  that might be the reason why you have the speakers go to the sub first, is because it might a have built in crossover to direct the bass to the sub, and all the highs to the speakers.it makes sense.  well, i hope i answered your question...anyway..good choice in receiver, im trying to get a 606 myself.    and also, you have to hook up the ps3 to the 606 with a fiber optic cable to get the surround sound from your dvds and blu rays. if you have a cable box or satellite box, you have to do the same thing.
RpCwfcRzaa	Yes. You can enable background downloads which will keep your console on until the download is finished. To do this, go to your system section in the My Xbox area, then down to shut down, and there is an option for background downloads.|`|XMJS3lrwaa	There is a setting to make your Xbox DL while it is in sleep mode but not when it is off.

BsV2TQAvaa	Sound is a very subjective thing.  Generally, TV speakers are crappy and your stereo speakers should sound better. BUT, most audio for video is mixed knowing that TV speakers are crappy   and sometimes it can sound a lot worse on a good sound system.     I don't know about your amp in specific but any good surround sound amp will likely have a setting you will be happy with. Try it with the TV speaker all the way down and just listen to the speakers connected to the amp and try all the "modes". Mine has modes like "movie","music" and so on.  Once you have found the setting you like the best, try turning up the TV speaker slowly. You may like it better, You may not. But sound taste is such a subjective thing, no one can tell you which one is more correct.

Because you can basically do nothing without it. Oh, and you need itunes on your pc then go to file then add a file and highlight all your music to upload it.   You can also dl a lot of applications from the store.   Anyway, you have some time to try it out before giving it back.

tHjBr4L4aa	You can buy Japanese: Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Nissan....  or you can buy German: Volkswagen, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche...    The Japanese first started by copying American and European products.  But they've evolved to the point where they are often the innovators.  Even the best known American name, Kodak, is found on cameras made in Japan or elsewhere in Asia, using technologies and designs from overseas.    I used to own a Leica and regret the day I, as a poor student, had to sell it.  But even the highly respected Leica has "fallen to the Japanese."      Examples?  One of the nicest little 35mm rangefinders was the Leica CL.  Guess where it was made?  Japan.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_CL    Leica is currently licensing lenses manufactured by Panasonic, a Japanese company, for use in their Lumix line of cameras.  Notice this quote:   "Leica is a registered trademark of Leica Microsystems IR GmbH. The Leica DC lenses are manufactured using measurement instruments and quality assurance systems that have been certified by Leica Camera AG based on the company's quality standards."   http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/sto...    Leica is having Panasonic make DSLR lenses for the four-thirds systems.  http://www.dpreview.com/news/0703/070307...    And more "cross-pollination."  http://reviews.photographyreview.com/blo...|`|YupMCYHlaa	We never made good cameras in the US, even when we did make them here.  The best cameras before WWII were all German (Leitz, Rollei) or even Swedish (Hasselblad).    After WWII, President Truman offered help to the Japanese to get their manufacturing capability up to pre-war levels.  He ordered a man named W. Edwards Demming to go to Japan, the greatest American expert on quality control.  Demming had written the book on reliability and statistical quality control.  But we never did that in the US.  The Japanese learned it from us, and they -did- it, and over the next few years they ate our lunch.    We never made really high quality things in the US.  It just wasn't our tradition.  We didn't make the Rolex and Omega watch, we made the Ingersoll Dollar Watch and the Timex.  They were really cheap, but a good deal for the money. After a year they'd die and you'd go out and buy another one, no big deal.  We didn't make Mercedeses or Rolls Royces, we made the Ford Model T, and it was cheap and everyone could own one, and it revolutionized the whole country's transportation.  We didn't make Leicas or Nikons, we made the Kodak Box Camera, which cost $1, and it took okay pictures, and if you sat on it and broke it, you didn't feel bad.    The Japanese not only made quality and reliability almost a religion, they also had a national quality control agency.  Whatever was made for export had to be inspected by government agents!  We couldn't do that here, they'd call it -socialism-!  8^O    But if we -did- make good cameras here, we wouldn't be making them here now anyway, we'd be making them in China or Taiwan or Korea,  and slapping our name-brand sticker on them.  I suspect that's where Japanese cameras are made too.  In fact I'd be very surprised to learn that Leicas are still made in Germany. I'd bet you they're not.|`|AA11317250	CAMERAS ARE MORE THAN BRAND NAMES, LEANNE!!!!  BE RESPECTFUL!      and leanne IT'S NOT OUR FAULT THAT JAPAN'S THE ONLY COUNTRY WHO CARES!

d381leKpaa	Well i'm guessing that you'd want to shoot for at least a $300 profit or more. When you bought it with the game, it was about 515 with tax? Am I right? So if you got 163 people in on it, than you could charge 5 bucks each, i'm not sure if people WOULD pay for it, you'd have to ask them to like pre-order tickets. As in "hey i'm raffling out a PS3 next week. I'm wondering if you'd like to buy a ticket." just like you said to us, but make sure they promise to buy it.  But if you want the 300 profit, just add it to the 515 you paid for, and divide it by the amount of money your selling the tickets for and see how many people you need in on it to make that proffit.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	i would say 7 to 10 bucks since its untouched    EDIT:american currency|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	It would depend on your charity or who'd be profiting from this raffle.

If it happened to be one of my favorite charities, I could see up to 10$ or 20$ per ticket.

Fh2BIsnvaa	Hey James L!    We think ultimately the answer depends on your own personal requirements and what you want in your iPod, but here are a few pointers to help you on your way.    Firstly, and perhaps most importantly is memory. The nano is available in both 8GB and 16GB while the Classic has a much larger 120GB. In terms of music, this is the difference between 2,000, 4,000, and then 30,000 tracks in the iPod Classic. It also means more photos and more movie time.     Looking at the prices, although the Classic is slightly more expensive, you are getting a lot more memory for your money. The prices tend to oscillate, but between the 16GB Nano and the 120GB Classic there is typically 20-25 difference. Simply, you can get almost double the memory for an extra 20 if purchasing an iPod Classic.    Shape and colour may be whats important in your decision. Nanos are lighter and thinner and come in a rainbow of bright colours, so much so you may be stuck for choice. On the other hand, with the somewhat wider and thicker Classic you have a far more limited choice of Black or Silver.    Battery life is also different with the nano typically lasting up to 24 hours (of music) the Classic lasts for 36 hours (of music), although you can find travel chargers and adapters relatively cheaply if you are regularly on the move.    It may also be worth considering a touch, as they have Wifi for wirless networking and internet access, gaming and they have a larger (3.5") touch screen display.    At the moment prices are around 99-109 for 8 Gb Nanos and about 130 for the 16 Gb. The 120Gb Classic is currently available for less than 165. Prices of the touch range from about 170 for an 8Gb to 270 for the 32Gb.    We hope these help to point you in the right direction. Good luck with your search!    From all at Dixons.co.uk|`|X0Nt2SNaaa	Touch 16gb 210|`|Lf4LlQQfaa	Clasic(dont have one but friend does) is nice(sorry don't know the price but you can check online) But I highly recomend the Touch.8G(2nd gen.$230)16G(1st gen. $220)

CKRfaRYvaa	If you already have a current family share plan, then you simply go into a store, call customer service or go online and tell them you want to add a line.  If you keep the same amount of minutes, it will just be $9.99 per month plus tax (so around $12-$13 per month), plus any other features you add for that line.  Depending on current promotions and you're account, you may also have an activation fee.  And you'll have to buy a phone unless you have an old phone you're using.      If you just have a single line, the first thing you'll need to do is see how many minutes you want the lines to share.  Once you figure that out, the process is pretty much the same.  The only difference is that you'll need to change the plan on your first line to a share plan at the time you add the second line.    Keep in mind that the secondary line is a completely separate line of service and can be moved to a separate price plan at any time.  The reason this is important to remember is because it means that the secondary line has its own contract, independent of the first line.
oQSzZeubaa	Hi!  What you need to do is exercise the amplifier a bit, giving it a hotter signal to process.  This can be accomplished by increasing the gain control, adding an overdrive pedal, or even just raising the pickups closer to the strings.  Make sure your volume is fully up on the guitar, plus you may want to set your action a little lower.  These adjustments apply to tapping, as well as, hammer-ons and pull-offs.  Hope this helps.  Best regards, Dana
ZQeXKdrAaa	You could get a Creative Zen 2GB.  Great player, lots of features, good sound quality, nice screen, and you can add more memory later (it uses SD + SDHC cards, which go up to 32GB).  It's a really nice player, and it goes for around $75.  Alternatively, if you can find a Cowon iAudio 7 4GB, it also goes for around that amount and they have amazing SQ and over 40 hours of battery life.  They also support FLAC and OGG files, unlike most players.|`|iKV2fNeTaa	you can get a ipod shuffle|`|DV3Zn46Aaa	I think you can get a zune with that money.

kTyiKldbaa	this question has been asked a lot    the main advice I give is to unsecure the network it seems a lot of people know the correct password, enter it, and fail to log in. I have an un-secure network (I have 3 other computers that need to connect to wifi so to not make it a pain in the butt we just made it an open wifi network)|`|iKV2fNeTaa	go to setting click wifi and it will searcha nd give you a list of wifis showing how good there connection is if its locked it has a lock if not it doesnt. if you know tjhe password click it and type it in|`|yqy5xfSbaa	its not that hard. Go to settings, wifi, and make sure its turned on first of all, and then select ur wifi network, and ask ur mom or dad for the password.
by4Gzhgeaa	When you purchase the consoles from stores they scan the serial number when they scan it for purchase.  If you return one that isn't in the system, they won't take it back.|`|SBcxooLsaa	no because of the serial nummber call dell and tell them what happen if you get caught doing that you can go to jail|`|LaVzFeLmaa	Most Walmarts record the serial number now, since this has happened a lot. You could try, but you might get stuck with two consoles, hehe.    Why do you need to return the Dell one in the first place?
sPQBluKEaa	no, they can't. that would be an invasion of your privacy. the only way anyone can see them is if they are court ordered, so be nice and clean and no one can see them =].|`|3yvuMkzTaa	The planholder can subscribe to a service that will send copies of all texts to their e-mail!!!!
CKRfaRYvaa	No, there isn't.  It simply doesn't have the hardware for it.  This means that for something to be wi-fi capable it has to have a wi-fi receiver, not just software.
tHjBr4L4aa	On the side of the camera's base, you'll find a sliding latch.  Slide it and the front of your polaroid will swing down and open.  Grasp the plastic tab that's attached to the filmpak to pull it the filmpak out.    When you push in the new filmpak, label side up, and close the door, a cardboard cover will be ejected and you're ready to shoot.
Lf4LlQQfaa	Yes, you just need the box and receipt.|`|EnkWULaqaa	yes, you could do what the other person recommended, but Ipod headphones are terrible, and you;d be better off with some new buds, like the sennheiser cx300s.
tzFkYLGqaa	I really dont know sorry.
fER8XF68aa	With analog TV, if the antenna isn't positioned correctly for the channel being viewed, you get snow, and maybe even a bit of video and sound.  With a digital signal, it seems that if the antenna isn't positioned correctly, you get only a black screen, or sometimes the video breaks up into mixed bits of picture and black squares/rectangles.    The remote for my converter box has a button called "Signal."  When pressed it brings up (on the TV screen) a status bar showing signal strength.  If the signal's not strong enough, I simply move the antenna a bit to improve the reception.    This may work for you, or you may need a better antenna.  I have a cheap antenna, but am right across the river from NYC, where most of the broadcast signals originate.  .
AA11436624	Forget about S video connection.     Nothing that cannot be solved with a couple of dongles. Since there are no 15 pin VGA to HDMI dongles or cables you will need a 15 pin VGA to DVI-I or D dongle (male to female) and a DVI-I/D male to HDMI male. (In case you are wondering the female male stuff, your laptop out is female so you need a male dongle...)    You can find that stuff below...    http://www.wolfcamera.com/product/EP5139...    Look for a dvi-i male to hdmi male cable...      Choose the length that adjust to your particular desire....    Depending on the resolution that your laptop has, the image will be relatively lower. Laptops dont handle high resolutions....|`|ZLmpH4dCaa	Nope.  You can get DVI to HDMI but not VGA to HDMI.  Your laptop would have to specifically list S-Video support if it was possible.. they would have given you some special cable to use.

oQdsvzmtaa	You're probably in deep trouble, but you can try a few things. Pull out the batteries and the memory card, then reinsert in hopes of "rebooting" the system. Turn the camera on image view mode instead of shooting mode, activate the menus and choose "reset all" or equivalent thereof. Finally, it's possible that the weird lens action is due to a piece of plastic from the gearing of the lens having broken off from the fall. If you can fish that out (if it exists), you might restore the lens action.     My guess is that none of this will work, but it's a lot cheaper to try before going to the service center, which is your next step and will run into $$$.|`|AA12323486	You can learn from your mistake.  Cameras have delicate electronics in them, and dropping them is very bad for them.  It's not covered under warranty repair, and repairs aren't cheap.  You can pay to have it repaired, or buy a new one.  Next time use the camera's strap, and keep it in a padded case when you're not using it.

CKRfaRYvaa	It is unlimited for all practical intents and purposes.  The actual amount of minutes per line is something like 99,999 per month, which is more minutes than there are in the month; therefore it is impossible to go over on nights and weekends.      The only exception to this is if you have one of the old family share plans from several years ago.  Some of these plans did have limited features such as 1000 night/weekend minutes.  Just check your bill and it will say if you have one of these plans, or call customer service and ask.  Generally, if your bill says you are on America's Choice or Nationwide, then you're on a newer plan and have unlimited night/weekend minutes.

A photo taken by a 10-megapixels camera can be printed in a larger size than one taken by a 8-megapixels camera. But as far as I know, a 10 megapixels camera can take photo at 12.91" x 8.64" ( 32.79 cm x 21.95 cm) actual size. Do you really need a photo that large ? The more megapixel, the larger the photo will be, but not the nicer. You really should know about that.  By the way, "a really good zoom", did you mean a super zoom camera ? (>10x) Or just 5x as the Nikon Coolpix S550 ?  Besides, do you know anything about "ISO", "shutter speed" or "aperture" ? If you wanna take "outstanding pictures", you should learn about it first.  In conclusion, a nice photo is not taken by a good camera but a skilled photographer.    Ah, I almost forgot, I think you should purchase a Canon A590 IS for your very first photos. It's a really good camera with 8 megapixels and 4x optical zoom.    Good luck !

I have the curve and find that it an extremely valuable tool for me with a great internet browser, e-mail apps, and other PDA functions. Also you can hook it to any computer through the USB cable and use as a tethered modem for wireless broadband internet anywhere that you can get a cell phone signal.|`|LzSj90pbaa	a blackberry is not a phone. a blackberry is a brand of phones. they have 60+ models.  this question is impossible to answer.|`|ZvAenLOMaa	your question is incomplete without the model of blackberry you are referring to.|`|rJ8kLGgkaa	Go to VerizonWireless.Com.  In the search box, type Blackberry.  Different models are shown, like the "Curve 8330" for $79, or the "Pearl 8130" for Free.  All discounted prices require that you sign a two year contract for a monthly wireless plan.  There is a significant $$ penalty if you cancel a plan early.      Select a phone and click "Buy Now"  (You don't really have to buy, it will pop up "plans" an you can just look at the options).      You can get a "Voice Only" plan with 450 voice minutes for $39/month and pay for each text message you send, or $59/month and have 450 voice minutes and unlimted text messaging.  If you want text messaging and email, it is $79/month.    This stuff is very confusing.  You can also call Verizon (800) 256-4646 and let them walk you through it, but don't buy over the phone unless they guarantee to give you the "online price."  Also compare prices with ATT and T-Mobile plans.
p6viL2Bmaa	Microsoft covers every XBox with a three year warranty for the RROD.  No charge to you.  And luckily few newer XBoxs get the RROD.  Enjoy    Edit:  If you do get the RROD, just call 18004MYXBOX.  They will send you a box to mail it to them.   It takes them a couple weeks to work on, and they mail it back to you at no cost.  The 3 year warranty for the RROD comes automatically with the 360.  You don't have to ask for it.  Best Buy offers their own warranty for anything else that could go wrong.  That costs and you have to ask for it.  A few things that can help avoid the RROD is to keep it out of an entertainment center or cabinet.  Put it in a place where it can breath.  Also don't put it on carpet.|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	Warranty is free.  1-year covers it if it ever stops working for any reason other than red ring of death (like any normal warranty, doesn't apply if the damage is due to negligence), and 3-years covers the three-light ring of death.|`|D52bRqQWaa	The 3 Years warranty covers the RROD only f you want it to cover anything else then you have to pay for it|`|LXiBCERZaa	Yeah it's free, I've used it a few times now. If you buy the warranty from whatever store, the plus side is you can bring it back directly to that store to get replaced, versus waiting a week or two to get it back from MS, but really, probably not worth it unless you are ultra impatient.     Every time my xbox broke, MS didn't even ask questions, they just replaced it.

The easiest might be just to get a cassette recorder with a built in mic:    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...|`|wQl4ZmfFaa	You could try using a radio to record your voice unto a cassette or a CD. if you dont have a stero. hope this helps.
475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	They are pretty good but not great.  If you are taking a movie of someone speaking, just make sure the camera (and it's mic) are close to the person speaking.  This is especially important if there is a lot of background noise when you are recording.  If you are close and you are recording in a quiet place, the mic will work pretty well.
XfTJDY5Xaa	well it would be $399 from apple for the 8gb with no upgrade or new contract. it would be $299 for an upgrade and $199 for a new contract. go here for more info...http://www.apple.com/iphone/buy/
eqLFfXfyaa	You have to sign a contract with AT&T.|`|HUAYinN7aa	No, you have to sign a two year with ATT, not apple, for the discounted price. SUCKS!|`|mrrVtKGgaa	Yes you have to have a contract|`|VoFlHxfcaa	well actually i have one and my mom just got one today umm u have to have a contract with att and with itunes/apple but not like a signed one.    and ok u know how the person who wrote this question has a heart in her username well how do u get that?|`|AA12025153	yes..for that deal you must sign up for whatever contract they are running the offer on..  sorry    I have been through similiar situations myself..  the price is just to reel you in so they want you to "need" the phone, but wont let you leave without a 2 year contract, maybe even longer|`|28DgExqWaa	you do not have to have contract to buy the iphone it is cheaper if you get a contract|`|F38x6SRdaa	You need to make a contract for the iphone to use its capabilities.|`|UgDOkQKKaa	no, you can just stick with att|`|HiuDxdlOaa	contract with ATT..not apple|`|QruXkDncaa	no.
Fb11LZdOaa	DON'T LISTEN TO xb0x1ive  Everyone I know has said the screen is stuffed so don't get the blackberry storm or whatever =)  I'm thinking of getting the Sidekick =) People say its good and you can access internet on it and stuff. Plus wouldn't it be easier to type text messages? If you have every letter? And way more =)  Hope I helped =)|`|NFUJAOtTaa	nooooooooooo get the storm by verison its the best phone|`|AA11301803	If you've got 300 bucks buy the new G3. I assume you use T mobile...|`|bGPLzUrlaa	No cause the lx is better and on tmobile website the sidekick 2008 is 100 dollars..you could wait till this summer ( or earlier before that) cause tmobile coming with better phone like the g2 and more sidekicks|`|cUpwcxjraa	I would suggest you to get the LX rather than Gekko. You can also get the Samsung Behold if you like touchscreen. If you want one unlocked, you can mail me or talk with me on Yahoo!
RpCwfcRzaa	20 GB don't sell for $60 in stores. If you bought one for that price, you got ripped off. The 20s are obsolete now so they sell for cheaper. $150 is a very reasonable price for a used Arcade 360.
otjzCZm3aa	Try and find the person who purchased the Zune and hope they have the receipt i dont buy from best buy often so i dont know if they will take back products which have items missing from them if they dont well im not sure what to do sorry and with the software issue try downloading 2.6 or something cause you may need to update you might not need to download the exact software for the Zune.    and this link may help you  http://www.download3k.com/MP3-Audio-Vide...|`|iRF1ztFyaa	It isn't necessary to use a Zune 2.5 with 2.5 software. You can download the 3.0 software and use that to upgrade the Zune from 2.5 to the latest version (3.1).|`|NLxcfGplaa	The person who bought it for you used a credit card online maybe they could look up the card info and find the reciept that way.  Just take the headphones back the way they are and maybe they wont notice.
DZzBfzVeaa	Yes, on the iphone you will get internet no matter where you are becuase you are on the network that your paying for to have the phone on.|`|Jj30buLMaa	yes but it will be costing you money as it will be over 3G or EDGE depending on your model.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	As long as you have the data plan through your cellular provider and have a signal you are able to access the internet.  If not, you will need to get a wireless router in order to use the internet at home.|`|5df7cc6f9f44cefe01289ac252d781e2aa	is this the first time you ever owned a cell phone?    internet on the phone was around looooooooong before phones were wifi enabled...
3UUipDwDaa	try using a different computer or a different cable. if you have time drop at the nearest apple store and have it checked. they can tell you if your ipod is still repairable or not. or maybe its already time for you get a new one.|`|1d9LTqBOaa	get a different cable and try using a wall adapter if you have one or an ipod dock and see if it charges. If you don't you may be able to get it to work with the computer. Try using a friend's cable to plug it into your computer to diagnose the problem. If itunes doesn't sense it, your port on your ipod may be broken and that is unrepairable.
AA11301803	Yes usually you can transfer numbers! The only time I coulnd't was when I went from a pay as you go plan to a regular plan.
CKRfaRYvaa	First, figure out which carrier most of your friends/family have.  This will help you decide which plan will work for you, because carriers like Verizon and AT&T offer prepaid plans with unlimited innetwork calling.  For the best coverage, I recommend Verizon.
zj1x2sdYaa	I have been unable to find one but there is hope Verizon will supposedly unlock the GPS on a the Omnia in the first half of 2009.
cUpwcxjraa	Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 is much much better than the Apple iPhone 3G. You can compare them with their features.|`|wXo9QiEYaa	definately iphone
wvkk0Xpvaa	The answer to this is simple.... There was a new Xbox live Update today 2/3/08.....  Xbox 360 Live Update 2/3/09 - February 3, 2009  As some of you might already know, as soon as you sign into Xbox 360 today, 2/3/09, you will be prompted to download the latest update.    What is this Update?    The update addresses the issue that a few people were having with audio and their HDMI connection. This update will be mandatory for all Xbox LIVE members around the world.      Simply logon to xboxlive on your Other xbox to get the update as well..|`|1WgOj89kaa	It updates as soon as you turn the console on.
AA11045021	You could get a Wii LAN Adapter. It's about $25 bucks and should be sold and your nearest electronic retailer. It's actually much faster than Wifi.|`|KfkmB4X2aa	Yea there's an adapter.|`|jKc7aDCwaa	It's the "Wii USB LAN Adapter" although, you can get a wireless router for about the same price.
3xXIKcMOaa	Depends on what games you like better.   Xbox has a TON of killing and war/shooting games.  PS3(which I vote for) has a bit more variety.     If you want a ps3, I would wait until April. They're going to drop the price about 100bucks. c:    That's when I'm getting one.  I have an 360Elite, but it's just collecting dust.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	Either    They have many pros and cons.    The PS3 hardware is better and it has a blueray player.    All that matters is the games. Whichever one has the most games you want to play is the one you should get.|`|qog4MvbOaa	Neither, it's called an opinion.   I'm getting sick and tired of this.   And when people say stuff like 'Xbox 360 has better games and graphics and the Ps3 is only good for movies' or 'Ps3 is way better and you it doesn't break down every month like 360' that's usually an indication that:   1. The person doesn't own the console.  2. You should ignore them.|`|3LPTLUczaa	For graphics, Xbox 360. Full low-down in the link.|`|FFuJ08vhaa	xbox|`|QIlhmWwBaa	i own both consoles and i play more my 360   but both consoles are pretty good|`|MoLQsZeXaa	ps3|`|ZKw46efXaa	PS3!!! 100000000%!    xbox is too noisy and the ps3 is blue ray!!|`|AA11168533	ive gone with ps3 there are lots of games and online is free|`|BUCwZYnzaa	360 it may be noisy but it is better|`|CKY0rZUXaa	Neither.    PC's are a hell of a lot better, and a lot less expensive!    You can upgrade your graphics card on your PC, whilst you have to buy a whole new console to get better graphics.     You can buy High Def (Blu-Ray) DVD players for Pc's, so they can play HD films.     You can buy more memory for your PC (like 1Tera bite Hard Disc Drives, which would store A LOT of games), and play these games without disks with the right websites.    Some people say there are no decent games out on PC, but they are lying. The gaming industry started with the PC, and epic titles such as "Command and Conquer" and "Deus Ex" started life as humble PC games.    There are a LOT more people to repair your PC than can repair your X-Box 360 or your PS3    And how many consoles can you play games on whilst pretending do your homework on it?    Costs:    Buy a 40 graphics card, some 20 DDR2 memory and, if you have a small HDD, a 1TB external Hard Disk Drive for 50 from Tesco's.  If you want to play Blue-ray DVDs, they cost approximately 150 and you will have to order an internal Blue Ray Player off the internet.    All of these will have to be installed by you, but are dead easy to install. (I've done it myself!) They all come with instructions, and will require an anti-static wrist strap, which you can pick up from PC world for a fiver.    Total cost of upgrade:    65 without HDD, 115 with External Hard Disk Drive and 265 with a Blue Ray player, or 215 without a HDD but with Blue Ray    The 115 is cheaper than an X-box 360, and the 265 is cheaper than a PS3!    Of course, if you don't have a Desktop PC, and have a laptop, then it will cost you a bit more.     299 more to buy the base unit, but with this PC you can remove the DDR memory from your list, and, depending on choice, the external hard drive, leaving you with a cost of:    344 without HDD, 394 with External Hard Disk Drive and 544 with a Blue Ray player, or 494 without a HDD but with Blue Ray.    But just remember, once you have upgraded the whole PC, then you only have to upgrade either the graphics card (about 40 each time) and/or the DDR Ram (20) to get all the benefits of the latest console, for a fraction of the cost!    Hope this helps!|`|8fqGySqQaa	Opinions matter. I think the Xbox is better only for the fact that I have used both and found the games a fewer but more playable. PS3 has loads of games but most are pretty awful.|`|NAZeTH0Maa	In my opinion PS3.The reason why is its more reliable it has a 0.002% chance of failing compared to 360's 33% failure rate.You should know by now about the 360's RROD problem so I shouldnt have to explain that.The PS3 also has a Blu Ray Player built in so you can watch movies in 720P-1080P resolutions and its TRUE HD unlike the 360 that upscales HD.The PS3 also utilizes Bluetooth technology which is far better than the 360's IR reciever because bluetooth cant be blocked by anything so you can operate your PS3 controller or Blu Ray remote in another room and your PS3 will still respond.The PS3 also has built in wifi so you can use the intenet right from your tv and play your PS3 games online totally free.The PS3 also has alot of great games to look forward to this year like Uncharted 2,God Of War 3,Tekken 6,Killzone 2 and Granturismo 5.I could go on all day about how the PS3 is a better choice but I think you get it by now.Go with the PS3.
LzSj90pbaa	Then check out the nokia n82. The xenon flash is a vast improvement over the led in the n95.  Or you could just go a little better and get the sony ericsson c905. 8mp camera with xenon flash.  And for the poster that talked about the tocca. Just because a camera is 5mp doesnt mean its good. 80% of it has to do with optics. the tocca has cheap optics, whereas the nokia n series run carl zeiss lenss.|`|ZKw46efXaa	dont get the tocca (samsung f480) camera is complete rubbish even though its meant to be 5mp!!!|`|7xwAxMvKaa	There is a motorola phone now that has a 5.0 megapixel kodak camera.

1HtTxOOQaa	DS3 is the newer one in which sony introduced the rumble feature back. DS3 also has 6 axis inbuilt and so is more expensive. Also, DS3 feels a little more heavier than the 6 axis and so feels much more better in the hand.    I bought a DS3 controller and can't imagine how I could have lived without it for such a long time. Vibration is great and also the heavier controller fits so well. Playing FPS is especially fun on the DS3.    Yes a PS2 controller can work on a PS3. It looks something like this(see link). I got an even cheaper one for 4$ and works well. It has a USB port so just pop it into the USB slot.|`|nbG4pGEyaa	1. It's wireless  2. It's motion sensing - some games require this controller|`|HekFanRvaa	DS3 is also a SIXAXIS (DS2)  but with rumble. DS3 is more expensive.    Yes, PS2 controller works with PS3 (I have a logitech PS2 wireless controllers that I use on my PS3). buy you need you but a Ps2 to PS3  adapter. It's only $10.|`|1WgOj89kaa	It hasnt got any wires  On games Like Gran Turismo 5, you can use it to steer.|`|raEUval8aa	There are no wired controllers for the Playstation 3, all are wireless. And the PS3 comes with a DualShock 3 controller.    A Dualshock 3 controller has both motion sensing capabilities as well as an advanced form of vibration (for example, if you get shot in the left side of your body in-game. the left side of the controller vibrates.)      No.
lebKMTaQaa	Just plug it in to any USB port, whether it is on the PS3, computer, TV, whatever. The 4 lights on the controller will start to blink, when they stop it is fully charged.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Plug it via USB into anything with an electrical charge, like TV, PS3 etc|`|raEUval8aa	If you have a USB cable, you plug one end into your PS3, and one end into the controller, and the controller charges.      The PS3 must be on, and you can play while charging.
3K1QW7Oeaa	That is pretty much up to you.    I was lucky to have TWO IPODS that have lasted me THREE YEARS (and STILL GOING!)|`|uftgjEqWaa	well that all depends on how abusive you are to it.  Ipods are usually really durable.  I am convinced that my 2nd gen nano is indestructible.  I don't know anyone that has broken theirs yet mostly because touches are relatively new.  I'd say 'bout 3 years if you are kinda-sorta nice to it.|`|NLxcfGplaa	I don't know but hopefully a really really really long time!!!

AA10631868	Product Specifications:  HP w1707  Model Number w1707  Cabinet Color Black/Silver  Panel Technology TN  Screen size (diag.) 17"  Native Resolution 1440x900  Aspect Ratio 16:10  Response Time (typ.) 8ms  Response Time (g-g) Unknown  Display Colors (max.) 16.7 m  Brightness (typical) Unknown  Contrast Ratio (typical) 600:1  Pixel Pitch 0.255 mm  Display Connections DVI, VGA  DVI Modes DVI-D  Component Modes -  HDCP Yes  Internal Scaling Unknown  Viewing Angle (H/V) Unknown  Warranty 1 year  Speakers Yes  Additional Ports No  Additional Features Wall Mount     OK, what you need to know first is, if the screen has HDCP, and YES, this model does, so the PS3 will work on this screen. Another detail that you need to know is if the screen will give you full HD? This one will NOT, because it's maximum resolution is only 1440x900, which is enough for 720p HD, but not enough to give full 1080p HD resolution. Basically, it means your screen will work for 720p but 1080p can be selected on the PS3, without it actually giving native full HD graphics. The price for one screen of this type is half what you said, unless you buying two. The screen is good for gaming. I would advise you get the best PC LCD - Viewsonic. Get a 22" model with full HD support or any model above 22" size, as it will definitely have full 1080p native support.|`|HekFanRvaa	native resolution is only 900x1400 (not HD)  and only costs $200.. are you buying 2?
qvl3PjdEaa	I think the idea is, get yourself a 20gig drive and some controllers if your not that much of a gamer.    The newer arcades and premiums have HDMI also. The component vs HDMI is not noticeable. I have seen and read of tests where identical systems and TVs have been used and the only difference is, for the picky, I want the best type of person, is the blacks can be slightly better. But that is - as they put it " if you are looking for irregularities and you put your face to the screen.    You will be able to play 1080p when you get your TV and component will look just as good! The Xbox 360 does support it. I will say remember if your new TV doesn't have component input get a new console.    Enjoy|`|klOl7Q6Laa	i just read an article saying that even with the elite xbox's they are still having problems with the rrod. I would wait a little or research it really well.|`|I6zUkFtfaa	If you just want the HDMI port, the newer Arcade and Pro systems now have HDMI ports. The HDMi cable will give you true 1080p resolution if your TV supports it; the component cables support only 1080i, so its really down to personal preference if the difference between interlanced and progressive scan picture will be worthwhile to you. Personally, I have the old premium system and run a component cable, and Im pretty happy with the picture quality on my TV through 1080i.|`|1QgZrHcVaa	If you are not a big gamer, just get the hard drive.  Its the same thing and not worth wasting the money on the elite. you'll be spending about 100 on the hard drive  and the elite.. doesnt that go for almost 400?? 399 i believe.  I have the arcade version, only cost me 199, and then we got the hard drive so it came out to 299. so much better =D   with the elite, your only paying for that 20 gig hard drive. so. same thing, only cheaper =D|`|RLIIhxDhaa	If you are buying a 360 get the premium/pro 60gig model it's the best of all the options available.    I am not sure if they are available yet, however, the latest versions of the XBox are based on a motherboard system code named 'Jasper' these versions run with less heat problems and are supposedly free of the RRoD (Red Ring of Death) problems beset by earlier models.    Check for the 12v symbol on the packaging.     20 gig HD is ok if you do not wish to install any games, it'll be find for added content and downloading demos thought.
RDcwT7YEaa	This is your lucky day. My husband and I decided to get a new tv for our bedroom as our present to each other. I was like you. I knew nothing about these new high tech tvs fortunately I did have an unlimited  amount of time to spend on the internet checking them out.    First thing I learned is the size example 32" is top left corner to bottom right corner of the entire TV which simply means the screen is smaller by about 5" smaller. So 32" TV the screen which is what you really want because that is what you going to be seeing is 27". So pay close attention to what it says remember they are talking Diagonal measurements!! No horizonal and width    The other thing that is important If you have a wall unit or any area that you are putting the TV so it has to be certain dimension take a tape measure with you so you can make sure it will fit. A fraction of an inch will mean it fits or don't. Learned that the hard way!!    LCD vs Plasma - Get LCD the Plasma is very fragile in more than one way. The most important to me because I pause what I am watching often because there will be something or someone that can't wait for a commercial or watching something with no commercials also if you are going to have a game system you use on it with a plasma if you leave it paused for more than a very very few minutes it will get a "ghost" embedded in the screen.  Remember LCD    Specifications - when comparing TVs apples to apples, Now this is the mind blowing totally confusing part. So here's the short version  1)  HDTV vs SDTV - simply put get HDTV    2) HDTV Tuner vs HDTV Monitor - Get built in HDTV Tuner other wise you will need a converter box     3) More Inputs the better because you will be using satallite or cable,   DVD player, home entertainment system, game systems. you get the idea.    4) Salesmen work on Commision     These are basic Need to Know Facts but believe me there is so much more. After many hours of research     I got the Vizio VW32L at Wal-Mart for 409.00.  Great value, you get more bang for your buck.I found it easy to install (my husband did not but he would'nt listen to me)LOL.    Go to www.Visio.com to find out more about the one I got and the others that they have.

He also said for 40" and down he recommends LCD TV's and all i can say is i'm very pleased with the price and my TV but must tell you that i'm no expert just a consumer.
ysiE6IDjaa	The "intended" play resolution for Madden is still 800x600. At higher resolutions, you get the mismatch of sharp and detailed players overlaid by low resolution 2D elements such as the button icons and playbook menus.  Madden will look like an early PS2 release because the engine is DX8-based and uses hardly any pixel shaders. The minimum supported card is a NVIDIA GeForce 3 or ATI Radeon 8500, and while that was fine three years ago, these days that indicates a museum-grade graphics engine.|`|ykXzzx65aa	Cuz u have a shitty laptop|`|9CHsxrJFaa	idk maybe because they are crap|`|d9yyKVThaa	Prob need a new laptop.|`|AA10690306	Hate to tell you this but the copy protection EA uses causes a LOT of problems.  But what do you expect the SecuROM was written for(and owned by) SONY.    Oh and the SecuROM puts a rootkit on your computer, replaces microsoft valid drivers with SecuROM drivers and causes drives to crash if you try to uninstall it.    Google SecuROM, problems|`|9AR6B4ELaa	its either your laptop screen or the graphic card s**ks|`|joQ6cZ5Maa	The reason that many games and not just EA look like "crap" on any laptop is that many games do not support laptop chip sets. It states this on the box.     As for Madden, someone stated that it is to be played at 800x600, and I personally believe that as when I play it on my desktop, there are so many graphic errors.     On a side note, you have a good laptop, just need more ram.

fGRuRzrlaa	in short, search "redsn0w" on goolge or something, i used it and it works fine.      HOWEVER, I do NOT recommend doing it yet. it takes quite a chunk of time, and is HIGHLY complicated. If you are unfamiliar with using cmd, i would wait.  you have to do what is referred to as a "tethered" jailbreak...i don't know what it means exactly, but i know that if you turn your ipod completely off (not just screen-locked) you have to hook it up to a pc just to get it to boot again.    Like i said, i did it, and it works. definately worth it if you know what you are doing. The dev team is currently working on a better exploit for it, that will allow it to boot, i would recommend waiting for that, if you can that is.

dVK7E5Kiaa	Hi, I suggest you use online faxing solutions (http://onlinefaxfree.net/). They are a GREEN choice because you don't waste paper and not to mention the headaches of paper jams, ink and paper expenses you have to bear with fax machines.    With online faxing you DON'T need a fax machine, or complicated installation. If you have a computer with internet access then you are ready to fax and you can fax to any fax number in the world.    Plus, you can filter out all that SPAM and only get the faxes you need. Plus you will also get a FREE local or toll free fax number.    Also, did you know that a fax machine is the most energy consuming office machine? However, with online faxing you can send AND receive faxes 24/7 without increasing your electricity bill. Plus these services will give you a free local or toll free number among other features offered.    You should take advantage of their 30 day free trial where you can test drive their service and then see if it is what you need.    I made the switch over the online faxing last year and I've save thousands on electricity bills, paper and ink expenses. It is so much easier, if you know how to send an email then you know how to fax online.    Check out the source below, pick the service you want to try and take it for a test with their 30 day free trial! Hope this information helps!|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	You simply plug it to a phone outlet and to a power outlet.

Wdp3HuuMaa	A tiny little electric motor with a small weight on the side so it doesn't spin evenly.|`|v1A9lxuzaa	contrary to popular belief it isn't actually an electric motor (they use too much electricity). Inside your phone is a small self-contained nuclear fission generator that activates when a small current is passed through it (0.000154 volts). This causes it to open up a tiny parallel universe inside your phone that contains nothing but michael j fox clones. The resulting tremors are what causes your phone to vibrate. Hope that helps.|`|AA11264416	i saw it on TV not to long ago, its a very small electric motor thats unbalanced|`|5yZxxeyPaa	Good Question!!
5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	Visit the very fun Canon camera museum to see how camera technology progressed over the years.  You can learn a lot from that website.  Many of the worlds most popular manual cameras have been serviced or CLA = clean, lubed, adjusted, light seals replaced look for them & many are sold dirt cheap.  If your taking a photography class you will need a manual SLR that has a detachable lens, hot shoe, adjustable, aperature,shutter & ISO settings.  Pentax K-1000 was a very popular & famous manual camera & a pure joy to use.  Some SLR's are a mixture of automatic & manual functions but not totally manual they were made for convenience. Do your research before buying.  Technically the Canon T-50 is an SLR  that has program, battery check & off with a high quality detatchable lens.  Point & shoot cameras have a built in lens that cannot be removed.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	The Olympus AM 100 is a point and shoot camera. What you need is an SLR. What makes a camera an SLR?    1. When you look through the viewfinder you are seeing through the lens on the camera. This is done by having a mirror in the camera body that reflects light up through a pentaprism to the viewfinder.    2. Will have a mirror. The reflex part of SLR. When you press the shutter the mirror flips up or reflexes out of the way and the shutter opens to expose the film or sensor.    3. Will have interchangeable lenses.    4. Will allow you complete control over the exposure. Manual settings    Check the links to see some examples of SLR cameras that would be good for your class. I recommend you purchase from Craigslist so that you can check the camera out first but there are lots on Ebay. Any Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta or Olympus will be fine.     http://cgi.ebay.com/Nikon-F65-N65-QD-Dat...    http://cgi.ebay.com/Canon-EOS-Rebel-Ti-3...    http://cgi.ebay.com/Minolta-Maxxum-7000-...|`|EExti2yKaa	SLR cameras are not point-and-shoot cameras; cameras like the Canon EOS 5D are, they require more equipment.

You should contact your school and ask what type of camera will be used in your course.  Often when they ask you to bring a 35mm SLR they mean a film camera.  Other courses will let you choose between digital SLR or film (or the option of bringing both). Best you make sure.
maLzjlgXaa	If it is a wired controller, you should just be able to plug it into an available USB port. The computer should recognize the hardware and download the necessary drivers for it.

j3gWgonpaa	I just got the one in Onyx and I ABSOLUTELY love this phone. the music player on it is really good if that's one of the main reasons you're considering getting it. it's really easy to sync if you have windows media player (that's what I have, so idk about any other players) and the sound quality on it is pretty good. I listen to some of my music with the windows down in the car and i can still hear well. The only thing is you have to get some sort of adapter if you want to put headphones on with it. I'm considering getting rid of my ipod because the music player is so good. I've had mine since Tuesday and I've only had to charge it once if you don't consider when I first charged it. I got used to the keys pretty quickly and that's probably because I have little thumbs. :]|`|28DgExqWaa	the phone is a very good phone  it has a full keyboard and it has fast internet also

QE71sNC3aa	Sounds like a pretty good match...    That particular Yamaha is a budget receiver and not the most powerful. The 100 watt RMS power is measured at one frequency (1khz) instead of from (20Hz-20KHz), no distortion number is given at that 100 watts, measurement not taken with all channels driven (they would boast it in the specs if it was)....    The total power of 500 watts from 20Hz - 20kHz is probably the most telling spec. It means that it probably puts out a maximum of 100 watts per channel (20Hz - 20kHz) with all channels driven and the true RMS power rating ( 20Hz - 20kHz, not just at 1 KHz with one channel driven) is probably closer to 60 watts per channel RMS with 100 watt peaks.    Like I said... it would be a good match. The JBLs are plenty efficient. But, you won't have enough power to play the speakers quite as loudly as they're capable of. If you start to hear distortion, turn the volume down. That's your amplifier running out of power and producing clipping distortion that will damage speakers.    If you want to play the speakers as loudly as they're capable of playing...  you'd need a pricier receiver with a TRUE 100 - 120 watts RMS rating. Look for output being tested from 20Hz - 20kHz with a distortion number (THD) under 1%.  Look for output that was tested with all channels driven.This would give you a true 100 watts RMS per channel with peaks right around the 175 watts your speakers will handle. Again... if you hear your amp starting to clip (distort)... turn down the volume to save your speakers.

pZGLhV2Waa	For under $200 your choice is the kit lens or the newer kit lens the 18-55mm IS $170. From what I hear the IS version is a great improvement over the original 18-55mm lens.   Your only other choices in that size range are the EFs 18-55mm F2.8 $1,000, EFs 17-85 $450 or the EF 17-40 F4L $700.    http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/51...|`|5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	You can easily use a smaller lens because some sensors in digital cameras make a lens act more powerful than it really it.

You can get one for about $300 used and into the $400's new. The canon 28-135 is a little bigger, a little more range, and the same price.
XfTJDY5Xaa	well to me it sounds like a power issue. is it possible that the dvd player was on or plugged in during a power surge or just a bad storm? It could also be the outlet you are using. try using a completely different outlet in a completely different room. is the dvd player still under store or manufacturer warranty? try contacting sanyo. i actually tried to look up contact info for you but didn't have any luck. try checking that the inside may not be clogged with dust. especially the disc tray as well as any areas that allow venting or air to move in and out the unit.
q0ErVj1Daa	Carbon was a great game for Gamecube. I would get the Gamecube version of Carbon and play it on your Wii with a Gamecube controller.     Or get Undercover for Wii. It's not as good as the 360 version but still a good game.
oQdsvzmtaa	My guess is that you cannot fix this. Typically this sort of "black screen" result happens from failed hardware inside the camera. It could be a motherboard failure, causing the images not to be processed in the camera, it could be a sensor failure causing the images not to record at all, or it could be a failure of the interface to write the image data to the card. In any event, the solution is to contact a Sanyo service center. It probably won't pay to fix the problem, but some companies offer substantial discounts on replacement products. For instance, we had a Canon fail in a similar way and they provided a later generation replacement of the camera at about 67% off retail.

3xXIKcMOaa	Thirteen girl? You'd probably enjoy the wii more.   Just because xbox has a lot more killing and brutal, gory, epic games then the wii would.    Especially if you are going to be getting Mario Cart for Wii. (Which is insanely good) Wii has a load of good Mario titles out, and even coming out soon!    From what I've seen, Xbox's are mainly geared for early twenty year old guys who like to yell at each other over xbox live. haha.    As another side note, Wii is really great for people who enjoy having others over and playing group games, while Xbox is seriously for die-hard war fighters who mostly like to play games alone.     I suggest you do a bit of research before you spend a load of money on such a big purchase. c: Find out what games you seem to like more, and the pros and cons of each system.      Edit: You really don't "NEED" an Xbox360. x_x' It can play movies. woopee? So does my dvd player and PS2.

Stick with the wii.  Currently the Nintendo wii is the best selling console out of all of them which means there will be way more games developed for it than the others.|`|RpCwfcRzaa	It depends on what kind of games you like. If you like more casual games like those mostly on the Wii, it's pointless to get a 360. Although the 360 has a lot of casual games too, it has mostly more hardcore games and shooters. It can do a lot more than just play DvDs and the graphics are 20 times better than the Wii's, but if you're not sure if you'll like the games, stick with the Wii.
epaT3Jpxaa	If it is a cannister of 35mm film there is usually a tab of film to pull if it is unused - for the user to feed it into a spool in the camera. Normally, if it has already been used the tab will have been wound back into the cannister.    If you double expose, the pics will probably overlap each other and the two images will be confused onto one another, not to mention overexposure in many parts. Either way, exposed already or not, the likelihood is that the old film will also be skewed in its colors - which is quite popular in some circles.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	If the film isn't sealed in the original box, you might as well get it developed, and not risk ruining the pictures that might already be there.|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	Look for some sure signs of use-    The pack must be open,   The film leader (a small part of film that always sticks out in a new pack) might be in the cartiridge  The end of the leader might show signs showing extreme bending which used to happen in many manual SLR's  There might be linear marks near the sproket holes due to pull.    Only sure sign of a new film is -  Unopened pack !    If you want more information, you can simply ask you dad. He might be remembering it.    Since the film already expired and you don't know the status of it, it's better to buy a new roll and use it.    Ask your dad if you want to get the roll developed. If he wants to throw it away, pull the whole film out in the sunlight (and expose it fully) and then throw it away.

The ipod is designed to work with and be the slave to itunes on the computer to which its paired.    If you do not pair a ipod to a computer you cannot alter its settings.    If you pair your ipod to a new computer it overwrites what's on it.    Simply dragging music onto an ipod does NOT make that music playable it then acts as hard disk. To make the music playable you MUST use itunes to sync with it as only itunes can put the music files in the correct file names (not the same as on the computer) in hidden folders and create the hidden indexes for them to be playable.    When you pair the ipod to a computer it erases ALL the previous library and tracks and replaces it with what the current computer want it to.    if you want to erase the ipod you select RESTORE form the ipod's tab in itunes then it re formats and re installs the ipods firmware resetting everything to default values and removing the lock (except for the touch which asks for the code to allow this)    the ipod needing a master player to sync with is NOT unique to apple Creative, Zune, Sony al have one of one sort or another.      syncing with more than one PC is not possible as the ipod is a slave device that can only pair and sync to one PC at a time. syncing with another over-writes what was there form the last one!    Why do people assume that the ipod is a music backup system - its NOT!    the Master files are on the computer in the itunes library and you really need to back these up directly.  Thats NOT they way its designed to work the ipod is a slave device to ONE itunes only although itunes can have many ipods. When you PAIR an iPod with a computer it erases all songs on it!!! and deletes pairing with original computer.    Sharing music is also illegal!    You cannot transfer music from an ipod to itunes as Itunes is the MASTER location of the music files. if you NEED to transfer music form your ipod to the computer as you have lost the original you need a 3rd party application (I use Yamipod for mac) but a whole range can be found on www.versiontracker.com and enter ipod transfer in the search box under your operating system.    I suggest copying the contents of the "iTunes Music" folder on your old computer onto the new one by USB hard disk, USB Flash memory or DVD-r    once you have the utility installed run it and close itunes! connect the ipod (if itunes starts up and asks if you want to pair say NO and close itunes again). then with the utility transfer the songs form the ipod to your hard disk.    Then disconnect the ipod, START itunes... drop the files you have just transferred onto the itunes Library and once the files have been copied into the library you can delete the originals (NEVER MOVE or touch the itunes folder on your computer otherwise you will lose the music let itunes manage it for you).    Now reconnect the ipod and when it asks pair say YES and it will transfer the music to your computer.    if doing this with 2 computers you have to do this on both!!|`|Mz1I71gVaa	Umm i think you can just tick all the songs you want to put on it...not sure though|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	i think you can sink it with another pc as a guest,it will ask you what you want sinked...you chose.|`|MoLQsZeXaa	you might lose all the songs that are on the ipod part of the phone.  i you will also lose apps i think       and i also dont think it is possible to drag songs. but you can authorise different pcs but i dont think ths will be very helpful in your case|`|DjSQZO7Saa	With the ipod touch if you do a full sync it will erase all.. but if you just make a manual connection you can drag and drop songs from other computers but when you plug into your home computer and have an automatic sync.. it will erase the stuff from the other computers.. so you have to keep it on manual for all computers to get it to work|`|AA10661753	If you synch to another PC - you will lose anything that doesn't exist on the 2nd pc.

Seems like you're not sure, and just need someone to type an essay to get you "up to speed." No one wants to sit here and type for a couple of hours - there are simply too many products on the market right now.

All the other specs you mentioned are less important.|`|4fWZL4TRaa	I guess you are talking electrolytic capacitor because you mention ESR. Without knowing what the purpose is and what specs you cannot match, it is hard to say, isn't it? If it is a filter in a switch mode it may be fussy about ESR. A lower ESR should be better though. Obviously physical size and voltage are essential matches. Temperature/lifetime is not so important if the operation is not demanding as in a hot environment. For actual capacitance, it is common for capacitors to allow a lower value by no more than 10%, but the capacitance may sometimes be high by >200%. Similarly the replacement can be higher in value for most situations, but not much lower.

6fAZfZ74aa	okay, plug your ipod into her computer and when itunes comes up with do you want to erase and sync, obviously click no. go onto your ipod, and check the box that says enable disk use, and click apply. now go into my computer, click on your ipod, and go to tools in the menu bar, folder options, view tab, under hidden files and folders click, show hidden files and folders. right, now click on the see through itunes folder that appears. click on the music folder, and there should be loads of folders named F01, F02 . . . now go back and drag the music folder into itunes, or highlight all the folders and drag them. if that doesn't work, in itunes click file, add to library and choose the music folder. this will add your songs to her library, without messing up your ipod, or her itunes. i hope this helps. x|`|8serxyLuaa	you can put your music onto your friend's ipod from your computer ( you cannot directly transfer music from your ipod to hers).    Before you do that, once your friend's ipod is plugged in, open itunes.  When the itunes show the ipod's info there should be a list of options at the bottom that says: Open iTunes when this iPod is connected, Sync only checked songs and videos, Manually manage music and videos and Enable disk use.    MAKE SURE THAT THE BOX FOR Manually manage music and videos IS CHECKED. This is the only way your friend will not lose her music.    Once that is done. you can add your music to her iPod and the music she had on her iPod earlier will not be erased.    Hope that helped.|`|FX4obiYmaa	with itunes? no i dont think so.  when i tried to do it. it said something like, "this ipod is synced with another computer, if you sync with this computer, then all data will be lost on ipod." or something like that.  but maybe there is a program out there that can take the songs off the ipod and put it on your computer and then just re add em to your itunes, and that way her and your songs will be on there.|`|emDn2aQtaa	yes, just add your songs  to her music library.
HekFanRvaa	yup.. logitech wireless keyboards works better than any other keyboard.. yeah but they do work. Even mouse, or USB port hubs, etc.|`|AA10631868	Get a wired USB keyboard. It will definitely work. I don't think wireless will work, unless it's bluetooth enabled. And this could be a hassle to connect, if it should not be supported by the PS3's current firmware. Just get a USB keyboard and you should be good to go!|`|Y1XFYZxGaa	Hello     I i have ps3 myself and the trick is to use wired i know its anoyying but it works fine   also if on the keyboard packaging it says ps2 compatible it will work with the system   and mouses just use wired because wireless tends to play up with the PlayStation 3 console    Best Regards   darkgamer333|`|DyORD0Zkaa	yea logitech is better than getting a ps3 keyboard its tech is more advanced|`|LSXdwRDUaa	the logitech keyboard is well worth it about 60.00  and for the mouse just go with wire. since wireless could be a pain|`|1WgOj89kaa	Only with wired, not with wireless
BMConIedaa	DLP displays tend to be not very good for gaming, as they can introduce a noticeable lag between receiving the video signal, and displaying it.  Rhythm games, such as Rock Band or Guitar Hero, may very well be unplayable (unless they have a "HDTV calibration" setting in their options, but not all games do that).  I'm unsure about whether or not that would apply to the projector you specified, but as a rule, DLP and Plasma displays aren't as good for gaming as LCD displays.    Good projectors that are ideal for gaming tend to cost over $1000 (for a 720p/1080i-capable projector, a 1080p projector would probably cost considerably more).|`|HekFanRvaa	yeah but it won't be full HD.. max maybe 1080i but I'm thinking maybe up to 720p.

If you downloaded an album (like one you bought in a store or at a yard sale) and can't download right click a song, go to get info, there you go to artwork, and browse then take a pic of the album and click the pic and select open. you should have you pic as album artwork.

2yl8omcAaa	Umm, you cannot unlock the iphone without jailbreaking it first. That iphone is already jailbroken, the person who unlocked it prolly didnt installed the best "cydia and installer" application.    The speakers... try to plug the earphone back and forth do it for about 5-6 times. I repaired few of the iphones that have the speakers problem with just doing that. Re-lock it then unlock it again won't do anything to fix the speaker.

I'm pretty sure nothing shows up on the TV when you get it. Either way, you can't do anything with an RRoD 360, so does it matter?    Just tell Microsoft to hurry up and mail you a box.
J3kfQtViaa	Ok you need to clarify what kind of connection inputs your TV has.  You are hooking up the yellow , red white ps3 cord to the tv?  That is an av input and should work just fine on the tv.  You need to try to switch inputs or go down channels until you find the ps3.      If you still cant get the video working, the problem could be the tv.  or the cable or the ps3, but realistically it sounds like the tv.  You could get an rf converter to take it to the coax in.    On older tv's like that i remember stuff doing that though, sound and no picture.  Keep going down channels, from 1, and see if any of them work.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	if you go to radio shack you can but something kind of like a converter box except it has those white red and yellow plugs that the PS3 plugs into so then you will buy that and it will have an old cable that was meant to hook up to your old TV

You might get a wannabe though...and it won't be for a long time.|`|AA12323486	I asked at a Verizon store here, and they had no idea.  I'm hoping it will be available when my two years is up on my Centro.  It looks like a fun phone!|`|AA11091315	Amy B doesn't know what she's talking about. VZW always carries Palm's phones like the Treo and the Centro. The Centro was exclusively sold by Sprint when it first came out but it was picked up by both VZW and ATT. So, I'm thinking the chances of VZW getting the phone are pretty damn good! I can't wait for this one either.
5vOV8XVhaa	There is no way to get it tonight, but don't let her have her phone until she tells you. Also try stopping by the store where you got it tomorrow (like an alltel store or what not) Usually they can help. This is being very nice on your part. A cell phone is NOT a right, its a privilege, and if she won't be responsible, she shouldn't have one. Heck I didn't get a phone till I was almost 18, my brother didn't get his till he was 19. Your not doing anything wrong, your not being mean. Stick to your guns and win this battle.|`|Cdx4vjxuaa	No, there isn't. The point of a password is so nobody else will know, & I'm afraid this is no exception. If you're that concerned, you must let her know that you must monitor who she's talking to, & that the subjects are appropriate. With the whole texting thing, there's a lot of strange things that get sent & passed around. If she doesn't oblige, you do have the right to take her phone away until she cooperates.|`|RL1rXYb9aa	If you don't trust your daughter, then take her cellphone away until she tells you the password. You do have the power to shut it off don't you? Unless you have good reason to not trust her, don't look through her cellphone. Its her privacy whether shes texting a boy etc. And theres no way to filter what she hears and sees through her cellphone, she'll see it online, at school, on tv, everywhere else. Give up you can't hide the world from your kid.|`|2ykaeyFGaa	1. Beat down her door  2. Grab her Cell phone  3. Snap it in half|`|EtCRnDJMaa	People she is only 13.  Since when did 13 year ODs get privacy???    They're acting like she is 17 or 18 or 20!!!  She has no business doing this, she's 13!    I thnk if you forget what your password is you might be able to enter the phone number for the password.  If you cannot get it, then I would call your provider and tell them, they will help you through it.      If my daughter did this, I would ground her from her phone unless she's out and really needs it.  Tell her if she wants you to trust her then she can't be doing this.  After all, who pays the bill???   Tell her it's not HER phone to begin with, it's yours and you let her use/borrow it.      also: tell her she's not keeping anything from you by doing this, becasue you can look at the phone bill to see who calls her & who she calls.  Tell her it also shows text messages incomming & out going!!!  This will get her wondering!  But you can do this for calls in & out.      I can't believe the people who tell you not to look through her cell phone.  I'm not saying this is true, but what if she has naked pictures of one her friends she got from somebody psending them around at school?  Or some boy or her?  You could go to jail for child pornography.  This is serious!  So you have every right as a parent to look at and through her cell.  We do this because we love & want to PROTECT them, not to be FRIENDS with them.|`|UinOWcMUaa	hmm ? Do you pay the bill ? I think also you have allowed her enough freedoms as your daughter already and know you want to control all these things about her life ? If your that worried about her and sneaking her password, than maybe you shouldn't of given her the cell phone in the 1st place if you don't trust her. I think you need to relax on the control issues. Maybe if you want something out of her you should maybe just have a heart to heart and open up with her, than maybe she wouldn't have so much to hide from you !!!    Just a suggestion ....|`|LZYpkR9zaa	perhaps your being over protective...geez let her live a little...|`|AIJgbvIcaa	If you feel she is talking to bad people or doing bad things just take her phone.    If you have no reason to get into her phone stop being so overprotective|`|4BoteYDwaa	Pull a fast one on her, if she has a Sim card, take her phone to the service provider (AT&T, Verizon, etc.) tell them you accidentally locked the Sim card and need a new one. They will issue a new one or format the old one, they can also transfer all the numbers and data, but it will be unlocked. It will cost about $30 to do this (the cost of the Sim card). Before you give it back, put your own password in. Then she will be locked out, when ever you want. Her only being 13, I'm assuming the plan is in your name. You will need to tell them this when you have it done, make it clear that this is "your" phone.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Who is paying for this cell phone bill?  If you are you should be able to find that info out,. one way or another.  If you are and she refuses to give you that info, shut the d@&N thing off!  Good luck.    BTW:  Any "thumbs down" further proves my thoughts that teenagers are sneaky disrespectful, and have so much to hide, and also be in bed by now!  = )|`|TsSv1PGZaa	You are being WAY too overprotective.

2yl8omcAaa	Itunes..    Pick the song, highlight it -- right click -- get info -- options -- choose the best time of that song example start time = 0:20 end time would be 0:50 -- click ok    Make sure you have the convert set to mp3 format. Right click the same song again -- create mp3 version (if you do not have this option then you need to change it) GO TO -- EDIT -- Preferences -- General -- import settings -- Import using -- choose from the box and pick mp3 then click ok.    Now you should have the create mp3 version. itunes will then create a 30 sec of that song.     Check your music library and click time so you can see the duration.     NOW drag that song to your desktop. then just move it later to your ringtone folder..

As far as prepaids go, the only true value I know is from boost mobil.  With them, a $30 card = 300 minutes.  Plus w/ the bleep (walkie-talkie) feature at about  $1.50 it's a great deal -Well atleast if everyone else in your calling circle also has a bleep number,too (even non Boost customers).    Their basic phone runs about  $50 and the smaller flip phone about $ 80.     You can check out Boost's web site for more info on the phone.  They're available locally at  Target and Walmart. ( at least in my area-Central NJ)    if you want to compare this to the Trac fone check out their site and compare for urself.|`|5303eda801afee9607f5431c4432d090aa	prepaid phone|`|4ff941dcfe7bdf12fb08d124e7ff11eaaa	Tracfone is a prepaid phone company.Unlike other prepay companies they offer more minutes for a cheaper price.Tracfone kits and cards can be bought at: Wal-Mart,Target,K-Mart,and other retail stores.

UAYzLyN4aa	It'll say in the specs.     If a DVD player has full decoding for either AC-3 (dolby stereo) or DTS it will have six analog audio jacks on the back (L, R, Rear L and R, center, and sub) instead of just two.     Generally any modern home theater receiver will handle AC-3 and DTS. The new Dolby 7.1 lossless compressed format is less common.    Later:     > I doubt there is any DVD player made that DOESN'T   > decode Dolby Digital surround sound (and probably DTS).     Hm... I just checked the BestBuy site. There seems to be some confusion.     To me, "decoding" means that the player provides 6 analog outputs for the 5.1 channels. That is fairly uncommon. A few Denon players have 5.1 output jacks but they're very expensive.     The modern players most certainly pass the AC3 or DTS bitstream to their digital audio outputs - and that's all the Dolby Digital (= AC3) and DTS logos mean!  AC3 output is standard in DVD players. DTS isn't quite universal, but almost so.     But that is not "decoding" in my book.    Almost all of Best Buy's players do say that they "decode" DTS and AC3. However if you look at their back panels, they don't have 5.1 outputs; the specs also say "5.1 outputs - NO".     If you want ACTUAL "decoding" done by your player, it has to have 5.1 analog outputs on it, and that is fairly rare. What most players seem to be calling "decoding" is merely pass-through of the AC3 or DTS signal to coax or optical digital audio output jacks.     That Yamaha player you linked does not have 5.1 outputs. It does have AC3 and DTS passthru.     Actual decoding to analog in the DVD player was more common a few years ago when DVD players were relatively new and HT receivers that could decode AC3 and DTS were rare. But, HT receivers at the time could handle Dolby Surround (the old analog two-channel "surround sound" that was on VCR stereo audio tracks), and many of these had a 5.1 set of "direct" audio input jacks, in anticipation of future need. So you'd hook your DVD player, with decoder, to those jacks. Today though it's expected that your HT receiver can do the decoding, so today's DVD players just have the digital output jacks, and stereo audio (one pair only, L and R) for those who still need that.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Get the model number and look up the specs on the manufacturer's website.|`|AA11056614	Any A/V receiver (i.e. 5 or more amplifier channels)  made in the last 5-10 years will have decoders for DD, DTS, ProLogic and others.    That said, the front plates of the component almost always has a logo for each format it decodes (See 1st link for example logos). Some advanced components are so busy with logos they get very busy looking!    But the only sure way to know is to read the specifications for the component ... decoding formats will ALWAYS be listed.    Note that a few components can/have been updated via firmware to add additional capabilities so the firmware version may be need to be known to be absolutely sure.    Finally, note that even if a decoder is present the right type of signal must still be input to "trigger" the decoding to take place. This is done through settings accessible via the menu in either the source device (e.g. DVD player) or the target device (e.g  receiver).    Hope that helps.

1HtTxOOQaa	I seriously can't wait for it. The game looks so great. I think the only other game that comes near it is Crysis running on a high end PC. Also, the 360 crapbots were saying that graphics is not everything but gameplay matters. The game has been reviewed by so many sites and is yet to score less than 90%. This is a massive feat which no other game has been able to achieve. Not even MGS4 or Gears1/2 (no HALO cause it's a joke to even compare KZ2 to Halo) have got such a positive feedback.   The reviews also state that KZ2 is a mixture of COD4 gameplay and Crysis graphics which is a great compliment. It undoubtedly takes the best FPS title till date from COD4 and is a new benchmark to which future games(even Halo) will be compared.  I got the beta early last year and the amount of multiplayer modes simply blew my mind. Also, while playing online, there was little lag and the graphics remained identical to the campaign mode which is a remarkable  feat in itself.    This game is going to be huge. It's already the best selling game on ebay and amazon and the game isn't even out yet!!! There are more than a million pre bookings which didn't even happen when Halo was being launched.     Go to the below link to read many KZ2 review and ratings. Hope this even makes you more impatient to get the game!!!|`|KnXwXw4Raa	hahha why cant you wait for halo wars so you can burn your x box faster?|`|2c43cc35c9af40e61d674e54adf600d3aa	are you kidding me?

Vo6YukG2aa	What firmware do you have? It must be really outdated.  The jailbreak is next to shlt for the lower firmwares, seriously.    You need to go into iTunes and upgrade to firmware 2.2.  In the process of upgrading the firmware, the jailbreak will also be removed and since 2.2 comes with Appstore and Mail, you'll still have them.    If you don't wanna pay 10 bucks to do that, just plug in your iPod to iTunes and restore it to factory settings. I can't guarantee you'll have thouse two apps, though.

XIRqDfUpaa	What kind of sound card is it?  I do recall using my computer for recording my radio spots.  I went to Radio Shack (any music store or computer electronics store will do) and got an inexpensive adapter plug so that the larger plug would fit.    I used a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live at the time, but most sound cards should have the capability to do the same thing.  Basically, with the correct adapter, any analog audio input signal should work in the input jack.    If you are trying to capture your guitar input for editing or recording purposes, most of the friends I have who are recording artists, use something like "Band in a Box" "Cakewalk" and "Sonic Foundry" to make the best of their work.  These applications tend to be a bit pricey and are mostly for very serious artists, but from what I have seen they do the job well.    And no you are not crazy for trying to use MIDI input.  It's just an extra step and more equipment.  Many in-home music producers use some sort of external EQ device, mixer board, or synthesizer (or any combination of these) before the sound card to modify the sound.  But that is for the pros and they usually like to spend the cash for the optimal sound output.    Rock on son!|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Plugging into the audio port is easy, depending on your sound card you may need an adapter to for the cable.  What I cant figure out is how you could plug it into a MIDI port, they are just totally incompatible!    -EDIT IMPORTANT-  If your guitar has ACTIVE pickups (it requires a battery) rather than the standard PASSIVE pickups, then do not attempt to connect it to your sound card!|`|hcpNm5BDaa	yes|`|YtcLq3d5aa	Any audio program should have a direct in option. Just look for it.

c653b3a77dc0e540d73427c32600609baa	A histria da fotografia pode ser contada a partir das experincias executadas por qumicos e alquimistas desde a mais remota antiguidade. J em torno de 350 a.C., aproximadamente na poca em que viveu Aristteles na Grcia antiga, j se conhecia o fen?meno da produ??o de imagens pela passagem da luz atravs de um pequeno orifcio. Alhazen em torno do sculo X, descreveu um mtodo de observa??o dos eclipses solares atravs da utiliza??o de uma camara escura. A camara escura na poca, consistia de um quarto com um pequeno orifcio aberto para o exterior.    Em 1525 j se conhecia o escurecimento dos sais de prata, no ano de 1604 o fsico-qumico italiano ?ngelo Sala estudou o escurecimento de alguns compostos de prata pela exposi??o  luz do Sol. At ent?o, se conhecia o processo de escurecimento e de forma??o da imagens efmeras sobre uma pelcula dos referidos sais, porm havia o problema da interrup??o do processo. Em 1725, Johann Henrich Schulze, professor de medicina na Universidade de Aldorf, na Alemanha, conseguiu uma proje??o e uma imagem com uma dura??o de tempo maior, porm n?o conseguiu detectar o porqu do aumento do tempo. Continuando suas experincias, Schulze colocou  exposi??o da luz do sol um frasco contendo nitrato de prata, examinando-o algum tempo depois, percebeu que a parte da solu??o atingida pela luz do solar tornou-se de colora??o violeta escura. Notou tambm, que o restante da mistura continuava com a cor esbranqui?ada original. Sacudindo a garrafa, observou o desaparecimento do violeta. Continuando, colocou papel carbono no frasco e o exp?s ao sol, depois de certo tempo, ao remover os carbonos, observou delineados pelos sedimentos escurecidos padr?es esbranqui?ados, que eram as silhuetas em negativo das tiras opacas do papel. Schulze estava em dvida se a altera??o era devida  luz do sol, ou ao calor. Para confirmar se era pelo calor, refez a mesma experincia dentro de um forno, percebendo que n?o houve altera??o. Concluiu ent?o, que era a presen?a da luz que provocava a mudan?a. Continuando suas experincias, acabou por constatar que a luz de seu quarto era suficientemente forte para escurecer as silhuetas no mesmo tom dos sedimentos que as delineavam.O qumico su?o Carl Wilhelm Scheele, em 1777, tambm comprovou o enegrecimento dos sais devida  a??o da luz.    Thomas Wedgwood realizou no incio do sculo XIX experimentos semelhantes. Colocou expostos  luz do sol algumas folhas de rvores e asas de insetos sobre papel e couro branco sensibilizados com prata. Conseguiu silhuetas em negativo e tentou de diversas maneiras torn-las permanentes. Porm, n?o tinha como interromper o processo, e a luz continuava a enegrecer as imagens.    Schulze, Scheele, e Wedgewood descobriram o processo onde os tomos de prata possuem a propriedade de possibilitar a forma??o de compostos e cristais que reagem de forma delicada e controlvel  energia das ondas de luz. Porm, o francs Joseph-Nicphore Nipce o fisionotra?o e a litografia. Em 1817, obteve imagens com cloreto de prata sobre papel. Em 1822, conseguiu fixar uma imagem pouco contrastada sobre uma placa metlica, utilizando nas partes claras betume-da-judia, este fica insolvel sob a a??o da luz, e as sombras na base metlica. A primeira fotografia conseguida no mundo foi tirada no ver?o de 1826, da janela da casa de Niepce, encontra-se preservada at hoje. Esta descoberta se deu quando o francs pesquisava um mtodo automtico para copiar desenho e tra?o nas pedras de litografia. Ele sabia que alguns tipos de asfalto entre eles o betume da judia endurecem quando expostos  luz. Para realizar seu experimento, dissolveu em leo de lavanda o asfalto, cobrindo com esta mistura uma placa de peltre (liga de antim?nio, estanho, cobre e chumbo). Colocou em cima da superfcie preparada uma ilustra??o a tra?o banhada em leo com a finalidade de ficar translcida. Exp?s ao sol este endureceu o asfalto em todas as reas transparentes do desenho que permitiram  luz atingir a chapa, porm nas partes protegidas, o revestimento continuou solvel. Nipce lavou a chapa com leo de lavanda removendo o betume. Depois imergiu a chapa em cido, este penetrou nas reas em que o betume foi removido e as corroeu. Formando desta forma uma imagem que poderia ser usada para reprodu??o de outras cpias.    Niepce e Louis-Jacques Mand Daguerre iniciaram suas pesquisas em 1829. Dez anos depois, foi lan?ado o processo chamado daguerretipo.    Este consistia numa placa de cobre polida e prateada, exposta em vapores de iodo, desta maneira, formava uma camada de iodeto de prata sobre si. Quando numa camara escura e exposta  luz, a placa era revelada em vapor de mercrio aquecido, este aderia onde havia a incidncia da luz mostrando as imagens. Estas, eram fixadas por uma solu??o de tiossulfato de sdio. O daguerretipo n?o permitia cpias, apesar disso, o sistema de Daguerre se difundiu. Inicialmente muito longos, os tempos de exposi??o encurtaram devido s pesquisas de Friedrich Voigtl?nder e John F. Goddard em 1840, estes criaram lentes com abertura maior e ressensibilizavam a placa com bromo.    William Henry Fox Talbot lan?ou, em 1841, o caltipo, processo mais eficiente de fixar imagens. O papel impregnado de iodeto de prata era exposto  luz numa camara escura, a imagem era revelada com cido glico e fixada com tiossulfato de sdio. Resultando num negativo, que era impregnado de leo at tornar-se transparente. O positivo se fazia por contato com papel sensibilizado, processo utilizado at os dias de hoje.    O caltipo foi a primeira fase na linha de desenvolvimento da fotografia moderna, o daguerretipo conduziria  fotogravura, processo utilizado para reprodu??o de fotografias em revistas e jornais.

Este tipo de fotografia ficou conhecido como Daguerretipo.    Mas a primeira fotografia foi feita por um outro francs chamado Joseph Nicphore Niepce em 1826, com uma tcnica que ele denominou de heliografia, que usava uma placa de estanho coberta com um derivado de petrleo chamado betume da Judeia.

e928c8df417d1e1b41580aaec5c3bca2aa	Microondas (tambm designadas SHF- Super High Frequency) s?o ondas electromagnticas com comprimentos de onda maiores que os dos raios infravermelhos, mas menores que o comprimento de onda das ondas de rdio variando, consoante os autores, de 30 cm (1 GHz de frequncia) at 1 cm (30 GHz de frequncia).    Nota: acima dos 300 GHz, a absor??o da radia??o eletromagntica pela atmosfera da Terra  t?o grande que a atmosfera  praticamente opaca para as freqncias mais altas, at que se torna novamente transparente na, assim chamada, "janela" do infravermelho at a luz visvel.    Gera??o    Para a gera??o de microondas podem ser utilizados transistores de efeito de campo (FET: Field Effect Transistor), transstores bipolares, diodo Gunn e diodo IMPATT, entre outros. Dispositivos a vlvula , ou vlvulas termi?nicas, por exemplo: magnetron, o klystron, o TWT e o gyrotron.    Usos        * Um forno de microondas usa um gerador de microondas do tipo magnetron para produzir microondas em uma freqncia de aproximadamente 2,45 GHz para cozinhar os alimentos. As microondas cozinham os alimentos, fazendo com que as molculas de gua e outras substancias presentes nos alimentos vibrem. Esta vibra??o cria um calor que aquece o alimento. J que a maior parte dos alimentos organicos  composta de gua, este processo os cozinha facilmente.      * Microondas s?o usadas nas transmiss?es para um satlite de comunica??es, porque as microondas atravessam facilmente a atmosfera terrestre, com menos interferncia do que ondas mais longas. Alm disso, as microondas permitem uma maior largura de banda do que o restante do espectro eletromagntico.      * O Radar tambm usa radia??o em microondas para detectar a distancia, velocidade e outras caractersticas de objetos distantes.      * Redes Locais sem-fio, tais como Bluetooth, WIFI, WIMAX e outros usam microondas na faixa de 2,4 a 5,8 GHz. Alguns servi?os de acesso  Internet por rdio tambm usam faixas de 2,4 a 5,8 GHz.      * TV a cabo e Internet de banda larga por cabo coaxial, bem como certas redes de telefonia celular mvel, tambm usam as freqncias mais baixas das microondas.      * Microondas podem ser usadas para transmitir energia a longas distancias e, aps a 2a Guerra Mundial, tm sido realizadas diversas pesquisas para verificar essas possibilidades. A NASA realizou pesquisas, durante os anos 1970/80, sobre o uso de Satlites de Energia Solar que captariam as emiss?es solares e as retransmitiriam para a superfcie da Terra por meio de microondas.      * Um maser  um dispositivo semelhante ao laser, exceto pelo fato de que trabalha na faixa das microondas, em lugar da luz visvel.|`|a4f39e71bbe01d4f33446cedf3553804aa	Te deram um monte de informa??es tecnicas mas te esqueceram de dizer que as microndas s fazem efeito no liquidos, corpos solidos sem liquido (secos) detro do microndas n?o fazem efeito algum e que na realidade dentro do aparelho a grosso modo existe um gerador de alta frequencia que produz uma vibra??o sonora de altissima frequencia e que essa vibra??o ao entrar em comttao com as moleculas dos corpos liquidos fazem com que elas se agitem chocando-se umas com as outras (e como vc sabe na fisica quando os atomos se movimentam eles desprendem calor.)  s isso|`|9dd3a55e4b99a8df2e1d1b669c35b637aa	O nome j diz,micro ondas ( uma freqncia)elas que retiram as partculas de liquidas do produto e ai neste movimento aquece.|`|2193b6d4a0c5918d2783dc2551c5acf2aa	em poucas palavras, as ondas sonoras fazem com que as molculas se esfreguem umas as outras, por fric??o elas se esquentam|`|da26f884a5b9794fbdbc214bbcc70bd7aa	Fa?a assim: coloque um prato com comida ou um copo com bebida dentro do micro ondas, feche a porte, programe o tempo de aquecimento necessrio, aperte o bot?o que aciona o aquecimento e aguarde o trmino.

Mediante o processo de ressonancia, essa onda  absorvida pelas partculas de gua existentes nos alimentos a serem aquecidos. A energia absorvida aumenta a vibra??o das partculas, produzindo o aquecimento dos alimentos.    O forno de microondas n?o fornece calor, ele atua exclusivamente sobre as molculas de gua dos alimentos. Alimentos secos ou recipientes n?o s?o aquecidos pelo microondas, embora, com o tempo, o alimento aquecido possa aquecer o recipiente por condu??o. As microondas tm alta capacidade de penetra??o na comida, o que possibilita o cozimento por dentro e n?o a partir da superfcie, como ocorre nos fornos convencionais. Alm disso, n?o fazem vibrar as molculas de vidro ou plstico, que n?o se aquecem no interior do forno. Como as molculas de gua dos alimentos tm uma carga eltrica diferente em seus plos, giram com a polaridade varivel (dire??o) do campo eltrico. A fric??o entre as molculas giratrias produz calor e assim cozinha os alimentos. Os recipientes metlicos n?o podem ser usados num forno de microondas porque o metal refletir as ondas, impedindo que cheguem at o alimento.     importante lembrar que o nosso organismo tem alta porcentagem de gua e pode ser seriamente prejudicado pelas radia??es dos fornos de microondas. No entanto esses aparelhos s?o blindados, isto , as radia??es, produzidas internamente, n?o atravessam suas paredes.  colocada uma grade de metal junto ao vidro da porta: os espa?os entre as malhas dessa grade s?o menores que as microondas.
