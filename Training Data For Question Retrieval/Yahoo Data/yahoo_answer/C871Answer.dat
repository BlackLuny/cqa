This is used in a worksheet to see if you are entitled to any additional money based on your 2008 tax return (you wouldn't be).

pCEA7Pu8aa	If you price it right it will sell.    Although we deal much in Illinois from experience when it is priced right the phone rings off of the hook.    You should get an unbiased evaluation of your property with the intent of selling in 30 days and if that value works for you then price it accordingly and move forward.    More and more we see homeowners that think the house is worth more than it is and are always behind the market curve and instead of pricing it right from the beginning end up with a house on the market for over a year and then sell it for ten of thousands less than they could have if they had just priced it right from the beginning.    Realtors will tell you anything to get your listing.  They play on your emotion of thinking your house is so much more than a house and because it is so much more it is worth so much more than everyone elses and then when it does not sell they will say we need to lower it.      Good Luck|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Price it right and it will sell.

A good real estate agent that knows the area and the market. Not just a listing agent, I mean a real estate agent that sell houses.    All these things go into selling a house. The selling market is okay today with the buyer having the upper hand at present.    No one can really answer your question as there are so many variables. If you want to sell quick and can afford it mark your house down a couple of thousand dollars for a quick sale.     I hope this has been of some help to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|blC1U6LFaa	If it's priced right, it should sell within a month or two.  The key is pricing it right.    I'm not a big fan of Realtors in general, and I don't think they are worth what they charge when considering the lackluster service they provide.  I think the market will usually dictate the price of your home, not the real estate agent.  If you competitively price the house, and actively market it, you should have it sold in the same amount of time it would take an agent.

qBCGH52haa	Overtime pay is based on the weekly total of hours worked.  You are entitled to overtime pay for all time worked beyond 40 hours in a calendar week (the start and end of the week is up to the company - it is not necessarily Sunday through Saturday, although the majority are).    So, if you worked Monday through Thursday with an extra half hour each day, that would total to 34 hours and you would not get overtime.  However, if you worked Monday through Friday with 30 minutes extra each day, that totals 42.5 hours and you would get time and one half for 2.5 hours.

jZMDYsVOaa	Hi there,    Yea this is the right time to invest in currencies.    EUR/GBP dives after ECB and BoE delivered what markets expected, with ECB on hold at 2.00% while BoE cut 50bps to 1.00%. Though, the decline in Euro is somewhat limited after Trichet's comment took out the possibility of adopting zero interest rates in the Eurozone. Sterling remains firm across the board though. Dollar, on the other hand remains mixed in range after jobless claims surged to highest level since 1982. After all, the outlook in most pairs remains unchanged. Euro is expected to remain weak in generally, taking the Swissy down with it. meanwhile, dollar and yen will likely be mixed as there are countering effects from strong pound and weak Euro.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	What on earth are you painting with?   It takes little time to paint and the paint should be dry in 2-3 HOURS, not days.    You do not have to compensate them anything.    If the unit is not habitual, and paint certainly does not effect that, then you compensate 1/30th of the rent for every day they can not live there.|`|REC4YgOuaa	I am glad that I am not your tenant....just joking.

I have given them a portion of their rent back.  By that, I mean prorated based on a 31 day month.

I prefer to leave that up to the tenant, and have always had positive feedback on my efforts.  Good Luck!|`|7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	no way I'd pay for a hotel.  Not sure why you're painting with a tenant in the unit, but I'd try to work something out with them where they could shower at another tenants place.  Give them both like $20 or something and call it a day.    It really depends on why this painting is taking place though.

f9f4407b08469472a7b821eb01936d16aa	You're talking about subliminal advertising, which is a very popular idea among the tin foil hat crowd.    Basically, the idea, as promoted by a number of so-called experts throughout the 1970s allegedly proved that advertisers were secretly placing hidden images that you could not see but your brain could detect. The idea, supposedly, was that you would be induced to buy a product through a primal, "subliminal" desire you were unaware of. But once you got into their "research" you found it laughable. Images of alcohol in a glass of ice yielded such gems as the words "sex" or "death" or "money." We were supposed to believe that the enticing image of the product over ice wasn't enough, but somehow the word death would get us to trip over ourselves and buy the product.    The entire idea - laughable as it is - was discredited almost from the moment it first appeared. Supposedly, in the early 1960s, a research organization had inserted a single frame or two of an icy Coca-Cola into a feature movie (1/24th of a second) so that you couldn't see it but your brain supposedly registered the "ad." And, yes, sales of Coca-Cola rose during that particular showing of the movie. What the researchers conveniently failed to note was that it was a hot day and the air conditioning system wasn't working properly.    No one has ever been able to replicate those results. And there has never been a single person in the history of advertising who has ever proven that subliminal imagery was ever inserted into any photograph anywhere at any time. Period. In a fluid, wavy photograph you're liable to see any number of things if you're really looking for them, and it's in your best interest to "find" them.     The bottom line is, the so-called evidence always tells us more about the researcher than it ever did about advertising.

Yes you can get a copy of yr credit score for just ￡2.00 in UK there are 3 <br>  <br>  Experian I know is one but there are another 2 and some places may register with different companies.  So best to get yr personal info from all 3 sites.   It will list everything even where you have lived for last 10 yrs and if you had/have any financial associations with anyone else - maybe a joint loan years ago with an ex spouse etc.  If you see adverse info challenge it Fast.  It will show who has checked up and you and what the decision was at the time they checked.  So if 3 companies make a check and it was not favourable then yr score will be decreased etc.  If there were mitigating circumstances then you have the opportunity to put a short letter of no more than 2000 words together which the credit ref company then HAS to read out when someone is checking you out so they can make a full and informed decision.

6MmqeIIZaa	Gold cannot be taxed first of all.<br>  <br>  Second, every jewelry store will vary in markups. Bigger populated 24k markets in New York, Chicago, LA, etc.. will have more competition thus driving prices lower.<br>  <br>  I've seen them as low as 30% markup in Chicago, and as high as 40-50% markup in Atlanta. This is AFTER NEGOTIATING the price given to you on the set itself. They WILL ALWAYS NEGOTIATE if they are a true Indo/Pak jewelry store. <br>  <br>  To get an idean of what you should be paying would be calculated depending on the GOLD SPOT price, which can be viewed by going to <a href="http://www.goldprice.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldprice.org</a> or <a href="http://www.kitco.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kitco.com</a> (harder to read, but it's the site all jewelers use).  <br>  <br>  If for example spot is $1,000- in a major market you should be paying around $1,300 for an ounce of gold jewelry. In a smaller market you should be paying around $1400-$1500.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! And ALWAYS NEGOTIATE- if you start walking out the door- TRUST ME THEY WILL CALL YOU IN.

The IRS does only dump on Friday and they probably did yesterday especially because they told you that they did.<br>  <br>  The reason people like yourself who check on it almost hourly get so nervous is that most banks take 1 to 2 business days to "process" the direct deposit.

Bo354tBjaa	I can definitely sympathize with you.   I got out of a similar rental situation about a year ago.   A lot of the neighbors were loud and had no consideration or respect for their fellow neighbors.  I would go to bed early because I had to be at work at 5:30 AM.  <br>  The best solution that I found was to wear earplugs when I went to sleep.  Get the foam ones.  You can find them in most drugstores.  They take some getting used to, but they will save your sanity until you can get out of that situation.  <br>  They work so well that I slept through an incident where one of my neighbors got cranked up on crystal meth, got into a fight with the sheriff's dept., got tazered and died.

Whether the clients are "obese" or "normal" weight, it would happen.  To refer to them as "fat" and "obese" has nothing to do with it.  Banging on the ceiling is a huge, no, no. Did you take the time to talk to them?  Did you go upstairs and explain to them what you are experiencing?  We always advise our clients to talk to the clients first prior to us bringing it to their attention.  It creates animosity  between the two clients and now you have created a "war" of which has become pugnacious between the two of you. We as landlords do not play referee. Children will be children, you can't say for them to just don't be a child.  I have the same problem and I live where I work. (BTW - I pay rent too, it's not free for me) I have to deal with it knowing it is apartment living.  You are going to have to deal with it unfortunately.  It's not interfering with your "quiet enjoyment" of apartment living.  Good Luck.|`|AFMo3671aa	Keep cool during 6 months and find a new less noisy apartment.

So you won't get in trouble with anyone, for this common error.  Secondly, since you are under 18, and your parents can claim you as a dependent.  Depending on how much you made for the entire year, you need to file a seperate tax return for yourself without taking your personal exemption and pay taxes on what you earned.  If you claimed 1 withholding allowance, you probably had some taxes taken out so again you won't have to pay any penalties.  <br>  Remember, all penalties are on the tax return you file.  The only way you can get in trouble with the IRS in regards to your W4, is when you put EXEMPT on it, saying you are exempt from paying any taxes at all.<br>  <br>  To file your return, download free tax software and go thru the question and answers, you'll have a good idea of how much you may owe or if you will get a tax refund.<br>  <br>  Check out the IRS website for names and websites.  Personally I use TaxAct, you can download the software for under $20, do your own and your parents taxes and save them $100.

YCXxP43Laa	Because it is a government tax.. so it is an imprisonable offence not to pay it. You owe the government money, with credit cards etc people owe private companies the money and therefore the same punishments are not applicable, unless they involve fraud.<br>  The best way to view it is to think of it the same way as if you evaded paying tax... that also carries a prison sentence.<br>  If you find yourself getting into arrears contact your council asap... don not wait until legal proceedings are imminent. Most local councils have debt counsellors who can help arrange a method of repayment. If you are eligible you can claim Council Tax benefit, though they have a very low threshold to be eligible.<br>  The fact that you are paying for other peoples children is irrelevant... it is the law and you have to pay it.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Bailiff law is extremely unfair.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Like it or not, the payment of Council Tax is a legal requirement and failure to pay is a criminal offence. You mention street maintenance which is paid for by government, Local Government, who get their funding from Council Tax. Remember that you may not benefit from many of the services that the local council provides at the moment, but when you get older, of pensionable age, you will be entitled to many benefits that those younger than you are paying for. It's all a matter of swings and roundabouts and you should think of it as a form of contributary pension scheme.|`|AA12129792	If there was no consequence then no-one would pay their council taxes.<br>  <br>  Run up bills with the banks, shops, store cards etc. but always pay your government bills.  The government has the harshest penalties for non-payment and will always get the money in the end, regardless of what you try to do.<br>  <br>  I'm single, have no children, live in the country where there's no street-lights, parks and CCTV, have no local bus services and the roads never get repaired yet I too have to pay for all of these things as well.  I too think that it is unfair.|`|h8if0YlTaa	i dont think its your arrears you will  be arrested for but your failure to pay<br>   im in a similar situation, having made a reasonable offer they have flatly refused ,so they going to take our furniture soon, talk about nazis sorry i cant help you with your question but if you can go and see a solicitor and dont leave your doors open cos they just walk in uninvited|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	I think you just found your own solution. Get a credit card, pay the council tax, and feel a lesser punishment from the bank...<br>  <br>  They had the bailiffs round mine, even though I live in student only accomodation, and hadnt sent me any warnings. Now im facing a fine of 130 quid, some things in this life just arent fair, you need to find your own ways round them.|`|9KIniBETaa	Oddly, Maggie T tried to spread the burden of council tax on to more people and even it up so that single people didn't have to pay so much (remember the poll tax) and everyone went ballistic.   Now people are saying the council tax is unfair.   So how should local services be funded?   Please don't say by the government since that's just the same - ie paid by the tax payer.   Of course workers are paid to maintain the streets - paid by the council using council tax - how else would they be paid?  <br>  <br>  People know they've got council tax bills to pay - they aren't a surprise demand.   I completely agree they're far too high - we pay for all sorts of things we could easily live without.   Perhaps someone should start a political party to do away with red tape in local councils, no H&S, no equality officers, diversity officers, etc., just police, fire service, education, street maintenance, rubbish collection and that's it.

So it's wise to compare terms and fees before you agree to open a credit or charge card account. Try looking for a credit card with a low APR. Find out the APR because this is the amount charged to you on monthly balances.|`|QkGLEMklaa	in todays climate, i wouldn't have one, it is far too risky.  But if you do have a poor credit rating, capital one.  They gave my mom one when she was unemployed.  Spend as much as you can, and switch it to a 0% with lloyds or another.  Meaning you can spend and pay no interest. Repeat every time the 0% is up to NEVER pay interest.<br>  <br>  Good luck with legally cheating the banking system!|`|Htn9lxdQaa	Get a debit card.

y4SUDnpaaa	If you've been denied credit the company that declined the loan is obligated to give you the evidence they based their decision on. You should have received a copy of your credit report from the companies who turned you down, if the reason was bad credit.  Then you would at least know what's on your credit report. Call them and ask  why you didn't receive a copy of your credit report.|`|Gj5WkwG4aa	If you didnt had a loan really then it should help you. Where as nowdays banks are looking at how can a client be measured on his repayment capacity when he is not at all tested before by any bank (by not taking loan).<br>  Hence try to show good income source in your application and also provide them account statements of your existing savings etc.<br>  Best of luck.|`|YDz1i2Wxaa	Here's my opinion as I don't know what u need the loan for. Unless it's identity theft, you don't pay your bills on time. Pay them on time, not 1 day late. <br>  The loan that you are looking for other than the bank: You'll pay a horrible price in the end. More Insurance than you actually need on that loan, a ridiculously high interest (make your calculations).<br>  My advice is to hold off for a year. Get your things in order. If you have to take a second job, after work or weekends, do it for 1 year. You could work a second job in a restaurant, delivery, waiting on tables, delivering during supper hour. That extra income for 1 year might just put you on easy streets. Do the calculation.  You won't need them, you'll feel better about yourself, and you'll be in control of bargaining with them and not begging them. Good Luck.

Already PSU Banks are on the way and they too geared up with attractive strategies.|`|DT6QFP7Yaa	It is said that India lives in villages because more than 70 % of the country's population live in the villages.    In the past infrastructure facilities were not available in the rural areas,there purchasing power was limited n they did not have access to TV.All these facilities r available along with improvement of their purchasing power due to improved method of agriculture n allied activities..A person who was using a bullock cart is now capable of using tractor,a person who was using a bicycle now can consider a motor cycle etc.The penetration of banking facilities n easy availability of credit has enhanced their purchasing power.They can now use more FMCG N consumer durables including mobile phones.Taking these developments in to consideration ,many companies r changing their rural marketing strategies to improve their sales.
QoVL5cDHaa	It won't be done automatically, and for PAYE, it is highly unlikely any refund would be paid into your bank account. HMRC have no facility to make electronic repayments. If you want repayment, you should make formal claim to tax office, and you can ask for cheque to be sent direct to your bank. You should give sort code, account number, and name and address of bank. Send HMRC documentary evidence of tax deduction (forms P45/P60), and tell them your complete employment history for the period in question. The tax year goes from 6th April to 5th April. To do this you can download form P91 from <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk," rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk,</a> then go into forms.<br>  You don't need the complication of a Tax Return for this, unless you have been self-employed within the period.|`|KTNqah9eaa	You could file a tax return if you haven't already done so. hen it's assessed the refund ill be clearly shown and maybe more easily claimable.|`|at3fTytsaa	Have you actually contacted HMRC to point out that you are due this refund?

AA10241450	The S&P 500 or Standard & Poor's is a well known index of the largest 500 companies in the World traded in the U.S. market.  The differences in your above indexes you would have to look at the prospectus carefully however instead of holding stocks some companies will buy options or calls and puts or use complex business intelligence programs to pick the best 500 companies out of the index.  Buying the "best" companies the fund managers would hope to beat the S&P 500 index.  <br>  <br>  Some fund companies may even buy certain stocks and sell short particular companies for instance financials adding to the selling pressure in the hopes of buying them back for investments at a later period of time.  Another strategy is buying stocks before they will be added to the index. This strategy alone can add a few percentage points to the APR for the fund.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	There are many more.

Since the government owns a large share in Fannie and Freddie the ROE won't go to public shareholders.  The stock price will remain low until the consumer can start buying houses.  <br>  <br>  Aggressive ETF's would be financial since they have declined so much - probably better to buy Fanny and Freddie in a diversified Financial ETF.

fbqrIdkuaa	Ok...I know that your question is about a collection account, but first I have to address the credit score thing.<br>  <br>  This is something that confuses many people.  FHA does not have a minimum credit score requirement.  However, even though someone is doing an FHA loan, it is still done through a lender (HSBC, Countrywide, Bank of America, etc.) and those lenders also have rules that have to be met.  The lenders are the ones that have a credit score requirement and some lenders will not do a loan under a certain score.<br>  <br>  Now onto the collection.  Again, this is going to depend on the lender.  Almost all lenders require that there be no late payments or collections in the past 12 months.  Many lenders require that there not be any late payments or collections in the past 24 months.  For collections that are still owed, most lenders will require that they be paid, not all but most.  Many people pay old collections at closing.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing to keep in mind though...lenders are all different.  Do you want to loose a loan because the lender that you happen to be working with does not allow the collections to be paid at closing?  And, with a 3 year old collection, you could probably negotiate down the payment if you contact the collection agency before you try and buy a house.  If you wait, there is less of a chance that they will take less money, because they know that they have you over a barrel if it has to be paid in order to get your home.  Also, you owe the money and you have the money...why not just be responsible and pay your debt?  Then you don't have to worry about it.|`|AA10665533	"After that debt is settled, you should pull that score up to FHA guidelines."<br>  <br>  Paid collections still have a negative impact on your FICO score. Check out the below sites. Also make sure that score is a real FICO score.|`|kyEeM6oxaa	I am a Realtor and not a lender but with ten yrs experience, what I can tell you is, Collections that are not recent, don't matter as much. You MUST have a spotless pay history for the last 12 mths. FHA needs to see a 680 or higher score. I would call that credit company, negotiate a settlement for the balance, and have them send you a letter confirming the arrangement. Then I would talk to your lender about getting a re-score on your report. After that debt is settled, you should pull that score up to FHA guidelines.<br>  Hope that helps.
AA11211495	There are parts of the country where you most certainly can.  Unfortunately Florida is not one of them.

MPO0ahemaa	Graduate High school! Go to a good college and major in Political Science or History. Gain a solid knowledge with the court structure and the laws so that you are conversant. Stay up to date on current and world affairs with respect to the law and those political actors that influence it(legislators, judges, governors, mayors, etc). Seek internships and opportunities in the summer that draw upon knowledge you are learning in the attainment of your degree! This is crucial!!!!! You want to do this especially because you gain valuable contacts (hint: letters of recommendation)! If you can, form a relationship with the political leadership of your city! Stand Out! Make them remember you! Offer Ideas and ways of thinking about policy if you are fortunate enough to be in meetings and rooms with them while they do the business of the people! Dont be afraid to open your mouth and be heard! Start studying for the LSAT the summer that starts prior to the fall semester of your Junior Year. Take the LSAT in December of your Junior Year. That way, you can take it again with plenty of time left if you need to. Research Law schools! Gather professors and contacts that you are able to and request letters of recommendations. Follow the LSAC procedures by going on to www.lsac.org where you will find step by step procedures as to the law school admissions process! Do all of this at the time you first take the LSAT, as I suggested in December of the Junior year. Make sure of deadlines!  Apply! Get Accepted! Graduate College! Go to law school, do well! Exceptionally well! In the summer, continue to grow and develop relationships with firms, government leaders, etc. Graduate Law School! Go right back to contacts in local government that you know and know you and be appointed as assistant district attorney! They've seen you grow from college as a little pipsueak to now as a full, fledged, licensed attorney! <br>  Then after a few years of experience, shove old boss out of the seat(LMAO) by encouraging him to run for Mayor or Congressm(or whatever) and then you run for DA! There you go! This coming from someone who has done all these things up to the point of starting law school! About to graduate college in 2 months and start law school in the fall!

Research a little about the companies that have caught your interest in case they ask what you know about them.<br>  <br>  Be sure to have a smart appearance and dress appropriately depending on the type of position you seek.  Take copies of your CV/Resume so you can hand this in if anyone asks and/or it will be useful if you need to complete any application forms.<br>  <br>  Try not to be nervous, just be yourself, the employers will try to put you at ease as they know this is the best way to find out more about you - if you think things through before you go you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

2gFem71maa	I recommend not paying.  Restart your life.  You can just let all of your balances go cold and start doing what you need to do to survive in this new economy.  If you're anything like me, it will actually be a relief to not have credit available to you and to live more simply.  <br>  <br>  As far as your house is concerned, I recommend that you let it go also.  You will definitely be able to find a place to rent because the majority of americans have crappy credit.  I do!  I have for a couple of years now and have never had a problem finding a place to live... and I would be willing to bet my credit is worse than yours will be!  <br>  <br>  I am extremely happy with my decision to stop paying, have returned to school and spend more time with my family.  <br>  <br>  I have included a couple of excerpts from an awesome book I read on this very topic--not paying your credit card bills.  Its by a guy named Mic Insky and it's called Uncollectible: A book about escaping credit card debt.  Although I had already stopped paying my bills, he was able to put into words many sentiments that I felt about the credit card industry and my decision not to pay.  I hope these help. (For clarity, he calls not paying your bills the Do-Nothing Option)<br>  <br>  "Through the Do-Nothing Option, we insisted that the credit card companies be responsible for their investors' money that they foolishly passed out as unsecured loans to anybody and everybody.  They should have stopped extending us credit a long time ago, but they greedily saw that the deeper we got in debt, the more likely it was that we would be staying in debt and the more offers for new credit kept streaming in.  They are so foolish that we still get credit card offers!<br>  <br>  Because of the Do-Nothing Option, we placed ourselves in a position to change our lives for the better.  We got the do-over that I had always wanted—a fresh start, and we didn't have to file for bankruptcy protection."...<br>  <br>  "And the Do-Nothing did something else I couldn’t have done on my own.  Without me ever having to pick up a phone or write a single letter of request, each and every credit card company that I had refused to pay has come back with offers to settle at a fraction of my original balance.  Many have even made me offers at less than half my original balance.  So, if for some reason I do decide to pay in the future (although, I don’t see that happening), my negotiation was done without a word—they came to me with the offers!"|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Wow!

ZdlRGYZXaa	As a former Loan officer & underwriter ; In the old days , when relying on rental income to afford the mortgage /property , you had to have a renters contract in place at the closing table as well as an appraisal proving this type of rental arrangment is common in the area. Furthermore the property itself would have to be listed as a multi unit in order for the investors to be willing to buy this paper . However some SFR can be grandfathered in as multi units as long as its common place in the area for SFR  to sub let space.<br>  .Bottom line in my opinion  is your going to need a Good Loan Officer special consideration in underwriting  " needing 80% of the mortgage moneys to come from renters is high risk .<br>  with a nitch program you could get it done if your credit is squeaky clean . <br>  If you really want it ,then go get it. Hang tight , cuz its gona be a  long ride. Perhaps as long as 6 months to close the loan. So be patient and compliant and you’ll get what you worked for..<br>  Tip ** Create & register a business generating an EIN # . This is a free service  and can be done easily on line or on the phone.<br>  Next , have business cards made . This in itself may qualify you for many more/ other lending options.<br>  Good Luck|`|Gun3UGzaaa	The biggest issue is that your payment will be about $10,000 a month, and if you are a new landlord without substantial bank behind you, they will require you to qualify for the whole payment on your income alone.  They will want to see an income of around $30,000 a month.<br>  <br>  You also need to plan out your cash flow, insurance, repairs, maintenance, and times for when the unit is vacant.  You also need to compare rentals in your area and see if you can get the amount of rent you want for your unit.<br>  <br>  Finally, being a landlord has some significant tax and legal ramifications.  For a property this pricey, you probably want to put it in a limited partnership.  See an attorney and an accountant before you go forward with your plan.

You also can use this service to avoid common mistakes while buiding credit and pre-estimate future scores for different scenarios of payments - creditreport.fateback.com|`|9qymF2xlaa	It depends on your circumstances. If you have just arrived from outside the UK, it can take about a year or two. It's not just credit rating that helps, being on the voters roll also goes in your favour for credit applications, as does being listed in the telephone directory. I would say about 3-6 months after paying your utility bills (gas, phone and electricity) on time to make a start, but about 6 months to show a clear history of good payments. Thereafter, it builds up progressively

mrhbJWuJaa	The mortgage company owns the home now.  The contract you had with the previous owner is not valid.  The company can evict you if they want, but they figured it would be cheaper to pay you relocation money.  They don't want to give you the money before you leave becuase they want to make sure you won't trash the place.  If you did trash it, they could press charges against you, but they don't want that.<br>  <br>  If you can find another place to rent, go and take the money.  Otherwise you have no choice but to stay, rent, and when the home is sold you move without receiving any money.

KGCih5BTaa	You are never going to get market value for your gold.  A lot of people forget that it is a business and there are expenses.  About 2% of the gold immediately evaporates upon melting, market price may drop, rent, assay fees, permits, labor, taxes, etc etc.  Also market prices are based on 1,000 ounces of bullion (bars, coins etc) on a trading level.<br>  <br>  If you have one ounce of jewelry, and gold is $1,000 a ounce you don't get $1,000 for that jewelry.  Most jewelry is 14k gold and that is only 58.5% pure gold.  <br>  <br>  10k- 41.7% Gold<br>  14k- 58.5% Gold<br>  18k- 75% Gold<br>  22k-  91.7% Gold<br>  <br>  I am a refiner and diamond buyer in Florida, and will give you the information you need to sell your items without getting ripped off.<br>  <br>  Gold (Based on todays price of $993/oz)- 10k- $9 gram, 14k- $13 gram, 18k- $17 gram.<br>  <br>  Silver- 925/Sterling- $9 a ounce.<br>  <br>  This is the absolute least you should get per gram. A lot of place buy it according to pennyweight (DWT) to convert grams to pennyweight just multiply the gram price by 1.55.<br>  <br>  I pay around 6% more than the numbers I listed above for 100 grams of gold OR LESS, if you 100-200 grams I pay 10% more than the prices above, 200 grams or more 12% more than the prices above. <br>  <br>  I buy from jewelers, dealers, pawn shops, and the public all over the country.  If you know the approx weight and karat of the gold I will pay you PRIOR to you shipping your items using paypal.  If you dont have a scale I send them to customers FREE OF CHARGE!  If that sounds like something you would be interested in doing call me anytime.  My number is tollfree.  (877) 487-1386.  Either way I hope you get a fair price no matter who you sell it too.  Just Do YOUR RESEARCH!!!<br>  <br>  A few last things.  If you have any gold or silver coins or bars (bullion) you should get about 1%-2% below market value if they are pure gold (most are)  since they do not need to be melted. <br>  <br>  Also now is NOT the time to sell anything but gold, silver or platinum.  If you have diamonds (larger than a 1/2ct), or a high end watch, KEEP THEM IT!!  Wait until the economy rebounds a little.

BoAEgaAGaa	You could lower your total income by possibly contributing to a traditional IRA before April 15th, but not your earned income.  But this will not allow you to receive any EIC.  First your earned income is used to determine your EIC from the EIC tables.  Then your adjusted gross income is used on the tables.  Whichever creates the least amount of EIC is the amount you qualify for.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, since there is no legal way to lower your earned income  this is the amount that is reported to the IRS from your W-2s or other income reporting documents, you will not qualify for EIC this year.

One hand washes the other.  The only other alternative is to get a job or get education where you can earn more so you dont have to worry about earned income credit.
YCQAPMXcaa	That is a little tricky on salary - it depends.  Are there a lot of repairs that are in need to be completed, does the landlord have projects in plan, are you going to be turning apartments (painting, cleaning, etc.), if so, then I would go for hourly.  If it is not going to be "that much" then I would go for a monthly fee.  Does the landlord have a record of work orders performed?  If so, you can review the history. Ask if you may inspect the apartments so you can get an idea of what you might be walking into.  Of course the clients must be notified first of you entering their homes too for you to do this. You have to weigh what is going to be involved.  Realize if there is an emergency call at 2 am, you will be responding to that call.  You could be there for an hour on up. Are you going to be living on the premises?  If so, neg. a hourly rate and a possible discount on the place.  Make sure you get everything in writing - a letter of intent as to what your agreement is.  Better to be safe then sorry.  Make sure it is signed in front of a notary too. Are you qualified to do this work?  Do you have certifications?  If you do then you have more neg. power for your rate.  Depending on what is involved - people who are green in this field start out at $10-$12 an hour.  Be careful if the landlord wants to 1099 you.  If the landlord does, then you must have your own insurance.  If you get hurt, lose your job, fired, laid off, etc. You will not be entitled to any of these benefits if self-employed, although you get to write off a lot.  Best to be on a payroll.  I'm just guessing but if there are 20 apartments, you will have your hands full especially if there is age behind the building.  Which in Philly, most have.  Be careful and think on this.  Good Luck.|`|RZzMse3Haa	It sounds like all he wants is an on staff maintenance person.  Maintenance people usually get paid an hourly wage.

Because this market has boomed and if you don't know some basic tactics, it will be hard for you walk that route.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you man.|`|S51Pd1cQaa	I know it sucks to be on your feet right now, but... waiter/ waitress is the best way. Now it's only about $100 a shift, but that's something. Go to a busy restaurant. Very flexible, however, the money is unreliable at times. If the times were better I would have a better answer, but that's my second... no wait... third job right now. I also tutor through a company, but it's not that much.

Pjm9pg7iaa	You attend the auction. You get a bidder number. When you want a property, raise your bidder paddle. You must pay cash within 24 hours. You are paying the last 2 years of property tax. You are not giving the owner a gift.  The Treasurer marks a box named "Subtax" and enters your bidder number. If the owners do not pay the tax in 3 years you can go to court and get a deed to the house. If they don't pay up in 5 more years, you don't have to go to court; the Treasurer hands you the deed. All mortgages are wiped out. You own the house free and clear. <br>  If the owner pays up (they do over 99.9% of the time) you get all your money back plus big interest. Sometimes i would get my money 4 days after the auction. The one thing i learned is that the only properties i could get a deed to were such horrible investments that i wish i had never bid. I actually lost money after buying 40 Certificates. Each property had such serious flaws that they were not worth owning.  <br>  I don't buy the Certificates any more..

Anyone that expects or tells you 2 to 3 days has no clue to the amount of time it takes to close a loan in today's market place.  You legally have until the 27th to close the loan.  The sellers have no right to shorten that time unless you also allow it to happen.<br>  What is your Broker telling you?  Have you asked to speak to the Branch Manager and have them call on your behalf as well?  A little push from a higher up helps, sometimes.<br>  <br>  I wish I could give you better advise but in today's market you are held prisoner.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Ask your agent or broker to intervene. Unless you have a shady or unstable credit history, that is a terrible excuse. With a complete application, underwriting should take no more than 2 to 3 days. The lender may be trying to back out of its commitment??|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	99% of the time your loan has been rejected.  the underwriter and the mortgage company manager are frantically trying to find another "investor" for your loan. The don't want to upset you so they say nothing. Which is the worst possible thing for you. You have to order the moving van and give notice where you are living.<br>  Go in person to the lender and sit in the office until someone in power sees you. A loan should be underwritten in 2 days. If you are not underwritten by 5pm Monday, apply at another company. You have a major flaw in your qualifying ability; only you know what it is.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	one consideration you may want to offer is to "rent" the house from them for two weeks to allow the loan to close.  Trust me, they really don't want to start all over with another buyer.  But, on the other hand, your extensions are costing them money in interest costs, taxes and utilities.<br>  <br>  So, if you offer them some compensation, maybe 1/2 a months' payment, in exchange for another extension, that might make the deal sweeter for them and fair.

But your landlord can choose not to renew your lease and can also make you quite miserable in the meantime while getting around the law.<br>  You are complaining of a difference of 5 degrees.  If you put plastic on your windows as the landlord suggested, it will keep heat in and your energy bill down.  It's super cheap to buy and easy to install, but if you feel like nickel and diming your landlord, send the receipts for it with that amount deducted from your rent check.

AA10305589	Interesting idea,but it would be very difficultt to reach everyone wih a computer asking them to donate.  Maybe you could focus on a smaller target - say corporations - so you can more efficiently reach a more concentrated group of potential donors with a much higher giving potential.  (if you convince one company to donate their used computers, it would generate multiple donations, rather than spending the same time cultivating an individual donor who would likely only give 1).  Next, you compose your marketing piece, a letter that describes your mission, how you intend to accomplish it, and how the company can help.  Invite the company to contact you for more information, or a web site where they can find out more about your organization.  Follow up in a week or two with a phone call or a personal visit to see if they are interested in donating, have any questions, or are not interested.  Do this many times, and you will eventually start seeing results.  <br>  <br>  You can also plan a 'computer drive' in your community - ask your local newspapers to run an ad promoting the event, get a school or church to host the event, and post up signs and flyers in high visibility areas to drum up attendance.  <br>  <br>  You may also want to search the internet to see if there are any established charities or nonprofits in your area that serve a similar purpose.  If there are, you may consider partnering with them, rather than competing against them to accomplish your shared mission, and you can take advantage of their in-place programs to attract donations.<br>  <br>  There are any number of books that go into much greater detail on how to plan and implement a donor solicitation campaign.  You can search "donor solicitation + computers" and see what ideas you get from freely available sources.  Search the same at amazon.com for related book titles.

The problem may lie there.<br>  In theory, second or third jobs should be taxed at Basic Rate, 20%.

The only problem you will have is the "hassle" in finding out the correct tax office, but look up your local one in the telephone directory and then let them help you.  Don't get put off by the paperwork, if you have the P45 and all the details you just fill it in.  By the way if you have any interest paid from bank accounts you can also get the tax back on this.

at3fTytsaa	UK employment law does not recognise short term contracts. If an employer wants you to leave after 3, 6, 9 months, they have every right to do so - this is not unfair dismissal. The fact that you have been turning up for work, are given work and are paid constitutes a contract in UK law. <br>  As you have now been there for more than 12 months, you have employment rights. Therefore, if they want to dismiss you at this stage, they have to go through a formal process during which you are given reasons why they are asking you to leave.<br>  I dont know what the meeting is about, but you should be prepared for the fact that it may be the first stage in the dismissal process - but it could be for just the simple reason that there is no more work for you to do.|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	No, they have no obligation to offer you a permanent position.

Ideally they would have confirmed the extensions to your original contract in writing - this doesn't necessarily have to be a whole new contract, just a letter confirming the extension.  But even if they haven't done this, the terms of your original contract will still apply.<br>  <br>  What you need to be prepared for is the possibility that they may now be terminating your contract.  As you now have over a year's service with them you have acquired rights against unfair dismissal, so if they do want to terminate your temporary contract they will want to make sure they have done it properly by following the statutory process, (which includes a meeting with you).<br>  <br>  This might not be what's happening though - they may just be wanting to tell you what their plans are for the role you are doing.

UHQcBwxVaa	Read what dave ramsey or suze orman (both consumer finance experts with many books and television shows and radio shows dealing with smart consumer finance has to say on the subject.  I have enclosed a direct link to the appropriate area on the dave ramsey website for your learning.  I have been where you are and an insurance agent calling themselves financial planners, financial advisor, etc will try to convince you that whole life makes more sense than a lot of other options but this idea is not supported by anyone that is not in the life insurance industry.  Meaning anyone whom does not have something to gain and has an education about finance will tell you term is always to the way to go.  You will have to be really careful though because with your youth and lack of financial education there are a lot of so called "professionals" who will in hind sight turn out to be professional pick pocketers and all of those types will attempt to put you in whatever strategy makes them the most money.  Call an independent financial advisor and ask specifically if they are in any way connected to or paid any commission from an insurance company or life insurance company and if they say they do or if you believe they do, run to another qualified professional.  Always make sure that the advice given to you is backed up by and independent source meaning do your own research of their plan after they give it you. Go to the link below and read up and stay sharp cause the world of professional finance is one filled with a lot of sharks.|`|8LI4QNo6aa	Please first read “bima nivesh nahi hai nivesh ke nam par apne paiso ko kachare me mat dalia please!(hindi me) In  blog link <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sharegenius.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharegenius.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  then make your decision

6MmqeIIZaa	In this economy? NONE OF THE ABOVE<br>  <br>  Traditionally, Real Estate agents make the LEAST comparing to the amount of work they do. You may think its the appraiser, but the appraiser snaps a few pictures, and spends 1 hour on research for a total of $150/hr if they charge $300 for an appraisal (usually the bulk rate for real estate agents / mortgage brokers). Same thing with Mortgage brokers they spend on average 3 hours on your loan- which includes putting up with your questions- for the 1-3 points they earn depending on how much they ripped you off, and how much they will get from the back end from the bank.<br>  <br>  Traditionally the top 3 would be:<br>  <br>  1. Developer<br>  2. Bank if it is selling your loan on the after market<br>  3. Tie between Mortgage Broker and Real Estate agent ONLY if the real estate agent is acting as the broker for BOTH the buyer and seller.<br>  <br>  However, comparing the amount of time, work, low percentage of shows vs. purchases, the REAL ESTATE AGENT always MAKES THE LEAST PER TIME INVESTED. They are simply chauffeur's with lock boxes. Stay at home mom's make the best Real Estate agents, because they can connect with other wives, and convince husbands. They are consistently rated top real estate agents, and promoted to high splits if they work for a major player.<br>  <br>  That's why they are fine with selling 2 homes one month, and 0 homes the next. They have a husband that brings in that paycheck no matter what, or vice-versa. I know a real estate agents that now drops off office supplies to my business- it's sad.<br>  <br>  Hate to say this- but you picked the wrong market to be dealing with right now. You would be better of taking a course in pretty much any other industry.<br>  <br>  Since your 20, and your doing your MBA, you'll be out of school right when they start hiring again. The jobs should start coming back around 2011, and the recession should be clearing up, along with a bull market. Real Estate unfortunately will be bottoming with no increases in value anytime in the near future. Your MBA should be good though for solid income.

cWuumdy7aa	What Does Exponential Moving Average - EMA Mean?<br>  A type of moving average that is similar to a simple moving average, except that more weight is given to the latest data. The exponential moving average is also known as "exponentially weighted moving average". Investopedia explains Exponential Moving Average - EMA<br>  This type of moving average reacts faster to recent price changes than a simple moving average. The 12- and 26-day EMAs are the most popular short-term averages, and they are used to create indicators like the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the percentage price oscillator (PPO). In general, the 50- and 200-day EMAs are used as signals of long-term trends

There are many solid companies whose stocks are underpriced and they are good investment opportunities. But you have to understand that markets are nervous and money is not going to flow as easily. Specially since credit standards have been tightened. Due to this crisis I had to diversify my portfolio and I allocated 1/3 of my investments on a secure fund that gives a very low yield, 1/3 to PIMCO funds and the last 1/3 + my contributions, I have them on other funds that are under performing but I know will recover after this crisis is over. But my strategy is a long term one. When markets recover if they recover, I will move <br>  <br>  If I were you I would secure my 25,000 + past/future contributions to a secure fund like PIMCO or a low interest secure fund. And continue gambling on any profits left from the investment.|`|AA11368375	If you are scared of being in the market for the next couple of years, you can move the investments to the 529 plan's money market.

The money market is almost certainly insured, but ask your adviser just to be safe.

It's possible that under revised rules for calculating your credit score. You may not have had enough credit to raise it. <br>  <br>  Also every time someone runs a credit check on you for anything (loans, credit cards, etc.) it can drop your score. Even your employer can run a Credit Check on you.<br>  <br>  There's lots of things that could have happened that you're not even aware of.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to contact them and ask them directly.<br>  <br>  ********<br>  <br>  Heh, to the guy that said I'm wrong:<br>  <br>  From the Bank's perspective, they have to look at how much of a risk you are. <br>  <br>  If you have the ability to ring up 16K on your Credit Card in a matter of Minutes they have to take that into account. <br>  <br>  That could cause your minimum payment to go from $25 a month to $2,000 a month. Therefore, hindering your ability to pay back whatever other debt you might have. <br>  <br>  Trust me, it's calculated as Debt because it's available to you. If you don't belive me, ask your local Bank.<br>  <br>  ****************<br>  <br>  Lol to the guy that has Twice his annual Salary availible to him in Credit.<br>  <br>  Good luck buying a house! :)<br>  <br>  Once a Bank catches wind that you can spend twice what you make in a year, they won't touch you with a 10 foot pole. <br>  <br>  Don't forget, there's a lot more to your Credit than just it's score. The Bank looks at the whole picture. Your Credit Score is just one part of that. <br>  <br>  Someone like the person who has far, far too much credit is too much of a Risk. <br>  <br>  Even more so now in this Economy. Banks are very wary of any kind of high risk borrower. I.E. someone who can borrow far more than they could ever hope to pay back quickly.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Credit scores are calculated by each reporting agency which may differ based on the info each has about you. There are two major scoring systems (FICO 300-850 range, Vantage 501-990 range).  And FICO modified their formulas for 2009.  So you need to make sure you are comparing the same type of score based on similar data.<br>  <br>  Getting a new credit card for lower rates or promotions and closing an old card can hurt your score, because the old card drops off and leaves you with a shorter credit history.<br>  <br>  Available credit is not a debt and does not hurt your score unless you use to much of it.  $900 on a $16k card looks much better than $900 on a $1000 card (or a $500 card).  Having available credit and using it wisely shows a new lender that others lenders trust you.|`|AA10665533	MonkeyBoy is wrong.

If they do not have money to buy a home of their own, they need to start looking for another rental house or apartment immediately, start packing, and get ready to move before their deadline.  <br>  <br>  They should get their own solicitor.  Since the landlord apparently did wrong here, they may be able to get a sum of money awarded them for moving costs.  They also want to ensure that despite the landlord's troubles, they get back any security deposit they paid.  A good solicitor should help them get all this, and won't cost much.

You usually have to exclusively buy supplies from the franchisor. <br>  <br>  One reason franchise's succeed is that they charge premium prices for their product which means they can afford the high rents for premium sites.

sZg4QZs0aa	The best way to forge a career as a public speaker is to, first and foremost, just be 'out there'.  What I mean by that is simply take every opportunity you can to speak to different groups.  Join a speaker's club.  Network and volunteer to speak for different groups.  Clubs like the Lions Club, Rotary, Chamber of Commerce, etc are always looking for speakers - and the better you can speak the more your services will be in demand.  Look at Tony Robbins.  He started out as a bum!  But he woke up one day, decided to 'turn his life around', and then decided to speak to other people about it.  Now look where he is!  <br>  <br>  College degrees that will force you into speaking careers - journalism (especially broadcast journalism), business (especially marketing), communications, and even law (assuming that you are preparing for criminal law).  <br>  <br>  I don't know of any summer programs that would help out here.  The biggest kick start to your career is to simply network with every one you know, and volunteer to speak at different community type events.  You can pick almost any topic - the key here is to either have experience in it or be able to do enough research to come off 'sounding' like an expert.  I have given speeches to audiences, where two weeks prior, I didn't know anything about the subject, but was able to 'pull it off' - because I knew 'just enough' to pull of a good speech and was able to answer general questions.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|FZ19TZpxaa	Jobs-<br>  <a href="http://jobchmob.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jobchmob.com/</a>

She'll get hosed on taxes for withdrawing the money early.  <br>  <br>  Mutual funds in an IRA can be as "safe" as she wants them to be.  No load funds wouldn't cost her fees up front.  Lots of firms offer low cost funds.  She can check the balances daily if she wants to and change the investments within her account.  In her 40's a mix of stocks and bonds would be the normal investment advice for her savings, but "her own thing going on" could be brilliant.  It'll take about 20 years or so to be sure though.<br>  <br>  Corporate pensions can be risky.  Depends on who holds it and the types of investments within it.  Some like the United Auto Workers seemed very safe until the problems with the auto industry makes it look like they might be revised.

I object to paying tax on my wages and then paying tax on a pension I fund with my already taxed money.|`|8YfnjvExaa	Unless you fancy living off the basic state pension or working for ever (and can find an employer) you have to make provision for when you retire. The question is what is the best way to do that?<br>  <br>  If you work for a company that adds to your pension contributions with some money of it's own, then you will find it hard to do better, so the pension route is best. Also, you get tax relief on pension contributions.<br>  <br>  If you are saving for your own retirement with no extra contribution from an employer, then putting the money in a bank right now doesn't give a return above inflation so in effect you will lose money. Same goes for those who invested in the stock market a few years ago, they have even less money now. Investing in property over the long term is likely to be sound, only those who bought a few years ago and *have* to sell now will lose out. Then when you retire you can either sell the property or rent it.<br>  <br>  So, it depends what 'your own thing' is. I would say a combination of a pension and other investments is best.|`|7060eafce3928f5687a405e1d56fae80aa	I suspect she does her own investments that way she cant loose.<br>  With the world economy a it is right now I think she is wise|`|bNdNV6vxaa	The primary concern is this: America and Americans are greedy.<br>  <br>  Do you remember the Enron scandal of 2001, in which Executives promoted and even encouraged company employees to invest in their company, while they themselves withdrew money after the stock prices had gone up?!

Bush, who has taken campaign contributions from Enron Executives, had those records permanently sealed as to avoid and repercussions. So.... you see, pensions or investments for that matter aren't always as secure as you might think they are.<br>  <br>  How do you think America got itself into it's current conundrum; over 1 TRILLION dollars in the mortgage market and not a SINGLE government employee was there to oversee any of the day-to-day activities of that industry. Just sit there in your chair and try to analyze the full spectrum of what has occured in the last few years, and what's still happening in regards to the economic situation of this nation.

IzCCoKNoaa	How to Break into Technical Writing <br>  From 2000, through most of 2005, companies downsized and did not hire many technical writers, or anyone else. <br>  <br>  Companies cannot now find the experienced technical writer who they need. Some company has already hired almost all technical writers who have worked in Technical Publications departments, know the complete tech. pubs. cycle, understand Java, XML, C# and .NET. Companies with openings for such experienced technical writers get no candidates when they advertise. Very, very soon, they will have to start entry level people who can learn the technology and how to write a decent manual or online Help on the job, like they did in the 1970s and 1980s. <br>  <br>  Characteristics You Must Have <br>  First, you have to write—a lot. At least 10 pages a day. Those who succeed at tech writing probably always thought of themselves as good writers. Writing always came easy to them. They enjoy doing the hard thinking called planning and outlining first. They enjoy doing research, interviewing, reading, then making the right decisions about what to include in user instructions. Then they attack the writing. Never a problem for them. <br>  <br>  Perfectionists <br>  Tech writers can’t stand sending any document out with a mistake in it. They obsessively catch all mistakes and fix them. We call this proofreading, and you absolutely must proofread before your employer launches the directions you wrote for, say, 200,000 customers. <br>  <br>  How do these good technical writers know what to proofread for? <br>  They have mastered writing perfect English, with no mistakes. Companies like to hire a Technical Writer who went through the arduous process of earning a B.A. degree. Professors marked up the college papers such writers turned in, and they eventually learned how to use commas, apostrophes, articles, and capitalization correctly. <br>  <br>  Good with a Computer <br>  Technical writers must become super users of some very difficult applications, such as FrameMaker, RoboHELP, Visio, HTML, Quadralay Web Works Publisher, and Microsoft Word. You use the most advanced features of these programs as a Technical Writer: styles, templates, conditional text, and XML output. <br>  <br>  Writers who succeed at this career have to constantly learn new, difficult software. They learn a new application without going insane. They catch on to using new software quite easily. They can figure it out or learn how to use it on their own, with a reference book. <br>  <br>  Have an ‘Eye’ for Good Graphic Design. <br>  The pages (or screens) tech writers produce have to look polished. Their pages have white space, neat, properly-aligned numbered steps, bullets, and text. <br>  <br>  Our writers (the best technical writers) produce pages and screens that look like a freshly cleaned bathroom: shiny chrome faucets, clean, folded white towels, gleaming floor, a fresh, new bar of soap. Good tech writers use the principles of good graphic design to achieve this attractive effect. They often hire real graphic artists to help them select great-looking fonts, covers, and page layouts. <br>  <br>  They don’t allow big, long paragraphs. Too much text not only looks ugly, people won’t read it. <br>  <br>  They Have Manuals to Show <br>  Getting a job as a technical writer works much like getting a job as a wedding photographer: you have to show your previous work. That’s why, in our online course on this Web site, we teach you how to write two, real manuals, and edit them for you. <br>  <br>  Technical Writing Certifications at Colleges <br>  Find out if any college technical writing program you’re about to take has you writing real manuals or online Help. You must have samples to get your first job. <br>  <br>  Learn It on the Job <br>  We have such a shortage of technical writers now, the time will soon come when—if you talk them into it—a company will let you try it, on the job. You’ll have to accept a low salary, and work in a Tech. Pubs. group with an Editor and other writers who can teach you what to do. But you can learn it on the job. Just follow a good style guide, like the Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications.

You must be able to evaluate the product and analyze customer requirements in order to determine the information required by the end user. You will design the templates for the books in the documentation suite and ensure that documents are tested before they are delivered. You will write all the books in the suite and you are therefore as at ease writing installation guides as you are at writing APIs and online help. You will also advise the design team on the usability of the product or application.<br>  You will work with a team that includes engineers (usually mechanical and electrical) and software developers. You will most likely report to someone who has no experience in or knowledge of technical writing, although you might report to someone who has worked with a technical writer in the past. If the previous technical writer did a mediocre job—as is, unfortunately, often the case—you may find that you are disliked or regarded with suspicion until you prove your worth. <br>  <br>  Working on a Writing Team<br>  Writing teams can comprise as few as two writers or as many as two hundred writers. As an inexperienced writer, you will have more chance of getting hired to work in a large team than a small team. The larger the writing team, the more mature its policies and procedures for developing documentation and managing the documentation project. <br>  <br>  You will report to someone who is an experienced writer. At first, you will be given easy projects to work on and you will be responsible for only one or two documents in the documentation suite. Your work will be closely monitored and you might be asked to rewrite parts of your documents more than once. You will learn to manage your time, use the desktop publishing software, interview subject-matter experts (SMEs), research glossary terms, and organize information. As you become more experienced, you will be given increasingly difficult documents to write (a product description, for example, is more difficult to write than an installation guide). <br>  <br>  Most large writing teams will have templates that you will use as the basis of your documentation. Some templates can be quite complex, others quite simple. Regardless, pay attention to how the template is designed and put together. You might one day be required to design a template. Template design is a skill that few know how to do well.<br>  <br>  Working as a Freelance Technical Writer<br>  If you decide to work as a freelancer, you will be hired to complete a specific task within a finite period of time. You are paid according to an hourly rate or, inadvisably, a flat rate, which you negotiate with your client when you are hired. You will not receive any employee benefits and when the contract ends you will not receive unemployment insurance. You are not eligible for maternity leave benefits. <br>  <br>  A contract can be renewed, but you might not be told that it is renewed until only a couple of days or weeks before your current contract is to end. Whether you begin looking for a contract with another company during the time of not knowing will depend on how certain you are that your current contract will be renewed. <br>  <br>  The rates you charge depend more on what the market will bear than on your level of experience. You will keep track of the hours you work and you will submit an invoice to the company on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. Your check is not processed by the payroll department, but, rather, by the accounts receivable department. It can take up to six weeks to receive a check. <br>  <br>  Since taxes are not withheld from the check, you must set aside a portion of the amount earned so that you can pay your taxes when the time comes. You should also set aside a portion of your check so that you can support yourself during downtimes between contracts. Until recently, a six-month reserve of funds was considered sufficient; nowadays, it is safer to set aside an eight- to twelve-month reserve.<br>  <br>  Even though you are paid at a higher rate than a full-time technical writer, the company you work for saves money because you are not an employee. Companies do not have to pay taxes on consultants at the same rate that they do for employees. Since governments make more money from companies that hire employees than they do from companies that hire consultants, they tend to take a dim view of companies that hire large numbers of consultants. Furthermore, since you as a consultant can claim many more tax write-offs than an employee, governments might take a dim view of you too, unless you have your own employees. If the government, at least in the United States and Canada, believes that, for all intents and purposes, you are an employee and not a consultant, they can deny any claims you make on your income tax return and they can force your client to pay taxes as though you were an employee.<br>  <br>  What do I mean by "for all intents a|`|df0ca584f37b18da28a65e5d1e76f95baa	You can earn Rs.25000 very first month from internet.

AA11966821	First of all, you have to know Canadian law.  In order to sit the bar exam, you have to have the proper education from an approved school.  If your application is accepted, you have to pass the exam on Canadian federal and provincial law.  You might also have to be a Canadian citizen or legal permanent resident to take the exam and be sworn in to the bar.<br>  <br>  Your law school qualifications from India probably do not meet Canadian requirements (or the requirements of any other country, for that matter).  Few foreign countries' bar admission requirements & legal education meet the requirements for some other country.  If you are a lawyer, then you already know that each country, and often each state/province within a country, has its own laws, legal procedures, etc.<br>  <br>  As for what they get paid, lawyers are not usually on salary, except for brand new grads taken on by large firms.  For the most part, lawyers make a percentage of billings.  The rest of the billings have to pay for rent and office expenses, secretaries and paralegal staff, the law library, professional insurance and other insurances, override to the supervising partner, and the normal expenses of running any business.<br>  <br>  If you are seeking employment as a lawyer in Canada, you probably have no chance whatsoever.

hvcjyEmDaa	Call a mortgage broker, and go through the numbers. Then you can realistically weigh your options. Call a realtor and see what your townhouse is going for- a marketing estimate is free. The realtor should tell you how long it will take to sell your townhouse. If you decide you want to sell in this market (and it could take a long while) go shopping for a new home after yours is sold. Obviously, you could use more space. A two bedroom with four kids is probably pretty cramped. But, if you stay put and wait for prices to stabilize, you may be better off, because prices are declining rapidly in most places. If you pay down your mortgage ( make extra payments and SPECIFY that the be applied to principal) you will save a lot of money in the long run. I would not put the bulk of your savings into your townhome. You still owe a lot, and if you or your wife loses a job, that money will be lost to you. You need your nest egg. Good luck!<br>  p.s.- If you refinance, plan on staying there. The costs of new title insurance, appraisal, bank fees, etc. have to be factored into your decision. You are better off just making additional payments to principal on your existing mortgage than plowing more into this home, since it is too small and you don't really want to stay there.|`|auegTf2iaa	Your townhouse is probably worth 76K to 82K now buddy...

There is no time limit on it.  Were their parts on order for your work order?  Sometimes supplies take a bit to come in, especially doors.  When we take a work order we ask (PTE), Permission to Enter, if they have pets, phone number.  As a courtesy, if a work order had been sitting while awaiting for supplies, we would leave them a copy of the work order to say we had to order supplies and the work order was still open but we do contact our client if several weeks had passed as a courtesy or we have left them a note saying we were coming in the next day.  But it is not required.  It is good you spoke to the office to let them know what happened so in the future they can give that courtesy to any other client going forward.  Good Luck and sorry to hear.  It happened to me once and it was shocking to awaken finding a cleaning crew in my bedroom while I was sleeping dividing up my belongings because they thought this was an apartment that was evicted.  What a treat to awaken to.  I wasn't the property manager on that community, it was a mistake on the apartment number.

If you didn't make over $1600 with them, you can still report it yourself as income, by putting "HSH" next to line 7 on the 1040 and adding the amount of  wages you received to your total income.

NG6eeCfuaa	In NY State, liability is the only mandatory insurance that you have to carry. Keep in mind, liability insurance (personal injury and property damage) have nothing to do with yourself, or your vehicle. It's liability insurance should somebody else be injured by you and your vehicle. The personal injury limits and property damage limits are for other people, should you injure them in an accident. <br>  <br>  Optional coverages, are collision and comprehensive. Should you wish to insure your vehicle for theft, glass damage, body damage, etc......you can pay for this additional coverage. Now if you have a car loan on the vehicle, these coverages become mandatory. If you own your car outright, they are optional. With that said, if your car is a 1990 Ford Taurus worth about 500 bucks, you don't need these coverages. If you have a 2000 Honda Civic in nice shape which is still worth about three grand, I'd pony up for the comp and collision. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Think about what this job requires, and think about an answer that indicates what your previous company didn't have but this job does. <br>  You might say you don't feel the current position enables you to show your full potential and you are looking for a new challenge.<br>  <br>  Try to talk about challenges in the old job, how you overcame them and how you now wish to use that knowledge and the skills you gained to help you contribute to their organisation.<br>  <br>  Don't make it simply about money (even if it is) as this means you are more concerned with what they can do for you rather than the other way around.<br>  <br>  The best practice is always be honest, but do think about the way you put it across.  The answer they look for is that you do not "bad-mouth" past employers and have a clear idea of what you want and what you can do for them.<br>  <br>  Keep it positive and make the reason for a leaving a constructive one such as a new challenge, thrilling new opportunity, increased responsibility or learning opportunites and you will not be far off the mark.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ug3a6qAFaa	Do not tell that for the sake of money, also do not criticise the current job or the organisation.<br>  <br>  Just give vuage answer like i am just looking for better opportunities in the market|`|9nTQj7vMaa	itz an eazy 1 u knw? juz say dem dat u r nt interested 2 do dat job coz dey r nt givin u enough salary or watevr u feel wrong in der.... datz al,<br>  .......... itz so simple dude|`|YNKakLMraa	dont know about u but i had told that sir i had to give the chance for my juniors who r roaming around inth market for the job
bd9b10c61be129eb44a25e767b74c0dbaa	It really depends on what type of Marine insurance you are referring to. Typically Marine insurance is also commonly called cargo insurance covering cargo or real property in transit.  Extensions to the policy offer a broad cover period and components such as storing while warehoused after shipment until accepted at destination.  <br>  <br>  It can also be Marine General Liability (MGL), Protection & Indemnity (P&I), etc. <br>  <br>  Let me know what type of policy your company has and explain the loss scenario better so I can understand the issue your having. I don't understand the "natural or manual" reference.  Thanks!

Some of the strongest background checks would be federal investigator type positions where they not only do the generic checks of your criminal, credit, and employment history but also visit your neighbors, old school friends, etc.  Obviously it wont go that far with getting a job as a store clerk.  But you get the idea.  Cash handling jobs with private employers generally do a lot of probing into criminal and credit histories as well as they don't want someone who has a history or is in need of stealing money.<br>  <br>  Stuff like college records they just tell you to send your official transcripts over.  Degree mill schools can be found so easily these days by just a google search so need to really even call that an investigation.<br>  <br>  One thing to understand is that background checks are not always completed when you are hired.

According to the Ohio lottery website, the current MegaMillions jackpot is $145 Million and the Cash option is $95.2 Million.  That comes to about $65,655,000 on a $100 Million jackpot.<br>  The highest Federal income tax rate is currently 35% ($22,979,250).

VecVZ15naa	The first thing you need to do is contact your local County Health Department. They'll tell you what the cart has to have (in your area) to meet code, and what permits you'll need. This way you don't buy a cart that ends up costing you three times as much 'cause it needs up-grades.<br>  Next you can shop for new carts, I've included a few links to some manufacturers, or you can check out craigslist or ebay. Then you'll want to start scouting a location. Again your Health Department will let you no if there are any limits on locations. And of course you'll want make sure you've got plenty of foot traffic, no or little competition, etc.<br>  And, Finally you can check out the forums at "roadfood.com" there are several vendors and other professionals there who have contributed to the many threads on this very subject.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Good Luck! :)|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	I had this idea myself.|`|2CHBAgJwaa	if you live in a busy city try the main streets like new york but make sure you have a pemit|`|iT31pFLqaa	if your a girl which I presume you are according to your avitar, you need to get a permit to work in your city, sex sells, so wear a bikini and you will need to find a good location. good luck.

For tax purposes, all the IRA accounts are treated as one account.|`|AA10259042	No there is a limit of $5000 that you can contribute each year in total.  You can have more than one IRA but the total contribution must be limited to $5000.  It is up to you, not the bank to make sure you do not exceed the limit.  If you do, you can ask to have the over contribution withdrawn.  You need to do so before April 15, actually sooner so the paperwork can be properly done or you might suffer a headache.

wMeQoXkzaa	When you deal on Ebay you should use Paypal but if you can't do that just make sure you check out the person's rating (100% is ideal with hundreds or thousands of sales completed). I wouldn't order from anyone with less than 97 or 98% or fewer than 100 sales since they don't have a proven record of reliablity. <br>  It's up to you of course but that's the criteria I use when ordering stuff. With a paypal account though, you are more protected since paypal will investigate and refund your money if you do not receive the item you ordered. <br>  With a money order it will take longer to get too since the buyer will be wary and need to make sure the money order goes through before they ship your item since there are counterfeit and "bad" money orders out there as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck :0)  Usually things work out fine, there are just a few scammers and losers out there who are thieves and scum and try to take from others without earning it.|`|92gcQFTIaa	Ebay no longer allows payment by check or money order for that reason.  PayPal is the recommended way to go, it protects the seller and buyer.|`|QjrN8aM5aa	It's always a chance you take when you buy off ebay or any other online site.  You simply can't guarantee that you are getting what you buy if you are not there, hands on, to make the purchase.  <br>  <br>  Did you check the seller's feedback?  A poor feedback score will give you a good clue about the seller's integrity.  However, read the negatives if there are any.  Sometimes purchasers will give neg feedback for other reasons such as shipping rate or slow shipping.<br>  <br>  You would be better off to use a credit card thru Pay Pal, or use Pay Pal. You can open a dispute with Ebay if you do not get your item or if you do not get what you bought.  You can also open a dispute with Pay Pal and cancel the payment in either of those circumstances.  <br>  <br>  You can't uncash a money order.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
ThKkn5fKaa	You'll love it here!  Haha.<br>  <br>  First off, one of the first things that I hear about Pittsburgh from people who travel here is that they can't believe how nice everybody is.  It's one of those best of both worlds situations, where you get the benefits of a large city, but everything is still very community and family oriented, as if it were a smaller population center.<br>  <br>  You'll be happy to find that the cost of living is very low here when compared with other large cities.  My family recently bought a brand new town house with appliances and about 2,500ft of living space and a decent yard for $200,000.<br>  <br>  As far as the neighborhoods go, it's fairly typical of any city.  The oldest houses are closest to the city and the newest are about 25-30 minutes outside on average.  One thing that is very unique to Pittsburgh neighborhoods is the universities.  With Pitt, CMU, Duquesne, Point Park, and Carlow all in the city limits, Pittsburgh has a very young population near to the city.  The older communities like Lawrenceville and Bloomfield are becoming very gentrified as young professionals graduate from school and move in.  The mass exodus caused by the collapse of the steel industry has stopped, as students graduate and stay within the city to work.  This is also causing the traditionally older population to slowly get younger.  Of course, this also means that there is a thriving club and bar scene too, if that's your cup of tea.<br>  <br>  Jobs are declining just as is the case with other parts of the country.  But, Pittsburgh seems to be dodging the recession better than a lot of the other major cities.  It stems a lot from the fact that Pittsburgh's main industries are medicine and higher learning, both of which are very recession-proof.  Because of that, there have actually been articles written in both Time magazine and USA Today about how Pittsburgh is a great example for how cities can soften the hit of the recession.<br>  <br>  My favorite thing about Pittsburgh is the cultural stuff.  We have one of the greatest symphonies in the world.  We have an opera, a ballet, a professional theater.  We're one of the main stops for touring Broadway shows.  And we have the amazing Carnegie Museums and Libraries, as well as the Andy Warhol Museum.  There is also a national aviary and plenty of parks all around.  A lot of this is possible thanks to what is known as the RAD tax.  Where most other places have a 6% sales tax, Allegheny Country has a 7% sales tax.  This extra one percent goes entirely to infrastructure: parks, libraries, conservation, sports, accessibility, culture.  That sort of thing.  I heartily disagree with the other poster who called our city ugly.  Take a look:<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/pittsburgh_showcase/pool/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/groups/pittsburgh_...</a><br>  <br>  Safety wise, Pittsburgh is relatively safe city, in large part because most of the crime is relegated to specific neighborhoods.  Just avoid the Hill District or the Homewood/Brushton area and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to build a home, you can check out North Allegheny north of the city, Collier and South Fayette west of the city, Plum and Murrysville east of the city, and Upper St. Claire south of the city.  There are plenty of other places of course, but these are what immediately come to mind.  If you want to buy, there are countless neighborhoods surrounding the city, far too many to name.<br>  <br>  Okay, I'll stop blabbering on and on.  But please, if you would like any more information, just click on my profile and send me an email.  I'll be happy to offer any other information.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	About the only thing to do in Pittsburgh is watch the Steelers..<br>  <br>  Have fun...|`|ZdlRGYZXaa	Ohh your gonna love it . <br>  Pit Pa is a Great Place for young people .

UDsOvTQ2aa	The Army is divided between officers and enlisted men.  <br>  A General would be quite a high officer rank.  There are very few officers that are able to achieve the rank of general.  Attendance at West Point would be very helpful to advancing your career as an officer.  With due diligence a capable individual might expect to reach the rank of major or lieutenant colonel and that would be considered having served a successful career.<br>  A Sergeant Major would be quite a high rank for enlisted personnel.  Again you would find few enlisted men that would be able to achieve that rank, but it would certainly be more attainable than being a General.  A more likely scenario for a dedicated solder would be to achieve a position of staff sergeant.  <br>  Advancement is based on numerous things.  Depends a lot on Army needs.  In the Vietnam War when there were many losses of supervisory personnel, advancement was quicken as the losses would cause the Army to have greater need.  In periods of peace or shrinking Army size, the rate of advancement would be less.  Also advancement would be conditional on performance reviews by your superiors.|`|JdRTGIUYaa	Lots of factors<br>  MOS<br>  Your personal Drive<br>  School<br>  points<br>  You cant make it to general as an enlisted you would have to go to west point or OCS.
T9c3u1ATaa	I'm not sure about retirees...It's true that it's a little bit unclear but I believe that retirees tend to be more conservative than younger people. However, the purpose of the stimulus package is to spend.

6g97hxCCaa	If you were still officially employed by them 15 weeks before the expected date of childbirth, and you meet all the other requirements to received SMP (e.g length of service, minimum earnings) then your former employer is still legally obliged to pay your SMP.  This is a government rule that they cannot get out of, regardless of whether you were dismissed or left voluntarily.  More info here: <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?r.l1=1073858787&r.l3=1080898273&r.lc=en&r.t=RESOURCES&type=RESOURCES&itemId=1080903421&r.i=1080903562&r.l2=1080898061&r.s=sc" rel="nofollow">http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/act...</a><br>  <br>  My advice would be to write to them explaining that as far as you are aware you were still employed by them in your qualifying week for SMP (it might be handy to include a print out of the page from Business Link, from the link above, highlighting the section about payment of SMP when employment ends).  As such you are seeking confirmation from them that they will be paying your SMP and if they are refusing to pay your SMP you request a completed SMP1 form informing you why you won't get paid.<br>  <br>  If they don't respond or they are refusing to pay and you what to dispute this then this page has advice about what to do next:  <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/advisers/ni17a/smp/smp_21.asp#decision" rel="nofollow">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/advisers/ni17a/smp...</a><br>  <br>  I would really encourage you to seek advice on unfair dismissal as well.

It seems to me that the company has just been trying to find a way to get out of paying you while you are off with baby? Speak to Citizens Advice and they will be able to guide you and point you in the right direction to sue your former employer if they agree that your dismissal was unfair.|`|h0u4VVUDaa	difficult...if you think you have been sacked unfairly and because you are pregnant  this is illegal and you can sue. there are a lot of "grey" areas to this though, you need to seek legal advice.ask to see a solicitor you will get legal aid so dont worry about the cost. if youve been sacked and it is your fault though you will get no maternity pay from your employer, and if you havent been paying full tax and insurance you wont get any maternity pay from the social either.<br>  its maddening i worked part time for the same company for 12 years and left two days before i had my baby...i didnt get a penny from anywhere because i was part time and my husband was working he was expected to keep me.yet my neice and her partner who have both never worked in their lives got payments for everything!!! its so annoying!<br>  good luck!|`|AA10971128	You will obviously not receive any occupational maternity pay (OMP) as you have breached your contract and therefore have lost your rights to the pay.

DGFu03Q3aa	Dear M: If you were married on Dec 31 2008 your choices are MFJ or MFS.  If you guys did not live together at any time during the last 6 months of the tax year the IRS then says you maybe considered unmarried for tax purposes. Your ex could have filed HOH and claimed your child if separated last 6 months of the year and she was the custodial parent and supported the household. <br>  <br>  Now its a question of choosing the correct filing status and fixing last year. MFJ normally works best but the refund check is issued in both names, could be a problem. If you guys can not agree you maybe stuck with MFS.

fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Your bad for getting the puppy BEFORE you received consent from the landlord.<br>  <br>  Your landlord homeowners insurance most likely has a clause for "dangerous breeds".   A pit bull is ranks #1 on the dangerous breed list.  If her insurance was to find out that a pit bull in on the property...they will cancel her policy.  Your landlord needs proof that your puppy is not a pit bull so she can submit the paperwork to her insurance company. <br>  <br>  "I guess what I'm asking is do I have to prove anything"?<br>  Only if you want consent to keep the puppy.|`|dPLkNRNuaa	Your puppy will have to have shots and a check up anyway.<br>  <br>  So, when you make the next appointment  for your puppy to get his shots....see if his vet will write something out for you.

That way....the manager is off your case and it does not cost you any additional money.  <br>  <br>  Then I'd keep a copy of the letter in a file. That way, if this question ever comes up again...you have the documentation. <br>  (I keep a file of all my dogs vet records, check ups, micro-chip number/info. Rabies certificates). If you don't keep such a file...it's a good idea to start one. <br>  <br>  If that does not work....see if there is a pit bull breeder in your area or a pit bull lovers club that would be willing to put something in writing.   Your local animal shelter or humane society may be able to give you some recommendations.  If anyone knows what a pure breed pit bull puppy looks like....it's going to be a reputable breeder.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	If he's asking your going to have to get something in writing from a vet that your puppy is not a pit-bull.

It doesn't say you can either.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You've basically answered your own question with "Our lease states that we can have any pet we want IF the landlord gives consent."  That means that NO pet is allowed unless the landlord consents.<br>  <br>  The landlord's consent is based upon verification of the breed of the animal. The reason the landlord wants such written verification is that her insurer may well cancel her policy if she allows "one of those bully breeds" on her property.  The property manager is protecting the interests of the owner-client.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you want to keep the dog, you will need to provide such breed verification.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you did this entirely backwards.  You FIRST obtain permission for the pet, and THEN you get the pet.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	Only a veterinarian can certify the breed..and they won't do it for free.<br>  <br>  Understand that the landlord's insurance or the local ordinance may not permit him to allow tenant's on his property that have certain classified breeds.<br>  <br>  He doesn't have to see the puppy...he has to have WRITTEN PROOF for someone legally qualified to determine the breed.<br>  <br>  Keyword:  You can have the pet IF the landlord gives consent.<br>  <br>  He isn't giving his consent unless you provide the proof...he has every legal right to do that.<br>  <br>  She DOES NOT have to specify breed in the lease...all she has to say is that it's "subject to consent".<br>  <br>  So, if you don't want to conform to the lease, then get rid of the puppy.<br>  <br>  PS:  What your neighbors are doing is none of your business.  If the LL is in RI..then how do you KNOW that the LL is even aware that your neighbor even has a boxer?|`|hvcjyEmDaa	She does have the right, because many insurers won't insure the home for liability if there is a pit bull mix in it.She can still be sued as the homeowner, even if the dog is not hers.<br>  <br>  Here is a description of the problem, from insure.com:<br>  <br>   Homeowners<br>  Condo Owners<br>  Mobile HomeTownhouses<br>  Renters <br>  Flood<br>  Home insurance for dog owners<br>  <br>  By Insure.com<br>  Last updated Dec. 2, 2008<br>  <br>  Depending on what breed of dog you own, where you live and your insurance company, it could be difficult to buy home insurance that includes liability for your dog.<br>  <br>  Roughly 39 percent of American households have at least one dog, according to The Humane Society of the United States. But as the costs of dog-bite litigation spiral, some insurance companies are refusing to write coverage for owners of certain breeds. According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), dog-bite claims cost insurers about $356.2 million in 2007, up by 10.5 percent from the previous year.<br>  <br>  Dog bite primer<br>  <br>  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that dogs bite 4.7 million people annually, resulting in 800,000 injuries that require medical attention. Almost half of them are children.<br>  The average cost of a dog-bite insurance claim was $24, 511 in 2007, according to III.<br>  Roughly 39 percent of American households have at least one dog, according to The Humane Society of the United States<br>  According to III, dog bite claims cost insurers about $356.2 million in 2007, up by 10.5 percent from the previous year.<br>  Dog owners in 33 states and the District of Columbia are legally liable for deaths or injuries caused by their dogs. Pennsylvania and Michigan have laws that prohibit insurers from cancelling or denying coverage to owners of specific breeds, according to III.<br>  While there might not be an industry-wide "blacklist" of breeds, it's best to check with your agent before you buy certain dog breeds. According to the Lester Kalmanson Agency Inc. — which sells liability insurance to owners of dogs commonly identified as "dangerous breeds" — the list could include:<br>  <br>  Pit bulls<br>  Rottweilers<br>  Chow chows <br>  German shepherds<br>  Siberian huskies<br>  Alaskan malamutes<br>  Doberman pinschers<br>  Presa Canario bulldogs <br>  Great Danes <br>  Boxers<br>  Akitas<br>  Wolf-hybrids<br>  Some home insurers have lists of breeds and crossbreeds they will not insure; other insurers consider such breeds on a case-by-case basis, or charge more for certain "biting" breeds such as pit bulls. Some home insurers require dog owners to sign liability waivers for dog bites.<br>  <br>  In Michigan and Pennsylvania, it's illegal for home insurance companies to deny coverage simply because a home has a dog of a particular breed, according to III. Other states have similar laws pending.<br>  <br>  Some insurance companies will sell you coverage regardless of what type of breed you own. Jeff McCollum, spokesperson for State Farm, says that there are good and bad dogs within each breed, just like there are responsible and irresponsible dog owners.<br>  <br>  "State Farm does not discriminate against certain breeds," McCollum says.<br>  <br>  Ohio is the exception. The state recently adopted a statute that labels a pit bull as a "vicious dog." Therefore, State Farm does not offer coverage under its home insurance policies for pit bulls in Ohio.<br>  <br>  State Farm does require policyholders to answer questions about dogs on their home insurance applications. Specifically, the company wants to know if a dog has ever bitten anyone or if it has been trained for attack purposes.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the dog has bitten someone, State Farm will want to know the circumstances surrounding the bite to determine if it is likely to happen again and if precautions have been taken to prevent it. Other factors the company looks at are the seriousness of the injury and whether the attack was provoked or unprovoked.<br>  <br>  State Farm has paid out roughly $80 million annually, from 2002 to 2008, for dog bite-related claims, McCollum says. While the overall number of bites appears to be decreasing, the rise of medical costs per incident offsets the decrease, he adds.<br>  <br>  Considering history<br>  <br>  Some companies will ask "Do you own a vicious dog?" on home insurance applications. Previous dog-bite incidents will show up on your claims history, which insurers check before issuing a policy. Some insurers will consider whether an attack was provoked or unprovoked, but it depends on the dog's history.<br>  <br>  Previous dog-bite incidents will show up on your claims history, which insurers check before issuing a policy.<br>  <br>  "We are most concerned about any dog bites or attacks," McCollum says. "If a dog had two or three unprovoked bites, we would probably still take a very, very close look at the situation . . . [but] one dog bite wouldn't necessarily mean automatic cancellation of your policy."<br>  <br>  But other insurers may cancel or refuse to renew an existing home insurance policy, decline your application for a new one or attach an exclusion for the dog to the policy.

There are companies all over that buy up bad credit card debt and try to collect. I would suggest to look up the statue of limitation in your state for how long they can file a lawsuit against you to recover the money. If the statue is up, stop talking to them, if they have no record of it and see if someone contacts you about it. The statue of limitations does not mean they can not come after you after it is up it just means you can use it for a defense if it ever goes to court.    Source  MD Board of Estimates and Taxation

AA11327323	I hate these fat cat loan sharks, and all the bankers.                                   Right, that's off my chest!  Now the advice bit:-                                    We are talking about the EU group here, they all work hand in glove, (to a certain extent).                                    That includes banks ,and loan companies.  I can only give you my opinion. The loan company is the one to watch out for, but the amount you are talking about is very small. 1500, I doubt if they would bother you over that. What can they do?                                     Bank 2000 a pittance, but you will need money in Germany, if your bank closes your account because you have stopped your direct debits to them, how will you get cash in Germany?                                    If you only have enough cash to get there and last a few weeks , and then you know you have an income of some sort coming in from Germany , I would suggest you go for it.                                     If not then you are living in a dream world.  Your credit rating in the UK would be below zero, so if you are looking for a return to the UK, you will find it very diffiicult to get credit in this country, for anything including a mortgage.Not a bad thing I think, if you can do without it?                                       There is another solution , go to these people you owe money to tell them anything you like, lost your job etc, offer them a minimum repayment on the loans, (very minimal) and hope for the best.                                         These folk are leeches, they just want their money back, with a lot of interesr! They will accept your offer, they know they have no choice, you can go to people that will help you, for free.                                          This would ensure  your credit rating in the UK on your return.                                             I do have a good example of this situation , but I am not going to air it on here.                                             My email address is available if you want to contact me.

Not much you might say but I've been able to upgrade my car, pay off all my debts and am looking forward to my first holiday abroad in seven years. My life has changed cause I no longer worry about people chasing me for money by phone or letter or my car breaking down (so often). I also look forward to payday as my months salary is all mine now. Sometimes I don't even know I've been paid as I still have a few hundred pounds in my account just before payday instead of considering another payday loan cause I've maxed out everything else. Lastly I've still got about 8k left and no plans to spend it. I've stopped drinking heavily and smoking as I have no money worries anymore and have a social life again after many .years.|`|6STxgw9laa	10'000.|`|fugmQcjBaa	200,000

You could do both, buy a domain and then hosting, but since most hosts offer a free domain with their hosting, you don't have to buy a domain name separately. Powweb offers hosting of multiple sites on the same hosting plan, so you can buy additional domains (from them or elsewhere) and host them all on the same plan (at no additional cost).|`|3mAgM405aa	Healthy Mom's response is right on.  I would highly recommend homestead.com for hosting purposes since their beginning monthly rate is about $10.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Do the two transactions separately.<br>  <br>  Get the domain name first. I use GoDaddy -- <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.godaddy.com</a> Depending on whether it's a .com, .info, .tv, .org, or something else, it'll cost you between $2 and $14 for the first year and about $10-$14 in subsequent years. There are other good domain sites out there, too.<br>  <br>  One tip: With GoDaddy and some of the others, you get a lot of extras with your domain name. For instance, I get a free e-mail account--one that I can access on line, or have the e-mails forwarded to me. That way, for instance, if my URL is www.RespectableBusiness.com, I can have an e-mail account as Don@RespectableBusiness.com. In fact, I really can have as many accounts as I want. And that's a lot better than having an e-mail account as Don@Hotmail.com or Don@Yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Then buy the hosting. I use Tripod -- <a href="http://www.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripod.com</a> It's a little bit clunky, but probably the bargain of the century. I pay $4.95 a month and have multiple web sites.

At one time it was very common for web hosts to register domains for you, but they would do it in their name.  What this meant was if you had a dispute with the hosting company they could hold the name hostage to prevent you from transferring your business elsewhere.  <br>  <br>  I don't thing that this is a common practice any more, but if you buy your domain from another company there is less potential for problems. <br>  <br>  If you get a "free" domain with your hosting package then you need to make sure that you own it and control it and not them, otherwise pass on the "free" name and buy your own.<br>  <br>  A good source of recommended hosts is <a href="http://www.hostingscorecard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hostingscorecard.com</a>  They have rated the top webhosts based on a minimum of 1000 user reviews/comments over the last 6 months.

AA11598210	I live in California too. Due to the economy we had to cancel our group policy which was really good, and go to a more major medical type coverage.  My son (26) who is a partner with my husband is only having to pay $54.00 a month for his and it is through Blue Shield. It's a PPO plan, and has prescription coverage, but only major medical coverage other than 1 yearly physical a year which is free.    Our insurance agent is Lisa and you can reach her at1-800-611-9057  ext  2206. She sells health insurance for Costco members which is what we had, but also sells for all the major carriers as well. She is the one who found this policy for us and it is saving us about $450.00 a month from our group coverage, so we are thrilled.    Anyway we have used her for years now, and she is awesome at working hard to find just what you need. I think she will do you a great job!    Good luck in finding new employment soon.

MHW8fIP4aa	The only way the loans can affect your state or federal refunds will be if the loans are federally insured. Which there is a good chance of, considering Sallie Mae has ALL types of loans. However, Sallie Mae would have to file a claim with the Feds against his loan, causing either wages to be garnished or refunds to be attached. You should have been notified by now if that happened. The only way to know, is to call Sallie Mae. However, you should amend the tax returns IMMEDIATELY and file separately, this way your portion of the refund cannot be touched, assuming you are not a co-signer on his student loan. If it is too late you can file an injured spouse form, which will allow the  IRS to determine which portion of the refund belonged to him and which to you. This process will take a while so be prepared to be very aggravated.|`|aUQ1ridmaa	They may try and keep the full amount of your refund.<br>  <br>  If this is not your debt, it was not incurred when you were married, and he is solely responsible for paying it back you may have an option if they do take all of your refund.

jZMDYsVOaa	Hi,    According to the Daily FX update i read on a forex blog, the Euro took a hit from the US Dollar and Japanese Yen today as fears of a sharp downturn in Eastern Euorpe. On Wednesday, a first-tier rating company, Fitch, downgraded Russian foreign and domestic currency ratings. It has been widely speculated that Russia has been hit the hardest during the economic crisis as Oil prices have declined sharply, but Fitchs declaration demonstrated how bad Russia really is. And with so many ties to the EU countries that it trades with, the fears for the stability of the Euro are now called into question. The EUR/USD was down over 1% at 3:30 GMT to 1.2903 and just under 1% against the Yen to 115.6.    I am expecting a reversal in the trend.    Cheers|`|lEX3CjWlaa	I'm not sure I understand your question. Forex stands for 'Foreign Exchange'. The Eur/USD is traded on the forex market.    Does this answer your question?|`|wLeZNlqjaa	I think the Euro has a big room to go down given that they have some room to cut rates. We are basically zero.
RqQDKEVHaa	Sounds very convoluted.<br>  <br>  If you trust the friend...if he's really your friend...maybe it's legit. But why PayPal rather than just giving him a check?<br>  <br>  What I'd suggest is partial payments, as is done when you're rehabbing a house.<br>  <br>  Break the payments into 4 parts. Roughly 25%, 25%, 15%, and 10% of the final cost.<br>  <br>  The first two payments cover parts. You pay 25%. He buys parts with those and shows you the receipt, and starts building the computer. When he's done with that, you take a look to at least see that he's done something. You pay another 25%. This covers all the remaining parts and labor. After paying 50%, there now should be a functioning computer.<br>  <br>  You pay another 15%, test the computer, and take possession of the computer. Now you've paid, and he's received, 85% of the payment due. The remaining 10% is a 30 day holdback. Probably when you take possession of the computer, you can't fully test it. And besides, sometimes parts fail. You pay him the remaining 10% at the end of 30 days. If something goes wrong with the computer in the meantime, he fixes it at his expense.<br>  <br>  That way, he's getting paid along the way, so he shouldn't be out-of-pocket for any money. Meanwhile, you're making sure he isn't scamming you. That's what I'd suggest.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|78lT75AAaa	unfortunately, if this is a bogus deal, you wont get your money back. unlike ebay, paypal is just an easy way to transfer money. you can pay for ebay items using paypal knowing that ebay will recover your money if anything happens. <br>  unless this is over ebay, get the computer delivered first or you should draw up a legally binding contract, get his signature, then make the deal.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, but yeah it sounds a bit too dodgy for my liking. good luck anyway!
T4s5tl6raa	Some credit cards offer introductory purchase deals. If you need to buy something and can repay it in the short term then you can get away without paying any interest. Currently the best deal is from Marks & Spencer Money, who is offering 0% for 10 months. However, if you can't repay the debt in the 10 month term, then the interest rate jumps to 15.9%. <br>  <br>  If you need cash, then never take it out on a credit card. Most charge a rate of around 25%, which is payable from day one, there are no interest free days like on purchases. You will also have to pay a fee of around 3%, min ￡3 on each withdrawal.<br>  <br>  Personal loans charge from 7.8%. Once the rate is agreed you will have to repay the money at a set amount each month over the term. This is a better option if you need to repay the debt over a longer term or prefer to know what you are paying each month to help you budget.|`|AA11908567	It's best tom read these articles about each and then you can decide what is better for you:<br>  <br>  www.moneysavingexpert.com/loans/|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	A loan is better depending on what your personal needs are as the interest rate usually remains the same over the period of repayment and you can shop around for the best deal. Credit cards will carry a higher interest rate and the bank can alter that rate whenever they choose.

MYxYzOLCaa	You don't have to rush - the stock market will be falling for at least several more months.<br>  <br>  Now is a great time to buy since everything is so low.<br>  <br>  Choose companies that you have heard of (they will most likely be strong), although some are pretty battered at this point.<br>  <br>  Choose a dividend paying stock, and a stock where the dividend has been growing for decades, such as JNJ or PG.<br>  <br>  Buy BNI (Burlington Northern)<br>  <br>  Don't buy a stock just because the shareprice is really low (that means nothing) or because the share price chart has fallen off a cliff.  Chances are it will fall further.  Pick stocks where the shareprices have fallen, but not crazy amounts, and also still pay their dividends.<br>  <br>  Look at Yahoo Finance or Google Finance to see statistics and share prices for stocks.<br>  <br>  Don't invest a lot of money all at once, especially because this is new for you.<br>  <br>  Invest a small amount relative to how much money you have.  Feel the reality of it a bit, and then invest more a little at a time.  This way you won't make the mistake of entering at the wrong time, or choosing the wrong stock and investing too much into it.|`|Ob6YXdAqaa	I'm 15 as well, and investment's sort of my passion, so I might be able to help a bit. <br>  Trust me - buying stocks is a good idea, but wait just a couple weeks. The dow just hit the lowest since '02. If it keeps declining in the next 2-3 weeks, we are in some serious sh*t. DO NOT buy stocks then, in anything. By that time, nothing is safe - not even Johnson and Johnson (well, okay, maybe them). <br>  If it's okay - buy a few shares of a bunch of blue stocks. Analyze their financial statments, their board, their history, and their price. Find out if the fall in their prices had anything to do with the company. If it did, don't buy. If it didn't - buy. These stocks have value that just isn't being realized, and will eventually pick up. The Fed estimates we'll see a rebound in two - three years. Guess what? That'll be when we're starting to go to college. Good time to sell your (hopefully) rebounded stocks. <br>  As for the Index you should buy in - Dow and Nasdaq. Industrials are like suits - they never go out of style. Technology is what defines the first half of the 20th century, so their likely to come back. <br>  But more important than the index is the stock. Like I said before, make sure you know about the value of the *company*. This is how Warren Buffett made his fortune. For more advice on this strategy, read Graham's "The Intelligent Investor."|`|P4eUVbbQaa	Hey man, <br>  <br>  Im 18 and poor as hell but im learning the market as well. Train yourself.

Open up a Roth IRA and buy these within it.  These people above are giving you horrible advice, you are not too young! the earlier you start the better. I started my Roth IRA at 16.  <br>  <br>  The stock market will recover and we will see double digit growth within 2 years, but you have to look long term.  <br>  <br>  Look up compounding interest.  A ROTH IRA is tax free when you take money out at 591/2 years of age.   45 years of compounding interest is much better than waiting.  Try to max your IRA.  The max for ROTH IRA contributions is $5K per year, but this can not exceed the income you claim on taxes.   <br>  <br>  If you have any additional questions email me.<br>  <br>  You are wise beyond your years to start investing now.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Never too early, would have to use a parents account. I suggest penny stocks. Small risk high reward.|`|AA10572056	I would look at blue chip stocks like General Electric.  They have been around for a long time and will rebound.  The last time their stocks were this cheap I don't think you were born yet :)  <br>  I purchased Markel Corporate Holdings (NYSE: MKL).  It is an investment fund run by the protege of Warren Buffet.  Buffets stock is worth over 100,000 per share.  If you bought even one or two shares now it may be worth several hundred thousand by the time you are ready to start a family or buy a house.  Also check out green companies, not just the ones that are planning on solar power but the ones that invest in recycling material.  We have been gradually changing over all of our products to "green".  Our wood is made without fermaldehide in the glue, our paints, stains and laquers are water based and our packaging material is made from reclaimed paper products.  We have increased our prices across the board and the second people hear that we are trying to be a leader in green production they pull out their checkbooks and ask no more questions.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	The first thing you should do is spend the next 3 years actively reading anything and everything you can about the stock market and keep your money in FDIC insured CD's until you are 18.<br>  Go to the Finance Section of Yahoo for a start and read.<br>  Follow the Dow Jones for a while and when you can get a feeling for what will happen next... (and you are 18 by then) then open up an online trading account.<br>  <br>  Research a company in detail before you decide to buy their stock.<br>  And in research I mean do your own research... the beauty of the internet is that you can dig deep if you are patient and have a handle on how to run a search engine... use your computer and do your own research.<br>  <br>  By the way.;.. do yourself a favor and also read up on Investment Scams,  Ponzi Schemes and especially "High Yield Investment Scams".

e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	I have four answers, hopefully at least one will be helpful...    1. Depression is a serious problem, well outside the scope of an online forum for job seeker advice. You really should talk to a doctor, therapist, clergyman, etc. for help with that.    2. You didn't mention if you are using job boards, but if so, consider alternatives. People are not finding jobs online these days, so relying on job boards and not hearing back can only bring you down.    3. In many cities, there are support groups for job seekers that focus on attitude as much as the nuts and bolts (resumes, etc.) Look for one of these -- ask other job seekers and any career coaches, etc. you meet.    4. Use your time wisely. Volunteer, brush up on skills. Most of all, give back. I've worked with job seekers for 10+ years, and one piece of advice that I often hear back about later ("it worked!") is this: look around, find someone whose in worse shape than you, and help them however you can. You're the one who will get the most from it.    Good luck!|`|FMmncxToaa	You are a smart person and you need to be strong and keep your head up.

You are not an unemployed loser, you are a student. Your job is to study and get good grades that will hold you in good stead for the future.    If you need some extra money try expanding your job search. Go for jobs that you may not have considered before (telesales, food service, factory, retail). The main aim is to get your foot in the door and some more money in your pocket.    Good luck and keep positive.|`|3urQfMffaa	Think of people who are worse off than you are. You'll feel better.    For instance, there are people out of work AND school through no real fault of their own. I was fired from my job a month ago for cursing out a coworker and punching the pole in the fitting room in front of customers (who reported me). I was also kicked off campus half a year ago for CONSTANTLY acting out in anger. The last straw was me throwing stuff across the library. You have marketable skills. The economy is bad, that's all.

I can't believe how bad it is out there, but you really have to be creative and come up with some different thought patterns to get you thru this!  Hang in there! Things must get better!  The best of luck and don't get discouraged.  Try some motivational books and cds ...they might help you try and turn your thoughts to more positive ones!

AA10305589	Honestly, the banks incur costs when someon uses a debit card, and just becuase they are unemployed is no a reason to not have to pay them.  The debit card is for convenience, and convenience is not free.  If somone doesn't want to pay fees, they can gett their payment by check or by direct debit, if available, and forego the convenience of a debit card.  No one is forcing anyone to use the card, it is offered as a amenity.|`|AA11357056	I don't think that the people who can least afford it are being gouged by bank fees... the states should have negotiated a flat fee per user per month.<br>  <br>  But I'm not buying the argument that the banks would be more able to help the economy by way of the additional revenue. If they really wanted to help, they'd work with some of the people who are trying to hang onto their homes...

There is NO credit card that is worth the fees and interest rate ( usually 18%APR+) to "borrow money from"...|`|TpMvr1pyaa	the one with the lowest interest rate|`|PvCngXKIaa	Use the card that offers you the best repayment terms, including lowest interest rate.  Consider all of the credit cards you carry, check out the payment terms and conditions for each and pick the best.  That said, if you have a bank account why not try for a personal loan from your bank.  Although, the interest rate will be high it won't even come close to what you are going to pay a credit card company.  Another option might be a loan from a loan company (commonly called payday loans) but that should be limited to short term loans only. Still another option might be pawn something that carries enough value to provide you with the money you need.  If you repay the loan you get your collateral back.  Last, how about borrowing from friends? Although it might not be a good option it is an option.

y4SUDnpaaa	I worked at a mortgage Company for 15 years and the rule of thumb is if you're not lowering your interest by at least 2% financially it isn't  worth it  Did the Loan Officer tell you what the difference, in dollars and cents, would decrease if you refinanced for a 1% lower interest rate. It's very little. What about discount fees if you have to pay 2% of the loan to get a !% lower interest rate you should stay where you are. You should figure out all the costs of refinancing, discount, origination fee, appraisal, credit report, job and bank account verifications, etc. It's always surprising to people that they have to start over and qualify for a new loan, but you do. Figure out how much it will cost you to refinance whether you add it to the loan or pay out of pocket. Then figure out how much you will save in lower monthly payments and see how long it would take to recoup what it cost to refinance against how much you will be saving in the lower payment amount. .Don't let anyone talk you into a refi to lower your interest  by  1%........it makes no financial sense.|`|lEX3CjWlaa	Typically that is the rule of thumb - refinance when the rates are 1% or lower than your current rate.    Was the bank guy with the bank you have your other accounts with? e.g. checking and savings. Oftentimes they will waive most, if not all the fees. I'd check around. Get at least 2 other quotes. $1300 seems a bit steep to me.    Hope this Helps

I think you should get to the bottom of why you think you may file bankruptcy and address that before considering if you should buy a new home.      There are many manageable ways to get oneself out of debt; go to your local library and check out some of Suze Orman's books - better yet, buy her most recent book Suze Orman's 2009 Action plan.  It will help you decide if you really need to consider bankruptcy or not.    If you have a lot of debt, you have a responsibility to pay it back.

If she is a carer for a disabled child she should be entitled to Income Support and Carers Allowance. Citizens Advice will have more info and can work out how much she would be entitled to as it will depend on how many children living with her    Edit- I read that as working tax credits not child tax credits- my bad, sorry! She will be entitled to IS and Carers for the disabled child, and child tax credits will depend on how many children live with her. CAB can give all relevant info to make sure she gets everything she is due as she will have to claim from different departments|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	You can get benefits for having a disabled child, but you do need to be working to get tax credits.

I was a single mum when I got divorced. From 2006 to 2008 I was claiming Income support and getting child tax credits, child benefit.

I get 86 a week for two children. Google tax credits.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	As long as you are responsible for the child you will be eligible for Child Tax Credit.

Now to answer your question, google landlord tenant laws in your state.    realtor.sailor|`|AA11296044	The best advice I can give you is have a lawyer draft your lease, make sure you run through all of the provisions like how to deal with damages and maintenance as well as late payments and penalties. Any other provisions you wish to put in the lease such as pets, subleasing, visitors, painting, changing fixtures and improvements to the property.  BE very thorough, a lawyer will be able to outline what is allowed under your municipal laws.    Always run credit,  reference and employement checks on prospective tenants.    It also never hurts to get post dated checks for the duration of the lease upon signing.

p7ZdohGTaa	Does your mother like to go to garage sales, estate sales, etc.? Maybe, if she is good at looking things up, she could start an Ebay business by selling things she finds that are great buys, unusual items, etc. She would need to research it to be sure she spends her money wisely, but this might work. If she has any special interests, the truth is that internet is growing so much, perhaps she could find a way to make money with a website geared toward something she is good at, has special interest in, etc. <br>  <br>  Does she like children? Maybe she could run a daycare in her home, if she is up to caring for two, three or four children. That can bring some money in. You don't say what is causing her pain. If she has pain from joint problems, she might try glucosamine which is very good at helping joints recover from trauma or wear and tear. Hope she finds something that works for her.

RcAofGkIaa	I applaud you for thinking about what career would suit your skills.  Not everyone thinks ahead this way.  I'm no expert, but here's what I have observed; baby boomers, (a HUGE age demographic) are aging.  People are retiring a lot, and people who can afford to retire frequently have planned well for this stage of their lives financially.  I live in an upscale area of mostly retired people.  It is very rural and quiet (I live on an island).  Most of us can afford to live in nice houses, what we CAN'T do, based on our ages, is work the way we used.  We just aren't physically as capable as we once were.  You should see the home of our neighborhood handy-man.  It is very, very, nice, and he has raised his large family with his income from being a handy-man.  Now, he works like a demon, there is no doubt about it, and he's very, very good at dang near everything he does.  His spelling and english are awful, but he can wire, plumb, build, plant, repair dang near anything.  I don't know if this will help you, but it might give you some ideas.

E7IPy6cDaa	nothing. they will just send it to you around late may.
NCZK0QyGaa	Absolutely.  The connection between fraud and the “tone at the top” of an organization has received international attention over the last few years. Tone at the top refers to the ethical atmosphere that is created in the workplace by the organization's leadership. Whatever tone management sets will have a trickle-down effect on employees of the company. If the tone set by managers upholds ethics and integrity, employees will be more inclined to uphold those same values. However, if upper management appears unconcerned with ethics and focuses solely on the bottom line, employees will be more prone to commit fraud because they feel that ethical conduct is not a focus or priority within the organization.

Usually they'll either sue you in court, or do so in arbitration and try to confirm the arbitration award in court. Either way, you'll be given notice of the suit when this happens. <br>  <br>  Prior to suit, they'll usually send the account to collections.

To begin have your property appraised with a real estate appraiser, establish a price, second make sure the buyer qualifies for a home loan by asking for an approval letter from their lender, contact the lender to discuss the buyers qualifications.  Locate an escrow company to execute the agreement you and the buyer reach.

For example, if you are a waiter, they may be sharing your tips with the bartender, bus boy, maitre d'.  Or, they may be deducting it for income tax withholding.  <br>  <br>  Ask the payroll person to explain, or look at your pay stub and see if your withholding is based on the $5.15 an hour, or the total pay including tips that week.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	100% of the tip money belongs to you. But every restaurant and hotel sees this money and wants a piece of it.  The only way to get it is to threaten to form a union for the waiters.

Since you don't carry any other balances, your "ratio" of debt to total credit limits won't be affected. (FICO score "looks" at that ratio)  The credit history component won't be affected much since it is only a year old.  In this case, I'd cancel if you don't need it.  You may want to check on your FICO score and make sure it is good.  Otherwise, you may want to use your Home Depot card more to establish a good payment history with more than one credit account...making your score go up.|`|1b21b9eeca7e2732a1724f74862141a1aa	It will not hurt your credit at all. As a matter of fact, it may hurt your score if you CLOSE the account. If you do not have many credit lines open sometimes opening another account can improve your score. Also, if you have too many accounts open, it could lower your score to open more.    Your mastercard is definitely helping your credit. Even if you just spend $5/month on it and pay it off, it will help your credit because you're showing consistent monthly payments.    Also, the longer you keep tradelines open, the more it helps your score. You want to make sure you do not close whichever account you have had the longest.    Also...Keep all of your balances below 30% of your credit limit. High balances will negatively affect your score.    Your mastercard is definitely helping your credit. Even if you just spend $5/month on it and pay it off, it will help your credit.    You may not have any collections, but if you do, even just medical collections, make sure they are paid and reflect a zero balance. The collections will most likely stay on your report but, it helps your score quite a bit once your report shows that it is paid off. Sometimes you can make a deal with the creditors who are collecting from you...Tell them you'll pay off your balance if they agree to remove it from your credit report :O)    Most importantly...DO NOT MAKE ANY LATE PAYMENTS. This will effect your score tremendously. Just one late credit card payment can lower your score 30 points. A late mortgage payment can affect it even more.    Lender's look at all of this stuff if you were to apply for a loan.    It sounds like you're doing ok for yourself. Keep working on your credit. It pays off in the end.    Also, you may want to think of signing up for a credit monitoring program. I did this when I was in the process of purchasing my home, and needed to raise my score. It helps you keep track of what exactly is going on with your score. Rather than pay $25 each time you want to see your credit report, you can sign up for Truecredit.com. It's about $15 a month, but you can update your score every day, and it will even tell you what you can do to improve your score, looking at your personal credit history.I raised my score at least 60 points.    Hope this helps!|`|SJX3jMh9aa	Myth, not true.  It will not hurt your credit one bit :)    I believe just having it will help your credit as you have to pay the bill off when you do use it, and if you don't use it you most likely will have a monthy free of like 3$ or so for inactivity, either way, it will not be hurting your credit.

Less than 2 years, 15% tax rate.  2 years or more and main residence, see if you are eligible to exclude $250,000 (irs pub 523) and rest (if any) at 15%.    The $250K deal is one of the reasons we just had a housing bubble.  People paid more if they figured the house would go up in value and they could walk away with a tax free profit.
MbzyriZ4aa	From a smart financial standpoint:<br>  <br>  Pay off the high interest car loan as fast as possible. Make sure that when you send them "extra" payments that those are applied to the principal and not applied to any portion of the interest...<br>  Get everything in writing... and then send separate checks to them with the notation that this money is to be applied towards the principal.<br>  This will reduce the life of your loan dramatically...<br>  <br>  Your student loan... pay off at your leisure. 4.21% and you only owe them $4334 ... not a big deal. Use any extra money you have to reduce that car loan. Your car keeps depreciating... and if any possible knock out that car loan before you end up with a vehicle that is worth less than the balance of the loan.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	I would make the car loan the priority and add extra dollars each month toward the principle.|`|JsDID6gJaa	There are two schools of thought here.<br>  <br>  1. is pay the smallest balance first regardless of interest, then when that is paid off.  Use that amount you were paying to the student loans and in addition to the minimum payment for your auto loan and pay that off second.  You get gratification earlier and allows you to take a month off to splurge for a month as a reward to yourself.<br>  <br>  2. Is to pay off the highest debt first.  This "seems" slower, but may be faster than the 1st option and may cost less.  Then roll over the amount you were paying to your auto loan to your student debt.  <br>  <br>  I'd suggest option 2 if you have the disciple to stick with your plan.  Pick one and work on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
mwkfirjRaa	Filing jointly almost always results in your paying less taxes.    You may qualify for the first-time homebuyers tax credit of $7,500, but you probably won't be able to write off the improvements.  Those expenses can be used to offset capital gains when you eventually sell the house, but the capital gains exclusion is avoided now (for most taxpayers) as long as you live in the house at least two years before selling it and it's your primary residence, subject to a limit.    You may be able to exclude up to $500,000 of the gain on the sale of your main home if you are married and file a joint return and meet the requirements listed in the discussion of the special rules for joint returns, later, under Married Persons.    Ownership and Use Tests (from IRS Publication 523)    To claim the exclusion, you must meet the ownership and use tests. This means that during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale, you must have:        *Owned the home for at least 2 years (the ownership test), and            * Lived in the home as your main home for at least 2 years (the use test).        As the other answer indicates, you should use TurboTax or similar software to discover any additional deductions for which you may qualify.  You don't have to pay for TurboTax to calculate your taxes, only if you actually decided to file or print from TurboTax.    Visit the IRS website for additional tips.|`|8yQYmxVOaa	File jointly better tax rate  No you are incorrect about writing off the improvements, to a point. Improvements that save energy can be partially written off. Paint, new kitchen etc cannot. THose are written off when you sell the place|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Married filing joint is almost always best.    You cannot write off improvements on the house. They get added to the "cost basis" of the house. This may be important for when you sell your house, so keep the receipts.|`|JjbragXNaa	I would file jointly, makes things easier and you'll probably get a bigger refund.  Do a Standard 1040 form so you can go through all your deductions and figure them out.  I use TurboTax.com every year and it makes it really really easy to find all those deductions.|`|TwqIpHJLaa	Married filing jointly almost always gives a better result than filing separately.  Because you were married on the last day of the tax year, 31 Dec, filing as a single person is not an option.    Home improvements and repairs are generally nondeductible. Improvements, though, can increase the tax basis of your home (which in turn can lower your tax bite when you sell your home). Improvements add value to your home, prolong its life, or adapt it to a new use.  For example, installing a deck, a built-in swimming pool, or a second bathroom would be considered an improvement.  In contrast, a repair simply keeps your home in good operating condition.  Regular repairs and maintenance (e.g., repainting your house and fixing your gutters) are not considered improvements and are not included in the tax basis of your home.  However, if repairs are performed as part of an extensive remodeling of your home, the entire job may be considered an improvement.    Adjusting the basis is less important today for most folks given we can exclude from income (when filing jointly) up to $500,000 in gain on a sale of one's personal residence.    Hope this helps!|`|7e182e0a12923403259450951412a853aa	I would file MFJ or jointly.  Now you have to be careful on home improvements and their deductions.  You can deduct energy savings and such.  Some home improvements will be added on to the cost of the house so when you sell it your purchase amount increases.  The things you can deduct are property taxes, mortgage interest, energy savings such as added insulation.     I do not recommend filing seperately because one of you will get have penalties.  There are many credits will not be able to take and possibly your standard deductions

aUQ1ridmaa	Yes, it is possible. And there are many reasons why it is possible.<br>  <br>  For example if you have other income that has not yet been taxed (interest on a bank account; self employment income; money taken out of a retirement plan; rental income; taxable scholarships or grants; canceled debt that is now taxable; etc)  <br>  <br>  Or if you follow the instructions, but then at tax time find out that you are a dependent of your parents, and that they are the ones who should be claiming you.<br>  <br>  Or if you properly filled out the W-4 at the beginning of January, but had a major life change at some point during the year. (Got married; got divorced; a child moved away from home and is no longer a dependent; you received a huge raise or bonus; etc)<br>  <br>  Shannon C|`|L4eoLmvJaa	it is possible, but if you do owe, it shouldn't be too much

If you can't  come up with the money yourself, have you asked family, friends if they can help?? If not, go to the CAB and they will advise you to what to do.|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	Is it because of the extortion also known as council tax?<br>  <br>  Well I have a way but it may be a little far fetched. If you have a steady job with decent pay then go into your council office, tell them exactly how much you are able to pay over a certain amount of time, and they should return your car "after you pay a small holding fee i think".<br>  <br>  If you work at somewere like mcdonalds and there is no way you are able to pay it, leave your job, apply through UCAS to study on a full time course at the university of your choice, and apply for a student grant/loan/scolarship.<br>  <br>  So you basically get paid to go to university, they pay for your accomodation, they give you a bunch of cash to spend, you dont have to pay council tax because you are a full time student, and if you work part time on top of that you can be making a nice little income for yourself.

MhS1ZaUdaa	Opening a business even a franchise can be very costly. Tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. I your willing to put in time and effort and educating yourself you can find internet marketing fun and rewarding.<br>  <br>  First of all you need to understand that you are looking for a "business". Something to put your heart and passion into. <br>  <br>  Have you considered the cost of putting a business together? Educating yourself, getting a business license, accounting software, expenses associated with doing business? Are you willing to put in time and money to make your business venture successful?<br>  <br>  Making money online (internet marketing) is one way of making money at home but be prepared to educate yourself and put in effort.<br>  <br>  To make money online many people jump right in before they are properly prepared. You know that to be a rocket scientist, a doctor, a brick layer, a construction worker, an office worker, a teacher there are prerequisites, things you must learn, before you can be successful, you don't just jump right in unprepared.<br>  <br>  The same applies to the Internet marketing industry even though there are unsavory people out there who'd have you believe it's a "Walk in the Park" and requires no more than the belief that you can just do it.<br>  There are still rules you have to follow and pitfalls you must avoid to actually make Internet marketing work for you.<br>  <br>  Most people will not make a dime online and yet there are others who will make more in one month than most people make in a whole year. Why is that? I have no clue and I don't think many of us do either.<br>  <br>  But one thing I do have a clue about and know for sure is that to make money online you must first have Passion for the company products and/or service of any Internet business from which you expect to make money.<br>  <br>  Internet marketing work is typically not all that difficult or time consuming but it does take motivation caused by Passion to get you off and running with a sustained effort so that you won't stumble.<br>  <br>  You have a great resource in the Internet search engines to search about the Internet Marketing industry for business opportunities, USE IT!<br>  <br>  Your research should uncover a company that you like and have confidence in. It should be solid, founded on great principles, and easy to understand with great products and services that are sell-able for which you can have Passion. If you don't find it move on,<br>  You can find the right opportunity containing the attributes identified above.<br>  <br>  Comments like, well, that one sounds good and the compensation plan is excellent so I guess I'll start that business - does not sound like a decision based on anything near Passion. And remember when you hear that an Internet "guru" does that, don't be tempted, because as I said earlier they are experienced and can sell just about anything, without being Passionate about the company products and services.<br>  <br>  Note: By the way it's your goal to get to the point where you can sell about anything online. That end skill and goal is a worthy one indeed.<br>  <br>  Remember, there are other steps you must make before you step into Internet Marketing but if you don't first find the right company products and services to be passionate about, all of those other steps may just cause you a lot of frustration instead of bringing you great success.<br>  <br>  Not being Passionate about a company and products and services that has market proof that it will sell is a pitfall you simply must avoid.|`|7EXXw5cEaa	Dang dude you are asking a question I would ask.

uBTJtvITaa	Rhode Island can be a tricky place to get what you are describing.  It has a lot of colleges, so many coastal towns become college havens in the academic year.  You also don't want to be somewhere like Providence.  I would recommend somewhere like East Greenwich, RI or surrounding towns.

The Ryan Center at URI is also a quick drive, but far enough away to avoid tourists and drunk college kids.
DAMZKbpDaa	The IRS goes by social security number on the W-2 income. So a name mismatch on W-2 doesn't trigger any alarms.

dgsFDJdMaa	If you get a "gift card" with a Visa or Mastercard logo, your name will not appear on the card, which makes it difficult to use on some websites.  You can call customer service of the online store and place your order.    Most pre-paid credit cards (with Visa or MC logo) take several days to get because they issue a card to you with your name on it.  If you have this type of card, you'll be able to use it everywhere.    The down-side of the pre-paid credit cards is the high fees associated with them.  There's a fee to purchase the card, a fee to reload money on the card, a fee when you use the card, a fee every month just to have the card, and so on.    Hope this helps.
