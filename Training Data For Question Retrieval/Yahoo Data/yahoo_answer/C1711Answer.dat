The British government is one of the most bloated in the world. Every year it wastes 100s of millions setting up committees which either tell people what they already know (Like children in lone parent families having a rougher time) but which the government ignores because it's not PC, or they come out with some airy-fairy garbage that the thinking man knows is total rot but which the government treats as a revelation.    UK tax is tied up in bureaucracy and red taps, too. And in ineffective "packages of measures" to tackle common sense issues through non common sense actions.    If the British tax payer got their money's worth the average British person would live to 200 years old have a free education for life.|`|AA11518538	ALWAYS|`|gBgSMgClaa	Need to be a bit more specific.|`|vrFH5AKraa	YES and itll only get worse im afraid|`|0waBXFsSaa	It is causing a lot of problems - the average white family man feels discriminated against. Grey suits and unnamed nebulous people are attempting to police his natural speech patterns, he sees people walking into jobs, houses, benefits that he has paid into for many years, by clicking their fingers.  Outlanders and newcomers preferred before him at every turn.  When my family arrived here many many years ago we had nothing, worked hard and had little, grew and thrived, never took benefits and gained the respect of our neighbours,worked hard, and now we have 3 businesses and all own our own houses.  The British were not kind and over welcoming, but respected us for hard work and showing our character.    I think the White British now get a VERY raw deal indeed
xdUjRxKzaa	Many times as i was in a male dominated industry. Those who dealt fairly with me and earned my respect got my money, those who were hide-bound stupid, didn't. Eventually their reps would turn up asking for an appointment but, with idiots in charge you can't ever trust the business performance and so the answer would be - sorry, no. Now, male customers were a great deal different, as a female you had to be able to assure them that you knew what you were talking about and as long as you could impress them with engineering and plumbing know how they would willingly place their business which they did. Sometimes it irked me but usually i just got on with the next job and i would never allow any of my staff to see me annoyed with either a customer or a supplier.|`|c9b6778bcf8abb59cfb68e059b6f01c9aa	Yes...the white older man came in to the bank and yelled "That black girl back there" ..........Im hispanic.    That goes to show that to some we are all the same because we are colored.  I thought it was funny but the fact that there are still plenty of ignorant people out there makes me a little sad.|`|AA11097492	Pity. The fact that people thought they were better than me because they decided being Scottish was in some way inferior to being English just proved to me, very nicely, that they weren't worth the effort.    I do not for one moment believe I am any better than anyone else because of where I come from. I just cannot understand anyone who thinks differently.|`|15bjtZhzaa	Yes, mainly as I have Christian beliefs..  Never upsets me...I'm glad there is some response.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	Yes.

It didn't bother me because I'm sure a few of the blacks and hispanics had their share to. I'm not racial but a few people in my family were so I grew up around a wide variety. I don't agree with racist's. There is good and bad in everyone.|`|KDAAaRanaa	Yes. Snap, Crackle and Pop started picking on me but Tony the Tiger came and helped me out. It evoked feelings of hunger - so I ate some rice krispies to get my own back.|`|2vHY9ZIIaa	Yes I did, throughout my life. It didn't evoke any feelings, because I grew up with it was a part of life, it helped me grow without a chip on my shoulder like so many people have.  Me is me, never mind what they said over there or over here or wherever I have worked or lived.    Imagine the zebra walking up to a lion to complain of prejudice. Imagine  men accusing lions of doing any wrongdoings when they eat zebras.

9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	I think they were over the top. Especially since she did it in private and she was only commenting that the tennis players hair fitted a 70's stereotype which was called a gollywog. But ofcourse in Politically Correct multicultural britain any word that could insult a minority group is taboo. I think it doesn't make sense considering how easily Jonathon Ross got off for doing something much worse in public, which he too didn't properly apologise for.  Maybe the lefties who run the BBC have seized the chance to take revenge on the Thatcher family.    To the PC brigade, the hunt for racists has become the modern version of a witch hunt as soon as someone is accused it is hard to clear your name. Think carefully before you accuse Thatcher , she only used one word and she didn't even mean it in an offensive way. One slip of the tongue reminiscing about an old racist idea does not make you a racist. Keep in mind that she did it in private as well, unlike Ross.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	Aah yes the BBC the same channel that produces the likes of Johnathon Ross. They were wrong to sack carol thatcher and wrong to reinstate that ross guy.|`|AA12121752	No - it was off-air and misreported.  It is a load of PC cobblers like usual.  At the most it should have been an internal reprimand.  It is nothing compared to Ross and Brand - if Thatcher is sacked then so should both of them, they are far more offensive, on air, every time they are broadcast.  If that's the standards they pretend to keep.|`|ysclTmCoaa	The BBC have way over reacted on this one.    They have tried to defend their actions saying they won't tolerate racial abuse, however, Carol Thatchers spokesman, being interviewed on Radio 4, said the remark was made about Andy Murry's hair, where's the racial content in that?|`|uEjh3CAbaa	i agree with little red its all to much whats going wrong with society?|`|bcc9b2244c635c5b359d3c88d4d14878aa	No way.|`|155e47baf8efe28f58e95f4efe9cf546aa	No they were wrong its time the biased PC loony fringe were dealt with or they should loose the license fee. It was a innocent remark made in private the real reason is she being hounded is she is a Thatcher and some liberals are fuelled by hate and love to to brand her racist. A Gollywog is a child's toy a part of our heritage a now is very collectible i say save up and collect to send a message to the PC brigade to get lost !|`|8dhe15MUaa	no|`|hZIVKiFdaa	Ha! She was sacked because she got a face like a box of spanners and it is so unbearable to watch on TV..|`|ogLHkR0oaa	No. Wossy got away with far worse.....Oh!, sorry, he's a trendy left winger, like his bosses ! There may be some political reason for this !|`|AA11530601	I dont think she should be saying things like that. A lot of sexist comments get overlooked but racist ones dont- but that dosent make the racist ones right or mean they should be overlooked too..   Carol Thatcher really should know better. "Gollywog"  for Gods sake. Its been acknowledged for years that its an unnaceptible saying. She was an idiot not to apologise. And to the person who said "we all say things like thaty sometimes"....you may do, but I dont. I have never called a black person a "golliwog" in my life.    (Wossy was let back in but he did get a lot of stick and he deserved it. I cant stand him now. But its an example of how gender based comments are tolerated more than race based ones)|`|AA10077992	I'm still not qute sure why you can't say g0llyw0g.I used to collect the badges off the Robertson's jam when I was young and that's what they were called - sorry - I don't find that word offensive at all|`|FcHplZtQaa	No if she was referring to a hairstyle, though why not say Afro?  Yes, if she was referring to the race what possessed her to use that word?     It's ignorant, and in this day and age there's no place for ignorance and racism, she sounds like she maybe read too many Enid Blyton books as a girl, she needs to get a grip on reality, hopefully this will be the kick she needs to do that!|`|84crzC80aa	I suppose they have to nowadays to cover themselves. It is over the top though. I mean, everyone says things like that now and again, it doesn't mean anything.|`|HQKuzxulaa	The trouble with the BBC is damned if they do and damned if they don't.

499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	I find it difficult to believe someone got 10 years for a couple of ecstasy tablets.     I don't think 9 years, assuming it's nine years each and not between them, was enough. that woman has a life sentence. Many judges don't take gang rape nearly seriously enough. It should be at least 15 years.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	I agree completely and yes, it's ridiculous.  It's the government themselves who're the dangerous drug pushers, tobacco and alcohol.  If you look at the statistics for the number of deaths of each and divide it by the number of users you'll find that the chance of dying from ecstacy are extremely low, in those cases it's almost always the case that the pill was not made of MDMA, the user either danced endlessly without drinking any water or they misunderstood the governments advice and drank massive quantities of water.  Alcohol and tobacco kill hundreds of thousands.  If anyone thinks that it's not the government who sell them, just consider who takes the majority of the money that we pay for them.  It's even harder to justify their attitude to cannabis.|`|AA11530601	yeah it does my head in, I read about a 14 yr old girl who was kidnapped and raped by 2 guys. They got 4 yrs. But the sentence for selling  couterfeit goods is 10 yrs. Its fking crazy. You are right my friend. The law dosent take rape seriously at all. It just seems to protect the rights of businesses over ordinary citizens.    there was another case when a girl with a mental age of 8 was attacked in her home by 3 men. The raped her and poured acid on her and now she is disfigured for life. The men got 6 years for rape and 2 years for breaking and entering - but why werent they also charged with grevious bodily harm? does disfiguring someone with acid not count as a crime? This was in the Uk news recently. There were questions raised about how lenient these sentences were but whether anything will come of it, I dont know. ;[|`|94c0ec021388b26b975de66b616f1c70aa	You are absolutely correct in the first part of your question. The only problem being is how to turn it all around and get some real common sense and justice back into the system.|`|gF6LRuP1aa	Why is the fact that the rapists were black relevant to the case?  You have mentioned the fact that these men were black three times.    And yeah, the law's an ***.    Edit:  And what was the ethniticity of the druggie?  You forgot to mention that unimportant and irrelevant detail.|`|efQGWAoMaa	I agree, the law makes bad decisions these days regarding the time that violent and dangerous offenders get in prison.    9 years is pitiful for what that poor woman suffered and al the law can genuinely offer her is lifelong anonymity where in 6 or 7 years the perpetrators will go free.    And as for the lad that took E. Although dealing/ carrying can lead to somebody losing a life depending on how its been cut, it does not deserve a 10 year prison sentence. Going to court and getting a suspended sentence seems more appropriate.    Anyway, I agree with you.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	Yeah, but I'm afraid 'we' have a war against drugs, not a war against violence against women.|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	You should know by now that the flavour of the month will be done to death. so the drug 'dealer' is the lowest of the low.  Maybe next year it will be the turn of the rapists, but if you ask me, some judges, or rather most judges, have absolutely no effin idea about anything.|`|9EkwyFB8aa	sounds usual|`|c2l3Uja2aa	blacks are not pep their more like animals its hard as a judge to sentence an an animal for a crime committed on a human

With that in mind, being photographed smoking pot is poor judgment.    If you need to smoke up to gain a sense of peace and an open mind, then you have a problem.  The majority of the US does not smoke pot...maybe the majority of YOUR friends do but the majority of the country doesn't.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	What are your statistics supporting that the majority of the US smokes pot?  The majority of the US has TRIED pot, but a small minority habitually, or even recreationally smokes it.   I know of just one person out of the dozens I know that smokes weed at all.   Almost every job involving production or machinery has drug testing, so they cant do drugs, even occassionally, with out risking losing their jobs.    I think it is sad that you must use drugs to "have an open mind" and "be at peace".   You strike me as the typical pot head, who believes every one is like you and your pot head friends.   Wake up.  Most people do not use, and once you seperate yourself from your circle of pot heads, youll realize that.|`|AA10436595	The big deal is it is illegal to smoke pot and Michael Phelps is in a position to be a role model for a lot of our young people.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	For one, whether people use it or not it is illegal. And some people would feel someone like Phelps has to be a role model. I don't totally agree, but he should use some sense especially when he is probably under scrutiny like a lot of other celebrities. I think they deserve privacy, but that is not how everybody feels. But at the same time,  I think he did make a mistake, I'm sorry, no matter how many people use it, it is an illegal drug.      But I even wonder if it was a blackmail attempt, though. Could somebody have taken it, said if you don't pay me X amount of money I'll release it and then he did not pay and they released it. I'm not saying that is what happened but it could be.|`|pjKZQotYaa	It's probably not a big deal for most people. Phelps, however, is expected to maintain a squeaky clean image; otherwise he risks losing those major endorsements, especially Kellogg's which markets kids.|`|tguEmxVyaa	He said he was sorry so it's okay now. Pot for everyone if you get caught remember to say your sorry and see if it works the same for you.

gW0nD5cEaa	From sometime way back in sports history, everytime the St. Louis (baseball)  Cardinals had a world series win, or at least a league pennant, the economy was good or became good (Many in the 30's, early 40's, 46, 64, 67,68,82,85), the stock market would be up, at least in the 40's and 60's, then came 1987, the Cardinals were in the series with the Twins, the Twins won, but despite the fact the Cardinals were in the series the stock market crashed in Oct. '87. So much for that theory. I don't know what the stock market did in 2006.    I hope the Steelers will be good for the economy, even though I was for Arizona. But don't count on them to perform miracles. I think the 100 yard touchdown run used that up (even if the Cardinals were asleep at the time)|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Typically when the NFL won, the economy prospered and when the AFC did it went down.

HJaVcUGwaa	Militarily, Israel is stronger than ever.  Yet, its days as a Jewish state are numbered, and that is where it is becoming weaker than ever.<br>  <br>  Since its creation, Israel has followed an expansionist course, with total disregard for the rights of the Palestinian people.  Israel had a chance to make peace with the Palestinians based on a 2-state solution in 1993 with the Oslo accords.  However, instead of taking advantage of that opportunity, they continued their expansionist policy by more than doubling the illegal settlements and their population in Palestinian lands.  Now it is too difficult for Israel to back off from these policies and dismantle these settlements.  The Israelis have just voted for the most Hawkish Knesset ever.  Thus likely Israel's policies will just become more arrogant.<br>  <br>  The great Israeli military strength can help it in a conventional war against regular armies, but it is no good in city and guerrilla warfare.  All this strength is bringing to Israel is condemnation for its crimes against humanity.<br>  <br>  Israel's military strength is not helping it to reverese the Palestinian population explosion, both in the Wast Bank and Gaza, and in Israel itself.  With the Palestinians already more than the Jews in historical Palestine, and expected to be more than the Jews in Israel itself by 2048, the end of Israel as a Jewish state is coming very fast to an end, and Israel's military might can not stop it.<br>  <br>  See this CBS video for Israel's options:<br>  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4752349n" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4...</a>|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	In my opinion it has not weakened at all.

swiOhDo2aa	Every now and then the American people love to make a mock of a president. It happened with Jimmy Carter, who was presented on stage and TV as a bumbling clown, always drunk, who could not walk straight or stand without falling. It happened with Clinton (did I hear someone say "Cigar"?)  It happened again with Bush. These presidents did some things right and some wrong, but had no way of standing against constant ridicule.<br>  <br>  I have no brief for Clinton, Carter or Bush, but must say that halfwits do not, even in the USA, get to be presidents. This does not stop people sniggering about their alleged lack of brains. <br>  <br>  Simply, it is Bush's turn to be the PTB (person to blame).
7IjGzvqTaa	Watergate was a big deal because basically, it showed the American people that they could no longer trust anything the President had told them.  It really wasn't about the actually crime so much (though it was very bad and Nixon fully deserved that slap on the wrist for it), but moreso about the government deceiving the people.<br>  <br>  As far as his actually participation, he ordered the "Plumbers" to bug the hotel offices and such.  The whole scenario was that he wanted information on the Democratic party that could be used against them in his favor.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped you understand a little better.

At the very least he should have been thrown out of office, but he resigned before this could happen. <br>  <br>  I don't know if he ordered the break in at the Watergate Hotel, or knew about it in advance, but the fact remains that at the very least he covered up a crime and it was shameful that Ford gave him a pardon.|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	It was the first (and only - so far) time a President resigned from the office.

When I was a kid, my Dad bought me an old tape recorder, and I soon found ways to plug it into the radio to record anything off the radio I wished, as EVERYBODY did back then. The law was even in place then about copy writing, but seldom ever prosecuted anyone. That is no different to Pirate Bay, Limewire and the others today, apart from the media is now HQ and includes videos, games, software and even books. <br>  <br>  In retrospect, if I were one of those artists, I think U2 in for instance to use as your example, would have lost up to ￡1 million in royalties alone from this ONE p2p site, and I think I would feel cheated. Perhaps if you look at the masses of all the other stuff being freely available, it's not such a good thing for them and amounts to making people work for no reward effectively. This free download is great technology, BUT it will be clamped down on harder and harder and fines will eventually put people off using p2p downloads. I used PB, and others in the past, but now I personally don't because I know the 'snoops' are looking at people and catching them and imposing heavy fines. They are working with your ISP's to combat it, and that business will grow to big business soon. The cyber police and lawyers are very well paid, and they are out to get us.|`|RxZqP0cdaa	I honestly believe the future will see the artists employing their own publishers (or even doing it themselves). They will no longer produce hard copies, everything will be downloadable and will have to be paid directly to the publisher/artist to download it.<br>  <br>  Prosecutions will tighten up and the penalties increased to such an extent that all illegal downloads will be shunned.<br>  Too much money involved for it to continue as it is, the door will soon close.|`|wLGrgBobaa	Not bad, I still go to isohunt 1st though.

You may be on location without a script or teleprompter in front of you, so think and speak quickly and succinctly.<br>  Step2<br>  Be insatiably curious about current events, history and everything else. If you don't have a broad general knowledge of popular culture, politics and geography, read up as much as possible through college courses and in your free time. You'll have to report on many different types of stories, so brushing up on a few facts will help you become a better broadcast journalist.<br>  Step3<br>  Enroll in a broadcasting school or study journalism and broadcasting at a university. While a four year school is appropriate for some, other students may choose a broadcasting program at a trade school so they can complete their studies and enter the job market sooner.<br>  Step4<br>  Intern and work behind the scenes at a broadcast or cable station. All radio and TV stations need paid and unpaid interns to do a variety of jobs. These positions range from news writer to assistant director and weather reporter to production assistant.<br>  Step5<br>  Choose your specialty when you become a broadcast journalist. Once you have some intern or campus experience, experiment with different broadcast positions. You can become a city hall reporter, sports commentator or foreign correspondent. Many broadcast journalists try a number of different jobs before settling on their permanent area of expertise.

AA11808995	I thought the same but many are down to Pilot error.Assumptions are a bad thing wlhen flying and aircraft are such an unpradictable machine.It seems as though Computer Software complicates matters and Pilots rely heavily on the configerations.The proof is in the fact that most accidents are caused when taking off and landing but rarely in clear air and in cruise mode.The Airbus is the worst offender for Software glitches and the safety features have to be applauded only to compound further problems.But you are correct in your observations and enquiries need to be made.|`|xvxT46iJaa	I think it's just a coincidence, and as rob said, if there are two accidents quite close to each other, the media makes a really big deal out of them.<br>  As for pilots needing more training, i don't think that's the reason. My dad's an airline pilot and still has quite a lot of training even after more than 20 years in the company. He also trains new pilots and if they aren't going to cope in a real plane (as opposed to the sim) there is no chance they will be passing.<br>  Also, the reason everyone on the flight that crashed into the hudson survived was purely down to the skill of the pilot, if he hadn't landed that plane perfectly, if one of the wings had tipped the water, if he'd landed too fast or slow, if the angle was wrong, it wouldn't be referred to as the miracle. but as the catastrophe. And the reason the plane got into trouble in the first place was because it hit a flock of birds, which is hardly the captains fault, and extremely unusual at the altitude they were flying at (most bird strikes are below 500 ft and they were over 3000)<br>  I'm sorry baby1j200 that most of this answer doesn't directly answer your question, but i thought it was unfair to blame everything on the pilots, when i know how hard they work and how much training they have.|`|hwR7FgkQaa	No. I have no idea it kinda freaks me out.

Are you suggesting that there are no white people who behave the same way? What about all those good well mannered black people who are living dignified lives? What should we do about them? Let me guess. Kill them too, just in case their children get tempted to start misbehaving too.<br>  <br>  You have to accept that there will always be bad apples in society, both black and white. So what are you going to do now? Kill everyone?<br>  <br>  Obama is black, but he hasn’t called for the white people to be exterminated, has he? To all the black people who really want peace and development, Obama is the symbol of hope. An example that black people CAN actually achieve greater things that yobbish behaviour and crime. He is not a ticket to shameful, embarassing behaviour. That black brother you mentioned behave in a despicable and unwarranted way. That was unacceptable. It may be by looking at Obama and learning of him that such people will learn that there is more to life than to be always violent, aggressive, and racist.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I haven't had any experiences such as this but others I know have. I don't get it really. They look up to an educated Black man who is very articulate and yet that doesn't seem to be what they see at all. It's like, it's our turn and you'd better watch out. Like his achievements have allowed them to be totally obnoxious, even worse than before. Go figure. I am sure that this is just the less educated, entitled folks. The rest of Black America are hard working, they pay their bills and are trying to raise decent children. I hope there are more of that segment of Black America than the other. I do know that the less educated want Obama to continue to pay their way and make them even more irresponsible. It's a shame.|`|TyiPJwsMaa	It truly is scary that these are the people that obama relied on to get elected.Stupid people that know nothing about government,they are just bent on some childish form of revenge and getting all the free stuff they can.I believe that if Hitler came back and was black he would have been elected by people like this fine example of obama's constituency.|`|XKhNw221aa	yes, just the other day I was at wal-mart, a black guy knocked off some thermals from the shelves and I said he better pick it up (I don't work there) He said something similar "You can't tell us what to do no more." He was with a group. So I didn't say much. <br>  no, look at the last preemptive strike, all we need to do is prepare for the worse.|`|wgbAyuYRaa	As a black person, I hope my brothers use Obama as a symbol of how much better we can be!<br>  <br>  It hurts me to see other blacks behaving as you describe.  However anyone with self-honesty knows how true it is.<br>  <br>  I'm hoping we can look at Obama as an example of how good we can be instead of wallowing in our hatred and ignorance.  Black people can be great but only a handful of us believe that self-improvement is the way to gain true equality, not adhering to a hate-filled lower standard.

It is those responsible for these publications who are making so much of this story, primarily for their own gain. The death of anyone, whoever or whatever they may be, is a sad event. Who can seriously blame her for taking advantage of this publicity to be able to leave a nest egg for her children.Hopefully, the one good thing to come from this whole sorry affair for the rest of the country will be improvements in screening for cervical cancer for all women.|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	The media has reported that brave Jade is going through a lot of pain leading up to the wedding but she will soldier on.

Since she has let people follow her fight with cancer on tv, mags etc, there has been a sharp raise in women getting their cervical smears, and if she even helps save one life, then surely she's doing the right thing by everyone. I'm not saying that she's not an attention seeking so and so, but at least now it's helping people.

TDVIb4SBaa	It is so typical of what is going on in corporate head offices today.<br>  We are led to believe that banks are honest, trustworthy have   strict guidelines oh yes they do as far as their clients are concerned,however there it stops.No there ought to be no secrecy at all this mess that many nations in the world are facing is because of mismanagement and secrecy,not discounting fraud of course from some of the leading financial institutions in the world.We are led to believe it was all due to bad loans sorry I do not believe that for one second,perhaps corporate greed is at fault that is where we should be looking.<br>  Who are they trying to protect? themselves for sure ,certainly not the beleaguered tax payers or home buyers.|`|s8nPN7pVaa	Well let us consider what has happened, the situation that we find ourselves in is predominantly due to three things .........<br>  <br>  a) The housing markets in the US & UK ......... properties overvalued, over mortgaged and lenders / borrowers overstretching themselves.<br>  <br>  b) Failure of the bank executives to properly oversee investments and 'risky' loans.<br>  <br>  c) Most importantly, public confidence. The media and so called 'experts' talking down the economy. <br>  Bad news spreads faster than a wild fire and after a while it becomes self perpetuating.<br>  <br>  So if the banks that were having difficulty were helped covertly then the other stronger banks would not have been affected.<br>  <br>  The truth of the matter is that most of the current situation could have been avoided.|`|vc403uWPaa	I think the banking system has been doing too much over the past 10 years that has been secret and it has meant we lose money! The government are currently saying that they had no idea that banks have been giving so called "fat cats" bonuses of five figures and upwards! But that's what we get when we privatise banks in this country! I think from now on, seen as us tax payers are giving them all billions of pounds to stay on their feet, that we should have every right to know exactly what's going on in our banks!|`|jbQOC5kJaa	Too little too late and too easy to hide stuff from us.<br>  Our money is bailing them out, we should have access to information as to how our money is being used, what will we get back, and we should have a say as to who gets rewarded for what.<br>  And pigs might fly.  We pay up, our lords and masters do as they wish, tell us as little as possible.|`|JhC6BvPpaa	I am still in complete shock over the news of the ￡2 trillion national debt announcement earlier in the week. We will never see that debt paid off in our lifetime - unless they find oil or gold in the Midlands of course. <br>  <br>  It seems that borrowing to get out of debt has now become the norm.... How big do they want the national debt to be? To keep bailing the banks out all the time, there has got to be a limit surely? And I just wonder what the repo men will be like when they start knocking on Alistair Darling's door soon? Hmmm could be interesting.|`|wZc2gsq0aa	stinks<br>  movers and shakers<br>  secret societies

You make it sound like they think teaching reading and numbers is bull, but what they are saying is that the other subjects are being ignored and that education sucks because of government-imposed standardization and the way the schools try to address those imposed standards.<br>  <br>  This isn't one of those "don't teach kids the basics" or don't grade the kids so no one is embarassed idiotic ideas.  They are saying the system is broke and the way the government is trying to control the system is the problem.<br>  <br>  At least that is how I read the article.|`|Y46YE1e2aa	The three Rs should always be an integral part of our children's education,<br>   It will become more imperative that they are able to compete in the future with children who are spending far much more time in school that our children are<br>  , I honestly cannot see the importance of subjects being taught in schools supposedly to educate , my question must be, how beneficial will it be in years to come to be knowledgeable in our history to an ordinary school leaver? The curriculum needs to be placed on =exactly= what are kids will be up against from other countries, more emphasis is needed on subjects that will help them to compete.<br>   Knowing about past times is not, the way, in preference to everyday situations.=No keep the three Rs=|`|q6phm94caa	Codswollop.<br>  <br>  Our Cambridge Professors are arguing the inadequacy of the National Curriculum, in it's present form, and the testing that goes with it.

The line gets more blurred everytime someone in authority speaks.|`|u8mQbzc1aa	I am completely amazed.  If teachers are spending too much time on the 3 R's then how come today's school leavers are so illiterate?<br>  <br>  They can't spell, they don't know what punctuation is, but they DO know how to do simple maths - as long as the battery doesn't run out on their calculator.|`|AA10527991	This article says that the basics are not enough.

If you can't read and write, and add up, your future is pretty bleak.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	Yes I heard this on the news and was a bit perplexed myself. Yes children must learn to read and write. They must also have time to do practical things like crafts, cooking and art. Some children are not so academic but they have other gifts and can be very talented. I think music in school is very important it is a good thing to do as a group and lifts the spirits..I was in nursery a long time ago and started school 42 years ago..We had no problem with the 3 RRRs.

That is why it has been on a downward spiral ever since the election.  Historically, the stock market goes up once a new President is elected.  It was the highest in history in the Bush admin.

Let's hope it doesn't get to that.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Because someone has to pay for that trillion dollars.  The question is whether we would rather businesses and workers made more money or whether the government can somehow magically spend the money they take from us in a super efficient way that will make us all richer and rescue the economy.  I find that unlikely, because everything they currently spend money on is a total waste.|`|aUTLstpAaa	Obama and  his administration will create between 2-4 million jobs but to do that it will take 2+ years.  The reason why so many businesses are laying people off is because most of these businesses sell or produce a service or product that no one is buying or using anymore due to the economy (consumers are making cutbacks and not buying the products/services they use to buy so they can save money).  Since the businesses have less money coming in they cannot afford to have money going out.  That includes employee wages and benefits.  It's cheaper to lay people off than continue to employ them (at least for the businesses).  The Bush administration deregulated a lot of things (including financial markets/stocks), which cause people involved in these areas to make poor choices, causing more people to make poor choices.  It's like a domino effect.  One outcome always effects another, and that outcome effects another, and so on.  It's going to take at least 1 term for the Obama administration to turn things around.  It's going to get worse before it's going ot get better.|`|AA11100368	It goes back to basic economics.  Obama says he's being "Keynesian" in his proposal which means that the gov should "jump start" the economy. An inherently flawed idea, but Obama doesn't even do that well.  His plans are all pork filled pet project of government waste.  He even admitted that the "stimulus" wouldn't do anything for the next 2 years.  This whole bit on rich people"driving down economy" is crap.  They aren't driving it down, they just understand what is going on and have stopped spending.  Would you spend your money if you knew that your money will be confiscated at an unheard of rate in the near future?    You can trace this whole entire mess back to Democrats.  The guy with his thumb most in the pie is Barney Frank.|`|76cAAPfBaa	Because they know it's basically counterfeiting money. There's no true deposits behind that money, so it dilutes the money supply. When you dilute the money supply, you eventually have hyper-inflation. Then, it costs huge amounts of cash to buy anything!|`|uu6JYenAaa	Sara has it right.  If Obama surges the economy with money, then we spend it.  That creates more inflation.  A package of gum would end up costing $5.00.................LOL|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	Financial markets still go down because of the people managing it.  The reason why we're in the slump that we're in is because of fiscal irresponsibility on behalf of the people in charge in the government and the executives of these financial institutions.    Bank of America received bailout money.... and spent it sponsoring the SuperBowl.  JPMorgan and AmEx got bailout money... and spent it sponsoring a squash tournament.  Wall Street got bailed out, and their executives got 10 billion in bonuses last year.    Heh.  Would be hilarious if we all just stopped paying taxes.  Then where would they get their money?

CNN.com-great section on their web page with advice from alot of folks about different situations like yours and web addresses to find out what the best path is to take...It also has important info on 401k...insurances and links to get there....Be careful of websites that give you advice that seems too good to be true. Make sure you talk to more than one professional when getting advice. And let your decision be based on ALL of the information you get. <br>  Long range...I believe the housing market will come back. It may take some time, but It will. Hold on and be dedicated to keeping that credit score up there!!!!!

All the advice you have received above, looks good.<br>  <br>  But don't sign anything unless you read the fine print many times. And as said above, if it looks too good to be true, it isn't true. <br>  <br>  If you decide to rent one or two furnished rooms in your house to help pay off the mortgage, be sure to:<br>  1) have a contract that you both sign<br>   2) take photographs of everything, especially the room being rented   and any other places like laundry room or kitchen and bathroom plus outside including garage.<br>    3)keep every receipt for preparing the rental quarters and the rest of the house such as painting, decorating, maintenance,  to help with filing your IRS and in case there are any disputes between you and the renter.

I applaud your efforts to take responsibility for your actions and not shy away like some would do.  If refinancing does not happen, then it may be best to down size by selling and buying a house more suitable to your financial ability.  you might take a loss but in the en d you might come out ahead.  Don't touch the 401.  That is your future.

The arabs dont want to take themselves as ILLEGAL entrants into invaded Israel 800 years ago. This is the root of the problem. They have built their tent in their neigbour's house for 800 years , and now claim their rights over their neighbour's property.  You can be sure, if this was done with the arabs, they would have been more cruel.  The arabs have a great stretch of land and a number of nations. Why do they want Israel  as palestine too?  They should come to the point of sacrifice for the right of their neighbour. After all the Hebrews have just one small piece of land.    Terrorists are those who want to take over israel. Terrorists are those who want to punish nations who favour israel. terrorists are those who want to divide nations for the sake of their religion.|`|5r3DHtsfaa	they are people who wish to disrupt the normal life of people and cause havoc !|`|ihe71A3jaa	Killing Civilians, Supporting to kill the civilians.

5frOVAgSaa	that is the zionist agenda and it is funny how blindly the world super powers continue to support israeli tyranny in the mid-east. i am against hamas and their rocket attacks but there is no reason too good that gives you the authority to attack Gaza and bomb the place to ruins, and claiming innocent lives in the process.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	I think Iran would like Israel to do so.<br>  <br>  Israel is all that is keeping the terrorist hordes from reinvading Europe.<br>  <br>  History could repeat itself.|`|ytQfxuPyaa	That is what they have stated they want to do, and that is what they are doing.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	no, its the other way around.

You'll see...|`|GDwMdfqjaa	Sure they do, that is why Israel accepted the Oslo agreement in which they returned quite a lot of territories of the west bank to the Palestinian authority. That's also why Israel withdrew completely from Gaza in 2005 removing all military forces and  evacuating over 20 Israeli settlements in Gaza where some people have been living for decades. Obviously, it's also the reason why Israel has been returning territories in the west bank over the past 16 years up to a point that the vast majority of the west bank is currently in Palestinian authority hands. It's also why in the Camp David 2000 talks, Israel offered all of the Gaza strip + 94% of the west bank + part of the Israeli territory in exchange for the 6% of the west bank + East Jerusalem + removal of all settlements from Gaza and the west bank and much more in exchange for one thing - Peace. The Palestinian leader refused.<br>  <br>  Israel did all that because they want to wipe Gaza and the Palestinians off the map. Of course.<br>  <br>  Israel is always interested in peace, not territorial gains. It's been proven time and time again that if the neighbors are peaceful, Israel gives back what's theirs. In 1973, Israel signed peace with Egypt after giving back Sinai - An occupied area 3 times the size of Israel. That alone shows that Israel's true desire is peace, not territorial gains. The Palestinian authority agreed to stop violence and negotiate peace in the latter years - As a result, Israel gave back quite a bit of the West Bank territory, removed many checkpoints and passed others to Palestinian control. All because Israel wants to wipe the Palestinians off the map, right? Or could it be that Israel takes a policy of "Be nice, we'll be nice, hit us, we'll hit back"?<br>  <br>  Anyone who reads some history, not biased arab-produced propaganda history but real history of real events, would realize that Israel has never rejected peace negotiations and has been continuesly giving back territories over the past 2 decades in an attempt to promote peace.|`|tod8jy9Paa	They not only want to they nearly have done it. They have managed to herd 1.5 million into the Gaza Strip where now they are either bombing them or when that failed making life so impossible for the people there they will ask to leave .They are now concentrating on whats left of the West Bank by opening up more and more land for the illegal settlers there This is what life is like in the West Bank now., filmed by CBS news|`|8mQILFtVaa	Absolutely.

Satellite launch technology is pretty well understood at this point - it just takes effort and money (which they have).    Yes, this does make it pretty easy for them to develop missiles - the technologies and skill sets for the rocket are virtually the same.  Warhead technologies are another thing entirely - any missile they launched now would probably hit, but would probably not detonate.|`|2cqKQ2d8aa	uncivilized?   their brightest minds were trained in the usa in everything from computer science , to weapon development etc. also how to build nuclear power plants .  they learned well .|`|7XWfQJmnaa	With Russia and China's help|`|236c93851f8140793a37dd76c210a733aa	What do you mean by civilization?

If you mean civilization is Western lifestyle and technology, Iran has an amount of this, plus an amazing set of traditions that has started before America was 'discovered', thousands of years ago.     Do you think Iranians live in tents?|`|3qsGhN5Raa	The Iranians are much more "civilised" than you give them credit for.  I am pleased that they have done this and congratulate their scientists  on their success.  They don't intend to bomb the West with this. You can carry on and watch TV. Its not the end of the world.
nxrEuJsRaa	I love my girls totally and completely. I would die for them    But I can tell you know, if either of them did such a sick,unforgivable thing I would not want to be their mother. A part of me would always love them, but I would block that strong feeling out and be rational. I would try and forgive,but I don't think I could.    What disturbs me more is the fact that the grandmother is saying she fully supports her daughter. Supports that she killed her own child? That's wrong surely?

But if your son or daughter does something terrible, I guess there is still the thing that you still love them no matter how you feel about what happened, and maybe feeling guilt about it can drive you to them or against them. And sometimes it is 'protecting' them from the outside. In private it might be different but when it comes to 'outsiders' you are totally on their side.|`|kJs0RmtXaa	The grandmother, probably remembers the little girl who she used to hold on her lap, not the cold blooded killer her daughter is.  It is very easy as parents to roll back the clock in ones mind and remember all too well those precious younger years. I think for Grandma to bust out with a I still support you would be a habit.

After birth they always have the option of voluntary care, why not take that way out?  I feel sick with these stories, and I treasure my girls just that little bit more each time I read them.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	Unconditional love, means just that.  No matter what your child does, you will still love them.   You cannot turn of love, like a tap.   If that happens, then it was not unconditional in the first place.    If that was my daughter my heart would be breaking but I would still love her.      Can one suddenly say, because you have done a terrible thing, I do not love you anymore.?    This mother has done a terrible thing, and of course, the grandmother sees that.  HOwever, she cannot just turn away and say I do not love you anymore.      The grandmother must be suffering terribly, knowing that the baby girl that she brought up has done such a terrible thing.  It will make the pain much harder to bare because she, of course, still loves her daughter and must watch the consequences of her daughters' actions.   I feel for her!!|`|MpqNJ6sWaa	in a heartbeat NO, i would disown my daughter without a second glance, i wouldnt give a **** what people thought of me, i wouldnt follow the mothers rules blindly either , my thoughts would be with my defencless grandaughter, thats honest. i seen photos of her in court and she had the neck to be smiling in them.|`|ce90b5f1cb43f4f149fb6e0b5be70d0baa	I think that because parents are human, there is a strong possibility that they will not feel unconditional love even toward their offspring - for various reasons.|`|p3UDlABeaa	they need psychiatric help.|`|0db2fa5306d1f944ee81fd7666a0ebf8aa	I feel the same as you about this.I love my children and, God.

The energy generation is proportional to the cube of wind-speed.    But the problem is that it needs much place, & can be set up only in windy region.

OCfI1d0Aaa	This woman needs to  be committed! She really is mentally ill.    She has 6 children and lives in her mother's home.  Her MOTHER helps to take care of the children.  This woman is on disability and doesn't even have a job.  So what if she is going to school! Obviously the state is paying for it, and then some.    Look at the hospital bill she's leaving - $1.5 - $3 million! Nevermind the continuous care these children are going to need since they will all have some type of disability which is quite the norm for multiple births this size.      14 kids, no father, no job, no home of her own.  The Duggars or whatever their names are at least have their own home and the dad is employed.  The reason for them having all their children is a religious factor, not a selfishness factor.  "I just longed for certain connections and attachments with another person that I really lacked."  Her words.    She is a sick selfish individual who needs to be put away 'cause she is going to mess up 14 kids that the state will certainly be paying for for the next 18 years if not longer due to their disabilities they will surely have.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	I agree with you 100%. I cant see how anyone is going to give her her own show  She's shown that she is selfish and money grabbing. her parents have continued to support her throughout,paying all her bills etc. Her parents are mad and equally to blame for this shameful spectacle.    The mind boggles, it really does.|`|AA10283080	She shouldn't.    Those children should be adopted out and she shouldn't get anything.|`|981ae6721baf70bba18f8ca87d655a38aa	Probably.

She doesn't have the personality or home life that is conducive to long range shows (John & Kate plus 8, the Duggars).      No news organization is going to want to be a part of the negativity that is (rightly) surrounding her.|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	I hope not. This is such a tragedy. She's a hoarder and she should have her tubes tied, and then be committed.     One of the six she had already is autistic. How can she possibly care adequately for all of these kids?     The only show she should  be on, if any, is a show about people that have a problem with hoarding.|`|Blw9rlWpaa	Basically she is just looking for a quick buck. I doubt with all of the negative attention this story is getting that any tv channel will pick up her "show". At first I felt kinda bad for her and all the media hype she was getting. But now that the story is unfolding it doesn't look like a good story. But there have been no reports of abuse or neglect so I don't see that big of deal. I mean yeah it was crazy of her to have that many kids. But she's taking care of them. I think alot of the negativity comes from her being a single mom living at home. What about the Duggar family who has 18 kids. You don't hear anything negative about them and they have their own show. It just seems like the media is nit picking because she's single and at home. But I don't think it's very right of her to use her situation to her advantage.|`|4aIejmVxaa	I was hoping after she said that no one will talk to her because all what she care about is the money not her poor kids, I cant even believe what kind of mom she is, they should take the kids away from her she will never be a good mom, she need a mental hospital for sure .

2qQPBDlkaa	no in answer to your question.. editorial cartoons are NOT supposed to be funny necessarily<br>  <br>  most editorial cartoons are specifically designed to promote THOUGHT and or to poke fun at a current event  and or administration... although some are amusing most are not.<br>  <br>  from wiki<br>  <br>  "Editorial cartoons can be very diverse, but there is a certain established style among most of them.

Most of the people complaining about losing their homes earn more money in a week than I do in a month.  Many could have afforded a decent home, but decent wasn't good enough.  Many were shallow people who wanted nothing more than to impress people with their expensive homes and cars.  On the other hand, you have people like me.  I knew that I couldn't commit to a high mortgage or interest rate.  Sure, I had offers from the bank about what they could do for me, but I looked at the numbers and wasn't comfortable with them.  I am not a math professor, it was simple addition.  So I settled for what I knew I could afford, even if work was slow.  I am in a small mobile home with a disabled husband and four kids.  I guess I should have done what the greedy people did, live beyond my means and have the tax payer fix it.  So, YES I am upset.  I made the responsible choice and I am NOT losing my home, but my tax dollars (that could be better spent at my children's' schools) will be making sure the IRRESPONSIBLE, GREEDY, SHALLOW people stay in their big, fancy homes while I live in claustrophobia in my cramped home.|`|vrAiFHNCaa	I am more upset that my taxes go to the IRS and Federal Reserve(unconstitutional central bank set up in 1913) to begin with.

Not their primary home. They were buying these homes to turn around and make a quick buck. But the market burst and now their stuck with the mortgages that they never intended to have to pay off in the first place. Whoops! Did I say they were stuck with the mortgages? It seems that we are stuck paying off their loans. Pure greed was the cause of this dilemma. And now it seems that we should pity them for being greedy. And yes I am pissed. If I can't pay my rent will the government pay it for me? I don't think so. Hey! that is why I live in a place that I can afford.|`|iHjNXTZGaa	Yes it's upsetting especially since I don't even own a house myself.

Okay so his plan didn't work all that well because he's still currently sitting in prison but think about it.<br>  <br>  He is one of the very, very few people that is sitting in jail for life and he didn't actually do anything...  He never laid a hand on any of those people that were killed by the Manson Family.<br>  <br>  Drugs, sex were his weapons and weak minded people were his prey.  It worked.  They are still around.

Did he die?<br>  <br>  When I went to college in 1973, I got to know a woman in the dorm who had lived for a time with Manson and his "family" of devotees at the Spahn Ranch.  She had run away from home at 15 because her father was molesting her, and she used drugs and was by her own assessment "really screwed up."<br>  <br>  She didn't stay there long, because, as she put it, "I was screwed up, but he [Manson] was CRAZY."  She said that there was no doubt in her mind whatsoever that Charles Manson was completely amoral, hell-bent on hurting anyone who he perceived as crossing him, a living, breathing psychopath.  She told me she didn't learn the words to describe Manson until after she got herself straightened out, but that even as a 15-year-old runaway getting high on anything she could get her hands on, Manson scared her enough that she left the Spahn Ranch.<br>  <br>  Manson has never expressed any remorse for the murders he precipitated.

2Qykhk0gaa	ASHLEY & SARA'S ANSWER:<br>  I don't think that media violence is the only thing that affects children.  We can't blame it on just media or just anything.<br>  <br>  Parents are responsible for their children's actions...  They are supposed to teach their children right and wrong, good and bad and what's real or fake.  They should be monitoring what their children are watching and are interested in. <br>  I understand that parents can't be around 24/7 and the media is every where but if society wasn't so grossly interested in violence then our children wouldn't see it on television and it wouldn't be played on television.  It's human nature to be curious about violence, we're animalistic creatures and we're the only one's that kill our own species for no logical reason.  <br>  Violence affects everyone.  That's why we should be taught what violence truly is and not to see it as glamorous like so many of us do.|`|d2f94c8e2afb02dc78220026b62e787faa	I really think that it doesnt have much affect on children. At least not nearly as much as parents do do their kids. So when parents fight that affects children. But other than that I really don't think media violence affects kids.|`|XIc0XF6Iaa	media violence doesnt effect children . people blame media violence for school shootings and such, but it is really troubled children that are drawn to violence and then misinterpret entertainment with reality .|`|AA11828439	I don't believe it does.|`|uwzfTIKxaa	It can frighten children, but not much else. I was never affected other than being disturbed.
iOugBxLTaa	I got the solution for 25. I don't think that's how everyone else did the question, but this way is way simpler. <br>  <br>  Machine A gives you (m,n)<br>  Machine B gives you (m+3n, n)<br>  Machine C gives you (m-2n, n)<br>  <br>  the options were A:(2009,1016) B:(2009,1004) C:(2009,1002) D:(2009,1008) E:(2009,1032)<br>  <br>  the answer is D, and here's why<br>  <br>  Instead of looking for a pattern that would get me these numbers, all except for one, I reversed the equations of the machines and try to get these numbers to go back to (0,1)<br>  <br>  So, the new equations are still (m,n)<br>  (m-3n,n)<br>  and (m+2n, n)<br>  <br>  Since -3n then +2n is just -n, I can just use m-n however many times i want until m is smaller than n, then switch up the numbers with machine A, then continue the process until the numbers reach (0,1)<br>  <br>  Ex: A: 2009, 1016<br>  993, 1016<br>  1016,993<br>  23, 993<br>  993, 23<br>  73, 23<br>  27, 23<br>  4, 23<br>  23, 4<br>  3, 4<br>  4,3<br>  1, 3<br>  3, 1<br>  0,1<br>  <br>  You can do this with every pair of numbers except D<br>  <br>  D: 2009, 1008<br>  1001, 1008<br>  1008, 1001<br>  7, 1001<br>  1001, 7<br>  301, 7<br>  21, 7<br>  7, 7<br>  0, 7<br>  7,0<br>  <br>  And so you can't get 0,1<br>  That's why you can't get 2009, 1008, therefore D is the answer.|`|hHVMrnK3aa	I solved the machine input-output problem.<br>  <br>  Answer is D.<br>  <br>  Details are here: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219192330AAj9aJP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|194b193e8be3a95535b8655d497033f0aa	Well, everyone's got 25, so here's 24.<br>  <br>  If we were to connect the center of each sphere to its adjacent spheres, then we would form a small cube inside the 8 spheres.<br>  <br>  Now, the diameter of the spheres is 20, so the radius is ten. However, the lines made by connecting the centers are 2r, so they're 20.<br>  <br>  If we were to find the diagonal for this cube, it would be 20 times the square root of three, since the diagonal of a flat face would be 20 times root 2, and a side of the cube is 20. (Pythagorean Theorem so the diagonal of the cube is 20 times root 3.)<br>  <br>  Then 20 root 3 subtracted by 20 would be 20( 3^1/2 - 1), which would be 20 * 0.73..... but this is the diameter, so the radius would be 10* 0.73, which is 7.3, (B).
