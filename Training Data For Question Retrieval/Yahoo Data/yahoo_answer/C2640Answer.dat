im3vWyv6aa	Our Miniature Schnauzer will make noises under her breath when she is irritated with us... like let's say she is all comfy cozy on the couch and one of us goes to pick her up. She will start making breathy noises, like as if she is saying, "Aw, gesh... I was nice and comfy."    Could it be something like that?|`|OheUwdxWaa	Hopefully it's just worms, but small dogs are sometimes affected by a collapsing trachea. I have a pekingese who makes that noise, and that's what's wrong with her. This normally only happens to older dogs, but better safe than sorry. Get your dog checked by a vet asap.|`|whPNxAo4aa	mine does this to. I'm not possitive what it is but I think it might just be a hair ball because my miniature schnauzer always licks himself.|`|CvE881lBaa	it very well may be worms, but from what you describe, it sounds more like it may be a collapsed trachea.  this isn't as scary as it sounds, it just sometimes happens with smaller breeds.  take her to the vet and have her checked out.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Have her checked by your vet.  He needs to rule out worms, trachea problems, lung problems.  Hopefully, it is just something called a "reverse sneeze".  But you need to rule out the others first.|`|cnZlMojUaa	She may be doing a reverse sneeze. It is very alarming if you haven't experienced this before. Check YouTube for dog reverse sneeze and see if this is what your dog is doing. I'm attaching one example, but you can find more. My dog does this occasionally.|`|1553c732b3db3a2c6ef4f0f9c23b201baa	Hi, Have her checked for heart worms...|`|Vp4DcPX2aa	take her to the vets. She could have heart worms or even asthma.
keX0rz1oaa	it could be something in the enviroment that is making the cat sick|`|zDeFibxzaa	take it to the vet asap he need a shot,sounds like he has a virus or something
80S8U7Edaa	My pom had really dry skin too... You should try this shampoo:  http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p89/comfy-d...    And this conditioner:  http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p87/fur-but...    They're awesome and they may definitely help!     Good luck!|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Your vet should diagnose this.  It could be dry skin, one of the manges, ringworm, allergies.  All of these have different treatments, so you really can't know what to do until you know what it is.|`|Vp4DcPX2aa	my brothers dog has it too. You can get something at the vet for their skin. or if you give them baths on a regular basis space them out. giving them too many baths can dry out their skin.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	My 5 year old lab/pointer mix has something like this. I took him to the vet and they gave me an anti itch spray that helps when he's getting really itchy and also they told me whenever I bathe him to use the Oatmeal shampoo. Good luck!|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	bath with conditioner. if she continues she may have fleas or is allergic to something.|`|pm61DB3saa	take her to the vet for a examination it will be about $10/$20
MpQW0DNZaa	try some kitty treats that says freshen breath, if that doesnt work try get some pet toothpaste or something and brush its teeth|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	I know I have one like that and she is 4 years old. My 2 younger kittens pass wind , I am thinking of putting them all on dry biscuits only, but I have 6 cats of different ages so it is hard because they are used to having wet food!|`|tmL3zyVyaa	lol that's funny!|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	LOOOOL    toothpaste?    I have 4 cats and one of them has a very stinky breath and he drolls a lot so I got him kitty toothpaste and it works!
lhOd2hvXaa	Try Pet Edge (petedge.com), they have what you are describing.    Good Luck!|`|pm61DB3saa	sorry idk try www.walmart.com|`|csDhZDvraa	EDIT nevermind lol|`|AA11992723	why so you can start a puppymill?    ADD: i am so sorry. sometimes i get witchy (with a 'b") on here especially after i see alot of byb questions and i assumed the worst in your q. i apologize.    If you dont see what you want at petedge, you can try fosters and smith or orvis, but they'll be alot more expensive than petedge. i bet you can find something on ebay too but just ridiculous shipping. and lastly you could join freecycle and post what you need you may get some luck.|`|I12oUQZPaa	I did some research on kennels when we considered a dog run for the yard.|`|98eb82548cca88f7da53bfcb622f91ceaa	This site has lots of kennels and crates in stock.    http://www.ipremiumoutlets.com/23-518335...

F3LBgfvwaa	In my experience, cats get MORE affectionate as they get older, not less. When he's an adult he probably won't be as energentic, but I'm sure he will keep being sweet, so you have nothing to worry about.|`|AgqIXOasaa	My cat is 2 this month and she is just as affectionate as your cat sounds. She always has been and she still is! So she'll probably stay the same :)|`|SOxdyWQOaa	your kitty may always lovable|`|5BOV76bmaa	yes he will my cat was like this and now shes older, she waits for me at the door and stares at me to pick her up its quite strange but really cute|`|10eguzBCaa	yes think he will stay the same just very loving awww bless|`|S0Qmk0RAaa	ok dude as long as his tail doesn't wag allot u don't tease him 24-7 he will love u always o ya try to be with him allot or as Much as u can|`|8dhe15MUaa	yes he will my cat was like that he was 9 year old|`|PVCWIEznaa	yes my cat has been extremely affectionate for three years it all depends if you are nice to him whitch im sure u are
tShDXmgbaa	You did the right thing.  Its near the 21st day so she is about ready to drop another batch of fry.  Just feed her as normal and dont stress her and you will look around and find more fry swimming about the tank.  Congrats!|`|rHwMf2P4aa	Guppies store sperm, so even though they give birth they can become pregnant again right after. You are doing the right thing, I believe that guppies are pregnant from around 25-30 days. So around then separate her. But the best thing to do is to separate the males from the females unless you want a lot of fry all the time. :)|`|Hhifw93laa	i think she is. most fish when they have fry just like adults shake just before  they give birth unfortunitly some guppies die after delivering there little guppies but i hope that this is not the case have a great day and God Bless|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Yes she is going to have more fry though don't forget she'll eat the fry just like the other fish will so I hope you have a lot of hiding places.  Good lighting and floating plants over the fry tank really helps to supply hiding places, calm the mother and provide infusoria as food for the fry.  It sounds to me like you are doing great.  I hope you can find some friends or kids in the neighborhood that would like some free guppys.  It will help promote the hobby.|`|S0Qmk0RAaa	u defiantly did the right thing but keep an eye out as soon as she has the next bach put her with the other fish so she wont eat them directly after birth believe me i raise guppies
m16gf9mzaa	There's nothing wrong with her.  It's just a difference in two species' habits.  Cat's do not sleep solid for hours on end, but do the cat nap thing on and off all day and night.  She does not understand that you will not be keeping *her* schedule.  She meows because she wants you to get up and give her some attention, and possibly some food.  Solutions for this include just getting used to it, keeping her out of the area where the bedrooms are while you are sleeping, or getting her a playmate.  Just shutting your bedroom door will not work, as she will meow on the other side of the door.  Getting another cat may not help quite as much as one might hope, as it is possible that instead of  having two cats who entertain each other, you will have two cats who both want your attention at that time of day.  As for me, I've just decided to put up with it.  I get up, give my cats some attention, feed them, then go back to bed.|`|CvE881lBaa	she certainly is trying to get your attention!    if she has food and water, as well as access to her litter box, then the only thing that she could be asking for is your attention.  my cats aren't allowed in my bedroom, so when I get up in the morning they are quite vocal.  they went all night without any attention and they're just starved for it by morning time.  pick her up and give her a good snuggle.  see if that quiets her down.    if she's brining her mouse to you, then that really shows that she's probably just bored.  throw the mouse for her - see if she brings it back.|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	she wants attention she is bored and wants to play.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	she wants up my cat does the same thing everyday|`|10eguzBCaa	she just wants you to play thats all|`|YVP9vTi1aa	She's displaying signs that she wants you to play with her.    My kitten comes into my room early in the morning on weekends too and wants me to play with her. This means she really does love you, since she regards you as a friend.    She won't be content with just toys, even if she plays with them. You better play with her, it'll make her happy and she'll think you are a better owner. :-)|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	She's a kitten! Is her litter box in your room? She might just have to go potty!|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Sounds like she's on heat if you haven't had her speyed.|`|IpbC2dUsaa	Sounds like you've got one affectionate kitten. That's probably why she's doing it. She wants the attention that you're providing and has a means of getting it.     Getting her to stop might prove...difficult. Cats are notoriously difficult to train, so the best way I would say is stop her from entering your room in the morning. She might meow at the door however, so perhaps setting up a small area in another room and making that her sleeping area?|`|DtkLsetkaa	Sounds like she just misses you and wants to spend time with you, especially if she is bringing you toys.  Tire her out as much as possible before you go to sleep (I hang a lazer pointer from the ceiling fan for about 20 minutes before bedtime if they are especially energetic, it works pretty good lol).  She will be much sleepier and will let you sleep in more in the morning.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	you are actually encouraging the behavior by doing that.  also she has you trained really good, she meows you feed her.  just ignore her when she meows she will stop doing it because you are not giving her a responce.|`|AA10700407	she's just a baby that wants some attention.
qEp9fxU9aa	These are the wrong lights.  5,200 - 5,500 is natural sunlight at noon.  12,000k & Blue Actinic are not appropriate lights.  These are blue lights where all of the other colors have been removed.  This will look horrible in a fish tank unless you have all blue fish and want to inaccurately accent this fact.  A 4 bulb system is too much for a freshwater 75 gallon system unless you have a plant tank and then it's perfect.  See if your system will work with 2 bulbs operating and buy 2 full spectrum bulbs with a 5,000 - 5,500 k and a CRI of 92 or better and you will have the proper lighting level for a fish only aquarium.  You can try 4 bulbs for this tank though I think you'll have a lot of problems with algae grow though if you keep up on heavy water changes and cleaning the sides of the aquarium the tank will be beautiful.  Make sure there are some overhanging places because fish don't have eyelids and don't like constant sun light.  Enjoy.
o93EwErKaa	It could be a parasite which can be diagnosed by taking in a fecal sample to a vet and having it analyzed.     It might also be that your brother gave her a different food or a tablescrap or treat that caused a digestive upset.  I would put her on boiled white skinless chicken and boiled white rice with a heaping teaspoon of plain canned pumpkin.  This is a bland diet that is easy to digest and the pumpkin being a natural fiber regulates the water in the digestive tract.    If you don't see an improvement within a couple of days OR the diarrhea is very frequent than take in a fecal sample to your vet.    Edit:  Pumpkin is excellent for both diarrhea and constipation and will not make either worse.  Here is one link that promotes its use.  You can do a search and come up with a hundred more.    http://www.dogchatforum.com/diarrhea-dog...|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Your vet needs to check her out.  Diarrhea can dehydrate a puppy really quickly.  You can't know what your brother fed her or if his dog has been exposed to a contagious dog.  Once your vet has diagnosed whether the problem is dietary or disease you will know what to do.|`|OqFXq9Ejaa	Take her stools to the vet for some tests. She might have worms, or a bacteria issue, or the food might not be working for her. If you recently switched her food, this could be the problem.|`|90CPrvV3aa	give him lemonade      it helps me with my stomach problems    but u might want to check with a vet....idk if ur doggie like lemonade
PMksnqkxaa	Luke warm water.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	They grow fast. Unless you have an 8ftx3ftx3ft tank in the pipeline within the next year, rehome this fish. Capable of hitting at least 12" in first year and a bit in good tank conditions.    The only reason these fish ended up in the pet trade was due to a few babies getting shipped over as surplus to the food trade. These are food fish, they're best eaten or left in the wild rather than kept as pets. (They are now being shipped to the west as food fish as well, they taste good apparently.)|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Grow depends on water temperature and the amount of food you feed the fish.  Certain Tilapia and most catfish convert approx. 50% of their useable food intake into weight.  Water temperature increases metabolism and therefore you can increase the level of feeding to a certain point.  I don't know the ideal level for an irridencent shark though you are right these catfish get very large.  If you want slower growth, feed sparingly and keep the water temperature at the low end of it's natural range.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	They grow to 12 inches pretty quickly. By the end of the first year, they should be between 12-16 inches. On year two they should be around 24 inches. It will take a while, but he'll get to 16-20 inches pretty fast.
ltIuUBXNaa	At least here in the US, when you go to apply for licenses to rehab/rescue animals. You need to have pics and descriptions of the cages that will be used and the space you will use. The regulations I am sure will be different, do a lot of research, call town offices, use the internet, ask anyone who runs a rescue that you might know. Good luck.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Some municipalities have regulations regarding the number of animals you can keep, at least in urban and suburban areas. My municipality (granted, not in Canada) limits the species that one can have. For example, sharks and rhinoceroses are expressly forbidden. I got turtles removed from the list but large snakes are still forbidden. In theory, you could keep them if you had a permit but there is no form for such a permit, nor would anyone know what to do if there were an application.     There may be regulations at other levels of government as well. You would probably have to check with all of them.|`|PIwP8DFxaa	If it is just going to be a reptile rescue and you won't have any poisonous snakes or other poisonous reptiles, you should be Ok as far as just having them goes. I do not know about having a permit to have the rescue.|`|keX0rz1oaa	You're gonna have to most like call the town clerk or i dunno what you call them . but im pretty sure you need a permit or something ... at least in america im pretty sure... but check with the country or the part you live in
90cyv9f0aa	Please take a look at these videos... CLOSELY     1 = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kstGEmpo...     2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF8fPkV9H...     3http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01SaXyGY5...    I hope you weren't too shocked...  You will notice in each video that the cats are being taunted and every handler\owner is actually getting a kick out of filming them.   Cats are beautiful and sensitive--- much moreso than almost any other animals on the planet. When a cat is perturbed or angry... there is almost always a reason. STUDY everyone's behavior... I suspect foul play and some sort of abuse. You may have to even do a hidden camera if you ever want to find out the shocking truth.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNbDVMdV0...    People are always trying to force cats to be subservient and listen to them--- unfortunately it doesn't work like this.    But if Cats are allowed to be independent and feel loved they can be the most magical pets possibly imaginable!|`|3arJsZ91aa	Perhaps she doesn't like the company of the other cats and the dog.  As for the noise when you picked her up, wouldn't you complain if you were really comfortable and someone picked you up?  Mine whines at me if she is comfortable and I need to move.  She probably stares because she wants something.  Sounds like she needs a little love and attention.  Can't be very nice living with other animals she is scared of or doesn't like.
keX0rz1oaa	cats can also get allergies and colds and they can also have asthma. it could be old age on why he is weeing all over the house and he is having problems holding it in to get to the littler box. i would more likely call your vet and explain to them what is happening.|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	Cat flu is a killer take him to the vets for an injection|`|10eguzBCaa	please take him to the vet he could have cat flu which is very fatel to a cat good luck xx|`|gFFGpbKOaa	We would let my boyfriends cats outside and one of them would want to go out all of the time and he would get pissed cause we didnt let him out and he would pee by the door all the time so I would think that it is the problem....also my sister and her husband had a house fire in Dec. and they had to have the cat outside and it was really cold and a couple days after he was sneezing so that might have to do will the coldness outside and that is why he is sneezing...Hope that I help you..and sorry to hear that..|`|iZLHDZ4saa	Your cat needs medical attention, take care of your cat.
a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	Ahh he was so content and happy, bless, the other day one of my cats aged 6 coughed as they do and a poop popped out to the astonishment of a visitor, well these things happen. Embarrassed but got tissue smiled and put it in outside bin!!!|`|Z0VvcKCraa	He probably forgot that he needed to use the litter box OR he knew he had to but didn't want to ruin the moment.  Forgive him he was feeling loved! lol|`|CvE881lBaa	i don't really have any explanation of how this happened, but it sure is funny!  thanks for sharing!    trying to relate it to human behavior...i've never been so comfy snuggling with my man that i pooped the bed... LOL
gM7VuCM4aa	9:00 pm|`|CvE881lBaa	i think you might get more response to this question if it weren't posted in the pet section...
7es9ODLLaa	Yes you can get a rat friend, but if you don't want rat babies...you better get the same sex!  Otherwise you will have tons of baby rats!!
Z0VvcKCraa	You didn't give enough details.  Where you doing something to her? Were you touching her?    Either she was trying to get attention or was trying to stop you from moving her or petting her.  Animals can't talk and they used actions to show you what they mean.  When she does this, think about what you were doing and where she was laying.....think about what she might be trying to say...|`|CvE881lBaa	i find that a lot of times people misinterpret their cats play biting for agressive biting.  what are you doing when the cat bites you?    If what i imagine to be happening is actually the case, then this is probably play biting.  Is she laying there and then you scratch or pet her stomach area and then she grabs on to your hand with her paws, kind of kicks at it with her back paws and bites down a little?  if this is the case, it's play.  cats in a litter will do this to each other very frequently.  it's a sign of trust and love if she does this.     if the behavior happens in circumstances other than this, please elaborate more and we can offer some more advice.|`|bb3649abc43bcecc1f58f0270451ecd6aa	It's an animal, and has animal instincts it nothing wrong except that it is done against you, as human they learn so show disapproval every time she bites any one.|`|e721a19799100581a8786c5c64f9e3ddaa	This is EXACTLY why I'm a dog person.|`|cd72da1da611b68cb27517a0ec0aa106aa	Mine do that...just random bites while sitting or laying down with me. My mom calls them "love nips" haha.
AA11510999	i had an agrican dwarf frog and its friend was a goldfish. They got alone great. You cant put anything small or the frog will start torturing and eating on it! Thats what the pet store told me|`|cu3jnrq1aa	we have african dwarf frogs in our fish tank.  they are adorable, and so much fun to watch.  they are very gentle, and get along with all community fish.|`|dKKgwzGraa	I once had a dwarf frog and they're a lot of fun - providing you don't have a power filter they can get trapped on. They get along very well with most community fish, such as mollies or platys or guppies. The fish might occasionally "investigate" it, and since the frogs actually do have claws, it is possible that it could accidentally hurt a fish. But, chances are, that won't happen.    By the way, if you ever notice a humming coming from your tank, it's the frog. They will sometimes sing for a mate.|`|7bbfUYUOaa	African dwarf frogs will do well with most peaceful community fish.  I've kept them with bettas, swordtails, guppies, mollies, tetras, and kuhli loaches and they seem to do great.  African dwarf frogs should really be kept in groups of 3 or more, just so ya know. :D|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	anything but very active fish like danios i have been wanting one but not getting one thanks|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Most fish will do well with them. You need to make sure they get food though. Honestly, Id recommend keeping them by themselves in a short tank so you know they are being fed.    You want to avoid other bottom dwellers though. it takes quite some time for the frogs to find their food. the other fish usually end up finding it and eating it before the frog even knew it was there.
Jguzosm2aa	I do agree with you on this. Funny thing about it all? It costs vets next to nothing.    A friend of mine is a vet tech. When she asked how much it'd cost to get her small dog done, they said they'd do it for her at cost - she was charged $17.95. Under $20. For me to get my small dog done, the lowest cost is going to be $300.00. That's a profit of more than $280.00.    And I do get that they need to make money too. I want to be a vet, and I wouldn't want to make the same amount as a cashier at a convenience store. But I think the price is a bit much, even so. For such a common and relatively easy procedure, there's no need of so much mark up.|`|AA12103453	Depends on cost of living in your area. I don't think it was that high around my area, but not sure. Have you checked other cities that are reasonably close? It may be worth your while. Anyway the vets need paid too. They are performing a surgery they had to be trained to do. They have to pay for medication to put the cat under. Go look up what it costs to put someone under at a hospital. Yeah an animal uses far less medication, but you see my point.|`|dmdq0byMaa	HI, this answer will probably not be much use, but i live in uk and its about 30-50 for cats, male and female respectively, and about 80-100 for dogs (I think).  I receive a low income benefit, so I actually paid 5 each for my cats. My point is that th US obviously seems alot more expensive than here, but I suppose the price is high because a vetinary surgen is a skilled proffessional and get paid well - hence the high fees. It is expensive, but just a one off payment, i know what u mean though. Should be free really, since it is advocated so much......|`|xZRiyna7aa	The ASPCA does low cost spay/neuters; the downside being that you must schedule well in advance.  I am not aware that they have income requirements, but could certainly be wrong.      Actually, $200 doesn't seem that bad for a spay, which is serious surgery.  In my area, it's closer to $500.  If they want to charge you that much for a neuter, it's an outrage.|`|AA10229248	That's like saying if we're so worried about people being homeless, why does it cost so much to buy a house?     Spay/neuter surgery costs money because the vet has to pay for surgical equipment, supplies, staff payroll, heat, water and electricity of the building. The cost for all of that is passed on to the consumer.    If people can't afford the basic needs of a pet (and that would include spaying/neutering and annual vaccinations) then they really can't afford a pet.|`|Chxoncy7aa	I have to agree with you.  If it was more affordable to everyone, maybe more animals would be fixed.  That would certainly help out.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Keep your eyes peeled, many adoption and rescue agencies will do a free fixing weekend.  LIFE in SoCal's got one coming up in February, one day only.  They usually get vets to donate their time for free to do this, and I'm not sure about meds for after wards.  It's so expensive b/c of what's needed to do the procedure and th training required, especially for a female.  It's considered an invasive procedure.  Anesthesia, sanitation, antibiotic, saline fluid are just some of the very expensive things required.  There's also a big liability front as well, just like with humans some animals don't handle anesthesia well. Take all this into account as well as the vet stay, the surgeon vet and the assistants and it gets expensive fast.  It's a huge bummer, and is resulting in overcrowded animal shelters, but in this day and age of financial issues it's the norm  : (|`|1saOKrSwaa	its not society that can make it affordable, its the failed doctors that end up being vets then screw you by playing on your heart strings and make you loosen your purse strings! after surgery pain medication???? that's a new one, usually enough ketamine does a good enough job of that!|`|GNtsdk4saa	Your local shelter gets subsidies from the government, that's how they can do it cheaper, but (contrary to popular belief) the government doesn't have an endless supply of money.  If they made it "more affordable" for everyone, our taxes would go up even higher.      As for vets, they have to make a living, pay their rent, buy supplies, pay their assistants, attend advanced schooling, and a million other things that cost money.  Why expect a free lunch?
1gDTiPVyaa	Yep--probably within a week.  You might make her a nest somewhere and see if she'll go for it.  She's hunting for a place to have the kittens.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Well, you're sure not over-reacting to the extent that this dog needs some vet help and if your boyfriend won't get it, he shouldn't have a dog.  Period.  The dog needs his anal glands expressed, he needs his nails clipped, he needs his eyes checked before he goes blind.  That's definite.    Your boyfriend also needs to spend some time training his dog, but that's not the dog's fault.  He likely gets little or no exercise, no training and is beyond frustrated out of sheer boredom.      Your boyfriend is quite clearly someone who shouldn't have a dog because he's not taking care of the dog in any way.|`|gwUMipsUaa	This is animal abuse.  He can and should be reported.  If the boyfriend is too lazy to care for his own dog, imagine what having children with him will be like.  Trust me, he won't be changing ANY diapers, cleaning up puke, or doing any of the other numerous things deemed disgusting when it comes to children.  He'll insult you for taking a child to see a doctor when something is wrong.    I personally would not stay with a guy that thought I was overreacting to such things.  He's sounds like a lazy piece of crap that doesn't really give a rats hind end about the dog.  Dump the boyfriend and report him for animal abuse.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	the dog obviously needs some vet care, you seem to realize this so why not take the dog to the vet yourself. i understand you dont care for the dog but it is not the dogs fault, it is your boyfriends fault. this dog has not been properly trained or cared for. step in and do it.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	Get a new boyfriend or try to work with the dog.  Suggest to your boyfriend that you will accompany him to the vet with the dog so that he can be checked to see if he's in good health. Arrange to take him to be groomed as well. Certainly you can find a nice way to tell your boyfriend that you are displeased. Why compromise your health and hygiene because this guy doesn't care?|`|FnrAw2SQaa	Tell him you think somethings wrong with the dog and try to explain to him you are not comfortable around his dog.  You are not overreaching!!!|`|vRG0ebayaa	Well, even thought hes Your boyfriend, he doesn't seem to care much for his dog, and his household if he lets his dog get bodily fluids all over, and his claws are too long. Over time that can cause bad problems for walking etc. Maybe have a long talk and tell him its not over reacting, because I really don't think it is, its more like caring.|`|zL1sggpCaa	So, you like the BF, but not the dog that he has chosen to neglect? All I can say is if you have a problem with the BF, post it in dating....    If you have a problem with the dog, then take care of it yourself.... Why not give the pug a bath? Seriously.... pugs aren't that big, you could give it a bath in the kitchen sink. Also, why not take it to get groomed and have the nails clipped?     OR, dump him. If he wont take care of his pet... and you wont... then just dump the guy.     Seriously, that's pretty bad of him to not take care of his dog. My pup gets her bath, nails clipped, brushed, etc.... all the time. Not once a freaggin year.... (Or less often like this case seems to be)...|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Yes, you're obviously not a dog person and your bf is; although an irresponsible one.  he needs to make sure his dog is cared for. Taking him to a groomer will solve the gland/nail problem. And taking the dog to obedience classes will help everyone.  Why don't you take the dog to classes - it'd be a good bonding experience for you. and yes, the dog nees to get to a vet.    As for allowing the dog to be on the couch....I have 5 dogs and it's their house as much as it is mine.  If guests don't like dog hair on the couch, they need not come over. My dogs are part of my family and are treated as such.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well things are only going to get worse, so I would suggest you find a new boyfriend.  It may be possible that the pug needs his glands extracted and a vet can do that, however, scooting is a trait of pugs, so unless the dog scoots for more than 5 minutes, he is probably normal.  This dog isn't trained, and that is not the dogs fault.  I say "no jumping" and lift the legs off of me and dance the dog backwards.  When the dog sits I say "good boy"  They don't like to be danced backwards, so this doesn't take long to train.  I think you already know you need a new boyfriend.  I wouldn't want to be with anyone who isn't as passionate about dogs as I am.  Even if he gets the glands extracted, scooting is a trait of pugs.|`|j2albguDaa	i completely agree with the first answer.  don't stay with this lazy guy.  he obviously doesn't care about the dog at all.  it's very uncomfortable for a dog not to have eye drops when they can't produce tears.  i would leave him or just take the dog yourself to the vet under your name when he's not home or something.  then show him afterwards how bad the dog is.  and as far as the anal glands, that is so gross.  he would rather have that rotten fish smell in his house all over the carpet.  i bet his house doesn't smell too clean, does it?  he's a dirtbag.|`|024lJBZ4aa	So, what is it you want?  Do you want him to get rid of the dog?  Is that what your trying to say?   Stop being selfish, it doesn't matter that you don't like the dog.  The dog came before you.  What exactly is your request?      The jumping up is a training issue.  So how about you taking the initiative and train the dog not to jump up?  How about you take the dog to have his nails clipped and anal glands cleared?  These are simple things that are easily dealt with.    A sure way to lose him is to make him choose between his dog and you.  He will definately choose the dog.  If you don't care for animals, animals being on the couch or on the bed or in the kitchen or whatever, then don't date men who own animals.|`|v91Gbt0faa	NO UR NOT  OVER REACTING THTS GROSSS  SERIOUSLY GET HIM TO TAKE IT TO THE VETS !|`|AA12128656	ok.... the boyfriend needs to give the dog to someone who will care about him, and you need to dump him- if he doesn't care about the cleanliness of his house (i know what anal glands smell like) or the dog's nails, or the dog's eyes, or how you feel about it, then obviously he needs a proctologist to find his head.    go find a guy with some self respect and caring for others.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	The problem is the BF not the dog. When you have a pup and more than one person in the house both people have to do the same things with the dog as far as training. pup needs to see a vet first, then implement a training plan. My pup was exceptionally trained until I moved in with my son and his girlfriend. They allowed him to jump on them pull on his leash, all kinds of things I diligently trained him not to do.  Go to clickersolutions.com and read. You dont have to clicker train but do need to use positive reinforcement training. Have BF read the articles. If he is not going to propely train the pup, he shouldnt have a dog.
aP4bkYOCaa	I think this is probably a better question for your pediatrician. Excrement is full of bacteria- just call the office and explain what happened, and ask if they think she needs to go in for a check-up.    Best of luck.|`|pkz2lELgaa	thats just plain nasty!  i dont know but i would be careful how you say she got the poop as CPS may think you neglected your child...or even if they didn't think , since they generally don't think. but you know what i mean.     and really don't leave your kid alone with a bloody ferret or it's cage gheesh.|`|qH7IA1Staa	uh oh! GO TO THE DOCTOR TO MAKE SURE SHE WON'T GET A BACTERIAL INFECTION FROM IT! just to make sure....|`|44kEtDvIaa	There shouldn't be a problem.  Would keep an eye on her and unless you see some change in her attitude, eating habits, playfulness or temperature ... you can always give the doc a call and see what he/she has to say.|`|tQN4lGKOaa	duh...ask a doctor!
1oj4aamaaa	Sounds like he's purring, which means he's very happy.  Nothing is wrong.
Kn90YAzYaa	Make sure you're "100% dedicated", first of all.  What if you get a new boyfriend?  Will you cut time out with him to go groom and train your horse?  What if you get really sick or in an accident?  I suggest doing some serious thinking about this before you do it and make absolutely sure you're dedicated.  If you don't, you're gonna be the one losing money.  You need to concentrate on finishing school, saving that "horse money" for going to college. Then you'll have a great career that pays well enough so you don't have to write out a business plan for a horse.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Include an "emergency vet fund"- horses are gorgeous- albeit delicate, clumsy creatures. You should have enough back-up money for, say, if the horse colics or hurts himself.    Some other stuff..    Tack!  Feed/hay, depending on how your boarding barn works  Supplements  Money sufficient for show season (if applicable)  Grooming supplies  Pre-purchase exam, if you haven't calculated that in  Shipping costs if the horse is out of state    I wouldn't bother coming up with reasons for you to have a horse- your dad knows you've been riding since you were a little girl and probably knows this is your dream! I think an even better way of convincing him you're ready to own a horse is to take all of these costs seriously and maybe start saving some money of your own to pay for some of it. Don't cut corners.    Best of luck. :)|`|RYRhMyh7aa	I would make sure that you go out and buy a first aid kit. That way you don't have to call the vet out for every little things. Also include the price of tack, grooming supplies, feed/hay (if not included in the board). Don't forget about lessons and/or shows that you might want to do. Definitely include the price of a pre-purchise exam and the cost of getting the teeth done.
wu1z4uWNaa	Same thing happen to my dog,And she turned out to be pregnant. i dnt think their is anyway to prevent it now, but take her to the vet and ask them.|`|SDJ72zEPaa	unless you wanted her to have puppies at some point you should have got her 'done' after her 1st season xx|`|zL1sggpCaa	In order to PREvent, you should have been outside with her......    Now, you can only let time do its thing and see if she is preggos....    OH, and if you would like to not hoover over your dog, then get her fixed... That would solve all the problems RIGHT there...|`|SKyPhcnqaa	i would phone the vet you should have also tryed to identify the owner of the other dog or/and breed just incase you find yourself selling them|`|0HAn67yZaa	don't worry, you can take her to the vet and get her the abortion shot, then get her spayed asap.|`|PM23RDycaa	Is your vet still open? Call them and schedule a spay for her asap. If they will do it while she is in heat even better. She's in heat and should not be allowed outside unsupervised as you can clearly see. Keep her inside the rest of her heat and have her spayed IMMEDIATELY.|`|7Sf8VD85aa	Get her down to the vets tomorrow for a morning after pill.|`|bIaywrBCaa	The vet can give her a shot to abort the pups but you should take her in right away or better yet, have her spayed.|`|oZRfb0eAaa	ring your vets in the morning, he will tell you what you can do, but next time escort your dog outside to prevent this happening again.|`|3giaPYe8aa	There's a 99.99% chance that she is pregnant.  Make an appointment to have her spayed.  This will be an automatic abortion and a guarantee that this will never happen again.  This was very irresponsible to let a b*tch in heat out in the yard alone.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Take her to the vets and get an injection, it's like the morning after pill for humans. Or perhaps vets now do tablets.
RN1wGlWWaa	Pets will run about $600 or so.  Here's a breeder's list to get you started.      http://www.breedlist.com/cornish-rex-bre...|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Since they are not a "mainstream" breed, they're a bit scarce.  Expect to pay upwards of $1000 for a pet quality kitten without breeding rights.  But do check out the CFA and TICA (the two legitimate cat registration bodies in the US) websites and find their breeder referral list.  You may be able to find a breeder who's retiring a show cat or a breeder, and they want to find a good home for these cats, and will sell them to you for the price of their spay/neuter and to get vaccines updated. You can get quite a nice cat this way.  And there is also Rex Rescue - while I "do" Siamese rescue, I also have a rescue Cornish Rex - so they do exist!|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	It depends on the breeder, but its normaly 200 to 500 pounds.
3a01c0ab887b9ad9d7b78f85618d8bf5aa	This is very important to do immediately:  Get her to lick some honey or Karo syrup off your fingers, even if you have to force it into her mouth or wipe it off on her tongue. Small dogs often get hypoglycemic & if that's what's wrong with her, she will die before tomorrow unless you get her blood sugar stablized & giving her honey or syrup won't hurt her if she's NOT having a hypoglycemic attack & it will save her life if she IS.   I can't believe your vet put you off till tomorrow!  Little dogs also get dehydrated easy & you took away some of her water when you took away her wet dog food. As Mel said, boil some boneless chicken & offer it to her but also offer her the broth off the chicken in a drinking bowl. It will help hydrate her & it has a lot of nutrients in it.  The links are about canine hypoglycemia & dehydration + a link for vet advice.  Good luck with your new pup!    http://www.dog-health-guide.org/caninehy...  http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_toy...    http://www.metpet.com/Reference/Dogs/Foo...    http://www.free-online-veterinarian-advi...|`|80S8U7Edaa	When you took away the wet food, did you do it all at once? Or did you slowly replace the wet with the dry? Like, by mixing it in? Switching a dog's food has to be done gradually.. otherwise it messes them up. I think she's be fine until her vet appointment tomorrow. But if I were you, I would boil a piece of chicken breast and give her some. She'll more than likely gobble that right up, and it will at least get her eating something until tomorrow.|`|89512b4a439d6f311cd06b16d97c9b22aa	yeah smaall voi is right it sounds as if the pup is bottoming out she needs sugar water atleast 1 x a day ok|`|qq804CE8aa	Take her to the vet...right away.  She sounds really sick|`|KFwXBXv7aa	take her to the vet
NnYB9eXiaa	I'm gonna talk about cages first - but PLEASE check the end of my post about the water part - it's really important!!!    Bin cages are the best way to house hamsters, whether they're Syrian (Teddy Bear, Honey Bear, Golden, Panda) or Dwarf (Russian, Winter White, Roborovski or chinese).    I personally think they allow the most creativity while still giving your hamster room to move around.  Almost every breeder I know, and most rescue groups will tell you they're the best way to go as well :)    They're virtually escape proof because the sides are so tall, and there's SO much more room for your hamster (or hamsters if you have dwarfs) to move around in.  You can load them with toys and still put in fun tube arrangements for them to play in. There's more space to change things around - hamsters get bored easily so moving and changing out their toys is important in keeping them active and entertained!       You should use a large, bin that's transparent - no dyes (ie colors) because the chemicals could hurt your pet if they chew on it.    Here's an idea of what the best type of bin should look like, and the size you'll want to look for, it doesn't need to be this particular brand, but this is they type you'll want:    http://www.rubbermaid.com/rubbermaid/pro...      There are some great websites with advice for creating bin cages, here are a few:    http://www.hamstercentral.com/wiki/How_t...      http://www.bitterepiphany.com/bin_cage.h... [note: great info, the text is pink on white so it's a bit hard on the eyes, but the pictures and tutorial are worth it!]      http://www.ehow.com/how_2101498_hamster-...      This google search will give you some ideas on what they look like with things in them!    http://images.google.com/images?q=bin%20...    Be creative, be safe, and most of all - HAVE FUN!    --------------------------    The hamster that's drinking a lot, is it peeing a lot too?  It could be just trying to rehydrate - otherwise it's a sign of diabetes.  Please, please message me and I'll give you more info about diabetes and the symptoms and how you can feed your hamsters without putting them at any risk for it (and what's safe if the one does have it)    Daisy|`|0OTuWHhpaa	It would have helped if you had a photo of the cage in question (there's a few rotastak cages). They should probably be ok, they're plastic so there's no risk of your tiny little hamsters squeezing through the bars, just try putting some things under the tubes that go straight up for your hamster to use as a stool or something and use lots of sawdust to break any falls or something. This one looks pretty goodto me.    http://www.petcentreonline.co.uk/ecommer...    And I don't think so, one of mine drinks all the time but it's ok, just keep an eye on it for any signs of bad health.|`|jb59SazLaa	anything where it can get food and water at all times, somewhere to cuddle and hide in. also something that DOESN'T have a wired bottom, it can hurt them.    most pet stores sell cages and it usually says HAMSTER on the box :)|`|qQOyTxoQaa	I use CritterTrail cages. They have deep plastic bottoms so that they have a hard time throwing bedding out, but they also have wire sides so there is plenty of ventilation. You can buy tubes to attach to the cage. I have two dwarfs in one with added tubes. They're also escape-proof if they're put together correctly. The bars are close enough together that they can't even begin to fit through.        About the one drinking a lot of water, I'm not sure. I've heard it can be bad and a sign of kidney or bladder infections/problems.
sMTVcfiVaa	It depends how young they both are. The younger the better, of course. Try to get two females to avoid fighting.|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Yeah, i've done this before and it worked fine. Just make sure when you introduce them on neutral territory, some where with a large area, where neither of them has been on before, like a bed! Make sure they don't fight, though they're bound to be interested in each other and eventually one of them should become the dominant rat of the couple, when i did this with my rats, the dominant rat pinned the other down to show her she was 'the boss!'   Just keep introducing them maybe one or two times, until they're happy with each other  They got on fine and it was all ok!! :)  ~ Good luck ~|`|C3DSUacAaa	If you introduce them properly and gradually, there should be no problem. Have them meet in neutral territory, where neither's scent is present, a few times a day for a half hour to an hour each time; after a few days of  this and no aggressive behaviour, clean out the main cage completely and thoroughly to eliminate any scent, and then place them together. They should be fine.|`|U3W2AvnKaa	it depends some times if they're the same sex or different sex sometimes the older one treats it like its baby or you can have troubles|`|pKjjVvlEaa	You need to quarantine any new rats for three weeks.  Please keep that in mind.
n8jrLDblaa	Unfortunately, you are going to get patronizing answers, as this is a totally managable situation.    Puppies bite....HARD...they bark and growl as well. Any behavior that went beyond what is acceptable would be corrected by the dam. Now, those corrections are your job. Nothing that he is doing sounds at all out of the ordinary. And, considering his age, you can expect to deal with this for some time. It's not accomplished overnight. And you can't compare him to other dogs you've had....all pups are different.    But, to be sure it gets better and not worse you need to take a proactive approach immediately. It's play and attention that the puppy wants. You need to teach him that rough play isn't acceptable. When he snarls and bites too hard, give a stern "No" and then walk away. Ignore the pup as he tries to engage you in play. Do not make eye contact...do not touch the dog physically. When he gives up and calms down, feel free to praise him and treat him to reward the calm behavior. Do this consistantly.....all the time, every time...and it will pay off.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Your best bet is a really good trainer (I like one who uses positive reinforcement).  If he is just naturally aggressive, you have trained him, done everything you can and you still cannot trust him, you might just need to euthanize him.  Not politically correct, I know, but realistic.  Bad breeding has created some untrainable dogs.  People's -- and by this I do mean yours --  safety is more important.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	Ask the vet?? If you can correct the behavior then something is wrong.|`|j2albguDaa	i rehabilitated an 8 week old rottweiler just like this.  as soon as he does the aggressive behavior, just take him and hold him down on his side until he completely quits moving ( you should be able to let go of him without him immediately trying to get up ).  he needs to be  in a rested state of mind before you let go.  this is how his mother would correct unacceptable behavior.  make sure you are calm when doing it and don't get frustrated at him.  the rottweiler pup also had food aggression, you do the same thing.  put his food down, reach in, when he goes to bite you, put him down on his side immediately.  now, the rottweiler is 1.2 yrs old and is the best dog.  he was truely the worst puppy i've ever seen.  you also need to watch the dog whisperer or go to his website for tips.  make sure he gets a lot  of exercise too, this will make things a little easier.  it's better if they go on walks or runs first thing in the morning to get out that morning burst of energy.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	it Sounds like the dog doesn't see you as the leader.  You got to be the boss...eat before the puppy eats and don't give in to table scraps.....for one whole day ignore him and only give him attention when he is good.  another then you can do is when he bites you yelp really loud to make him back off keep doing it until he doesn't bite but licks you(i had the same issue) If that doesn't work which it usually does, spray water at him every time so he knows biting means water in the face.  and get him exercise.  If he growls just stand ground don't make him think for a second he is better then you!!  that way when he grows up he is submissive not dominant!|`|ctiKoGGfaa	Do research on training methods and implement them fast.I highly recommend positvie reinforcement and NOT CM. Treating aggression with aggression with my pup escalated the aggression. I am 93 lbs, he is 115 lbs. But I dont think this is aggression, I think its normal puppy testing you and teething. Get him bully sticks and bones to chew on. When teething, it feels GOOD to bite down, it releaves the pain. Go to clickersolutions.com and read.|`|qcAGW1ODaa	get the dog whisperer to come and sort it out!!|`|tF80XoLDaa	yeah, this happened to me with my new puppy, it was schnauzer and i had the same problem. what you should do it make him bite this own paw, and give him soft slaps in the ears. with the time it will just get adapted to living with you. ITS NORMAL|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	You are correct - what you describe isn't normal puppy behavior. And you are correct that this has nothing to do with lack of training - this is a temperament problem. You need to hire a behaviorist or private trainer who can meet this pup, determine exactly what his motivations/issues are and then work with you to change his behavior. Ask your vet for a referral or go to www.apdt.com or www.iaabc.org.|`|jQglJiMhaa	this dog needs to know that you are the alpha dog in the pack, he obviously knows that he can't be dominate over the other dogs.      Take the puppy (they are never too young to train, this is the best time to deal with that kind of behavior), kneel beside it, forcefully place the dog into a sit position, then a lay down position, then roll the puppy onto its side untill he just lays there in a submissive state.  When i say forcefully i dont mean slam the dog around, but be firm and confident.  Do not be afraid of the dog, they can sence emotions, and this dog is not going to kill you.    So again,   1. kneel beside the dog  2. Firmly put dog into sitting position  3. Once sitting, firmly place into laying position  4. Then roll puppy onto its side, and hold down at shoulders and hips.  5. Hold dog on its side untill it stops fighting back, once it has calmed down you can gently pet him, and reassure him.    If the dog is flailing around you can hold the front down with the head, not in an abusive way, but firmly.  You may have to go through the motions a couple times, eventually he will automatically submit to you    This technique has worked with me with every dog i have ever had, and has worked for many people i know.    Its truely hard to say what will and wont work without full info on the dog.  What is the scenario when he is biting at you, is he protecting something? in the house? outside? only when other dogs are around? only when no others are around?  there are many things that diagnose a behavioral problem.    I think its great that you're not willing to just give up on the dog, many people would have tried to get rid of him already, that shows you are truely a responcible dog owner, and i applaud you|`|3wJGXfkKaa	I personally have two labs and my aunt used to have a collie when I was younger.  They are pretty good dogs never had any trouble out of them.  But labs are or well can be extremely hyper, look at the movie Marley and me, Marley never listens because they weren't showing him who's boss.  Your right about the young and it not being trained thing it'll take time to get him to listen to you.  Get some chew toys for him that might help and take him for some walks to get rid of some of that energy.  Labs have tons of energy and big amounts of exercise and play time help a lot!!  Hope he gets better and don't give up just be persistant with him, he'll know your the boss, the pack leader.|`|7qFYd0y8aa	Bite him Back. When he bites roll him over and Bite (do not break the skin but give him something to think about) his neck. And/Or Try grabbing his bottom jaw and holding on for a while. The First one shows him who the real big dog is just like you older dog does, and the second is negative reinforcement that biting you is unpleasant. Train like the dog thinks.  Do not ever hit him or crate him for bad behavior. Those just make him fear your hand and/or his crate.|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	You have to start to become his pack leader.  He is trying to establish that he is the pack leader very young and you will have to change this bad behavior.    I helped my niece with her puppy and it worked.  Here is what I did.  I first sat on the floor and did not say anything to the puppy.  Then I gently put my hand on her back and said 'down' and gentle make her go down to the floor.  I kept my hand on her back and she squirmed for only about 1/2 minute (I did not say anything).  She knew by my hand what I wanted her to do.  She then submitted to me and became calm.  Once she was calm, I release pressure slightly and began to rub her back.  But when she tried to get up, I again applied pressure to keep her in a down position.  My niece said she never saw the pup that calm!    Check out these websites and videos.|`|ZmFa6FL2aa	This website has links to good trainers and books to read about dog training  www.fearfuldogs.com/books.html|`|wDsvazAFaa	When your dog snaps at you, you must punish it! Let him know who's boss. Say ' No! ' firmly and if it doesn't let got, open its jaw gently and drag him by his collar to his crate and lock the door for ten minutes, so he can calm down. If your dog doesn't have a crate, tie him up somewhere so that he's isolated from you and your other dogs. When you let your dog out, ignore him for a couple of minutes and then carry on as normal. Do this for a couple of times and see if it makes a difference. It worked for my dog when she was a puppy! If your dog continues to snap, consult vet or a trainer.    Hope this helps!

But it is very critical to have the female spayed earlier. the longer you wait the mor chance of it developing Pyometra which could cause kidney failure and even death. and at the least will cause you to spend way more then it would have cost to have her spayed and instead have to have a hysterectomy done on her. I can't believe the family vet has not warned you of the dangers of not having a female fixed at an earlier age.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Dogs do not go through menopause|`|gwUMipsUaa	Take her to the vet.  Bleeding should only last the first week of heat.  The next two weeks of heat don't involve bleeding.  Something else is wrong.|`|j2albguDaa	she's not going to go through menopause.  she needs to be spayed, but with her age and if her health is bad, they will not put her under anesthesia to do that.  do you not know anything about dogs, and how long have you had her??|`|um5CVvTfaa	B*tches don't go through menopause because they don't have menses.  They have estrus cycles that continue until their thyroid or other internal organs fail to work properly.    fwiw-- for some b*tches, bleeding for three weeks is NORMAL.  At 13+ years old, I'd be afraid she was bleeding because of a uterine infection.  Beware- pyometra is deadly.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	They don't stop going thru heat until they are spayed. You are lucky she hasn't developed pyometra. She should have been spayed years ago. You have to just live with it now.. Dogs do not go thru menopause..
BCZ1ezXMaa	they seem fine, but the cup thing would make me nervous; sharp edges  they love the cotton balls, its warm (:  if the hermit hut is edible for gerbils, thats fine  good luck (:|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	They all look good, then only thing is that they can chew that cardboard cartin thing.    Also, I would watch ur gerbil on the last agility coarse. Just watch him while hes on it.    Also be careful on the sharp edges on that upside down much. They could scratch him.     Hope this helped.  :)    Good luck with your gerbil
w4DIPHf1aa	I guess your using instant ocean salt? good choice    I would get a hydrometer to measure specific gravity to get the brackish water right but i think your pretty close already.    be super careful adding crushed coral..this may make the water very acidic. It is not a neutral substrate at all. That could be a very very bad idea.    The only thing your missing is his mandatory diet of snails...    These puffers need to constantly file there teeth down and pond snails do the trick. Most people create a "snail jail" ( 5 gallon bucket aquarium for breeding snails).    A whack of snails every 2 weeks should do it...    pet stores give away these snails for free but breeding your own is always easier.      sounds like your well on your way..    these fish are a bit of work but well worth it.      If the sand is a toal pain i would just take it out and leave it bare bottom for now. one month is no big deal at all.
7lsU5bcoaa	money set aside - it is up to you, but as much as possible, at least a couple hundred, more if you can  doubles and triples of items - halters (make sure they're breakaway), saddle pads (cause they get all gross and musty and need to be washed), lead lines (sometimes they disappear)      you should look into a vet when you start looking at horses, so you have one to call when you want to do a prepurchase vet exam. usually the barn owner will know of a farrier that the other horses see, and you'd probably get a discounted rate if the farrier only has to come out once for multiple horses.    and the right horse is never the wrong color or the wrong breed. look for temperment training and suitablility not a specific breed.     good luck!|`|uWcD70hXaa	Well its cool that you are getting one first of all. the best of luck to you! I think shareboardding is a great choice too. well for emergencies, just always be able to have enough money if your horse needs surgery or anything like that i can't exactly say how much but ALWAYS have something put away to help you out and keep adding to it.quarter horses and Appaloosas are two great breeds to own so i think they are both great and i love appaloosas too! hope you find what you are looking for!|`|if0qKN0uaa	if u like appaloosas and Quarter horses look into Arabians and even a Warm blood|`|pnDZcQKpaa	you should look for a good temperament, friendliness, and willingness to learn. not all horses are perfect, but you'll find your match.  i think that you should keep a couple hundred or maybe even a thousand dollars for emergencies (colic, a cut, injury, etc.)  and, you should have:  two bridles  two girths  multiple saddle pads  stirrup leathers  helmet  polo wraps/boots  and for your first horse, it depends what kind you like. quarter horses are calm and versatile, and thoroughbreds are fast and good jumpers. appaloosas are also friendly, and they would be a good first horse.  it mostly depends on how the horse is trained!  good luck!
2Zb0eNfeaa	Those dimensions equal a 93.5 gallon tank so it's close.|`|hKXIeur6aa	Not at all. It is an 100 gallon tank. They come in 3 common sizes:  48 long, 24 wide, 24 high  60 long, 18 wide, 21 high  72 long, 18 wide, 18 high    I think the second tank gives the most versatility in freshwater, however for aquascaping in saltwater, I would go for the first.
PM23RDycaa	First off you need to have your dog checked out by the vet FIRST before you start giving him anything. There could be something wrong with him beyond just getting old. Vet first meds second|`|j0ZsYrUJaa	That might be a good idea from Annie.  We have a rottie/mastiff cross, who is about 9 years old.  about a year and a half ago, we noticed he was very slow getting up in the morning, so we switched him over to the glucosamine "petsmart" food.  We also got him a MUCH better bed to sleep on.  He's still old, obv, but this seemed to help 10 fold.|`|UmhWxs1laa	Today.  Better yet, go to your local BJ's or Costco and get the glucosamine/chrondrotin made for people.  About $37 for a big bottle.  Don't pay big "pet" prices, same stuff is in the people version!|`|8tJPK69iaa	check with your vet, I certainly wouldn't be happy dragging my leg. My friend started her cat on glucosimine and her cat is now running up and down the stairs again. He couldn't even walk to the food bowl before he started taking it. It usually takes 6-8 weeks before you notice a difference.|`|fgxajTiBaa	10 isn't very old for a Pug. Small breeds can sometimes live to be 20 years. If your dog is dragging his leg then it looks like a vet visit is in order. Don't self-diagnose, there could be something else entirely going on.|`|qMDL2Ofjaa	it might be slightly more serious than old age. our friends dog had the smae thing and it turned out to be something entirely different.
2Zb0eNfeaa	Not the cardinals but some loaches can become aggressive when defending their territory.|`|hKXIeur6aa	Loaches are definitely not, however, some tetras are known to have a slight problem. But nothing extreme.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Some loachs and tertras can be fin nippers    I think cardinals will be OK, especially if they are in a decent school.    Skunk loachs are known fin nippers, but most other smaller species are peacefull. Kuhli loaches would be OK for sure.    Ian|`|7guIba8paa	my zebra loaches love tryin 2nip at my neon tetra|`|2IhKJjY1aa	I hope you are not planning on putting your beta with the tetras and loaches cause you won't have to worry about the beta getting nipped but the beta killing your tetras and loaches.  They do best in a tank by themselves.
XDCLL4Oqaa	Yes. When a guinea pig goes hard. It means he is gone. They go hard really fast. In about 5 mins. I have sadly had experience. Though with guinea pigs. You need to berry it. I think he should just be berried not cremated. Though its up to you.     You should hurry. It will Spread Bactieria about. And its not healthy.     Good luck.   Im sorry.   I know how you feel,  my guinea pig had 4 babies, and died 3 days after.   I was devistated.|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	I would get him cremated soon, if you want to do that. Dont leave him in there too long.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	was he dead when you frooze him he was rotting alive you should had taken him to the vet and had him put down|`|5fI8D1seaa	not to be rude or anything but that's kind of scary... I'm so sorry for you loss. I know how heartbroken I was when my hamster died (R.I.P ROCCO). I would say only about 3 days tops and I don't know the answer to the second one, sorry! But again, I'm really sorry that your poor hamster died. Maybe get a new one? ='(
FJOKqwTxaa	If I were you I would just put some wet puppy food out every day and while you are gone they will come eat it. Eventually they will come when you are out there then they will start coming to you for food. You just need to earn there trust first. But if it is extremely cold I would get a shelter out there to help you catch them before they get sick.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	call your local animal police. they will capture them, bring them to an animal rescue where they will treat any medical problems(like malnutrition) and adopt them out.  Were you planing on keeping the dogs? just tell the officer you're VERY interested in adopting the dogs when they're ready. BTW, thanks for trying to help a stray dog, it's thanks to people like you we still have a somewhat civilized world!   Remember-  The Starfish Parable:    An old man walking on the beach at dawn noticed a boy picking up a starfish and throwing it into the sea. When asked why, the boy explained that the stranded starfish would die if left to lie in the morning sun. 'But there are millions of starfish on this beach,' said the old man. 'How can your efforts make a difference?' The boy picked up another starfish and placed it in the waves. 'It makes a difference to this one,' he said.    I know that I can't save them all, but the ones I can save mean everything in the world to me.|`|tL2soFpUaa	well i would set out puppy food or cut up chicken outside and watch and see if the two puppies come and get it. if they are hungary enough they will come get it.  i would also call the humane society and let them know of the puppies so they could keep an eye out. but on the other hand maybe the mother dog came back for them later, i would just keep an eye out for a few days.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	FOOD will attract it faster than anything else and use a good food like meat or canned dog food, not bread, but it will probably take a few days|`|ErcsrWtJaa	The mother dog came back for the other two. Don't put out wet food or chicken to  attract the dogs (you said that there was snow...such things would freeze and they could not eat it anyway.)  You can put out a dish of dry food.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Call animal control.  If you try to catch these dogs on your own you could end up hurt, or hurting one of the puppies.  What if mom takes off with a pup, drops it somewhere because she is scared, and keeps going?  Then you've got an orphan pup in the cold that you can't find- it would surely die.    Your best bet is to contact people who have the resources to catch these dogs.
F0m7ey0Caa	I think as we (humans) grow and learn, we are seeing/realizing that animals, although not quite as intelligent as we are, still feel the base emotions that we do...anger, happiness (contentment), sadness, love (especially seen between mother and child). They "feel" and they also serve a purpose here on earth.   That being said, it is obvious that they need to be protected. Sadly, this doesn't seem to happen in the animal's natural habitat.  Dozens of species have been brought close to extinction. The main effort of zoos today is to try and replace the depleted numbers through specific breeding programs and to educate people about the animals and their worlds.  Most zoos do wonders for the animals they keep but I do think it's sad that the animals have to be "contained" in smaller enclosures. They pay the price for humans' greed and ignorance.|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Some zoos are really cool and help preserve endangered species. But some are really nasty and treat the animals badly. The zoos with enough room and resources to house the animals comfortably, I like.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	yes.  If we didn't have zoos some animals would be extinct!|`|AA12189965	yes zoos a re wonderful they help protect endangered species do breeding programs with other zoos to insure survival of a species and they do animal rehabilitation.. if zoos are shut down many species like tigers. polar bears etc will go extinct|`|e5VUwaRsaa	I think that some zoos serve a good purpose. They are used as conservation centers where tons of research is conducted. Providing the animals have plenty of space and their environments are similar to their natural habitat, then it's fine.    However, some zoos are just there to make a spectacle out of the animals. The enclosures are small and the animals look miserable.|`|OwNlomlTaa	Yes, but only accredited zoos that's main purpose is the protection and welfare of their animals.  Roadside zoos have a bad example of a zoo and deserve to be knocked off this planet.  However, most major zoos try their best to get animal welfare out there and they have breeding and conservation programs to help animals still in the wild.    Just think how many people would know nothing about wild animals if they didn't have a zoo to go see and learn about them :)
aJG5D0Vkaa	Why don't you do what I did,my mom wouldn't allow me to get a dog because they cost too much and need a lot of care,so I still did not get my dog but she said that when we find a good breeder in our state I can have one,I did it by talking about dogs and their qualities for about two-three months(I started December)They got so annoyed because I was talking about dogs every single day and finally they decided to get me one to stop all the talking about dogs.(I am only 11 and I am going to get the yorkshire terrier of my dreams)I think you should try it too your parents will probably crack first!)|`|44kEtDvIaa	Nick has the right approach.  Practice patience and do a lot of research.  Let her know how interested you are in snakes and how much you know about them.  And show your responsibility 'cause snakes do take care and I'm sure mom may be afraid she'll be the one taking care of it.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	It's your mother's house, and she does not want a snake in it.  That should be good enough for you.  The best thing for you to do is wait until you grow up and move out of the house and get your own place, then you can have a snake.  Don't give her grief about this.|`|ZUOLntgiaa	lol do what i did..sit for hours and hours on the pc researching the care and needs of the snake that you want, read books, show that you are really researching the care and needs of the snake. that is what i did and eventually got my own way, and now my mom likes the snakes lol. my mom didnt want me to get 1 as with every other pet i have had i got bored of. but i havent with snakes and have a boa now, and soon should be getting a burm, started off small worked up, and worked on my mom to let me lol good luck|`|cbefEuHWaa	sneak it
t6UkxbBNaa	Yes they can and they do... I have a mini rex doe that is driving me crazy because she keeps pulling her fur out and I've never bred her. Your doe could also be 'molting' which she looses all her hair and grows new, it's very common and it happens about once a year or twice.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Pulling out fur is a sign of nesting, but it is possible she is goin through a false pregnancy, its quite common :)|`|5L5GQYFXaa	A female bunny will pull out its fur when she is nesting so check that out to be sure shes not pregnant just in case. Other reasons could be that she is nervous. Is there a dog for example near her cage? that might be a sign of stress.  Hope i helped|`|nmercOm7aa	They can. It is usually a false pregnancy. Some just do it. If it keeps happening, you should get her spayed. If she is a pet, she should be spayed anyway.|`|FrPVteUIaa	I'm not really good with this stuff, but u should go to a vet just in case if the bunny is not pregnant or is pregnant.|`|5lRMzTYqaa	i gusse|`|nQ800xxTaa	the hair falling out means that your rabbit might be pregnant or it could be a false alarm that is what happend with my rabbit
AA11459417	To get him to use the litter box, pick him up and put him in it and then move his paws around in the litter in the motion that he'd use to bury his waste.  That's usually enough to give a cat the right idea.  If that doesn't work and if he makes a mess somewhere outside the litter box, take a paper towel and wipe up the mess and then put the paper towel in the litter box.  Take him to the litter box and let him sniff the paper towel (he needs to associate the scent of his waste with the litter box).  Then move his paws in the litter for him as if burying the waste.  You can then throw away the filthy paper towel.  You'll also need to use an enzymatic cleaner to clean the place where he made his mess; otherwise, he'll keep using that spot since the scent is there.      I just have to say this about neutering.  I think you should talk to a vet about it.  It seems that you're a bit naive about the procedure.  It's NOT a horrible procedure.  For a male cat, it's a very minor procedure with a very short recovery time.  Cats that aren't neutered have shorter lifespans and a much higher risk of health problems.  Besides, male cats tend to spray really foul-smelling urine if they aren't neutered.  I hope you change your mind about this issue -- it really would be better for your cat to be neutered.|`|ZJONfLNJaa	Ya, my cat is an outdoor one, but she has liver disease right now so she cant at the time, but it is winter and if you live in a place that has winter, you have to do this. If it is a cold day and your cat wants to go outside, pick him up and bring him out for a minute daily untill he realizes that it is too cold for him to have time to adapt. So then he shouldnt have to go out|`|4TX26viFaa	He should pick up immediately what the litter is for.    Get him neutered, or he won't leave the door alone.|`|dfe0268d59e51b8e7c2861c0cbc917b9aa	Your cat may spray in the house if he is not neutered. and will help bring unwanted kittens if he is outside. I agree with you that you should keep him in the house, but I'm pretty sure you will want him neutered if you do. That's the only way to stop him from spraying. I know I didn't answer your question, but that's something for you to think about. If he is spraying the house what's the point of litter training him.
IMoX3RcJaa	Is she young?  This sounds like pretty common behavior for a young cat.  They are nocturnal animals by nature.  She probably wasn't acting this way right away because she was either too scared or she felt unwell.  Play with her more during the day to tire her out.  Maybe consider getting her a (not vicious) kitty playmate, if you can.  If you cannot do that, maybe you can just shut your bedroom door, or get a fan to block the noise.  That's what I do to sleep in my house full of crazy felines.    Also, NEVER EVER strike your cat unless you want it to run and hide from you the rest of it's life.    Kudos to you for saving a stray, as well.|`|nOU8WvmDaa	have ahit man "take care of" the other cat|`|MGxDgsKZaa	Can you give more detail on her bad behavior?|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	My aunt got this zapper and put it on the counter, so that when the cat jumped up, it went right down. Then the cat learned, after about 1-2 months. It didnt zap the cat THAT HARD.
mC838ZbLaa	The best thing i did was to just ask another horse lover in my area. A lot of times, if they have had horses long enough, they will have a list of farriers to try and a list of ones not to. Through my trial and error i have found a select few i like. The main thing i look for is the how my horse acts around them. They are always a better judge of character. My farrier guarantees his shoes of at least five to six weeks so... I hope you have good luck!|`|Ih0B30Pvaa	Get a phone book.  Look in the yellow pages under "farrier".  Then call a bunch of them and get prices.      Or...  Ask around. If you want a great farrier you should ask what other people think of a particular farrier.  There are really good ones and really bad ones.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	www.farriers.com/ohio.htm
IhjFjoKDaa	Breeding your bay to the buckskin here are the percentage chances you'd have:      43.95% -   Buckskin  43.95% -   Bay  3.13% -   Palomino  3.13% -   Chestnut  2.93% -   Smoky Black  2.93% -   Black|`|an1L8njXaa	to garentee a buckskin foal the yes you would have to breed to something that has double dilute genes so cremello or perlino, however if you brreed to something with one dilute ie a palamino or buckskin then you have a 25% chance of getting a buckskin.    Breeding for colour is stupid thing to do anyway, you should breed for conformation and preformance, a good  horse is never a bad colour and a good colour is just a bonus.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Palomino X Palomino = Cremello  Buckskin X Buckskin = Perlino      So if you want a buckskin, breed to a perlino.    With your mare being bay, you'll have almost a 90% chance of getting a buckskin foal.|`|c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	You don't have to.  If you happen to find a perlino or cremello then you will have a 100% chance of getting the cream gene passed on. With a palomino or buckskin you will have a 50% chance of the cream gene being passed on.  The cream gene dilutes a bay to a buckskin and a chestnut to a palomino.  Perlinos and cremellos are the result of crossing a mare and a stallion that are both carrying and both passing on a cream gene so the resulting foal is carrying two cream genes (a double dilute).  A perlino is a bay with two cream genes and a cremello is a chestnut with two cream genes.    Depending on whether or not the bay and the stallion are both carrying a red gene, you could end up with a palomino rather than a buckskin.  So if you're looking for a buckskin foal rather than palomino, you should stick to a perlino or buckskin to cross the bay with for a better chance at a buckskin.  A cremello or palomino will always throw a red (chestnut) gene.|`|px27V5N9aa	You want a Perlino that is Homozygous for Black and Creme    scroll down on this and see what I mean:  http://www.morningstarmorgans.50megs.com...      This will also help you out..scroll down on this too  http://www.prairiehillmorgans.com/Stalli...|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, you can get to a buckskin is by breeding to one of those colors, but you have a guaranteed buckskin.  There is a 50% chance of getting a buckskin if you breed to a palomino/buckskin.    The stallion you have in mind is gorgeous, you have a 50% chance of a buckskin foal with him and a 50% chance of a bay.
DCeAcP7kaa	Try putting a litter box there or something.|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	Make sure he knows where the litter box is.|`|IMoX3RcJaa	Is your cat spayed?  People do not realize even females will sometimes mark areas.    She may also be experiencing some sort of mental or physical stress.  Cats are very in tune to their environment and can get stressed easily.  Has anything in your normal routine changed?  A family member move or pass away?  A new addition?  Is she acting differently?   Cats at her age are extremely prone to urinary tract infections, which will cause them to urinate in other areas, and sometimes there will be blood in the urine.  All of these problems can typically be solved by a vet - or maybe help you discover if there is something more serious going on.    I would DEFINITELY consult a veterinarian for sure before considering giving her away - doing that is pretty much sentencing her to death.|`|DIBzlY6Faa	Well there's special stuff called natures promise or something idk, and plus u can buy repellent or spray it with bleach could work also.|`|nOU8WvmDaa	What you have to understand is that cats are just animals. Like animals the respect and follow the alpha leader. So if you want to stop the cat from peeing you must first pee upon the cat./ This will show it that your in charge.|`|mYfkJFTVaa	Maybe is a hard thing        http://www.toboc.com/forum3/DEFAULT.ASPX...
QnCR3cYiaa	Well just keep wathcing for when he poops. If you starts to see disformation of it or wrapper bits, that's good news.  He more than likely will not vomit up the wrapper, but maybe the bread. But give it 2 more hours and if he hasn't vomited, pay more attention to the poop.  If he hasn't gone poop by tomorow affternoon, this may be a bad sign.  Hopefully your vet will call you before then.   That could be a bad sign by the way because it may mean the wrapper got stuck in his digestive system, which could require surgery to get out, but your dog might not need it thankfully.   Oh and also, if he vomits, this is a very good sign. It means that its getting it out of his system. So don't be worried at all if he does.    Hope this helps  and try not to worry too much, my dog once ate a whole batch of blueberry muffins and she ended up throwing up all day and now she is fine. Just give it one more day. If he does poop some out, just keep watching and make sure he poops it out at least 5 times. Then he will be perfectly fine.    Best of luck to you    KKPNC|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I really don't think you would have very many problems with this. If you notice any vomiting/diarrhea/constipation, then you should take him to the vet. A 65lb dog eating a loaf of bread usually isn't something to get worried about.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	If I am getting this right, your dog ate bread with the wrapper while you were with him? Why didnt you pull to the side of the road and take it away from your dog? Bread isnt going to do anything to him, but the wrapper, wait for the vet to tell you.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	My dogs steal bread all the time off the countertops if we are not careful. They never vomit or have diarrhea. They have bitten into wrapper before and have never had any problems. I dont encourage this behavior but my family members forget that these guys are walking garbage disposals with really good noses.     If your dog vomits its no big deal same with diarrhea just make sure that he is well hydrated.|`|tL2soFpUaa	constipation may happen because of the plastic. also throwing up may be a good sign, if he throws up (i know its gross) keep some of it to take to the vet b/c there may be plastic in it. and you may want to keep a sample of his next poop. if you dont get a call from the vet soon i would keep calling back, if you wait too long as his body tries to digest the bread it will try to do the plastic also and that can result is really really bad things.
MTCZoetYaa	I have to say yes and no. My answer is like a answer with a question. My question /answer is: do your rats have a breathing condition if not than there should be no problem. if so get them away form the plug in just in case they might suffocate|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	It shouldnt hurt them. But it might make them not wanna smell the air. You should MAYBE remove it, jsut in case.|`|FTbZ7t5Haa	If it is in the same room as them, and the room isn't well ventilated, you should remove it. The airwick scented things are very strong at first, and even after a few weeks the rats can smell them strongly. If you open your windows or use a fan to circulate the air, you are likely OK. If you notice your rats sneezing, remove the thing. You could consider some other air fresheners that are organic or natural, without the harmful chemicals of Airwick and such.|`|TTs6GBBUaa	yes it will. Any perfume or air-wicks and things like that will harm a rats fragile respiratory system it may not kill then but it's more likely to get a respiratory infection so to be safe I say take it out
nctxHm8Qaa	No, "phantom" isn't a desirable colour, it is a fault that shouldn't be bred.  If your dog doesn't even meet the BASIC conformation necessary to even think about showing him, he should be neutered.  And I'm not even going to touch the tip of the iceburg on the genetic health testing that a QUALITY poodle should have done before breeding.|`|PM23RDycaa	http://www.poodleclubofamerica.org/ National breed club    http://www.poodleclubofamerica.org/affil... - Find your local affiliate club.

Phantom color?  These are not reasons to breed.    Only breed your poodle when:    1.  He is AKC registered and purebred.  2.  He is 2 yrs or older.  3.  He has been tested for genetic problems and cleared.  4.  He has been shown in championship and earned champion titles.  5.  You have permission from the breeder to breed him.    If he is not all of the above, then take him in and neuter him.  And the female should also have the above.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	I am glad that you admitted to know nothing. Your dog has to go through several tests to make sure he is good for breeding, if one of his tests come out bad that is a sign he cant breed. You also need a mentor (some one who you ask these questions, and helps you breed the dog)|`|oGVWdnHraa	First you need to finding a breeding mentor, look in your area for poodle breeders (registered breeders who show their dogs and health and temprement test), they will advise you on the steps you need to take. The major things you need to do are showing (and winning, preferably up to champion status), health testing (im not sure what the major ones are for poodles) and temprement testing.    :)|`|rLDf1gGGaa	So I should breed when...?  The only reason you should be breeding is that you honestly feel that you are improving your breed by doing so. There are far too many dogs in the country to breed without good reason. A dog in a breeding program must be one whose genetic history you or its breeder is intimately familiar with. Such a dog must represent the best efforts of its breeder at that point. Such a dog must have good points to contribute, whether that is in good conformation, good performance or whatever. Such a dog must have some evidence of external evaluation. That is, others besides the breeder or the owner must also think that the dog is a good representive of its breed. That usually translates into titles, whether for conformation, obedience, field, herding, or whatever is appropriate for that breed. Such a dog must be tested as it matures for any problems that tend to appear in its breed, whether that is hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, von Willebrand's, cataracts, PRA, fanconi syndrome, subaortic stenosis, etc.    I want to make some money!  Breeding, and doing it right, is an expensive undertaking. By the time you've picked out a good *****, waited for her to grow old enough (minimum age: two years before breeding), picked out the best dog to mate her with, gone through all the health checks she needs, ensured that the dog you want to use also passes the same health checks, you've invested a lot of time and effort. You still have to pay a stud fee (or give a puppy back), you have potential extra expenses during pregnancy, you have the time and expense of whelping (either you take time off from work or something goes wrong and you have to take her in to the vets). You need to keep the puppies for a minimum of 8 weeks before sending them to their homes; you need to advertise and find good homes for the puppies, you need to make sure they have had their shots before going. You may have possible vet bills if the puppies require extra attention. If some of the puppies die, or you have a smaller than usual litter, you may not get as much money from the sale of the puppies as you had though. There are even potential problems later on with dissatified customers! You are better off consulting with a financial wizard about investing the money you would otherwise spend and lose on breeding!   Breeders frequently count themselves lucky if they break even.     My kids should see the wonders of birth and life!  What if the whelping goes wrong and dead puppies are born? What if the ***** dies? These are all very real risks that you are undertaking. Much better alternatives include videotapes that are available. If there are local 4-H clubs, those provide alternatives for children.   Or, you could contact your local shelter and see if there is a pregnant ***** about to whelp or a litter of puppies that need to be raised and socialized before being adopted out. This would allow you to find out just what this could entail, while helping the shelters rather than potentially contributing to the problem.     I want another dog just like mine!  If you want to breed your dog so as to get another dog like yours, think about this for a moment. No matter how special your dog is to you, a puppy out of it is not guaranteed to be just like or even similar to your dog -- half its genes will be from another dog! You will have to find another dog that also has the characteristics you want in your puppy; that dog will have to be unneutered; and the owner of that dog will have to be willing to breed her/his dog to yours. It is much easier, often less expensive, and certainly less time consuming to pick out an existing dog that you like from the shelter or another breeder. Best yet, go back to the same breeder of your dog, if possible, and pick another puppy out of similar lines.   Every ***** should have a litter!  This is flat out wrong. Bitches are not improved by having puppies. They may undergo temporary temperament changes, but once the puppies are gone, she'll be back to her old self. Nor is it somehow good for her physically. In fact, you will put her at risk of mammary cancer and pyometra. There is absolutely nothing wrong with spaying a ***** without her having a litter.   But my dog is registered!  Well, yes, but that doesn't mean a whole lot. A registered dog, be it AKC, UKC, CKC, etc., simply means that it's parents (and their parents) are also registered with the same registry. This confers no merit in of itself, it simply means that the dog's parentage is known.   Most registries do not make any assertions of quality in the dogs they register (except for some limited breed-only registrations, but these are uncommon). They do not restrict the breeding of their dogs and hence there is no guarantee that a registered dog is a good specimen of its breed.     The AKC has just started a "limited registration" program whereby puppies out of such dogs are ineligible for registration. It remains to be seen what the overall impact on AKC dog breeds will be. Other registries have used similar programs with good results|`|tPGxPDvBaa	First start by answering these 10 questions on this link to see if you & your dog are ready.

Second, start entering your dog in dog shows. He should be a champion, before you ever consider breeding him.  Thirdly, have all genetic health testing done on your dog---Including all clearances.    You should also have a pedigree, his AKC papers, along with a  mentor.    Talk to other breeds at dog shows, they can help.    You should NEVER put to dogs together, make puppies, and sell them. If you do, you would be considered a backyard breeder.    You need to do some research on your own. There is SO MUCH MORE to breding than you think their is. I just mentioned the basics.    Here a a few great websites you should read:  http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/breeding.h...  and  http://www.chowwelfare.com/cciw/breeddog...    Remember: There are thousands of dogs in shelters that need homes. 800 cats and dogs are born every hour. This means, there are NOT enough homes for all the animals. Unless you are a reputable breeder, trying to improve the breed, do NOT breed your dog.    Read the websites I gave you above. Then see if you really want to breed.     I hope this helps.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Go directly to vet have testis removed dont pass go do not produce puppies.      Breeding a quality dog is a big under taking, and should be done by those who have experience in it and the desire and ability to improve their chosen breed by breeding carefully selected sire and dam.  It takes time and effort to research bloodlines, find a male or female that is genetically compatible with what their dog brings to the genetic table.  It takes money to show the dog in either confirmation, or earthdog, or herding or gundog trials to earn the standing of champion and the respect of others within their breed.  A responsible breeder, breeds only for themselves and the improvement of their breed, carefully screens prospective owners, takes back puppies willingly and without hesitation should their family no longer be able to care for the animal.  They have a mentor that they can ask questions and advice of while applying existing knowledge from years of involvement in thier breed.  They have their vet on speed dial for emergencies as well as the  funding to handle any of these emergencies.  I  I have no idea what a phantom colored poodle is never heard of it, But the idea of breeding for color which is a complete crap shoot and because your mother in law really wants one of his puppies are not two of the best reasons for breeding I have ever heard of|`|W0buucLsaa	Chances are, your dog is pet quality and not show quality, and shouldn't be bred. Please don't take offense to that; I've never had a show-quality dog in my life, and neither has almost anybody else. Show-quality puppies are usually KEPT by breeders, and if they aren't, they cost about 3x more than the average for the breeder's puppies. (That's probably a conservative estimate.) You breeder would've told you that this was a show quality puppy, and if you wanted it, it would cost $$$$$$astronomical amount.     It's not terribly common for even national champions to have show-quality puppies; I think it may be an average of 1-2 in a litter.     The MINIMUM steps that you would need to take to breed your dog responsibly--the health checks and genetic tests for the breed--will probably cost more than puppy from a good breeder. So I don't recommend it just for your mother-in-law.     And ideally, of course, your dog would be shown and win championships. And the only way to do this, for your breed, is dog shows - I don't think there are any working competitions for toy poodles, since they are bred to be companions only. So go ahead and imagine how much it costs to travel all over and show your dog - WAY more expensive than simply buying a puppy from a good breeder.    Without winning competitions, you'll only be able to stud your dog to crappy backyard breeders, and there are just too many resultant puppies that end up in animal shelters to do that and feel OK about it.

XsXhcvZdaa	The way to make a horse's coat shiny is from the inside out with proper nutrition. High quality hay in sufficient amounts plus high quality grain fed according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Horses normally lose their winter coat in the spring. It is not spring yet, so she should not be shedding yet. Since the winter coat is more fuzzy, it is never as shiny as the summer coat.     Spray are only a stopgap and do not shine the coat on a permanent basis. The best shine maker is elbow grease. A thorough currying and brushing every day will stimulate the oil glands to make the horse shiny.|`|o3xolERnaa	i use Mane&Tail shampoo. Also the coat will last till it starts getting warmer.Just brush her down and it helps.I have also used baby oil on their coats it helps some too.i also think u could give her a buttermilk bath.|`|AA10986942	If you want her to shed out early you have to use light in her stall to make her think it is spring not winter....  I have my stall lights on a timer..They come on at 6am turn off at 8am (because it is really day light at that time) then they come back on at 4pm and stay on until 10pm or 10:30 pm.   The lights need to be bright... they say they should be bright enough to read a newspaper in the darkest corner of the stall...    I have 3  4' long shop lights in a 12 x 12 stall.    It is the length of the day that makes a horse shed out not the heat or temperature.  But remember when you fool with mother nature you must replace it... if you get her to shed out you mush keep her warm with a blanket.  Corn Oil and Rice bran will eventually make her coat shine but they also have alot of fat calories.   If you cant use a spray try just mixing up some healthy hair in a bucket and put in a dish towel, wring it out good and just rub her down with the towel then brush it in.  If you do not need her to shed out early because of a show just let it happen naturally.|`|AA10882637	Not much experience with horses, as a whole, but do read quite abit.    1. Corn oil and rice bran in her diet? or on her coat? Corn oil in her diet might help make her under coat( what's beneath the long winter coat) Shine, as well as the rice bran( which contains oil also.).... but I would introduce the oil and bran in small amounts so as not to give her colic.  2. With the temperature range you described, I wouldn't imagine her coat starting to shed until the start of spring. also, her age can be a factor, as well as her breed.  3. Diet can influence shedding and hair growth, but not nearly as much as changes of the seasons. If you want your horse to be happy, even with the warmer temperatures, just let her coat shed naturally, while at the same time introducing her to the corn oil and rice bran...( hope you like cleaning her stable stall.... bring a mop.)( oils make for loose manure.... give her extra hay to compensate.)   4. Getting to her age... A horse's coat actually starts to change texture as the horse ages.... hopefully, her spring coat with plenty of curry combing and burlaping ( rubbing with the grain with a burlap sack to smooth the hairs) will help bring out a good shine and also give her a massage at the same time..) hint: don't curry the joints, they don't like that.    hope this helps.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	You can use sprays, just spray them on a rag and then rub her with the rag.  Hopefully she will be okay with that?    Anyway, show-sheen is good for a one-time shine.  Cowboy magic is also very very nice.  Another thing you can do is use human hair products on your horse, they are cheaper usually and they work just as well.  Just use products meant for people with wiry hair.    Corn oil would be good, they also make supplements for shiny coats.  What color is she?|`|IMPvzBk1aa	If she is overweight, the corn oil and rice bran will possibly make that worse, unless you reduce other calorie sources.  I would just give rice bran.  But be sure it is stabilized rice bran, which means it has been mineral balanced so it won't upset the horse's natural calcium/phosphorus ratios.  Another good one is a flaxseed product called Omega Horseshine, by Enreco, which can be ordered over the internet.  I've actually used all 3 at one point in time or another, and all of them work.  I would only feed one of them.|`|Ih0B30Pvaa	Flaxseed for shiney coat, paprika for darkening coat.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	i would do the corn oil. the show horses at my barn do it, and they have beautiful coats.  you can also use show sheen or cowboy magic spray, which makes cleaning easier and adds to the shine of their coat.  and yes, the sprays would help to her coat. it'll prevent dryness from the cold weather and wind.  hope i helped!|`|90946810ea8a239b4220eef09c26ce92aa	if i had to i would use veggie oil   but i would use a tablespoon at most per day because it could cause diarrhea  if you use too much of any oil but if you do use oil the benefit of it is the coat and bowel movements

PGkbPBZmaa	How long have you had her? She might need time to get use to her new surroundings. How big is her cage? They need a big cage or will get very stressed out. When I first got my rats I tried to clean their cage a little with a glove, they freaked out and attacked my glove! It might just scare her to be honest. Keep putting your hand in her cage, let her come up to it. If she ignores it, it's okay - just keep doing it. Once she comes up to your hand a little bit, you can try the baby food trick. Put some baby food on your finger and let her lick it off. She might bite at first, but she'll realize not to and get the hang of it.|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Maybe the reason she's not settling in or being social is because she's on her own. Hopefully after a few days in the cage with your other rat will get her playful and social again. She's probably just a bit unsure after moving to a new home and everything, so probably just needs time with your other rat. Hopefully she should be fine, if not, just keep trying and find a food she really likes, talk to her, get her used to you, and hopefully she'll be OK  ~Good luck!~|`|SqWJCZyeaa	Use a leather glove...

3n60UxgQaa	The problem with bowls (besides their size) is that filters/heaters do not fit.    Now there are bowls that are 2.5+ gallon plus and can fit both just fine.  Those aren't a problem.  However, the majority of bowls are not like that.    Keep in mind that glo-fish, which are genetically modified zebra danios, should be in schools.  That means, at least 6 of them.  Bowls are usually small.  You'd need at least a 5 gallon to hold those.  So unless you have a five gallon bowl that fits a filter, the glofish should not be in bowls. =]|`|bDPVRtCNaa	In this case, the size of the fish is practically a non-issue.     No fish should be kept in a bowl. Glo fish should be kept in groups of at least six, and require filtration and heating.    ~Without filtration the fish would be swimming in a stagnant bowl of their own waste.    ~Without heating they will become stressed and be susceptible to disease.    ~They will suffocate from lack of oxygen in the water.|`|D178335Paa	Ok technically you can but i really wouldn't suggest it.

c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	A true white horse is rare.  What a lot of people call white is really gray.  A white horse is born white.  A gray horse is born any base color, usually they are born a very dark color, but they gray out with age, sometimes very quickly and sometimes very slowly over the years, but some get so light they look white, which is why I guess some people call them white.  Your Lipizzans, Lusitanos, and Andalusions are not white horses, they are gray.  Yes, I know the Lipizzans are advertised as "the dancing white horses" but they are not white.    A white horse has pink skin and white hooves.  A gray horse has black or dark skin and black hooves (unless they have a white leg marking, then that hoof will be white like any other color horse with a white leg marking).  A white horse is easy to tell as you will see a lot of glaring pink skin in any area where there is no hair or the hair is thin, such as around the eyes, muzzle and genitals.  The same goes with a gray horse, you can readily tell the horse has dark skin in these same areas (if they have any pink on their muzzle it will be from a blaze, snip or some such thing).    So that being said, if you want a white horse, you would probably be happy with a gray horse and those are readily available out there, unlike white.    As for breed, probably the best would be something along the lines of a Quarter Horse, Appaloosa or Paint, although if you want a gray I would look at Quarter Horses.  Arabians have a lot of gray horses in their breed but tend to be rather high strung.  Do not go with a Thoroughbred as those tend to be very high strung.  You will find a few Arabians and Thoroughbred that are laid back but not usually.  You are unexperienced so I would look for a nice gelding with some age.  At least over seven or eight years old and even in their early teen years is great.  They've been around, seen more and done more and are a lot more settled.  Geldings usually stay on an even keel whereas some mares do and some do not when they go into heat.  Whatever you do, DO NOT GET A STALLION!!!  With your age and inexperience, that would be an absolute nightmare for you!  Learn on a nice quiet gelding with some age, you'll have some great times with your horse then.|`|0FnVKSO5aa	if you want a beautiful white horse then i would get an Arabian but they're not the best horses to learn on or be your first horse, they are very high spirited.

Quarter horses are really nice, williful and learning, but their mainly for western. Thoroughbred/quarter horse aka. appendix are nice (what i have) most are calm and willing. Morghans are nice, appolousa (sp?). Paints are easy to train and are smart, and most are calm. It all depends on what type of horse you are looking for, and if you are training it and how much you want to spend.|`|if0qKN0uaa	get either a Thoroughbred or an Arabian|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	YOU WANT A MUSTANG STALLION?  umm.  No.  Stay away.  I really want a white beautiful horse.  Well... just because a horse is white and beautiful doesn't mean its a nice, sweet, gentle horse.  Breed of horse doesn't matter!  What does matter is gender (no stallions, seriously) how gentle they are, and age (dont buy a yearling and expect to go galloping in the fields on it)  I was told white mustang stallions are very wild, but that's what I wanted.  Color doesn't matter.  Go buy a black mustang stallion and he'll be just as wild as the white one.  Just because it's a stallion.  I have nothing against mustangs.  Why not geld?  If you do not know what geld is, dont get a horse!  Get a mare or gelding, around 10 years old, or 8, something like that, and then it should be over 15 hands preferably more, maximum 16.2H.  Shh.  Research, get horse lessons, ect...  Breed isn't important, but dont get a Caspian pony if you are 6 foot 2 inches.|`|sxHbsDjfaa	If you are new to horses you really shouldn't be looking for a beauty... the best beginner horses are always the less pretty kind ones.  Most good-looking horses are jerks and aren't nice for beginners at all. Draft crosses are usually my favourite when looking for horses for newer riders.  I know how tempting it is to buy the prettiest horse you see, but you really shouldn't.  If I were you and listening to my advice I would try a belgian or percheron cross.  If you don't like the look of the "heftier" horses you can find nice novice quarter horses,appaloosas and paints.  If you would rather just not listen at all you can find gorgeous grey (not white because there is no such thing as a white horse) warmbloods, arabians, andalusians and thoroughbreds.  I really hope you listen to my advice, but either way have fun on your search for a new equine friend!|`|eTE8woOmaa	I recomend a quarter horse. I have grown up with quarter horses and they have been great to learn from. If you want a white horse, get a gray or a flea bit gray. Gray horses get whiter the more they age.    The one horse breed i would not recommend is an appaloosa. They are very pretty horses, but they do not have the greatest tempermant for beginners.|`|zvn3WWmnaa	I would NOT suggest a stallion of ANY breed, they can be very unpredictable. Gelding are very nice, as for a breed, it depends on what you want to do. Arabians tend to have a lot of energy, but they can be good mixed in with another breed. Quarter horses are nice, generally a steady horse. Paints and appaloosas also.     I wouldn't stick with JUST white, but look for a wide variety of colours, its the horse itself that counts. You dont want to limit yourself just to colour. Ride and get the feel for as many horses as possible, aand try to ride it not just once because some owner tranquilize their horses to be calmer.    I would suggest more research into specific breeds, for specific things, here are some very useful horse breed site.    (PS - Lipizzans are white)    http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horse...    http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-breeds...|`|meoRbjgCaa	Sadly so many mustangs are in auction lots because for a while everybody thought it was so cool to "save a wild mustang"  Then they got a horse that they couldn't touch and thought that magically some type of fantasy connection was going to evolve......and it never did.      Like the saying goes, there is no bad color for a great horse.      I would recommend a quarter horse for your first horse.  When searching for my beginner husband we purchased a 16 year old bombproof quarter horse (but he wanted black so that's what we found) for 1000$ bucks and I am so happy the way that horse takes care of him.    Get a horse you can have fun on, there are white (grey) ones out there too, just make sure they that your first requirements involve the terms  "dead broke" or "bombproof", that they have been on trail rides and are in their teens.  This improves the probability that they have years of riding under their belt, and lots of experiences that will make them safe and fun for you!|`|oZnFre3Aaa	Get a quarter horse or an appendix qh to learn on|`|6wNwwY5oaa	TB|`|HCuArmpGaa	Umm, Quarter horses are nice.

Have you ever seen the Lusitano stallions? Amazing.   But since those are high quality and hugely expensive, I'd say Arabian or TB. It's hard to find pure white sometimes, just keep looking.   Most warmbloods (big) are gentle and calm if you get a decently trained one.   Geldings are much more calm than stallions-if you're looking for calm, don't get a stallion or a horse gelded while older (he'll already have ingrained stallion habits)|`|o3xolERnaa	it don't matter the breed.All you need is a well broken horse.i think you might need to look at getting a good Saddlebred .You definitely don't need a stallion.

4yt4D3vMaa	cherry tomatoes aren't ideal as they are high in sugar which is bad for the teeth and can upset the delicate balance of gut bacteria. there are differing opinions on what age to start feeding a rabbit greens-going on personal experience I wouldn't start before 4 months of age and I start with grass rather than vegetables.Always try new foods in very small amounts (one leaf to start and if they are ok the next day gradually build up to more) to avoid upsetting the rabbits digestion. fruit should only be given as a treat rather than part of the main diet http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html  what to watch out for with any change in diet http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.html|`|oGVWdnHraa	If he/she is over 6 months old, then yes, but you should not feed vegetables to a bunny younger than 6 months :)
mY19PPlIaa	I would keep an eye on your puppy and everytime you notice he is going to do his business redirect him to the pads.|`|r62mRF3waa	The places where he pees and poops buy a special spray that your puppy won't like, then spray it on those spots. If that doesn't work try the training pads again. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TIteIgenaa	Well, if you're not changing the pads, there's your problem.  My 3-year old pomeranian uses pads too, so you could see that I experienced the same problem.  Doing their business is a dog's way of marking territory.  If they smell that they have already marked there, then they feel that there is no need to do so again.  Another solution is to scold him whenever he does his business inside, and if he is sniffing in circles, or going into an area where you can't see him, put him on a leash and take him outside.|`|hiD30bDraa	I had the same problem.  Dont buy wee wee pad liquid it doesnt work just tie your pup up in your house to he gets familiar with his little area if you give him freedom you telling him to poop every where he might cry at first but he will get use to it.but paper in his area and when he poops and pee in the worng places dont hit or put his nose in it he will just think he cant poop at all

However our Animal Control has a low cost spay/neuter program and male cats only cost $40 to get it done. It's $45 at the Humane Society.    You have a low cost spay/neuter north of Chicago down there, I don't know the name of the vet but once a week they do surgery on any male/female for low income homes and it only costs $10 for a spay or neuter.  I think it's on a Monday.  Phone around to the various vets and ask if any know who is doing it.  A friend of mine runs a carload of cats down to there once a month, waits all day, and brings them back once done.  You do have to make an appointment, they can only do so many cats in one day.      Also do some google searches for feline rescue in your area, emailing them can get you hooked up to the low cost vets as well.  They all know the local pricing.|`|ocK1s59baa	call yur local aspca spay/neuter shelter. they usually have an application to fill out and its about 50 bucks to get a cat neutered.
db9ce3362907a136acac0610fae4357eaa	I have hauled horses on many long hauls and here is what I would do:  Make sure you wrap her legs with standing wraps and quilts (I use the no-bow wraps as they don't bunch and I don't have to worry about them being too tight or not being wrapped flat), make sure you secure her head and I would not leave the gates open (I am assuming a slant load?) the gates will give her something to lean on and support herself if she gets tired.  I do not take my horses out of the trailer until I am at my destination.  Too much can happen on the side of the road or at rest stops, and she will be fine in the trailer (ie, her getting spooked and getting away from you).  Offer her water a couple times during the ride.  I also give mine 2 gms of bute paste the night before the haul, this will help with the stress on the legs and keeping her from foundering.  When you get to your destination, let her out or walk her around for a little bit to and give her water.  Make sure she drinks before you feed her so she will not colic.  12 hours is really not that long of a haul, I have hauled 24 hours straight without any problems.  Good luck.|`|hQIqEnTEaa	Make sure you offer her water frequently as horses become dehydrated on long trips.    Also tie her reasonably loosely so that she can get her head down to the ground to avoid "shipping sickness" - a respiratory illness in horses subjected to long haul trips that is thought to be related to horses being unable to remove irritants and pathogens out of their respiratory tracts. By allowing her to get her head down gravity will assist in draining her respiratory tract while she is being shipped.    As for how often you should let her off it depends on how hard she is to put on and off - if she is a bad traveller let her out less than if you're sure she'll walk straight back on after a break. If she's good to put on the trailer probably let her out every four hours for a walk around.     Give her a hay net so she has something to do while on the road. And don't forget to put travelling boots on her so she doesn't injure herself in the float.    I wouldn't leave the gates open since she may need them to lean against for balance when cornering. You don't want her to fall down in the trailer.    Good luck.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	you should keep her in her own space. if she moves around, she has a very big chance of falling or getting hurt and getting tangled up.   you should probably let her out at least every 2 hours, so that you and her can stop for a break. also, get her a fuzzy sheepskin shipping halter  they prevent the hair from rubbing off when they wear halter for long periods of time.   also, keep a hay net in the trailer with her so that she can eat.   good luck!|`|sUN7TVtzaa	take her out every two-three hours and when you stop for gas give her a bucket of water and walk and trot her on the lead line around the gas station. avoid exciting her too much by letting little kids pet her if she gets too excited them tell kids to please back off her. give her some fresh hay or grain when you stop. make sure she is comfortable and is happy don't let her have any bad experiences.she is young and any bad things could stick in her mind and make her fearful of trailers. give her a blanket if she might need it. make sure you put her boots on her when you put her back in the trailer and take them off when you take her out but make sure to put them back on again.    good luck!|`|SrkoKZWuaa	Keep the doors closed. I know it would seem more comfortable if she could move around but it is more safe with them closed.  Make  sure to stop every 3-4 hours and let her drink, as much as she wants.|`|rTSwouqXaa	Once.When you get to your destination. 12 hours is not bad. We haul to shows and sometimes for a much longer distance. 12 hours is a long time and the horse will be a little stiff, like you, but baring no accidents your horse should be fine.|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	We regularly travel 3 8-12 hour days in a row to get to and from Florida, so we've done it a few times with several different trailers.      Do tie her, but such that she can decide to ride either face forward or backward.  I have horses that will not ride one or the other way.    Do not unload unless she is really calm and you have a suitable place, like a grassy area free of obstacles and somewhat enclosed. We only ever unloaded at the end of the day; the horses seem to rest better when their box stops and they get to just rest. When you take them out, they look around and get stressed if they see different surroundings.  She'll get better rest from staying in her familiar box, and trust me, riding in a trailer is like walking all the way, so she won't need to stretch her legs, she needs to stand still.    Take your time at every gas stop, offer water each time.  Hang hay if you want, but no grain all day, or for at least 1 after she gets to the new place.  If she won't drink, soak the hay so she gets some moisture.    Generally after 3 or 4 gas stops, you'll have to stop for an hour or so because she will be shaking from the effort of keeping her balance.  You may need to set up the gates so she has something to lean against to help her keep her balance; my horses always butt up against a corner of their straight load stalls.    With a newbie long distance traveler, we try to have the vet out just before we start off to oil them, as if they are a colic sufferer.  Ask you vet about their recommendation on that, as they may have a different idea about how to keep your girl the most comfortable on a very long day that she won't eat or drink like usual.    Good luck on your trek!|`|oM0TUQXUaa	well i own a  horses and i traviled a long distance with him and i stopped at a rest area and let them out every 3 4 hours because horses will sleep on there feet and they can go a long time like that i would just stop every 2 3 hours to give them a treat or more hay and make sher they are ok and if it was winter i would not leave the bars open but if it was summer and it Farly warm i would leave them open.  i hope i could help  jess|`|r5aokD7Yaa	12 hrs isn't a really long trip.    I'd stop and water her thorugh a trailer window every 3-4 hrs. She probably won't drink a first, but likely will by the 8 hr mark.    If she's ok with dividers, I'd use them. My guys like to lean into the dividers as we travel (install a camera in your trailer, it'll give you a giggle).|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	I let mine out to walk and drink about every four hours.  I hang hay so they can munch along the way...it gives them something to do...  I tie them high but give them as much slack as I can without them getting tangled up...  I have the trailer set up so they ride facing back...they don't seem to mind, in fact when they load, they go in the trailer and turn around and wait to be tied...I like this because if there is a wreck or even just a panic stop and they fall, they will most likely fall sitting on their haunches instead of falling forward on their knees....less likely to get hurt...  I have trailered them 16 hours without stopping, but that is as tiring on them as it is on me and I suspect they don't like it any more than I do!|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	im not good on that, but if i were the horse i would want a few breaks and id leave the gates shut, just in case.  congrats!! (:    *** oh and lots of hay  shipping wraps  breakaway halters|`|sxHbsDjfaa	Make sure not to give her any grain before or after the trailer ride- it could upset her stomache.  I would give her plenty of hay to keep her occupied.  Stop every couple of hours and open up the front door of your trailer... also take her for a walk every now and then if she is easy to load.  Also try not to give her too much water... whenever you stop just let her take a few sips- not a full bucket or anything.  I myself would leave the gates open for her comfort.  Hope that helps!
tAZe8XJsaa	I don't know about horses, but for rabbits basically veg and pellets is what I feed mine.    Just no meat or iceberg lettuce for the rabbit treats. Iceberg lettuce is bad on the digestive system, and I doubt I even have to explain why meat is bad.|`|kHeJFqdkaa	i don;t know a list or anything but i know chocolate should NEVER be fed to them!  nor garlic although it's not as bad as chocolate.      -sarah =)|`|t6UkxbBNaa	no corn for bunz it is extremely terrible! they cannot digest it properly.
HT3LtMtaaa	What???????????????
dwHnazEJaa	Its recommended for them. I used to have 3 hamsters and they love them. The we syrians.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	They can, but it's unlikely that they'll use it.|`|ktVkRc3Raa	You can give your hamster salt licks but your hamster will only chew on it to make his/her teeth shorter. This is called teething. It is normal for all hamsters when the start to get long teeth. So yes you mat give your hamster salt licks.
H06PtiIAaa	like frank said the metal halide lighting is enough for LPS SPS and your anemone, the blue actinic will help the blue spectrum and be good for the anemone but you dont need it as the metal halide is good enough.    Really it is hard to do anything to get them to host as most tank bred clownfish wont usually host, but if they do they do, thats really all you can do.|`|8owlj2xHaa	That is more than enough light for that size tank. You can grow anything under them. Adding Blue Actinic is usually a color preference and not needed. If the look is to white for you, you can change the bulb to a higher kelvin IE to a 14 or 20 k  bulb.    If you want you can try feeding just the anemone a piece of shrimp. Feed only the anemone, and usually the clown will try to get the food and decide to stay a while.  There are other ways, but I do not like to force the fish to do it.
BMConIedaa	Many places will spay and neuter rescued cats for free.|`|BY02DhfWaa	i live in pa and at my locale vet it costs any where from 130.00- 300.00|`|AA10985602	in Greenville, NC it cost 75 dollars for me to neuter or spay.  but the animal shelters will sometimes provide discount or free spay or neuter.
ICtaFQxYaa	Cross Breeding:    Owners cross breed for 3 reasons:  Human curiosity/ignorance; Greed (to create a new marketable oddity/commodity); Long term planned x'ings to create a new breed, maximizing qualities to fill a niche or need that did not exist (this takes decades to effect, and is the only true reason to x breed).    Here's a few reasons to pass along to your friend:    Canario and Argentina have different form, function, and temperment.    A breeding of this sort will not breed true...no measure of continuity throughout the litter and breedings.    Mixed breeds are statistically less apt to end up in quality homes...and more likely to have a ruff life (abuse, neglect, rescue/rehome)    A mix of this sort in a rescue environment ALWAYS gets labled "pit bull mix".  Will you be around to contest this lable when their up for euthenasia?    You're taking two wonderful and different breeds that have evolved over time into what they are.....and blowing thier genetics with one breeding.    Ask yourself this...What improvements will this breeding accomplish for the overall betterment?  Am I placing personal motivations before that of the welfare of the dogs?  Do I have puppies spoken for already?  Am I equipped to home and care for these pups if they do not sell? (good posibility in this economic environment).    ***even champion labled dogs are not being bred right now.  Sire and dame dogos and presas..whose litters were pre-sold at $1k-3k per pup, are not breeding right now....as the pups are not moving and owners are stuck with lots of big mouths to feed.  This is a problem im seeing across the world with large working breeds right now.    hope this helps.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Mutts don't have any predictable characteristics. Your 'breeder' should not be breeding mutts. End of story.|`|0lcSi5tnaa	The reason not to breed these two dogs is because both of these dogs have fighting past, do you really want to put one the best man stopping molossers with one of the best hog stopping molossers and think they are going to be sweet? They will constantly be looking for a challenge, and where will you place these puppies? SOmewhere with some people who may fight them, use them illegally, or something of that nature? If your friend has farm or a lot of farm buddies that will like to take the pups off her hands and work them then so be it, but if she is try to Create some new type of ban-dog, just tell her to stop! Has any of the dogs the Presa's or the Dogo's been health tested, temperament tested, earned any titles? Do they me the standard as close a possible> What makes these dogs worth breeding besides one has a dick and the other has a vagina>
14EzfaDWaa	Shes probably feeling sick i have 3 dogs all of them are spayed and they threw up and wouldnt eat or drink either. Sometimes when dogs dont feel well, just like people wont eat or drink but if she doesnt start drinking soon i would take her to the vet because she may get dehydrated and die. I really hope your puppy gets better soon though.|`|cETQuE9waa	I would contact the vet and see what they say.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Drinking is more important to survival than eating, I would encourage by adding a little low sodium beef or chicken broth to the water to entice, also try ice cubes or a little childrens pedialyte.  they do intibate to help with breathing during surgery her through might be a little sore.  If it goes longer than 24 hrs I would contact vet|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	Contact the ver asap
eoF2zvKhaa	Brad Pattison uses pain to train, which often causes anxiety in dogs. He's awful. Cesar Millan is much better, by far. Though, I prefer Victoria Stillwell over him, to be honest. :)|`|dwHnazEJaa	Cesar Millan. Hes xceptionel with dogs. Best answer please.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Brad says it as it is.  I respect him for being so blunt and upfront with people, even though it's usually not what people want to hear, it's still right.  A quick snap of the leash is not going to hurt the dog, better then what Cesar does.      You think Cesar is a good trainer? Watch this, poor dog is being strangled.  He says it's because the dog is being "dominant" when actually the dog is suffocating.  If he really wanted to attack Cesar he would bite whatever he could reach, he's actually just going after the hand with the leash.    http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/se...      I can't stand Cesar. Ever time the dog tries to sit, he yanks up on the leash.  It was clearly stressed, the eyes bulging, ears back- that's defensive aggression, not offensive. When he had it on the floor, it still looked stressed, just 'shut down'. It saddens me that someone who millions of people look up to can't understand simple canine body language.    Edit:  Brad does not use pinch collars, ever, even in his show he tells owners not use them.  Just zoom into the video and you will see it is a regular collar and he does not actually hit the dog.  The dog flinches because it was focused on the bikers then saw Brad's hand come down.  The dog was not "walking nicely", if the leash was actually being held it would be pulling on the leash, not acceptable, the dog is not the one in charge.    One more thing.....Cesar "rehabilitates" dogs in a day? *rolls eyes*....suuuure he does.  Meanwhile Brad works with the family for weeks if not months.|`|bN0Imp99aa	Yeah Brad Pattison does look extremely rough in that video and the dog is scared of him. I also find some of Cesar's methods old and should really only be done with aggression cases. He isn't a trainer but he does help dogs that have serious issues. But Cesar is good and has saved many dogs from shelters so I think his intentions are good and he does give useful tips like exercise, discipline and then affection. Brad Pattison on the other hand is very rough and and even hits the dog. He shouldn't really be working with dogs.|`|qioH81tiaa	Personally, I don't let people treat me like ****, so I wouldn't let Pattison within 30 feet of me or my dog.      It has nothing to do with his training methods - it has to do with how poorly he interacts with humans.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	I've never heard of the Brad Pattison dog trainer. I think Cesar Millan is a fool though. I like Victoria Stilwell best. Now that's a woman who knows how to train dogs!|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	From that short clip he looks like an egomaniical idiot.  I wouldn't want him to train my dog - he looks to be promoting fear rather than confidence.    Edit:  I just went back and had another look at the video and my opinion hasn't changed.  I am more disgusted than ever.  That poor dog was so confused about what was expected of him.  He was afraid of the handler.  Who would want to train a dog to be fearful of you.  The best trained dogs are the ones who do it just because you ask them to.  These dogs and handlers make the best teams to watch.  You can always tell a dog that has been trained through fear - they are jumpy and tend to look confused.  They want to do the right thing but aren't sure if they are.  Too, too sad.|`|gzxvPse7aa	I totally agree. This idiot may have taught the dog to do what he wants, but that doesn't mean how he taught the dog to do it was right. That first yank is proof. I have a Miniature Australian Shepherd who could never walk beside you without pulling away or getting distracted, so I took the dog to a few training sessions and they suggested a pinch collar just like the one Brad Pattison uses in the in the video. I found that a quick firm tug on the leash is very effective rather than jerking the whole dog backwards like this Brad joke did.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I think that Cesar possesses an unbelievable skill that is very rare. I have never heard of Brad, but his poor dog just looked scared and confused. Cesar's dog's always look confident and secure. I think Cesar is way better!|`|h6t4aRUOaa	My personal opinion: The guy is a moron. You do not yank that choke chain, serious damage to neck muscles, windpipe, etc. That dog's body language signals fear. I have handled my 3 APBTs to their championships and have never yanked on them like that. I wouldn't let that Pattison guy within 10 yards of my dogs.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I have never heard of the Pattison guy but was not the least bit impressed. He is more like a really bad Schutzhund trainer.   I am not a fan of Cesar but he is better than that one.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	Victoria Stillwill use a positive methods to train the dogs.    Cesar is for "red zone" dogs/ Extreme  cases / His methods to train dogs  can be harsh according to  the dog trainer I go to.    Paul Owens is REALLY similar to Victoria's methods as well. It is very positive method to train.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	I like Victoria Stillwell's (It's Me or the Dog) methods.  Much kinder and more common sense involved.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flCk4zuEF...    As for what he does with the check chain to a very confused dog - that is just not on!!  A check chain is designed so that the noise alerts the dog NOT to jerk them off their feet.|`|4vhMqU40aa	Brad Pattison does NOT deserve a dog...the dog was not doing anything and he hits it on the nose...the dog was walking nicely and he chokes it...i hope HE reads this... and finally LEARNS something himself... i cant believe people ACTUALLY listen to his "advice"...Brad deserves a Tiger... if he would treat a tiger that way... it would react to his torture and give him what he deserves... that poor dog should be sent to the SPCA... it would be HAPPIER there... Brad doesn't deserve to have his NAME spelt with a CAPITAL... so now i will spell his name like this... brad... :P ---> HAH... Cesar Millan ACCTUALLY treats the dog with respect... so... CESAR wins... by a long shot...YAY|`|ktC40jtXaa	Brad is awsome, i watch his show every weekend!|`|nmercOm7aa	I like Brad Pattison.  He cares more about the dog than the owner. Most of the people on the show aren't doing what needs to be done, so he gets them to do it. If you watch the episodes where the people do what is asked, Brad is nice. Some people need a reality check.   He challenges both dog and owner and takes them out of their comfort zones.   He treats the dog like and dog and uses training that a dog understands. It is about the relationship between dog and owner. He does not bribe the dogs using treats or toys. The dog does what is asked because it respects the owner as the leader.   The dogs learn how to interact with other dogs, people and how to live with them.   He also works with families to get to the root of the problems with the dogs. He fixes both the dogs and the owners.     Brad is a strong willed person. He knows how to get what is needed out of people. I would love to work with him, but cannot afford it.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	I have never heard or seen the work of Brad Pattison. I have seen Cesar work on dogs, and it amaizes me that he has changed many dogs that looked like they were not going to change.
uC2OAc4Kaa	I would say Gerbils!  I right now own a mouse and don't get one. She stinks and doesn't want to play as much. I had a hamster and he was nocturnel, noisy at night and stunk even more they bit a lot and all i did with him was watch him!  If you want afun interative rodent get a gerbil. My friend has one and they are trainned, they also are cute, and they love to be with people and they are almost oderless becuase they live in the desert and don't drink much water so no pee! So I would say a gerbil, because I am getting a gerbil soon have fun! and also if you get a gerbil get something he can chew on because they trim down their teeth!|`|lLQunBRaaa	Hamster, teddy or bear hamster!  pros they are cuter and dumber  cons they die faster     not a gerbil    mice!  pros they live longer! they are smarter   you can train them   cons they are escape artists.|`|793FXKCTaa	Hi I have guinea pigs and I think there cool but if you want a smaller pet you should get a gerbil go to more than 1 petshop because you can pick out the best one BTW no iceberg lettuce or citrus fruits i still love guinea pigs!

Gerbils are very easy to take care of and they don't really bite unlike hamsters they always bite.

1hS1pQz5aa	Reasons to bath your guinea pig:  Guinea pigs are very clean animals and unless you don't regularly clean out their cage, then most of the time they keep that lovely familiar guinea pig aroma. However, bathing your guinea pig will help towards keeping their hair and skin healthy. Remember that bathing a guinea pig too often can dry out their skin and lead to their skin becoming irritated.    Preparation:  Have everything you will need in easy reach before bath time commences. Here is a list of items that you will need:    3 to 4 towels  Washing up bowl  Flannel  Small plastic jug  Small animal shampoo  Soft hairbrush  Plastic box container (optional)  A responsible helper (also optional)    If the weather is cold, make sure the room temperature is quite warm so your guinea pig doesn't catch a chill.    Fill the plastic bowl with warm water, roughly two inches deep, check the temperature with your elbow to make sure its not too hot or too cold. Remember to have everything within easy reach, never leave a guinea pig unattended in the bath water. When applying water, I use a small plastic container that has a spout on the end.     If at all possible, ask a responsible person in the house to help you. They could keep their protective hands near your guinea pig while you are busy.  Never leave a guinea pig unattended on any high surfaces.    Shampoo:  I have used Johnson's Small Animal shampoo for years with no problems. For the next bath time, I'm going to try Gorgeous Guineas essential oils shampoo, I've heard so many good things about it. It also helps to prevent fungal and parasitic infestations, so it sounds ideal. If you are treating your guinea pig for lice or any other condition, you need to use normal shampoo first. This makes the hair and skin nice and clean, free of grease and dirt and will help the 'treatment shampoo' penetrate to the skin more easily.    Safety:   Remember guinea pigs can react very quickly, so please be ready. If your worried about them making a bid for freedom or you haven't given your piggy a bath before, so you won't know what to expect, place the bowl on the floor or in an empty bath tub. If they do happen to escape from your hands they won't have far to fall.    Bathing a guinea pig:  Before you place your guinea pig in the bath water, have a towel spread out for when you shampoo your guinea pig, all towels should be left in easy reach. After preparing everything, place your guinea pig in the bowl and wet the hair, avoiding eyes, mouth and nose. Never pour water down a guinea pigs ears. Take your guinea pig out of the water and place them on a towel. Add a little shampoo on their back and massage in well. When or if you are using a parasitic shampoo, always read the instructions first. Remember to shampoo under the belly and around the bottom area. Leave the shampoo on for roughly 3 minutes. Wrap piggy up in a dry towel so they can't lick the shampoo and this will also help to keep them warm.    Now is the time to ask your helper to either hold your guinea pig or have their protective hands near, so piggy doesn't fall, while you empty the water out that your piggy has previously used. As mentioned above, you can place your piggy wrapped up in a towel and place piggy in the plastic container on the floor, which will leave your hands free for a minute. Rinse your guinea pigs hair, making sure you have all the shampoo out.    Drying Routine:  When all the shampoo has been rinsed away, place your guinea pig on another dry towel. You might find that you will need two towels to dry piggy. The first towel will become wet very quickly because of the excess water. Gently towel dry your guinea pig. You can use a hairdryer, but on the lowest setting. Check it against your arm first to give you an idea about the distance and the temperature. If its too hot for your skin, its too hot for your guinea pigs. Please be very careful when using a hairdryer.    Grooming:  Once dry, brush your guinea pigs hair. Remember long haired guinea pigs will need their hair brushed everyday. Knots can quickly form and become matted. If left, it can be very painful for a guinea pig as mats can tug on the skin. You may need to trim around their bottom area as long haired guinea pigs can become messy. Be extremely careful when using scissors and make sure you avoid a boars delicate testicles. If you do find a small knot, its best to cut it out rather than try to brush/comb it out. Guinea pigs skin is very delicate so it would cause your guinea pig pain if you started tugging at it. But again, please be careful not to cut piggies skin.   Good luck with your Guinea pig!!!!!|`|3sB49YNnaa	Guinea Pigs are not awfully fond of baths so you should only bathe yours when he absolutely needs it.     It helps to use the least traumatic bathing and drying method. Put about an inch of warm (not hot) water in the kitchen sink. Put the pig in and wet the coat by gently "splashing" some water up on to it, avoiding the face. Soap it up with kitten shampoo, open the sink drain stopper and then rinse. I like to use the sprayer attachment since you can hold it close to the body and apply a gentle stream. This is less traumatic than sticking the GP under the faucet. If your sink doesn't have a sprayer, you can get a "hand shower" head that fits on the faucet at most discount or hardware stores. Wrap the pig in a towel and thoroughly blot it dry. You can complete the drying with a hand held hair drier. Always keep your hand between the drier and the pig so that you can make sure that it isn't too hot. If your hand is not comfortable, the pig won't be either. It will only take a couple of minutes to finish drying a short hair but a good quality dense coated Peruvian or other long hair in full show coat can take a half an hour of careful drying.|`|AA12317024	I give my baths in the bath tub just fill it not too full and have a cup and running warm water to rinse them with. here is a couple sites that helped me. =] good luck!!    http://jackiesguineapiggies.com/bathingy...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ7u_zp7B...    you can also give them thing to chew on that you can find at a pet store to substitute for the bars of the cage. but usually when they chew on the bars it means they want you to take them out =]

LAXxaxAZaa	The ones with stirrups are awful, really. I'm not saying this because I don't think you should be using stirrups if you're riding 'bareback'. I'm saying it because they're cheaply made, and it makes it easier for the pad to slide off if you lose your balance.    I have this one in purple:  http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.as...    I love it... it's very comfortable, and it doesn't slip. The only bad thing about it is the fleece girth. It's comfy for the horse, but it's really hard to keep clean and burrs stick to it really easily. There are other types of girths that are comfortable and easier to keep clean.    DON'T get a fleece pad! It's probably the most comfortable thing in the world, but if your horse spooks and sidesteps, the pad is going to slip right off... along with you.    The one with the breast collar looks really good, but I haven't used one. It's a good idea, though.    So I would either get the one that I have (the first one) or the one with the breastcollar.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I ride bareback all the time, but I use a pad in the hot summer because I've ruined so many pants from the sweat... it just doesn't come out!  It's still bareback because you can communicate freely with your horse.    Don't get one with stirrups, it's not safe to have stirrups without a saddle tree because they have no support.    I own the triple E fleece bareback pad, it's nice but it's a bit hot to ride in because it's fleece.  The Reinsman Microsuede TackyToo Bareback Pad  looks like the best one from the ones you've picked out.    Another cheap option is to just plop your saddle pad on your horse and ride with just that.  It doesn't have the strap and it might slip but it's cheap and easy.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	The problem with bareback pads and stirrups is there aren't any bars to 'hook' the withers and prevent the pad from slipping sideways if you're in a bind and put your weight in one stirrup or the other...you're almost guaranteed to fall...if you feel you need something between you and the horse (like to soak up the sweat, etc...) just get a decent wool blanket. Mexican wool rugs (30" X 60") are inexpensive, colorful and durable. Wool bed blankets also work well (twin size). Fold it in half length wise then the other way in thirds.|`|SrkoKZWuaa	I think any of them will work, but do not get the one with stirrups.|`|DDhsF8zYaa	Don't get the 3rd one, with the stirrups.  The 100% defeats the purpose.    I personally have one much like  4. If it is the one like I have, I like it because you can tighten the girth on both sides.. A lot of saddle pads I've dealt with only go from one side.    You might want to check ebay- they have some cute bareback/breastplate and some with bridle sets! Lots of colors & designs too!    Yay for bareback riding! :D\        Oh, for the person who said riding bareback with a pad isn't really riding bareback.  It totally is.   All a freakin' bareback pad does is keep your butt from getting sweaty!!!!|`|FLBCvJuDaa	Coolback|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Honesty...ride bareback. Riding with a "bareback" pad isn't exactly bareback.

3giaPYe8aa	They don't gain weight because they are "fixed".  They gain weight from eating too much and lack of exercise.  Being spayed has nothing to do with weight gain.|`|nmercOm7aa	Over feeding an lack of exercise cause weight gain.   With small breeds, they are more mature when they are fixed. This means that they may not need the extra calories of puppy food.   Spaying or Neutering does not make a dog fat.|`|qioH81tiaa	Nope.    Dogs gain weight when they are over-fed and under exercised.  Just like humans.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	No, not always. However some dogs are prone to it. To make sure it doesn't  happen, you have to make sure the dog doesn't over eat and gets proper exercise. Very simple. He shouldn't have gotten overweight with the proper care, which he obviously didn't have.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No. not if you watch their diet & they have plenty of exercise.  My 9yr spayed female is just as slim as she ever was.|`|oGVWdnHraa	that poor dachshund........ :(    The answers above are right :)|`|XK9RLaPeaa	Definitely not. A dog only gets heavier by being overfed, not exercised enough, health problem, poor quality food, or aging. Some dogs do get less hyper when they get spayed/neutered, so this could be why some dogs seem to gain weight after, but this is a small percent. Good luck! Thanks for spaying!!!|`|0fuF2sHbaa	No, I can't really see why they would unless before they got fixed all they did was run around looking for a mate :)    Obviously, if a 6 or 7 month old puppy gets spayed they will gain weight as they grow, but of course that's to be expected.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	NO. That is an old wives tale. Spayed & neutered animals do NOT get fat because they are fixed. If they get heavy it's because they are fed too much & exercised too little.  PS: Your chihuahua is adorable!|`|nF3AbLBWaa	I'm not a complete expert in this, but my chihuahua is a year and a have, and he is just as skinny as yours.   I don't get how chihuahuas get fat though, mine eats all the time, and is super skinny. While others look like balloons.  I guess I'm just asking a question trying to answer yours.  But my dog is just as skinny as your dog, and mine is not fixed.  So it might just be the bread.|`|54GBWTgoaa	they can....CAN >>> well that's what my local vets told me, they said if i put my boy on a high quality dry food diet and give him the correct exercise for breed and type then there should be no real problem, maybe lessen her fat content...are you sure she doesn't get spoiled? saying that my grandmother has had dogs >> dachshunds actually her whole life and every single one of them where fixed and not fat, so im putting it down to lifestyle and not the spaying.  hope this helps :)|`|SaCqoG0Faa	Actually some dogs CAN gain weight from being sterilized, but not by what some people assume. Getting your pet sterilized changes their metabolism, and some owners do not adjust the pets needs accordingly. It IS human error that causes weight gain, it is our responsibility to provide sufficient amount of exercise and proper diet.     Quoted from here: http://www.pets911.com/spayneuter/faq/    "Will spaying or neutering make my pet fat?  Removing the ovaries or testicles does affect metabolism. For this reason, spayed or neutered pets will tend to put on weight more easily if permitted to overeat. The important phrase here is if permitted to overeat. Monitoring the quantity of food given and providing regular play and exercise will help keep your pet in shape."|`|Yn5ADAd1aa	Having ur dog fixed does not cause any health problems for your dog. It is in fact a very resnsble thing 2 do. Dogs can gain weight sometimes from lack of excrsce. they may become a little lazy. I also hav a lil guy and he is very tiny. They are just small breeds. I wouldn't worry much. In the winter just keep cute little swters on its tiny body so it doesn't become ill.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Spaying doesn't cause weight gain, too many calories & not enough exercise do. Also weight gain in dogs can be genetic just as it can in people.|`|JsBb732Maa	If they are fed and given the correct amount of exercise they shouldn't gain a lot of weight.Fed right, not a lot of treats etc.|`|cETQuE9waa	My dog didn't gain any weight at all when fixed.|`|Ra3mLmzLaa	Mine did not gain weight after being altered.  They gain weight from poor diet choices and lack of exercise (same as us).  Your dog is really cute btw!|`|npWGkuwnaa	My spayed female is 8 and isn't fat. We watch what she eats and exercise her. We did let her come on heat once,but I don't think that makes a difference. Your wee girl is cute:)
kWwgWSSgaa	First rule out any underlying medical condition which may be responsible for your dog's behaviour.     Based on the available facts it would appear that you have a genetically unstable human aggressive dog. What you need is a professional assessment of your dog by an experienced dog trainer. A good trainer would be able to clearly outline your options & if appropriate work with you & the dog to manage the aggression.    To err on the side of caution I would advise purchasing a muzzle which fits securely, to be worn on walks or at the vet.    http://www.fordogtrainers.com/index.asp?...  {Purchased a collar & lead, quick delivery}    Good luck with your dog.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I'm an advocate of e-collars, but I really don't think it's the answer here at all.  In fact, I think it's a HUGE risk.  I'd get an opinion from a second trainer.    Based on what you are explaining, I think an e-collar is a sure fire way for somebody to get seriously hurt if you use static shock...the tone and vibration aren't going to do squat for your dog - she won't even notice them when she's doing the things you don't want her to do.|`|746YLjISaa	You can get one from your vet and mabey a loacal pet store.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Find a different trainer. Aggression towards strangers is almost never a situation to use an E collar in. It doesn't matter what gender vet sees your dog that isnt going to cause a problem with men; but lack of socialization does. You will probably make the situation worse if you use an added stimuli on a fear aggressive dog.|`|AA10029366	I guess I don't see how an e-collar is going to fix this. If she is biting out of fear, punishing her for being fearful isn't going to help...in fact, it will probably make things worse, since she will associate the stim with the people she already fears.    I agree with Ulva that this is a sign of mental instability. It is also unacceptable for the breed. Have you spoken to her breeder about her issues? Find someone authorized and experienced with training and behavior to evaluate your dog. Don't rely on a family friend who clearly doesn't understand the root of the problem.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	For the right situations, electric collars are wonderful, but this is a situation where it will just make her more fearful and make the situation worse. Forget the collar.   Honestly, I have to say that the dog sounds completely like a basket case. A normal dog doesn't become aggressive with people simply because someone startled it. I have a dog that used to get beat regularly by her old owner yet she is still friendly and happy.....simple injections would not cause a stable dog to turn aggressive, if that were the case then every vaccinated dog on the planet would be dangerous!   I'd get a behaviorist, not a trainer but a behaviorist and go from there. I hate to say it, but this behavior may or may not be fixable.|`|XK9RLaPeaa	An e-collar isn't what they are talking about. They are referring to a shock collar. Please dont use a shock collar though. Just because they are trainers doesn't mean they have the dogs best interest at heart. And some people really dont see anything wrong with the collars. They are inhumane and dont teach the dog anything. Also, collars that release a high pitched tone really hurt their ears. They have extremely good hearing, especially high pitched sounds, so something like that would hurt them. I dont care what anyone else says about them being fine. An e-collar is something you use to keep your dog from biting stitches after a surgery. Please just get him proper training. Or get a well fitting muzzle for when he HAS to be around small children or men. Good luck!|`|JsBb732Maa	Use a muzzle when your dog is out and look for obedience training in a public area.|`|ZxGAKWHQaa	I don't normally do "What he said!" answers, but Dartass2 is very correct. An electronic training collar, used appropriately and knowledgeably, is a wonderful tool. For the situation you describe, it's use would be a train wreck and be pretty much guaranteed to worsen what you'd like to fix. You need to find yourself a real trainer, as versed to a friend who does not have enough skill and experience to properly advise you.|`|4rwouQHOaa	Forget about e-collars and DIY, you have a unstable human aggressive Siberian that has already bitten and you need to find a professional trainer/ behaviorist (not a family friend) and get her evaluated ASAP. Her aggression has nothing to do with who gave the injections, it is most probably due to poor breeding, and is NEVER acceptable. PERIOD. Get this sorted out BEFORE she is given the chance to bite a child or any other human being.
gb6wgo3paa	Those things are so temperature sensitive... It has to be slightly warmer than room temperature (around 70-76 degrees or so) but not too hot or they will all die. I tried raising them last year and it was sooo freakin hard. Good luck to you, lol.     Oh and not sure if it's in the booklet they come with but tap water will kill them off. I think you have to use distilled water or something (I forget).    I went through 4 packages of eggs because they kept dying from the water temperature getting "Off" from what they needed. I ended up putting a reptilian lamp near (not too close) their tank (just a round fishbowl). I ended up turning it off when it was twilight for a few hours as I heard keeping it on 24-7 was not good for fish and assumed it was the same for them. They liked this, I think, as they lived for a long time once I got the hang of it.     Don't keep them near a window or near a draft or it will chill the bowl at night and kill them off (I learned the hard way, haha).    They will periodically shed their own skin and eat all the fish that are smaller than them. Turtle food is good for them to eat when you run out of the pellets they give you. Mine got fat.    Eventually you will only end up with 2 large ones, then only one as they will fight to the death as a survival instinct and eat their competitors. Happy Triops hatching, they are a high maintenance pet :)

3n60UxgQaa	There's no way to really prevent the growth of a fish that won't eventually  kill it.    People most often refer to stopping the growth as stunting.  Fish do not grow to the size of their environment; the environment stunts them.  In short, stunting means that the body will stop growing but the organs will continue to grow.  As you can imagine, this isn't healthy.  The body will not be able to accomadate the enlarged organs and the fish will eventually die from it.    So while they won't grow in a smaller environment, they won't be as healthy.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	That whole 'fits the size of the tank' is BS, I've had many many fish out grow a tank (even when they weren't supposed to). If you can't afford or have room for a 100Gal then you can't have that fish.     Keeping a big fish in a small tank is just a bad idea, the fish can actually break the glass either by itself or by hitting a decoration (rock or gravel).|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Thats the problem, stuntung a fish's growth is going to harm it.    Fish dont pull out a tape measure and magically decide to stop growing in a small tank. The reason they dont grow is because you cant keep the water conditions good enough for them to be healthy and grow to their full size. Nitrate buildup, lack of oxygen, not enough food all combine to slow the fishes growth. Thats really just one step away from killing them.    If you want to keep a large species of fish, you need a large tank, or keep buying small ones to replace them when they die.  Especially with rather delicate fish like BGKs.    Ian|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You cannot stop a fish from growing and keep him healthy. You would be sacrificing health for a smaller fish.      No fish grows to fit their environment. They will stunt. Lack of space and poor water quality will stop a fish from growing on the outside while the organs continue to grow on the inside. Stunting growth is cruel because it shortens their lifespan.    If you cannot properly house a black ghost knife than you simply have to wait until you have the proper equipment.    ~There is no way to stop a fish from growing and keep the fish healthy.|`|1r4HQequaa	yeah  if you leave them in a smaller tank  they will not grow unless their tank is bigger|`|TIteIgenaa	There isn't any way to prevent the growth of fish that is either humane or that keeps the fish happy and healthy.  My fish Dave has been growing a lot lately, so I just got him a bigger tank.  Mold to the fish, their lifespans are too short to make them unhappy.|`|BTyE1Ou4aa	unfortunately, unless there is a smaller breed of Black Ghost Knifefish the only options are cruel, i know you'll hate hearing this, because i know i do too!!! but there are other beautiful fish that are in a similar family group such as Brown ghost knife fish. they are Quite similar but half the price.

megu7JBFaa	It's fine, I fed my guinea pigs iceberg lettuce all the time. It just dosn't have much nutritional value.|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	I think it's because of the fact that there is all the fiber of normal lettuce without much else, so I wouldn't recommend feeding it to your pet, just in case.|`|tAZe8XJsaa	I was told not to feed my dwarf lop iceberg lettuce. It's supposed to give them diarrhea.     Since care of a guinea pig is similar to rabbit care, I'd assume the same for your guinea pig.|`|nm2hU5V7aa	Before he passed away, I actually found that my guinea pig preferred ice berg lettuce to romaine lettuce, and I never noticed anything significantly wrong with him. Perhaps it varies from guinea pig to guinea pig? If that's the case, I'm sure the best way to find out would be to give it a try and compare. Hopefully you'll learn something about your rodent friend!|`|VonDSR7Kaa	The problem with ice berg lettuce is that it has very little nutritional values, and is full of water--this could lead to her having the runs.     Better lettuces to feed are: Romaine, Green or Read leaf. Endive is good, too.|`|3RyvKIvPaa	Well... I used to feed it to my two, and it never did them any harm!|`|PoHpSqwwaa	Its better if you don't feed her iceberg lettuce, its low in nutrition and bad for her digestive system..so no|`|clxVw8XNaa	my guinea pig died. :[|`|OwNlomlTaa	Only dark colored lettuce is okay.

pfm0wcEIaa	Dog barking is a common problem.  Just call the police.  Noise, such as a barking dog is a disturbance.  In fact the City of Chicago passed a city ordinance about barking dogs about 2 or three years ago.    When you call the police you don't even have to tell them who you are and then police usually just come to their house and knock on their door to tell them to quiet down and thats it.      Once you call the police a couple of times, they usually get the message.|`|AA11457471	Talk to them again. I've had to remind my neighbor numerous times. She always apologizes & starts into a sob story. I refuse to listen & go right back to my point saying that's her problem to deal with. Each time I've gone over I've been less & less pleasant.  Ask if she minds if you call her whenever the dog is getting too loud- then do it regularly, especially when it's happening at 3am.  I have a dog, too & I don't leave mine out when she starts barking. I expect the same!  If talking to her doesn't help, that's what animal control &/or the police are for.|`|clxVw8XNaa	bark back.|`|o0GQUIXlaa	throw a shoe at it|`|lQ3uor3jaa	You should call animal control and they will go over and talk to her.

Maybe they just need a reminder.|`|JsBb732Maa	I would talk to her again, and if nothing changes call the local animal control and make a noise complaint.No one should have to hear a dog barking all day, I keep my dogs home and quite.

If you want to you can  call the police because they wont tell who called.|`|AA12203329	Our neighbor had a dog they would put out every night around 10:00pm and that dog would bark all night. I got their name then looked up their phone number and when that dog was barking around 2:00am I called them.This was before the days of caller ID..when they answered the phone I started barking into the phone as loud as I could. I never heard that dog bark again after that night!|`|baXseFOIaa	i now you asked before but just say your sorry but could you put them in and don't forget to say thank you   if that don't work maybe you should call animal control|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  I'm sorry for your problem.  The only way I know to take care of the problem is to anonymously call the police...they will ask your name so ask them to not mention your name.  I have had to do it before...but make sure that you don't want trouble with your neighbors.  A dog should not bark for that length of time...dog bark under distress/boredom.

What can they do about it anyways? if they leave it in all the time its gunna **** in their house and probably tear stuff up or they wouldnt keep it out. so is a little noise really that bad.  because dog **** would definately make your home less enjoyable and a barking dog can be ignored, tuned out by music or TV, close your windows? idk.|`|FNvv74UQaa	Check your city / county's nascence laws and see if there is a clause regarding barking dogs. Peruse it at that level, sometimes that's what it takes.

The whiskers help them feel for items in the dark so that they don't run into them.|`|t3xYstbdaa	They will grow back, but your cat needs those whiskers to move around safely. They are similar to antennae and let the cat know how close and far away it is from walls and anything else with an energy aura.  Please keep your kitty safe from flames in the future. A water bottle will work to keep it away from the stove if the the flame wasn't trauma enough.|`|cb7YfH5caa	watch your cat next time his wiskers will grow back but his face won't please be careful    -unknown|`|QxxCN4pVaa	yes they will grow back.|`|Kic8jeQiaa	ya they will|`|piPTKOkWaa	lol wow. ouch. yeah thell still grow back. be carfull though =)
AA12398420	Lots of things can be done. First, I would keep them apart in separate rooms and switch them so they can get used to each others smell. Then I would use Feliway (spray) and Rescue Remedy (drops for their water). That reduces the stress. Then I would get a dishrag and wipe each cat from head to tail and put the towel under the feed dish of the other cat so they would associate good with their scent.  They need time to adjust to each other and always give them equal attention/love. Feed them treats at the same time and always praise them when they are doing well.|`|Dcr8bdDraa	http://catfaeries.com/feliwayfaq.html  A product called Feliway can help to get two cats to like each other. I have many customers that use the product just for that reason.   The website above has alot of information on the product.|`|t3xYstbdaa	When my mom had to bring two cats together (they were both female) she used a cat carrier to separate them. Tinkerbell (the cat that lived with her) was placed in the carrier so Cuddles (the adopted cat) could wander around the house and smell all the new smells. Then, she closed Tinkerbell in the bathroom and placed Cuddles in the carrier, set the carrier in the middle of the kitchen again, and let Tinkerbell wander around.   Doing this enables both cats to see the other enclosed, and allows both the cats to put their scent out around the house. The mixing of smells tells the cats that is shared territory.  I recommend visits until you move in together, where you keep the cats separated, but they can see each other. They will still growl, hiss, and swat, but they will be in a carrier.   Something important about cats, is that usually when they are in a cage, they cry, and if the other cat hears it cry, it comes to help and investigate. It may help them make friends.   Some cats never stop fighting, but if you are diligent about telling them No when they do, and spray them with water, hopefully, they can make friends.  There is always the option of declawing, but i don't recommend such a cruel practice unless it is really necessary.|`|V4D6ocfzaa	You made a BIG mistake. You need to get a male and female cats if more than 1yr old. If one cats young get another young cat, if they grow up together it will be a weight of your shoulders!
AA11887983	Depends on where you get it done.  You have to call around to the local vets, and ask.  You will also have to make sure that they have all of the required tests and vaccines prior to having surgery.  The neutering of the male cat will be less expensive, because the procedure is simpler.  I would expect that the surgery itself, including anesthesia and the hospitalization for the female would be around $200, maybe $130-150 for the male?  But you really have to call.  And the Humane Society may do reduced cost spays and neuters.      If you live near Lansing, you could always call the Michigan State University School of Veterinary Medicine to see if they have a program that offers reduced cost for animals that have students perform the surgery. These are senior students that have already done the surgery before, and they are supervised by doctors.  I know when i went there, they had a program like that.  You can always call.|`|4TX26viFaa	Look down five posts, people already just answered it.|`|YBcB0732aa	You can Google low cost spay neuter program for cheaper rates.    http://www.michiganhumane.org/site/News2...

There are some pretty cheap food out there, I know Dad's dog food is like 8 bucks for 20 lbs.  If you're dog is small, and doesn't eat a lot...that would last her awhile...I know it does for our dog.  A 20 lb bag lasts at least 1 1/2 months.  I know it's not the best food out there...but it's cheap.  No matter what the job is...whether it be at McDonald's or in a mall....put in applications ANYWHERE that is actually hiring (if anywhere).  You might have to try for odd jobs first though.      While you're searching, do what you already said you would do....ask anybody and everybody that you know (friends, other family) if they could possibly take care of her.      It's really sad that some people are forced to give up/sell their pets because they lost their jobs and can't afford to keep them.  If you absolutely can't find anybody to take care of her and can't have her live off the cheaper food (if you feed her the 'good stuff')....take her to a shelter and tell them your story and have them find her a good home.  That should be the last thing you try.  I wouldn't be able to give up my dog either, but I would be able to have my mom take care of her.    Good luck with your dog and your job hunting!

You really need to do some research and choose a dog which is suited to your life style.    Rotties - Originally bred for Herding and Drafting (Pulling Carts).  Although typically low maintenance, they will need excessive exercise (although if friendly, a good hour or two in a controlled dog park should do the trick) to maintain focus and challenged.  Many of them are sweet and well trained, they are not known for their intelligence and not usually recommended for young families.    German Shepards - Bred for Herding.  They are well regarded for being intelligent, loyal and protective.  They too will require excessive exercise (again find your nearest dog park).  Happy in Companionship and Family Life.    Doberman - Initially bred for Guard/ Watch duty.  Also intelligent, alert and loyal.  Will also require much exercise, and in recent years careful breeding has improved the temperament of these dogs and are much suited to companionship and family life.

I have added three links one for German Shepherds and one for Rotties and (one for Dobermans in case it wasn't a mistake at the end of your question, but another choice) and I suggest that you do some research on these breeds.     None of them, are really, if you'll pardon the expression "beginner dogs".

KeevlZnTaa	If she is hiding she is probably frightened. She is still young. See it from your rabbits point of view, she is scared and them someone(you) are trying to take her from a secure area(ie-by grabbing, reaching, etc). Becareful when she is growling as this is usually a last resort before biting.    Also if she spends a lot of time in that room, under the bed, as you said she could see this as her territory, and is trying to keep you out of it. I would close off the daughters room and vary where she can and can't go.     I would think because she is so young it is probably because she is scared. Although another answerer said to keep her in the cage for days, this is not going to do anything to help the situation. You need to block off the room and show her that you will not back down when she growls.|`|7AqZzEEWaa	choice would you want to spend the night in a cage or roam free in the house? you choose|`|WAXkXYr0aa	When you do get her back in the cage keep the bunny in the cage for a few days before you let her out again. Maybe you should try another room that wouldn't have lots of places for her to hide. Have lots of contact with her then maybe she won't growl at you. I have heard that you can train bunnys to use a litter box just as a cat does. Good luck|`|AA10055682	My guess is yes.  The fact that she's hiding under the bed suggests to me that she's scared, and the fact that she's growling at you makes me think so even more.  It may be that she'd do better with some more restrictions for a little while until she's comfortable again.

Sometimes it is on purpose, perhaps due to fear, and sometimes the cat didn't intend to inflict harm, but was just playing too roughly.  Or, a person doesn't stop petting or holding a cat who doesn't want any more handling.     The two most common reasons tame pet cats bite are due to:    Play Aggression    Over stimulation    Early Training Matters to Prevent Biting Kittens, or Why Kittens Should Stay with Their Mothers for 12 Weeks    When kittens are kept long enough with their mothers and littermates, they learn that biting and scratching for real hurts. They learn to keep their claws in and to not bite for real when playing.  Mother cats discipline kittens who get too rough when they play with her.  First she might hiss.  Then she will finally sit on a kitten who bit her in play and won't stop from getting hissed at, gently holding him down by the neck with her mouth, so he can't wiggle out from under her, giving the cat version of "time out".  A littermate who got bit will squeal out, startling the one who did the biting, helping to modify the behavior.      Kittens should be kept with their mothers and littermates for 12 weeks, so they have time to really learn to not play too roughly.  They can only start learning "kitty manners" at 6 weeks of age, and it takes a few weeks for them to fully internalize the lessons to where they become the normal way to play without thinking about it.      Most of the kittens and cats reported to be biting and scratching people in overly rough play are those kittens and cats who were taken from their mothers and littermates too soon.  If for some reason the mother needs to be separated from the kittens, the kittens still should remain with each other, or at least in pairs, for 12 weeks at least.  A single young kitten should be paired with another young kitten to play with and learn about not being too rough while still young.  Kittens should really be adopted in pairs.    If you have an only kitten, read on to learn ways to prevent play aggression biting from occurring.     Too late now, the kitten/cat is biting!     If one has a cat or kitten that is biting, see the articles below for help.     Play Aggression    Over stimulation|`|QRFXQwGqaa	Chop her head off.|`|TbdQPxptaa	honestly i had a cat that did this.

They are on the quiter side normally though.  Lots of care, love, and attention miust be given to them.  But, again, we LOVE ours.  Only problem is it led to getting an umbrella cockatoo.  Birds are addictive- they are SOOOOOOO... loving and wonderful!|`|gdvCvWrLaa	i'm 16 and i just recieved a 6 week old cockatiel and i have to tell you it is going to be tons of work to get your bird to trust you so if you plan on not wanting to work with it and just stick your hand in the cage your going to get a nasty bite. i have them all over my handd.  of you want to look on a website just go to google and type in cockatiel and you will get a lot of stuff. but i'm not sure about the cage. when i got my cage i went to petsmart and got the cage that said it was ideal for a cockatiel
OyNJTWaiaa	All types of birds vary in the way the male tries to impress the female before she will allow him to mate with her.  Budgie boys head bob up and down talking closely to her face and feeding her before mating. She crouches low on the perch arching her back in a fully curved position, tail erect, to allow him to climb up on her back.  This is the mating act  http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj233...  In my canaries, the male impresses the female by singing and flying displays around the female. The mating act is swift and more upright in position.  My Princess Parrots...the male stares into the female eyes and jerks his head around in circles around her head and stares into her eyes. Feeding her and then resulting in the mating act very much like with budgies.  Hope this helps.|`|KUWDICSVaa	Well, there comes a time in every little birdie's life that he needs to know about the "birds and the bees". The father bird sits him down and tells him...

enC9TvxUaa	-PLEASE find a local breeder!  Those pet stores do NOT sell hand raised birds, which you need to have a well adjusted and healthy bird!|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	DO NOT BUY ANIMALS FROM PETSMART. Petco over-prices their birds very high. Animals from Petsmart are bred at Rainbow World Exotics, who beat the animals they raise and take very little care of them. Any animals you buy there will be aggressive and possibly diseased. I used to work at Petsmart. Type in "Petsmart's dirty little secret" on youtube and you'll see. Look to buy from a conure breeder in your area instead. They know and love birds better than any pet store, and sell them at MUCH lower prices.    In general, conures can cost anywhere from $150-$500 (depending on which species). You will need a cage appropriate for their size (cockatiel size cages are almost too small...). You will also need food (Zupreem pelleted diets, if the bird is weaned onto them), perches (4-5 and different variations), food bowls, LOTS of toys... You're looking at about $300 on essentials, not counting the bird. Do lots of research before purchasing a conure... They require tons of care, hours out of their cage and at least an hour of interaction with their owners DAILY. They must be bathed at least once every couple of days, their cages must be cleaned once weekly, and they cannot be placed in front of drafts/heaters. If you have cats, they can NOT come in contact with them at ALL (cat saliva is deadly to all birds).     As far as talking goes, there are several species who are notorious for good voices (particularly Blue Crowned conures). Most conures can't talk very well though. This should not be the primary reason for your purchasing of a parrot... They have emotions and feelings and need love and attention. Talking should just be a plus. Also, beware if you have children... Some conures can get aggressive and bite very hard if they are not well socialized (yet another reason you should not purchase a bird from Petsmart).     Hope this helped!|`|fQVJhPM1aa	From my experence, it is a bad idea to buy a bird from a pet store! Try adopting. I got my green cheeks from a breeder for $200 a pair.

Find a hobby breeder where you live. They are relatively easy to find.  Go to Yahoo groups, search for a Conure Breeders Group (I'm sure there are several) and join it for free. Once you join you can post a message with the group telling them what area of the country you're n and ask them if they can recommend a breeder close by. this is the best way for you to find someone, cause the reference you get from the group will most definitely be a good one!    Conures are great pets. Enjoy!
XurYYreBaa	Rats are individuals like the rest of us & the way they react towards each other can vary.  Your lone rat will *probably* accept your new rat eventually but it's not 100% certain.  We've intro'd *lots* of rats of both sexes, including young pups to rats more than 2 yrs old.  Although the average time it takes for them to accept each other has usually been 1-2 weeks, some rats have immediately got along & were sharing a cage within days.  On the other extreme of our experience, it took our hairless girl about 3-4 weeks before she even stopped hissing @ the new rat but they eventually got along great.  We've never had an unsuccessful intro although I'm aware that it's possible.  Good luck.|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	Just today I introduced two small baby rats to my large, older rat scorpious, whom ive had for awhile.  At first he kept attacking them and they were terrified of him.  But I put them in the cage with him, watching closely, and after a bit he stopped.  its only been hours, they have a nice big cage, and plenty of food and water, and they are happy. they innoy him a bit, but now he only attacks them (not meanly, just something like a small, painless nip, no blood)  if they start attacking him, mostly playing.  Female rats are supposed to fight less than male rat, so there aren't usually problems.  just put them in the cage together, and watch closely, being close at hand if things get nasty.   make sure they have plenty of room, food, and water, and are being taken care of right. they should get along at least mostly, although if youve had them awhile, thenn maybe you should start out small, putting them togethetr in a play area or something at least once a day, closely supervised.|`|owko7Jczaa	It probably just doesn't like the baby rat. I don't know much about rats but i know about hamsters and if they lose their cage mate they can sometimes become depressed and they can show that in alot of different ways. Thats prob what is happening.|`|F3bwZzmVaa	Well, the new rat wasn't used to those new rats, and well it doesn't know the other rat, so it is just trying to defend itself. Rats are their own individuals, and just like hamsters, they can't be put together, or they get agressive, unless they are from birth. You're other rats may just think she is too, lovely lol!|`|TiFgKM87aa	maybe the rat the big one is jealous because its getting more attention  or maybe it want to eat it :)|`|D08wOiW9aa	Rats are territorial and will attack a newcomer.

uvHc7EDOaa	Ok the obvious is the cage... The bigger the better, and you can keep more than one in a big enough cage. In fact, if you can't spend a lot of time with your budgie, its recomended.     Now, what goes in the cage:    Perches first. These are the most important part of your birds life. Make sure you use natural branches. This is as simple as going down to the nearest tree and grabbing a couple. Get a few different thicknesses. The reason you should use natural branches is for the birds feet. Fake ones don't allow the bird to exercise its feet properly and can cause problems later on. Also, taking a few branches from a tree is cheaper than buying them. If the the cage is big enough, put a few perches in there, it provides variety for the budgie. But also leave enough room for it to fly as well.    Next is toys. Toys are also very important, because they will keep your budgie entertained when you aren;t there. Get a few plastic toys, bells, balls, chains...things like that. Birds love mirrors, and some people will say not to buy them because the bird wont bond to you. However, my birds have always had mirrors and I have never had a problem with bonding issues. As long as you are always playing with and talking to the bird, there shouldn't too much of a problem. Rotate the toys every week or so, to ensure the bird doesn't get bored.    Next one is diet. You can buy a budgie food mix from any supermarket, or pet store. This should provide your bird with plenty of seeds. However, you should supplement its diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Apples, small pieces of corn, stuff like that. Never feed your bird adavcardo. It is poisonious to birds. For a better list, I suggest talking to your local vet. They can give you the best advice for the diet of your bird. Change your birds food and water every day.    Last is environment. Your budgie will need plenty of sunlight, so next to a window is a good idea. Line the cage with newspaper and clean it every week. At night, ensure the bird is given complete darkness once the sun has gone down. If there is going to be noise and light in the room, cover it with a dark cloth until morning.     Hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, lol. Or talk to your vet.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	You can keep 2 budgies in the same cage, and is preffered, just as long as they were in the same cage in the store. you will need:  cage $20-60  litter $0-10 newspaper is ok  food $6-20 feed what they fed at store, unless it is poor quality. Nutriphase is good.  toys and perches $15-30 budgies need lots of different toys and interesting perches. I reccomend a sandy perch and natural wood ones  food/water cups are usually included with cage  millet $2-8 budgies LOVE it and it helps bonding   Cuttle bone/mineral block $0-5 some are included in cages, my birds like them in pink better than plain white. (go figure)  parakeet gravel and grit: $1-5|`|SeKR3zncaa	I don't know specifically all of the supplies you will need but just a few tidbits of information that I found useful when I bought my budgie:  -do not buy a circular cage. they do not have corners in which the budgie may hide or retreat to if they feel threatened or scared, and what results will be a a very disturbed budgie flying in circles.  -if you have time to spend with the budgie and want it to bond with you do not buy a mirror to put in the cage as the budgie will spend time "bonding" with its reflection. The same can be said of a companion bird. The budgies will bond with each other rather than with you however if your family does not have to time to spend each day with the budgie, its best if you buy an additional budgie so they can keep each other company   Hope this helps a bit ;)|`|Hk2C8zTRaa	You need a decent cage with some toys in it. Some perches depending upon how big your cage is. You need some cuttle-bone for there beaks to trim and its also good on calcium that they need.  Some parakeet food. If you want them to go on a pellet diet or an all seed diet is up to you. Also something for them to chew on cause they love to chew no matter what it is. A swing so they can play and see them selves in. A cage liner so its a lot easier to clean the cage up with. And believe me that does make it a lot easier. A sheet to cover them with so the don't freak out over the shadow and stuff. A parakeet book will help you with some questions that you have on how to breed, train ect.  Hope this helps.|`|w1necKzYaa	A cage of course about  1.5 foot wide x 1.3 foot deep x 1.3 foot tall cage (about 45x40x40 cm).   Perches (wooden ones are best)  Food, food and water cup (if you get a starter kit you will probably get most of what you need) Use fresh seed with at least 40% straight canary seed.  Cuttle Bone and Mineral Block - . These items are readily available at pet stores. These white powdery blocks provide your budgie with essential nutrients and calcium.   Toys-  swings, bells, and lattice balls with bells in them. Rings and other toys are also great.

ITnQEUQTaa	spey and neuter your pets!!      A five month old male is 'probably' not viable.  The b*tch could have had a phantom pregnancy and he decided to have a drink.  She may just be producing milk because he is suckling - the trouble is that lactation is dependent on demand.  If this becomes an ingrained habit it could continue for months!!  Separate them for a few weeks and see if that helps.    If you decide to continue with the pregnancy you will need to keep the male dog away from the mum and pups. Having other dogs around can really stress out the b*tch and she may neglect or harm the pups.    ** b*tches can produce milk from a phantom pregnancy or even if there are puppies that need fostering.|`|hov037Giaa	seperate them immediately! if she is lactating that means within1 day to a week she will have her puppies. the blue doesnt need to suck her mile because the first bit of milk she produces has more colagen and stuff that the pups need and they can only get it from the FIRST bit of milk she produces. get him away from her and dont let him get near her while she has her puppies. my Duchess is the nicest most loving pit ever but when she had puppies, we had to drag her away from them just for her to use the bathroom and that lasted until they were about 4 weeks old. she growled at anything and everyone that got near her and her puppies except for me and my boyfriend. so keep her stress level low and keep the male away from her until the puppies are weaned.|`|9tzgiIwraa	You need to separate them, especially due to the fact she might start getting aggressive closer to delivering pups and hurt him.

ufc4JKRkaa	The best advice that I can give to you is to ignore 95% of what the pet store tells you and go to www.guinealynx.com. Carefully read through the care sections there.   Here is a good section on diet  http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html  To get the piggy used to you and the kids, have the kids feed him/her healthy treats 1 or 2 x's a day (this in addition to daily "salads")  give cilantro, small slices of apple, bell peppers, sliced celery, blueberries for treats. Pigs are very food driven and will eventually stand at the cage to greet you when they know you are coming with a treat.  I highly suggest that you read through www.guineapigcages.com. If you have a pet store cage you may want to consider making your own c&c cage which are the cages on guineapigcages.com.    I mentioned salads;read through these links so see what I mean. you have to become familiar about what you can and can't feed them but once you do you will be able to put together piggy salads that will give them the vitamin c that they need each day. Vitamin C in the water is NOT a good option.  http://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/diet...    You will also need to feed a plain high quality pellet food, make sure the food has no seeds, dried fruits or colored bits in it  KM's hayloft has excellent high quality pellets and the best hay around  http://www.kmshayloft.com/  If you don't want to order online then your local petsmart may carry Oxbow cavy cusine pellets which are wonderful  http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html pel...    Last thing;  make sure your piggy has hay 24 hours a day! This is THE most important part of a guinea pigs diet  http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html hay    Best of luck to you!|`|AA12324049	Well, I can only speak from my experience but my guinea pig loved being around the family and the noise - inside her cage or out.  Her main diet was the pellets they sell for guinea pigs but she also loved lettuce and carrots.  In fact, whenever anyone opened the fridge she would start making noise because she knew they were stored in there!  I would recommend that since she is new, don't overwhelm her with a bunch of kids huddling over her - let them take turns petting her or holding her quietly like when they are watching tv.|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	O.K be extra carefull with him keep him away from your kids teach them how to handle him when he is old enough. For the sound he will adjust to that but make sure the first person he famlireizes with is YOU!=)|`|OCHM0Q7paa	Not holding but simply petting the guineapig every day will make them used to you. Holding is better to do though. Make sure the children know how to handle the little one and the noise shouldn't be a problem. My guineapig just squeaks along with the noise. :D|`|cIuHgdFWaa	Handling- Make sure you dont smell like food and wash your hands before and after you handle them. Also be sure not to hold them too tight.    Feeding- If you have mulitple guinea pigs in one cage you should have more than one dish. That way they dont fight over the food. Treats are helpful. Just make sure you know what is safe and what is not safe for them to eat.    Kids- It depends on how old your kids are. Let them know not to be loud or mean to the guinea pig. If they are really little do not let them hold the guinea pig they may drop it.     Noise- You cant be too loud near the guinea pigs. They have very sensitive ears.|`|D08wOiW9aa	Feeding: No pears or iceberg lettuce - they will get bloated. Timothy hay on a regular basis, vitamins for their water. Fresh lettuce or other vegetables daily, fruit occasionally. Pine shavings are best.   Handling: Let them get used to your hands. Feed them by hand and let them smell you. When they come close, you can try to touch them. Do the same with your children, as long as they are quiet and careful. If you want the guinea pigs to get used to your children, after they are used to their smells, put them in a room where there will be occasional bustle and they will get used to it. My guinea pigs loved the kitchen. Once they are used to everyone, they are very friendly.

I personally wouldn't know where to go, however I did find a site that may help you:    http://judymyers.tripod.com/tfaq.html    or, if this doesn't contain what you're looking for, google 'veterinary malpractice' for more results.    Best wishes.
hdQvbs0naa	Are you sure they're actually fighting, or are they just wrestling? Young rats love to wrestle each other. They may squeak a bit, but that's normal too. If the fighting is vicious, you may need to separate them. Little ones are high energy and often squirm and struggle when you try to hold them. Just be patient with them.     Have they always been together? Did you just introduce them?|`|Wj5wwIz6aa	MAybe u should try putting them in different cages and see how they react and then see whaat happenes next|`|XeC7eEBAaa	their just babie maby their playing and dont worrie mabey they will grow out of it|`|LM7DWcdlaa	They are probably fighting for dominance. Separate them. They are probably afraid of you because they are anxious of the other rats around them.|`|Bsk4Z0WQaa	You might have too many rats in one cage
z01moLIvaa	It is possible for your pet to kill your baby. It's most likely to happen with a dog and there have been several stories in the news of this happening.-  http://www.nypost.com/seven/01032008/new...  http://www.unchainyourdog.org/news/04121...  http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/new...  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local...  http://kgmb9.com/main/content/view/10245...    Even if you trust your dog and will allow him around your baby, stay with them and don't leave them alone. Many of these dog attacks were actually made by trusted family pets.  I haven't been able to find any stories of cats killing babies.  Here is the only one that I've found about rats killing a baby- http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...  These rats were not pet rats. So I'm not sure it counts. Wild animals are more likely to kill than pets. And I've never heard such thing as a pet rat killing a baby! (or anyone)    What you should do is never leave your pet alone with a baby. Even if you do trust them.  Here's some helpful information on introducing your pets and your babies. Please read this-  http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/introd...|`|VMY7No0eaa	infant (HUMAN?) BABIES?  no  animal ? possibly ... depends|`|9tzgiIwraa	No... most of the time the pets become protective of the infants. They will protect the infant against strangers.|`|lCXDLQupaa	dont leave your infants lying all over the place and im sure they wont be mistaken for a snack|`|zY9PdRGjaa	i heard of cats getting in the crib to get milk that might have dribbled on babys mouth and then suffocate baby ..... but always thought it as a wifes tale.. but a rat biting them (thats tru)|`|LCAzlHhEaa	When I was younger we had several outside cats at our farm.  One that we had when she was ready to deliver her babies would go and hide and then eat her babies.  My older brother and sister found her one time doing this.  Even though the cats were outside they were still our pets, my parents just didn't want cats in the house.    Also, I know a pig isn't a household pet but our sows sometimes would eat baby pigs.  And once a sow gets the taste of blood from eating one baby she would eat the whole liter of pigs so you would have to remove her from her babies & bottle feed the babies so they would live.|`|aracCoyEaa	come on man there's less chance of that than you roof caving in!|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
Dkk5HwbEaa	There was obviously something wrong internally.    You'd have to get a necropsy performed to know an exact cause.      Unfortunately, it's difficult to know when are pets are ill.  Besides the fact that they can't tell or show us, as a defense mechanism they hide their ailments until it's really bad.  In the wild, a sick or injured animal is a target for predators, so they hide their sickness well, and we only notice when it gets really bad or it's too late.    Your dog could have ingested poison, had a distended bowl, an infection, obstruction or any number of things.  Or it could have had a bad heart, or seizure or a virus.|`|lhOd2hvXaa	Sorry to hear of your loss.    There is no way to tell why/how your dog died without a necropsy.    With that said, bloody diarrhea is one of the symptoms of parvovirus.  If you have other dogs in the home or if you plan to get a new dog soon please speak with your veterinarian about decontamination procedures for your home and yard.  If a necrosy rules out parvo then, of course, that is not something to worry about.|`|9tzgiIwraa	Sorry for your loss....    Yes, a autopsy would be the best way to find out. Possibly she could have had a blockage or a rupture inside of her intestines. If she was a puppy and the bloody stool was accompanied by a really strong smell then it could have been parvo.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	im srry|`|hsO3cLutaa	It all depends on why it was bloody. There was something internally wrong for there to be blood. It could be a number of things. The only way to find out is to take her to the vet for an autopsy ($$$$). Sorry for your loss!|`|5c2SiZ82aa	1st of all, I am terribly sorry about what happened to your dog Precious. Bloody stools often indicate an injury or disorder in the digestive tract. Could she may have eaten anything  else other than food that you normally feed her? Have you talked to your vet about it?|`|AA12377116	Autopsy time, if you are serious about finding the reason. It was probably something she ate but if not, all the more reason to find out.|`|KnypnLfxaa	the bloody stool. :( I am so sorry|`|MT0gw2hmaa	It could of been parvo, one of the symptoms is bloody stool and depending on vaccinations takes the life of puppies quickly. Theres dehydration, not wanting to eat and bloody stool, and vomiting are the symptoms. There is a test a vet can do, and with aggressive treatment and lots of prayers a puppy has 50% chance of survival. Also, sure you didn't leave any chocolate, they get bloody stool from that because its toxic to dogs. So sorry to hear of your loss. I speak from experience, both my shihtzu puppies contracted parvo, and only one survived. Its hard to know without a test though. Huggs.
p3vjvzRPaa	If you've choose your breeder well, then the pups should all have been vet checked before you came to collect your pup and you should have a record of that (and worming/vaccinations).      Being born 38 minutes after the other pups is a weird thing for a breeder to say - there is usually a gap between births and this isn't a reason for a pup to be smaller!    Hindsight is always 20:20 but you have probably figured out by now that your questions are ones you perhaps should have asked *before* collecting your pup.      On the positive side, I know of very small pups that have gone on to be beautiful normal adults.  I hope that happens to you :-)|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	;you would have been better off using a reputable breeder..    let the vet give him a thorough check|`|FewhKlx9aa	My first born pup was the runt and they did'nt think he would make it because he weighed 12oz at 4wks.I made sure that I was supplementing his food from mom and he is still the runt but boy is he strong and tough..The bump should be checked out though by the vet|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	if the breeder told you he was a runt instead of teacup.  then i think she seems to care enough that she has her dogs health checked, but have some time to have vet check it out for problems.|`|kbV5LV3paa	That's actually not always the case.. Let me tell you my story. I have a male & female chihuahua who had puppies last July. The last puppy my dog had was about 45 minutes after the rest. She's the biggest of all of them & the strongest from what I've seen. People usually don't believe me because I kept 2 of them the 3 born & the 6th born. The 3rd born weights about 3 lbs the most & the 6th born the last weights about 8 lbs I wanna say. I guess it just depends! Good luck w/the new pup though!|`|agh18eT2aa	I pick runts, too, and oddly enough, they have been the best dogs/hamsters/whatever that I ever had.  And they all came right up to me right off the bat, too.  The little doggie is going to be the love of your life.  There is no truth to the sick runt rumor, at least not from my experience.  Care for it as best you can, and you will have a best friend for many years.  Congratulations!|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Runts do not have ano other problems than the rest of the litter.  They often die sooner after birth due to natural selection.  If he made it through the competetion of puppy, then he's gonna be fine!|`|uQrIdrjfaa	no|`|Uhge1Qzjaa	I know this is a dog Q but my cat was the runt and he has spent a beautiful 10 years i really dont think that that is true lol hope i helped|`|JYsV0KfKaa	if it is a hound and the bump is on the back middle of his head, then it is normal :]|`|tRfgwT5saa	The runts only get sick easily because they can't get their way to their mother past all the bigger puppies and sometimes don't get all the nutrition they need.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Not always!     If you buy from a reputable breeder, then the chances of genetic problems or illness is low. If you buy so called "teacup  " dogs then the chances of genetic problems, illness, or even early death are high.    Some runts grow to be the biggest and healthiest of the group! My previous dog was a runt when born, but turned out to be a few pounds over breed standard! She was also healthy all her life.|`|3F6l81vxaa	NO!     I had a runt mannnnnyyyyy times ( my favorite ) and they were great!|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	He should be perfect. He may just be a smaller individual. The fact that the breeder knew the order of birth and is that involved is very good.  Did she have the vet check the pups and mom after birth prior to sale?  Most puppies are equal healthwise. If they are born very weak they die quickly.  That is how nature does it. Unfortunately, we people want to save every last life and sometimes that isn't so kind.  It is always good to have a vet check soon after you get an new animal.   Have fun with your new boy!|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	The definition of the word 'Runt' is defined here.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runt    http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=runt%20...

enC9TvxUaa	-Good deal?  What is that?  We have one, and he is absolutely wonderful!  BUT, NOT CHEAP!!!  The original invest,ment was about $2,000.  Tjhat was only the beginning!  Be prepared for a lot of vet bills!  Ain't no such thing as a good deal from the money end, but the dog, that's a GREAT deal for a breed!|`|n8jrLDblaa	LMAO!    Good deals? Nope...not in this lifetime. Expect to spend a small fortune! They are difficult to breed, and often can't whelp naturally, which is what makes them so expensive.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	deals doesnt mean quality with bulldogs, bulldogs run from 3000 up from reputable breeder which is the only place you should get a bulldog from other then a shelter.    English bulldog is another name for the bulldog its just not used any more.     And are you really willing to pay all the vet bills? cause i think not if your asking for a cheap bulldog.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	pet finder|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Good luck on that one    You will be paying a LOT of money    But a tip: don't buy from anyone selling english bulldogs  They're called bulldogs in the AKC|`|fmHHcFd5aa	depends on where you live. go to the akc website nd locate a breeder in your area and NEVER buy from a pet shop or have them shipped. theres alot of scams going on now where they are selling imported or sick dogs when they are shipped. always go to the breeder or owners home to pick up the pet. a good breeder or owner will let you go interact with all puppies and have the parents on site and let you see them. Also there are shelters. A bulldog is always best to buy from a reputable breeder more so than a shelter just because with bulldogs with their temperment they have a  tendancy to have issues when neglected or disowned. You never know wht you are getting into with a shelter as far as healt or behavior problems. Plus as a puppy it gives you and the dog a lifetime to bond. Black is an unnacceptable color and a breeder will tell you its rare, no its not worth the 3,000 you pay. A good dog hs no price tag. ours was 2,000 and he has limited papers, but its ok as we do not show or breed. There is no price of a good dog. You can get one dirt cheap and it be a great dog. But check out local breeders on akc webpage.    and people make an issue on the proper name as well. A reputable breeder does call them english bulldogs as does half of america as thats the new name for them. They can be under british bulldogs,english bulldogs and bulldogs is very broad. A bulldog could be any dozens of types. the british and eng. are the same thing. the british are just more mean and were bred to fight where as the english is the modified we see today thats more common. Unless you want a mean dog bred for fighting avoid the british bulldog and yes they are clled eng. bulldog. you are not getting scammed if you see that. Ours was an eng. bulldog as well and thats what all the vets call them. As well as alot of great breeders and on the dog shows.

Cats are not useless, by the way. For instance, cats saved the human population from starving to death on many occasions by killing rodents which ate our grain, or spoiled it, or both.

z6d6k1Ltaa	If your kitty  is your life, get off the computer & get to the vet NOW. Something is VERY WRONG for her to be throwing up green bile & if she's not moving, its because she is in PAIN.   You may be able to save her if you go to the vet now, but if you keep waiting, you won't have to worry about putting her down, because you will have allowed her to over 5 days in excrutiating pain, dying slowlYour vet will advise you if she can be helped or if euthanisia is recommended. You may not want to put her down, but that is certainly more humane (quicker & less painful )than letting her slowly die in agony. Many conditions can be easily treated without a lot of expense, but people often wait so long to see a vet, & the animal's  condition deteriorates, so that it may become impossible to treat or much more costly to treat.(For instance, I have seen cats allowed to go blind, because they weren't taken to the vet for an eye infection that could have been cured with one tube of $10 eye ointment.) A cat that stops eating for any reason  can develop hepatic lipidosis within a few days, a condition involving the liver where they become unable to eat & they must be fed by stomach tube until they get well enough to begin eating on their own again. Don't try to force feed your cat yourself, as it may have a blockage & you could burst her stomach.

No living animal is "supposed" to get so sick, but cats do become quite ill, and from what you are describing, it seems like a high emergency situation to me.     Since your cat hasn't eaten in 5 days, she probably has developed liver problems. Cats cannot go without food safely for more than 48 hours tops, without liver damage.    http://en.allexperts.com/q/Cats-1606/cat...    http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_hep...    I am amazed that you haven't taken your cat to a vet by now. If you cannot afford a vet, talk to the vet about payment plans or register at  care credit to arrange for payment which is interest free for the first year.    http://www.carecredit.com/    If you can find a Veterinary Emergency service because this is an emergency situation.

It's only common sense that when your dog is sick-- you take it to see a professional, not some Yahoo (pun intended) on the internet that gives you an answer like "Give your dog two tylenol" which can be sometimes be lethal advice.    There's no profit to be made from SAFETY.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	No that's dumb. We're supposed to be giving advice on this site. Also go to the vet is the most reasonable response when soemthing is wrong with an animal. That is really stupid, you think we deserve money for helping people.

But I don't see it as paddy a Vets pocket, I see that a loving owner is taking care of their dog.    So many are abused & never get treatment for their wounds.  It is just good to see those that care doing the right thing.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Lol @ rottens answer    inderectly maybe  Not enough to really make a difference
xGmbEzOZaa	In the future, keep in mind that frostbite must be thawed in cool water slowly heated to lukewarm. If you thaw the tissue immediately in warm water, it will thaw before circulation has returned and the tissue will die of oxygen deprivation.    Keep her warm and provide her with lots of food and water. She should get better really quickly.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Obviously she wasn't in the coop. Always use cold water on frostbite as warm water can further damage the frozen part. At this point just keep her warm and let nature do the rest.
jjoBO3jkaa	Avoid giving your dog chocolate at all costs. It can be deadly. Different dogs react to chocolate differently. Better not to risk it.|`|jQglJiMhaa	Its actually only real Dark chocolate that affects dogs    The level of risk to a dog's health depends on the size of the animal, its sensitivity to theobromine, and the type of chocolate. Dark or more expensive (purer) chocolate presents a greater danger to dogs as these contain higher levels of theobromine.    According to the Veterinarian Dr Mike Richards, (Toxins Poisions that effect dogs, 03/06/99), even a small amount of chocolate can cause problems. Based on a dogs body weight, one ounce of milk chocolate per 1 pound of body weight is enough to produce a toxic dose. However, putting things into perspective, unless you have a very tiny dog, a small piece of standard commercial chocolate (such as Cadbury's or Hersheys) is unlikely to prove fatal.    theobromine is what is dangerous.  The sigar can also ust make them sick to there stomache|`|f529b16d6a3c11e5892aa3fea7cfb3d2aa	milk chocolate is not as dangerous to doggies as dark chocolate    the higher the cocoa percentage (or cacao beans) the more risky.    if you wanna give a dog chocolate, give it tootsie rolls. they're only chocolate flavored.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	my dogs all have eaten chocolate with NO ill effects|`|f1kRtbMAaa	A small  amount  of chocolate at a time does not usually bother  any dog.Poisoning happens when  a dog eats a large amount at once in  contrast  to its body weight.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Well my dogs have eaten lots of chocolate and have never had any affects. Except maybe not four pounds lol. Anyway my poodle once got into the closed cupboard and pulled down a whole bag of Chocolate Chips and ate the only thing shes alive 5 years later. Shes 12 now. And some people panic if you give your own dog like a crumb of chocolate for a little sweetness its so annoying also my dog likes ice cream so we let her finish the ice cream sometimes. She has a sweet tooth. Some dogs are more sensitive then others. I think it depends on the type of dog really. MOre sensitive the better chance they will react to it. The stronger the stomach the better they react. My terrier mix has like a stomach of steel.|`|MURxMnLtaa	every time you give your dog chocolate, you risk its life.  stop giving the dog chocolate!|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	It's the amount that he eats at ONE TIME that is toxic to dogs. The purer the chocolate, the more damage it will do.   A high enough dosage of theobromine and caffeine will lead to seizures and cardiac arrest.  Best is no chocolate at all.       http://www.talktothevet.com/ARTICLES/DOG...|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	It really depends on what kind of chocolate.    It's the theobromine in the chocolate that is deadly to dogs.  Milk chocolate (which is most candy, cakes, etc.) has very little theo in it.  Dark chocolate, and semi-sweet chocolate (like chocolate chips) is high in theo and can be very bad.      I know a sheltie who ate an entire bag of Reese's peanut butter cups with very little ill-effects.  On the other hand, one of my dogs got into a bag of chocolate chip cookies and was very, very ill.|`|s23w0I3Baa	my 80lb lab/ret. mix once ate a whole bag of hershey kisses with no effects what so ever. though i would never ever intentionally feed my dog chocoloate.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	OK, I am almost 50 years old and have had dogs my whole life.  I never gave it a thought to give my dogs anything up until about 10 years ago.  I had a dog that ate a pound of grapes a week, then I find out that grapes can kill dogs.  My dogs have always licked the plates with all kinds of sauces with garlic and onion in them and never got sick then I find out that garlic and onion are no good for them.  Yet I know people who give their dogs garlic to keep fleas away.  Now with the chocolate:  gave my dogs chocolate too.  As a matter of fact, one of my dogs got into a whole big platter of chocolate cookies that my mom baked for Christmas one year while we were at my kid's Christmas play. He ate them all, no sickness.  So I think the answer to your question is "no one really knows". So don't give your dog chocolate just in case it does get a reaction.  I dunno what else to tell you.|`|yCkGLt1laa	All good advice, DO NOT GIVE CHOCOLATE TO YOUR DOG, EVER! Those that have had no problems, that's great, but one of these times you might not be so lucky.
CjOOkfX4aa	Yes and i know exactly what you are talking about. i have this adorable min poodle/pom and she is the sweetest dog. she has never bitten anyone or growled she gives me kisses and she is just an all around good dog, she is very smart to.   It makes me really mad that people don't give them the time to see how much they got to offer. i hate it. but at least i can see how lovable and smart she is. :)|`|hfu63hoxaa	because they dont have a sense of wild to them. they are just really show dogs. like a great dane is a protective dog and very big and could take someone down. while a poodle will do nothing. mostely because they coward down to many things.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Because they are happy.      People forget that happy is the original meaning of gay.|`|goaxOxzdaa	They just get a "froo froo" reputation, mainly due to their handlers who are, the majority of the time, the ones who are gay.  There are many gay men that are hair dressers, so they figure why not get a dog with hair that they can artistically style.    When people choose to artistically style their dog's coat, it looks dainty and, well, I guess some people would say it looks gay.  It's not politically correct, but that's why people call poodles gay.    Standard Poodles are anything but dainty dogs.  They're smart, strong, and driven.  I resent the world of dog fighting, but if these twisted individuals out there doing it occasionally through a Standard Poodle in the ring with their commonly used Pit Bulls, the Poodle in all likelihood, would dominate the other dog.  I can say that merely owning a Pit Bull has shown me that Pit Bulls are not a very good choice for this barbaric practice; Pit Bulls are too social of a dog and dont take to violence very well at all (mine has always avoided fighting in the past when presented with a conflict with another dog; he actually ran away from a strangers black lab that was showing aggression towards him one time).  But ask any Standard Poodle handler, and they'll tell you, Standard Poodles CAN be vicious, and they score worse on temperament tests than Pit Bulls and a lot of other breeds as well.  Combine this with the Standard Poodle's strength and wit, and you can see that there is nothing "gay" about this breed at all.    And I'm not talking about miniature or toy poodles, just to clarify.  Those dogs ARE "gay" (gay simply meaning something bad) and even more "gay" when they're crossed with another rat-dog to get your cross-bred "rodent-doodles" that have recently become so popular with people looking to buy a dog.  People want a dog's companionship, but not the accompanying responsibility and labors of properly caring for a traditional dog.  It's the laziness of human beings that drive breeders to fulfill this demand for low maintenance little rat dogs that require very little food, grooming, exercise and space.  In return, you get constant health problems, temperament issues, and a "dog" that is basically good at nothing at all as far as a dog's practical implementations go.  But above all of this, they bring into existence a manmade, inbred animal that suffers throughout it's existence because it's genes are so artificial and void of natural selection, they essentially code the animal in a way where health problems and the consequent suffering is unavoidable, even with modern-day veterinary medicine.  The traits that contribute to a strong immune system, a healthy bone structure, normal development, etc, etc, have been discarded over the years.  All that has been selected to prevail (by man, mind you) are traits that affect the dog's appearance, notably in this case to make the dog small.  You can see how this will undoubtedly create problems in the dog's health.      Its not that I hate the little dogs; I just strongly disagree with people who contribute to their existence.  When broken down and analyzed - to perpetuate the creation and distribution of an animal that is so genetically corrupt that it is doomed to a life of suffering, is essentially animal cruelty.    Just a thought...      ADD-  I though this was funny:  "Cause most people dont know that those "ridiculous" cuts actually serve a purpose. The big puff ball so to speak in the front protects the rib cages and the heart and other vital organs, the small puff balls at the bottom of each foot protect joints, and the back two puff balls protect other joints and muscles. same with the tail puff ball its used to protect part of the tail and used for a rudder. All these "puff balls" protect the dog from frigid water. "    Why can't they just leave its fur alone?  Wouldn't the coat in its natural form also protect the animal where it needs the protection?  I don't see how selectively removing fur necessarily "adds" any protection to the animal, so I'd have to question as to whether these haircuts essentially serve any purpose at all other than those cosmetic in nature.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Until you've been on the receiving end of Pit Bull discrimination, you don't understand a breed with a bad image.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Cause most people dont know that those "ridiculous" cuts actually serve a purpose.

And to a lot of people, fluff equals not manly.|`|AA10112346	It's the hair cuts..    My neighbors have a black miniature poodle with a normal dog looking cut.    He doesnt look gay.

I actually had a client who wanted her male shih-tzu clipped to look like Arnold so he would look more masculine compared to her 2 female shih-zus.  It's all just silly!

p3vjvzRPaa	I've owned multiple dogs for more than 20 years.  My neighbours have sometimes been surprised to learn I have any dogs because they're so quiet.    Sometimes dogs bark because they are overstimulated or trying to protect their territory.  Eg if left loose in a property where they can see every passer-by.    I find with my dogs that they need a quiet area of my yard which doesn't look out over the street - that way they can relax when I'm not there instead of feeling they have to patrol all the time.    Of course having plenty of toys/bones, exercise, and human attention so they aren't stir crazy helps too!    The other important thing is that the dog has to realise that pointless barking is not something you like.  My dogs learn from puppyhood that they get positive reinforcement for being quiet and timeout or a verbal reprimand if they start barking (for no good reason).    It can also be a good idea to teach a dog to bark on command so that you can also teach them to stop barking - basically like setting up both an on and an off switch.  My dogs will 'speak' and then stop when I say 'that's enough'.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Sure they do, when you teach them not to bark at everything.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Like Beardie said she is bored.

You can get a shock collar for the dog that will buzz him when he barks.  He will learn fast not to bark any more.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Does your dog have enough to do?

You may want to figure out why your dog is barking to help correct the problem. Most dogs don't just bark to hear themselves bark. They bark for a variety of reasons. When do you notice it barks the most? Think about these things and then be a little more specific in your question...|`|HKoo2PfYaa	I have the same issue with my lab.  I did some research and here is what I have found:    General principles for controlling undesirable barking        * If we want to control barking, we need a dog who can obey us and relax. The dog needs to look to her owner for behavior clues. If we can call her, have her lie down (dogs do not bark as much when lying down) and stay, we are well on the way to solving a nuisance barking problem. In addition, there are some common principles we can use in modifying barking behavior.        * First, in most cases shouting "No" is only going to make matters worse since the dog is thinking you are barking too (and is probably happy you joined in).        * Be consistent. Pick a one-word command e.g., "Enough" for the behavior you want and always use that word in the same tone of voice. Everyone in the household must use the same command and act identically.        * Be patient with your dog and yourself. Changing behavior takes a lot of time, and you need to take it slowly, one step at a time. If you become angry at your dog, the chance to correctly modify the behavior will be gone.        * Reward the dog for good behavior. Positive reinforcement is much more powerful than punishment. Physical punishment will do nothing but make your dog fearful of you and break down the bond you wish to have with her. Food treats are fine to use as a reward at first. Often, picking a very special treat like small pieces of cooked chicken or hot dog will make the reward seem even better. As time goes on, you will not give a treat every time, sometimes just rewarding with a "Good Dog" and a pat on the dog's chest.        * Do not hug your dog, talk soothingly, or otherwise play into your dog's barking. Your dog may then believe there really was something of which to be alarmed, afraid, or anxious. This reinforces her behavior and she will likely bark even more the next time.        * Control the situation. As much as possible, set up situations to use as training. Practice in short, frequent sessions, generally 5-10 minutes each.        * Do not be afraid to ask an expert. Animal trainers, behaviorists, and your veterinarian can give you valuable advice. Having them witness your dog's barking episodes may give them valuable clues on helping you solve the barking problem.    Hope you find this helpful - I know I did!    Happy training.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	give her more excersise    you can also get her debarked  but thats lame

AQsiugSpaa	If your cat had an odor similar to a skunk smell, the groomer may have "expressed" his anal glands which releases a foul smell. Cats, just like dogs have anal glands which are used to mark their territories. Cats generally clean themselves really well, but if the glands become impacted if they have not emptied when the cat defecates, sometimes groomers and vets will have to manually empty them to avoid infection.    He has cleaned himself up and no longer has that pungent odor on him if this is the case.     The next time you take your cat to the vet, ask him/her to explain more to you and to teach you how to observe if the glands are blocking up.    http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/a/...    Hope this solves the mystery. It is really not "nasty" on the part of the cat.  These glands are just a way in which he communicates with other animals.

Um8osMNuaa	Sometimes this will happen, all the baby teeth don't get pushed out when the adult teeth come through. lf they are causing a problem then you need to see the vet and get them extracted. This is easily done, if you are planning on having her spayed you would be best doing it at the same time, no need for her to be anaesthetised twice that way.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Vet will need to remove them - usually during the spay.|`|GSf09ALBaa	They need to be pulled.    Edt:  super answers from everyone.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	ya might have to pull em|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	you will need to have them pulled|`|kbV5LV3paa	Yes you'll have to take her to the vet so they can have them pulled.. I had to do the same thing to my chihuahua!|`|FewhKlx9aa	One of my pekingese had this happen and when he was neutered they pulled the baby teeth,it caused crowding|`|MdknQ2Mkaa	Talk to your veterinarian.  If she has not been spayed yet, then they can do the extractions then while she is under.  No reason to put her under more than you have too.  One of my shelties, her teeth went out of line, because her baby teeth didn't come out when they were suppose too, so I have made sure with all of my others to check. Your bulldog is already a year, so I don't think they are going to fall out on their own.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Not losing baby teeth can affect how the adult teeth settle in and her overall bite.  Please take her to a vet and make an appointment for the removal of the baby teeth right away.

You need a big tank and NO other fish in there. They will be killed.     Its also a good idea to have a place in the tank the female can get to that the male can't or she may get killed too.

MNLbVQ2kaa	chinchillas sleep all day, and should be kept in a quiet, dark area. they need their rest or they will become stressed and bite at their fur. they should be ready to come out and play around 5:00 or 6:00 pm.|`|TIGZp5yzaa	around sunrise-sunset (depends on season)|`|1uvrkDWNaa	They're nocturnal, so they sleep a lot during the day.|`|OCHM0Q7paa	They sleep all day (light) except to eat/drink. They get up as soon as it gets dark.
MNLbVQ2kaa	depends on how long you've had him, he may just be shy.sometimes chinchillas enjoy being chased, its their idea of fun, or a game. hope this helped!|`|OCHM0Q7paa	If the problem IS that he/she is shy then try this... put your hand in the cage and alow it to nibble on you. It shoudn't be hard or painful. She will get your scent and become accustom to you.
F7S0eGvmaa	Chinchillas are naturally nocternal.  So they usually are asleep till about the time the sun goes down.  You can change this slowly, like you would for yourself.  But natually they sleep during the day.    They will wake up if you pick them up and then go back to sleep once they settle back down.    My chinchillas are starting to be up more in the afternoon since I moved them into the living room.  They are curious to whats going on around them so they are up more when I am.  Hope this helps|`|OCHM0Q7paa	This happened with mine. On christmas morning they were awake because we were holding and petting them. It was not natural for them to be awake at that time so they slept a while longer than normal the next day. They got up later though.|`|MNLbVQ2kaa	at about 4-5:00pm , if you pick up your chinchilla, he should wake up, then go play with him in a chinchilla safe room.

Try using a %2 bleach solution to wash out the traps.|`|WebaFPgsaa	I don't actually know about catching mice, but I know how to get rid of them without killing/hurting them.  I know there is a humain Society thingy were they find all the places in the house were the mice get in, and put trap doors on them so they can get out but not back in.

9tzgiIwraa	Well I would make an appointment with your vet for tomorrow and if it improves by tomorrow morning then you can safely say it was probably a soft-tissue injury that resolved itself. Better safe than sorry though, so always consult with a vet.|`|zeTGmB3faa	First you would do a visual inspection to see if you can spot wounds to the back, hip leg or paws. Fell gently the top, underside and between the toes. He may have a foreign object lodged. If the limp is very pronounced he should see vet right away to make sure that the did not fracture his leg or foot. The more that he walks on it untreated, the more difficult it will be to heal if it is a break. And, even if you cannot find something stuck in his foot or toes, it is possible that it is lodged deeply. Limping indicates pain and I'm sure you don't want the cat to suffer.|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	You have to take him to the vet you gotta be safe then sorry. Even if its nothing its important you find out go right now for your cats sucure saftey!|`|6fiMD6WOaa	take it to the vet RIGHT AWAY.|`|Umt80GyKaa	when it tows up|`|Xt6wsuabaa	If the limp appears to worsen over the next few hours, you should call your vet.  Is your kitty avoiding using the leg? Have you checked to see if there is anything stuck in his paw, or if it's cut anywhere?  If there is something in the paw and you are hesitant to remove it, take it to the vet.    The kitten could also have a bad strain, sprain or have some damage to a ligament.  If it's a ligament, the kitten could do more damage to the injured paw/leg.  Good luck.|`|43eUq8hOaa	give it a day,sweetie,it will probably get better.Ihave lots of anmals and have been through this,give it time and a little love and scratching.|`|NUOSS6kcaa	What I would do is keep checking on him, (see if he has something he loves to do, but sort of ignores it, ect.) and if it goes away, then I wouldn't worry about it. But if he still has a limp,  then the next day, I would arrange something with the vet. (Just get a checkup, and see what he has to say) Well I hope it helps! Good luck! :)|`|bxlYleZkaa	Have a good look at the cats pawpads and the fur in between. It is likely one of the pads is cut or maybe a thorn or splinter is lodged between the pads. A good indication that the pad is hurt, rather than the leg itself would be if the cat was reluctant to allow you to look at it.|`|VMY7No0eaa	feel the leg... see if you can feel an obvious break or if the cat tries to bite you.    If it is obvious then take him now ...   if not you can watch him and see if in a day or so it eases up.
d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	I know someone who brings their ferret to a nursing home to see the elders and it makes their day. Maybe before you go in, ask the nurse that anyone with diseases ferrets can catch ( pneumonia, sinus infections, the flu, etc.) don't come into contact with the ferret. I would also wash him when you get back home to get off anything bad- not soap, just (decently) hot water to kill the germs. Good luck!      EDIT: If he's just alone for an hour then he should be fine, but there's nothing wrong with bringing his buddy- maybe they can learn a few things too and pass the test some other time!|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	i think that if you ferret is well behaved and up to date on vaccines and dewormings, and you take the class, it would be good.  Just remember that ferrets get the flu.  (they are the lab model for influenzna--so if he is around people with the flu he could be at risk)|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Ferrets are susceptible to influenza strains, so if anyone in the nursing home is sick, the ferret could possibly pick it up.    As for stress illness--well, does he like meeting strangers?  Being handled by them (even inexperienced people)?  Does he mind loud noises or different voices?  Does he mind different smells (sometimes antiseptic, chemical, etc)?    If he is uncomfortable with even one of those things, I would suggest rethinking the idea.  But if he is a cuddly, laid back fella in any situation and is in great health, then I would say go for it.     Whether you bring the buddy along depends on how rambunctious they get when their together, but I really don't see a problem with it, personally.|`|SytfXV6Haa	It really depends on the personality of the ferrets you are considering to take in, if they're healthy and have whatever shots they need, and on the rules of the nursing home. You should probably first contact the nursing home you are considering to propose the idea and to find out if they have an animal visiting program and/or what their rules for this type of program include. Your ferret should be fine as long as it is healthy. Ferrets have been known to be great companions for those that need a friend.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Check with the nursing home administrator, althought for health, safety and liabilty reasons, I am not sure it would be advisable.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Don't see any problem with it and would be good idea .. as long as the nursing home allows it.  Check with them first.|`|9tzgiIwraa	Be sure he is vaccinated for rabies and distemper and then check with the administration at the nursing home. Some state laws require rabies vaccinated ferrets.
9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	do your best in high school. vet schools won't look at high school grades, but get as prepared for your undergraduate years, and good grades will help you get into a good undergraduate school.     undergrad years-most vet schools don't care what 4 year school you go to as long as you meet their prerequisites and challange yourself.  They also don't care what you major in.  Some schools want diversity so might think its cool if they took an art history major---but if you are going to be learning about animals--i think a biology related major is the most helpful.  Animal science is a really common major among prevet students.  Take alot of credits - more that just the bare minimum.  Grades are important.  If you don't have a state vet school aim for atleast a 3.6 gpa.  Vet schools like to see research-most undergrad schools have plenty of opportunity for undergrad research projects.  Also outside activities like prevet club, community projects look good.  You will need to have some vet expereince to be considered for admission.  Can be volunteer or paid.  The more species the better.  When you start college find an advisor that is used to helping out prevet students.    the following links may help:  aavmc.org  http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/colle...|`|44kEtDvIaa	Ive seen so many questions on this subject that a new article has been put into the Todays Pet site.

w1lh1INHaa	You can get some immediate relief by putting a little Metamucil on the food, or, give her a little milk (the lactose will soften the stool).    What kind of food are you feeding?  If dry, or primarily dry, I suspect that is the culprit, and it would behoove you to switch to a primarily wet food (no more than 25% of diet dry, if any at all).    You can also add a little Omega 3 to your cat's food, or a little olive oil.  While this won't really help the constipation now, it will help stools pass more easily in the future.    Now, if this continues even after a change in diet, or happens more than you would like, yes, take the cat to the vet for a fecal exam and a general blood work up to make sure there is nothing wrong to be causing this.|`|cCNj40fEaa	make sure your cat is drinking plenty of water!!    switch to canned (wet) food instead of dry food    cats are better with canned food than with dry food, canned food has more 'moisture' so that might help your cat's digestive system     here's a top list of brands you could buy for cat canned food, canned food seems more expensive, but your cat will benefit much more from wet food, and in the long term you'll save money from visits to the vet...    http://cats.about.com/od/catfoo1/tp/tpca...    also, you can add a little (1/2 spoon or less) of Extra Virgin Oil to your cat's canned food for 2 or 3 days until she's less constipated    good luck and hope your kitty feels better soon!|`|AA11887983	Definitely take her to the vet.  There may be a reason such as arthritis, or poor colonic motility that are causing those problems, and there are not over the counter treatments.  Plus, this is not normal, so you need to find out what is going on.     Please do not give any medications unless directed by your vet.  Plenty of medications are toxic to cats, and you don't know what is actually wrong with her.     Good Luck!|`|43eUq8hOaa	no cheese!!!!!

No such thing as a "hypo-allergenic" dog --- NONE, nada, nil ---- allergies are from dander - dander is from skin and saliva - all dogs have skin and saliva.    Get real folks - stop spreading myths and nonsense.    There is no difference between hair and fur - it is the same, whatever you call it dogs have - another bit of nonsense passed on ad infinitum.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Hypoallergenic is the term used for dogs that elicit the least response in a person allergic to dogs.   There are dogs with fur, and dogs with hair.  That said, some people are SO allergic to dogs that any dog will cause an allergic reaction.  Those persons must meet dogs on a dog-by-dog basis.      The two breeds you mentioned are not considered hypoallergenic because they have fur.  Dogs with hair are some terriers, bichon frise, poodles.  Some people are not allergic to the hairless version of the chinese crested.   Some people do well with Shih Tzus and Lhasa Apsos.  Again, all that depends on the degree of allergy.    The condition of the dogs' coat and skin will play a heavy role in a person's reaction to that dog.  A dog with dry, flaky skin is more apt to cause a reaction.  Therefore, feeding a dog a wholesome diet is very important.      All dog breeds and dogs of any age are easy to train using humane, positive methods.|`|I3foEBp2aa	I agree with Jeff.  There are no hypoallergenice dogs, all dogs have dander!  However, from my experience, people with allergies seem to do better with short-haired, low-shedding breeds (and remember: not all short-haired breeds are low-shedding!) and breeds that don't openly shed as much (those that you have to brush the shed hair out, like poodles).  These types of coats don't stop the dander from happening, but they help keep it to a minimum.  Also, keeping your dog and it's bedding clean makes a huge difference too!  Ask your breeder about how often you can wash your dog without drying out the coat and skin.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Depending on the severity of you allergies, after you purchase a dog and are submitted to it everyday, you slowly build a tolerance to the allergy and no longer are allergic to your dog.      So although those dogs do not exist, do not let it discourage you.

Allergists do recognize that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that "the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.    There are some listed on this site, and the benefits they can have to people who suffer from allergies.  But every person and every allergy are slightly different, so be aware, that depending on the severity of the allergy, a dog might not be an option    The Wikipedia site has a whole bunch of them listed and also explains why the dog breed seems to be better for allergies than some, check it out, but before purchasing one make sure you take your dad to meet one to see what kind of reaction he could have.

378b13982f38188afccdf2a26222cf1eaa	I understand on so many levels. I have a male eclectus named Jadan. He used to bite my and growl at me-still does, but I have some tips that will hopefully work for you.  It is good if she learns to bond with more than one person at an early age-especially if something bad happened God-forbid, she won't mind someone else caring for her.  I know this is hard, but when she bites, try not to react or make any sound. Any response is positive attention to them. Praise good behavior. If you notice her just resting on her perch or whatever the case may be, verbally compliment her, sing to her, etc. This will teach her that good behavior earns rewards and praise.  Whenever I would put my hand into Jadan's cage, he'd growl and bite if I asked him to step up. Finally I just put a medium towel around him(had to stand on a chair) and scooped him out and sat him on my lap. Eventually he stepped up and when she steps up onto your hand make a big deal, "Wow, good step up," or something to that extent.  Or you could try another perch instead of you hand and she may go for that and gradually get used to coming out to see you as a good thing. Jadan didn't like the perch but the towel worked well. If you use a towel try not to use one with a pattern because sometimes birds are afraid of them(patterns).  Maybe you could suggest to your mom that if she wants to spend time with her that you could do it with her?   Also, birds sense-like babies and other animals like dogs, they know when your scared or not confident in your actions. I learned this the hard way hehe.  If she bites you, tap lightly on the beak and say 'no' firmly but do not yell obviously.  Whenever she lets you kiss, pat, or touch her in any way, praise her with a healthy treat or verbal praise.  Sometimes birds just want to be left alone, especially if they are sleepy or cranky or moody, then it is ok to let them be. You can try several attempts in one day to get her out with you. ashleyjuliette22@hotmail.com if you need anything. Good luck.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Be glad she is getting along with different family members.  Controlling the bird and making it your bird is NOT the proper way to go!  Take time.  The little guy needs plenty of time to get used to you, his new family, and new home.  The nipping will stop after he learns to trust you.  Go at the bird's pace!!!  She may be bonding with your Mom more, just spend as much time as you can and make the bird happy!  Leave your feelings out of the equation!
SZOMVGBRaa	Fish tend to hover around the filter intakes and outputs looking for Fresh water when they die. Most fish get sucked up there when they die then. Goldfish are CRAZY messy fish and will foul the water so quick. Its most likely they are dieing from bad water conditions.     Ammonia and Nitrite needs to be 0 and the NitrAtes should be 10- 40 ppm. Any higher and a 50 % water change is need asap.     If you don't know what I'm talking about or don't own a test kit, that's the problem right there.  Good Luck|`|5072c885a0d43b66b964ac86a027351faa	Both good points.  first I would get a water testing kit, test for HP level, Nitrate levels and O2 levels- if they are ok, then try get your fish from a different place. the best places are friend which have excess fish in there tank|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	The filter is a dangerous place for a fish to be it is to strong and could hurt or kill them.

It is important to have a safe and healthy tank especially for goldfish because they are delicate.|`|cXK9sY1raa	How large is your tank?

okH04Nhlaa	My dog tibby used to be very hyper. She would be off the walls every day. one day, while feeding our horses, tibby jumped up on the hay bale and couldn't quite get to the top. I tried to catch her in time, but she fell about 5 feet off the hauling trailer. She lay on her back, while I knelt down beside her. I tried touching the front leg that was hurt, but she just cried in pain. Tibby was not the drama type of dog, so I knew something was terribly wrong. I gently massaged her shoulder, until I heard a pop. In a split second, she was jumping around plafully again. I felt so happy that I could help her. Looking back on this, it marked the beginning of my future of caring for animals. Sadly, tibby passed away last year, but she was just such a special dog and friend.|`|OCHM0Q7paa	Mine isn't so interesting but here you go!    My new puppy Elli is very bad with food and pretty much everything else. She is a black lab which as I assume you know are pretty fast and tough. She always sits with my mom on my porch and watches me leave for school on the bus. Every once in a while my mom lets go of her collar and she just sits and watches me with a loving smile. One day she sat without my mother holding onto her. As SOON as my mom turned her head Elli shot off the porch. Atleast 15 cars were stopped so she wouldn't be hit. I tried to grab her as she ran by but she was fast and not a normal sized lab (smaller). After a long attempt to catch my baby my mother caught her. She is way to intelligiant and I was worried to death. I know she loves me to death though. :D
b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	silky terriers  General Appearance  The Silky Terrier is a true "toy terrier". He is moderately low set, slightly longer than tall, of refined bone structure, but of sufficient substance to suggest the ability to hunt and kill domestic rodents. His coat is silky in texture, parted from the stop to the tail and presents a well groomed but not sculptured appearance. His inquisitive nature and joy of life make him an ideal companion.    Size, Proportion, Substance   Size  Shoulder height from nine to ten inches. Deviation in either direction is undesirable. Proportion  The body is about one fifth longer than the dog's height at the withers. Substance  Lightly built with strong but rather fine bone.    Head  The head is strong, wedge-shaped, and moderately long. Expression piercingly keen, eyes small, dark, almond shaped with dark rims. Light eyes are a serious fault. Ears are small, V-shaped, set high and carried erect without any tendency to flare obliquely off the skull. Skull flat, and not too wide between the ears. The skull is slightly longer than the muzzle. Stop shallow. The nose is black. Teeth strong and well aligned, scissors bite. An undershot or overshot bite is a serious fault.     Neck, Topline and Body   The neck fits gracefully into sloping shoulders. It is medium long, fine, and to some degree crested. The topline is level. A topline showing a roach or dip is a serious fault. Chest medium wide and deep enough to extend down to the elbows. The body is moderately low set and about one fifth longer than the dog's height at the withers. The body is measured from the point of the shoulder (or forechest) to the rearmost projection of the upper thigh (or point of the buttocks). A body which is too short is a fault, as is a body which is too long. The tail is docked, set high and carried at twelve to two o'clock position.     Forequarters   Well laid back shoulders, together with proper angulation at the upper arm, set the forelegs nicely under the body. Forelegs are strong, straight and rather fine-boned. Feet small, catlike, round, compact. Pads are thick and springy while nails are strong and dark colored. White or flesh-colored nails are a fault. The feet point straight ahead, with no turning in or out. Dewclaws, if any, are removed.    Hindquarters   Thighs well muscled and strong, but not so developed as to appear heavy. Well angulated stifles with low hocks which are parallel when viewed from behind. Feet as in front.    Coat   Straight, single, glossy, silky in texture. On matured specimens the coat falls below and follows the body outline. It should not approach floor length. On the top of the head, the hair is so profuse as to form a topknot, but long hair on the face and ears is objectionable. The hair is parted on the head and down over the back to the root of the tail. The tail is well coated but devoid of plume. Legs should have short hair from the pastern and hock joints to the feet. The feet should not be obscured by the leg furnishings.    Color   Blue and tan. The blue may be silver blue, pigeon blue or slate blue, the tan deep and rich. The blue extends from the base of the skull to the tip of the tail, down the forelegs to the elbows, and half way down the outside of the thighs. On the tail the blue should be very dark. Tan appears on muzzle and cheeks, around the base of the ears, on the legs and feet and around the vent. The topknot should be silver or fawn which is lighter than the tan points.    Gait   Should be free, light-footed, lively and straightforward. Hindquarters should have strong propelling power. Toeing in or out is to be faulted.    Temperament   The keenly alert air of the terrier is characteristic, with shyness or excessive nervousness to be faulted. The manner is quick, friendly, responsive.    YORKIES:  General Appearance  That of a long-haired toy terrier whose blue and tan coat is parted on the face and from the base of the skull to the end of the tail and hangs evenly and quite straight down each side of body. The body is neat, compact and well proportioned. The dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.    Head   Small and rather flat on top, the skull not too prominent or round, the muzzle not too long, with the bite neither undershot nor overshot and teeth sound. Either scissors bite or level bite is acceptable. The nose is black. Eyes are medium in size and not too prominent; dark in color and sparkling with a sharp, intelligent expression. Eye rims are dark. Ears are small, V-shaped, carried erect and set not too far apart.    Body  Well proportioned and very compact. The back is rather short, the back line level, with height at shoulder the same as at the rump.    Legs and Feet   Forelegs should be straight, elbows neither in nor out. Hind legs straight when viewed from behind, but stifles are moderately bent when viewed from the sides. Feet are round with black toenails. Dewclaws, if any, are generally removed from the hind legs. Dewclaws on the forelegs may be removed.    Tail   Docked to a medium length and carried slightly higher than the level of the back.    Coat   Quality, texture and quantity of coat are of prime importance. Hair is glossy, fine and silky in texture. Coat on the body is moderately long and perfectly straight (not wavy). It may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance, if desired. The fall on the head is long, tied with one bow in center of head or parted in the middle and tied with two bows. Hair on muzzle is very long. Hair should be trimmed short on tips of ears and may be trimmed on feet to give them a neat appearance.    Colors   Puppies are born black and tan and are normally darker in body color, showin|`|Rva0ocMOaa	The Difference is that they are two Different breeds!

I have seen plenty of yorkies that are larger & with the thinner less coat similar to a silky.  Right now there are huge differences in the qualities in yorkies since they are so overbred. I groom 2lb to 40lb yorkies with every type of coat imaginable.
zeTGmB3faa	When he got in the fight, he was either scratched or bitten and this has caused an abscess. These can be dangerous if not treated, Take him to the vet. The abscess may open on it's own or the vet may lance it. He will be given antibiotics to stop the infection so it does not spread through his blood stream.|`|KpNaPyiZaa	you should definately take him to the vet. It could be an infection from the fight. It probably isnt a tumor, beucase I don't think that they can appear that quickly. It might be an abcess of puss or something.|`|UF5ZwzHCaa	Take your cat to the vet.  If it is from the cut, the lump is an abscess.  It may feel like there is liquid inside the lump.  The liquid can build up very quickly.  The vet will cut the lump open, clean the wound, and the cat will be put on antibiotics.     If this ever happen again, clean the wound, or take it to a vet to do this.    Good luck to you and your kitty.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Your cat might have gotten an infection under the scab.  Sometimes if the wound is not cleaned out properly, a scab will form but will form and infection/abscess under it.  An abscess can come up pretty quickly.      Where do you live?  There seems to be a horrible wolf worm infestation going on south of the Mason-Dixon Line, and the fly that lays the eggs that turn into the worms (which are actually larvae) is attracted to an open wound.    For your cat's benefit, and your peace of mind, take your cat to the vet tomorrow.  There, the vet can determine what the problem is, and your cat can be treated.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Maybe the other cat had rabies and infected your cat or maybe the other cat broke your cats leg. It's good you are taking it to a vet. Good Luck and I hope it's nothing serious.|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	OMG go to the vet it could be a affect from the scratch but if it just happened that is not likely. An old cat can get affected by things easily it can get a disease from a little thing just as a scratch which is not good. Tell a vet and take good care of him do not let him out anymore do not risk his health anymore.|`|NUOSS6kcaa	im not sure - take him to the vet...it might be an infection.  good luck!
43eUq8hOaa	r u sure it is a male? I have had 106 cats total and the only ones that do that r females in heat.|`|flH8hNf2aa	when i was little and first got my cats i did a lot of research and from what i remember its part of how they say hi. like how dogs always sniff each others butts.     but i agree that it could be part of its scent marking you. there is a scent gland right at the base of the tail on top of there butt.     with out seeing what you are talking about its hard to tell which it is|`|zeTGmB3faa	Some would call this marking his scent on you. I personally just think it is a sign of affection for his good friend.
blIUbMzaaa	If you used a water based paint, then 24 hours should be okay if you use fans to clear the fumes, but 48 hours would be better, just to be sure.  If you used an oil based paint, I would wait at least 48 - 72 hours.|`|O70uR8FRaa	Wait a week, keep the room airy , open windows and keep your birds in the kitchen or room with lots of windows *but if it is cold do not let them catch a chill.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Open the windows and exhuast the fumes outside.  Give it a good day, then they should be fine.  NEED to move the air in there though, and vent to outside!
f8t4FQZ5aa	Your dragon is laying infertile eggs. Females that have never even been in contact with a male can still lay but of course they will not develop. The other possibility is that she has been with a male in the past (they can retain sperm for  roughly a year) but either she or the male are infertile. Our observations have been that dragons carrying infertile eggs may not excessively display the behaviours normally associated with laying.|`|fQeS0qWWaa	sorry i do not know maybe go to a doctor
nmEquxagaa	Once upon a time, I would have been horrified and judgemental. That was before some bad things happened to my foster kitties. All of the bad things were the result of accidents or ignorance. In some ways, animals are wiser than we are. They know humans make plenty of mistakes. God will know if you are sorry and will be able to forgive you. Assuming you and your cat had love for each other before this happened, he will be waiting for you when you get to the Rainbow Bridge.     If you're not ready to tell your parents, please, Please, PLEASE consider talking to a counselor or therapist. Maybe you can figure out a way to honor your cat's life instead of focusing on his death? Some options may include adopting a homeless pet, making a donation to a local rescue organization, or volunteering to help at an animal shelter. You sound sincerely regretful. Your cat wouldn't want you to be grief-stricken.     P.S. One thing that most people on Earth don't know is that some people get to Heaven before their pets make it to the Rainbow Bridge. Your cat is a companion to someone who is waiting for their cat to finish out it's life.|`|NJqH1PCNaa	it was an accident, beaner|`|mQhYZk2eaa	tell your parents u will feeel much better...do not blame it on yourself...if u r really sorry God will forgive u :)|`|isPCwnNzaa	Just tell them. I can tell you feel awful! Of course God will forgive you. It was an accident.    Good luck!|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	You killed your cat by giving him a heart attack. He won't forgive you because you killed him. God might forgive you but you killed an animal. You will never ever see your cat again.|`|CoqYFcYuaa	If you knew your cat had heart problems, even if you didnt know how serious it was, you should of never have horsed around with your cat, because even the tinyest thing can cause a heart attack, which most likely would be the cause of death , or something simular. Just have faith that your cats spirit is with you right now, and that God will forgive you if you tell the truth to your parents what really happened, and you will be reunited with your cat, that is, if your cat wants to.|`|Hbgje6fRaa	I know cats can die very suddenly from heart problems and most of the time without warning. My friend came home from work one day to find her cat dead in the living room from a heart defect. It's best to not cause any added anxiety to animal with heart problems, but you shouldn't stay so hard on yourself since you obviously weren't intending that to happen. Animals are very forgiving and so is God. I'm sure your cat would be very excited if he were to see you again.|`|zeTGmB3faa	You were playing with him as usual and something happened. The cup may have startled him or it may just be a coincidence. Beating yourself over the head will do no good. You don't even know if you had anything to do with it. From what you describe, it doesn't seem like it. You were good to your cat and loved him. He had a good life and enjoyed your company.   His heart was weak and this you could do nothing about. Just because he was "frightened" by the cup, it would not cause a heart attack. Assume it was coincidental. God and all we love, are always with us, don't forget that. Best wishes.|`|43eUq8hOaa	sweetie,i kno0w that u didn't mean to,but you suffucated your cat.Mine have died that way by getting into the trash and getting their heads stuck.The only thing that u can do is to move on and forgive yourself.And,most important---don't do something like that again-k-? Just strive to do different.Get yourself a new kitty and love & spoil it--Don't just play around. You will b ok.Good Luck|`|g2KhN4rzaa	I think telling ur parents will get a load off ur chest, and make u feel better about what happened. I'm sure god will forgive u.|`|KpNaPyiZaa	i am an animal lover, and it doesnt seem like you killed him. It seems like a coincidence that the accident happened and it died when you put a cup over his head. It doesnt seem like you killed him, probably the heart problems did. Don't feel bad. if it keeps bugging you, you should talk to your parents.|`|0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	hmm... u did make a mistake... but since it was unintentional u may have an excuse...u can tell ur parents... and maybe they can understand... if u really didnt mean any bad intention, God will forgive u... and idk if humans get reunited with their pets... lol
6Qjkx15laa	Just make sure they get along ok at the shelter.  If they are not at the same shelter, ask one shelter if you can bring the cat back if the cats don't warm up to each other in one week.|`|44kEtDvIaa	If I liked cats and didn't have a problem, or restriction where I live, to having more than one pet ... a pair of cats would not be a problem.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	if i was looking for a couple of cats to give a loving home i would b more than happy to adopt
D1beU6MPaa	They are great little dogs. I have three of them. They are reasonably intelligent, and not particularly yappy.. They do require grooming and sometimes the breed is prone to skin problems. That does not mean that they all have problems, but some do. They make great companions and get along with other dogs. All of mine are males and they all get along great. Here is a picture of my three    http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii301...|`|Ei85kgfdaa	http://www.americanshihtzuclub.org/    click on the 'about the breed' on the left.|`|NDHiLwaLaa	Shih-Tzu's are playful, devoted and are great lap dogs. They are not really that intelligent when it comes to training because of their free-spirited and aloof personalities. On the plus side, they love to play and be held and cuddled. Also, they can get along with strangers and younger kids if you socialize them very early! They need lots of grooming to keep their coat mat free and they are not very yappy. They are a very low energy breed so they do not need much energy. I would suggest searching petfinder.com for a list of your local shelters that have shih-tzu's or buying from a responsible and reputable breeder. Do not buy from a pet store because their puppies come from puppy mills. I wish you the best of luck with your new puppy! (:|`|FFuJ08vhaa	I have 4 shitz tu's and each one has a very different personality  THey are like small children, Dont let what you read on the web describe a dog.  You have to get to know them, see them at an early age to see how they will grow up.. There parents will have no impact on how the pups will turn out.  My momma dog is very outgoing, friendly to everyone, while one of her daughters is shy, barks a lot and only likes bing around us.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Not too yappy but not too bright either. They actually score very low on the intelligence test but they are very loyal and good lap dogs. I hear they take a long time to train because they aren't that good at learning comands but sometimes I do hear of some that are smart as a whip.|`|Hbgje6fRaa	I have a female shih tzu and male cocker spaniel. My shih tzu is very sweet, affectionate and quite entertaining! It took a long time to housebreak her, but she was already 2 years old and was found as a stray. She's definitely worth it, tho!
b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	after she has weaned the pups and gotten back into healthy weight|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Most vets who are responsible recommend about 3 months tops as she has to have to feed the babies and be weaned and then recover so on the safe side that is why vets who l trust go for this time frame.Up to you who you wish to believe
ndrtHVKzaa	Yes, when they feel horny :P|`|bDPVRtCNaa	How big is your tank? Odds are it is not big enough.    The red spots could be due to high ammonia levels in your water. Never clean out the entire tank, it makes matters much worse by removing all the bacteria that breaks down fish waste.    Your niece won common goldfish from the carnival. Two require about 75 gallons with double the filtration. They do not spawn until they reach sexual maturity at about one year of age at which time they should be at least six inches long.     You should not house fancy goldfish and common goldfish together. The quicker commons will stress the fancies. Fancy goldfish and common goldfish share the same scientific name Carassius auratus. Fancy goldfish are mutations of the common goldfish.  That is a carp- http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_S7-_JVDT_qM/Rc... Goldfish are distantly related to carp.    ~Your tank is severely overstocked. A 25 gallon is barely large enough to house two fancy goldfish. Try to find a pond for the commons.    ~How is a local fish store weird? Most areas have them. I have three that I know of that deal solely with fish.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	What do you mean when you say clean the tank ?  Your not doing something stupid like taking out all the water and scrubbing out the insides are you ? Cus that will cause the tank to re-cycle every time you do that and that would cause the cloudy water. Also causes of cloudy water are over feeding and not enough Oxygen in the water. It will smell like rotten eggs is your tanks isn't getting enough oxygen or the water is fouled. Goldfish produce too much waste to be kept in anything smaller than 20 gallon tanks. Then you need to have a filter rated for a 40 gallon and do 30 % water changes weekly. 50 % a week is a little much but may be a good thing.     I don't have the time but just goggle fish tank cycle and goldfish care and see if you can't learn a little more about the whole process. You need to go back to fish keeping boot camp lol. Good Luck    O ya and goldfish wn't breed untill they reach about 6 inchs for the fan tails and the commons need to be more around 10 inchs so I doubt you will ever have them long enough to see them breed.
QVP8zSuWaa	Of course! I come up with new nick names all the time, mine probably have about 10 names a piece. But when I call them by their real name they sit up and take notice|`|81sucrAEaa	yes you can do whatever i want|`|07e0cb88644693b5568498c78db082e5aa	Sure name him what you want.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	He'll respond to the new name after a bit.  I've re-named cats/dogs before.|`|4d39e7dd6b413fbd46444cffe2149c0baa	Yes, but if you are still together with your boyfriend, ask him also if it's okay. But since you're the one cleaning up after him, do what you want. :-)|`|jsD8WaQbaa	Yeah, sure. He's not going to care. I've heard that if you call him by both names for a while-- "Touille Indiana!" and then gradually drop down to just Indiana, they adjust just fine.|`|6fiMD6WOaa	yeah sure|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I did.  A dog come to me through a rescue place & his name was Diego & I didn't want him to have a  Mexican name so I kept it simple & chose DD (Da Dawg)    Some times it take me forever to find the right name for one of my dogs.    Yeah, you can rename him.  One had two names & he answered to either one.  Chester James  -- CJ.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	A new name will not be a problem at all.      My dogs respond to all sorts of nicknames!    Just start using the name a lot, especially when you're feeding the dog, or about to take him for a walk - associate it with positive things.  I always say my dogs' names as I put their food bowl down - that helps a lot.    Don't confuse him by expecting him to come to you just when you just call the new name - that will take time.|`|XdJKParRaa	It's fine but not that necessary.|`|7d8eb4542c3cfcc18c18ecad61242b51aa	no w/e just keep the name or do a nickname like Tou|`|xEyyFrPhaa	yes you can, i bought a 18 month mini long haired dachshund last september and his name was boo boo, but i called him dai bach and he took to his new name straight away.|`|R0o5rvpGaa	He's your dog... you can do what you want|`|xGWZ5DfIaa	its ur dog but i would cuz its used to its name and i dont want to get it confused|`|igGDiiczaa	sure escpecially in ur case|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Sure but it will take a while before dog completely learns the new name. My dogs are adopted & either didn't know their old names or changed them except for one. Btw - I have a JR Ewing !!  fits him perfectly!!|`|agh18eT2aa	Yes, my dog was a rescue.  She was picked up by a foster home and her name was changed because they did not know her former name.  I hated the name they gave her, so when I adopted her four months later, I changed it yet again. So she has had at least three names in her life.  She responds to her new name after six months because I use it hundreds of times a day, so she knows it now.  Do what you like.  The dog probably wouldn't like that name either.|`|qS2ugtlNaa	yes|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Hi Diana, I mean Susie, I mean Clementine, I mean, Bertha- what is your name this year anyway?  You can change his, but why?  This could confuse the dog.  Don't confuse him just because you dumped your boyfriend!
OyNJTWaiaa	The paper is not a good idea whenever you have female budgies as they can get an idea to nest and lay eggs. Better sheet paper, than any kind that resembles nesting materials to a budgie. You didnt say what exactly the other bird in the cage is...male ? female ?  As most people on yahoo call budgies parakeets where actually a parakeet can be any number of half a dozen other kinds of birds.  Do you have two budgies or a budgie and another type of parakeet ?|`|1gDTiPVyaa	I had one who was a bottom-sitter too.  She was just a low-key, quiet little thing. Some are like that.    Good for you for taking her to the vet, though! It's always best to be sure.|`|ObKqyZ7haa	no, some birds like the bottom of the cage.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	is she still active at the bottom of the cage.  She may be getting ready for eggs.  I had a female and male together once.  Before i realized it was egg laying behavior---- I noticed my female was spending alot of time at the bottom of the cage, shredding the paper towels i used as cage liners.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Great for you for taking it to the vet!  If he says there is nothing medically wrong, your bird may just like it there.  Also, could be ready to start nesting.  My tiel paces on the bottom when he is upset about not being let out.|`|WebaFPgsaa	as far as I know, there is two answers  1. Her wing is hurt.  2.she just enjoys it down there.    I've had this situation before. My canary always used to saty at the bottem and eat from the bottem, sometimes for weeks. But it eventually just went up the cage again. It actually just enjoyed being down there! Another time, my finch hurt her wing (don't know how) and she stayed at the bottem till this day. She still eats and is healthy and she is now starting to fly to her nest at the top. It has been at least two-three weeks. Good luck:)|`|O70uR8FRaa	I would reccomend 2 things. A 2nd opinion from another vet (especially an avian vet) And 2 get a seperate cage, with a better perch . Good luck
8owlj2xHaa	Most likely no. He may eat some of it, but will never be able to eat the root of the problem. Never try to solve problems with livestock.   If it is just on one rock, take the rock out and manually remove the hair. Scrub it off with a brush if you need to. If the algae returns. put in a bucket of salt water with a power head and put a lid on the bucket. Keep in there in the dark until the algae is dead.|`|07lCZh28aa	The Lawnmower Blenny, a.k.a. Algae Blenny, is a very popular algae eating blenny. These fish have a long slender body with a long dorsal fin that extends the length of their body. They are usually tan and white in color and love to perch on rockwork. The Lawnmower is aptly named for its ability to mow down hair algae. These fish have tons of personality. They make an excellent addition to any reef tank. They should be offered algae sheets on a regular basis if regular algae growth is not available.      These fish have blunt heads and their teeth are combed, giving them the ability to scrape algae -- their primary food source -- from rock surfaces.|`|RXYZb6bsaa	some will some wont, mine didnt.  the only garunteed species to eat hair algae is a seahare
u3Hdoeiqaa	Yes - I work with guinea pigs and hae had to pair or group up lots of unfamiliar animals. It usually works fine if you do it properly, and know what to expect!    Firstly, contrary to popular belief males can be introduced - although they are more difficult than females (more chance of fighting, need more space etc).  Females are usually easy - I've never had any major problems.    Firstly, you need to make sure you have enough space for multiple pugs - this is even more important when introducing unfamiliar ones. Too small cages is probably the most common cause of fighting. A cage for two sows should be at least 7.5 sq feet, but the bigger the better. Males usually need more (at least 10.5 sq feet).    Secondly, you need to prevent them becoming territorial or competitive. You do this by making everything "neutral".  (If you just put a new pig in with an existing pig they will fight, because the first pig is defending its territory from the intruder!)    So, firstly, you introduce on completely neutral territory - eg on the bed or floor.   If this goes ok, you can put them in a cage together. This should be a completely new cage if possible (as this way it is 100% neutral territory), otherwise you must thoroughly clean the whole cage (inc the bars etc) so it doesn't smell like your first pig.    To prevent any competitive fighting, it helps to have at least two hideys so they can get away from eachother. Hideys with more than one entrance are best if possible, so one pig can't corner the other. If you do have problems, it can also help to have two food bowls, two water bottles etc to start with (especially with boys).    A common mistake is trying to introduce pigs gradually, over a number of meetings. This generally makes things worse rather than better, as every time they meet they have to re-establish dominance, so it looks like they keep fighting.    This is the next problem - most people don't know the difference between normal guinea pig dominance behaviour, and true fighting.    When you introduce new guinea pigs you should expect them to squabble to establish dominance. This can include chasing, squeeking, mounting, nose-butting and rumble-strutting (they walk funny and sort of purr). This is completely normal - just leave them to sort themselves out and they will settle down once they have decided who is boss. (Just make sure both have access to food and water).    Real fighting will be far more serious - literally going at eachother. The ONLY time you need to seperate is if they have a proper fight and actually draw blood.    Hope this helps!  (And please adopt!)|`|M06c7GU6aa	Noo, the first answerer is completely wrong about boars - I should know, I have four of them.    Only one of them seems to be one of them rare loner pigs (Which has nothing to do with him being a boar). ALL pigs are social. Boars need buddy boars just as much. However, they are more likely to get into "squabbles", so the more space the better. I have a trio of boars right now, all different ages, different litters, which I all got at different times.    The best thing to increase their chances of getting along, and making the squabbles happen less is SPACE. One pig alone requires 7.5 sq ft. With boars especially, the MORE SPACE THE BETTER! Two pigs need at least 10.5 sq ft as well. Check out these websites for more imformation:  http://guineapigcages.com/cubes.htm  http://guineapigcages.com/howto.htm  http://guineapigcages.com/types.htm      Lastly I do not recommend "buying" a guinea pig, there are plenty out there in shelters, and in fact a reputable shelter will help you even match out a perfect buddy for your current piggy. Not that you take any chances, and they end up not getting along.|`|4M3fHMciaa	I got my male piggy a female friend and they immediately hit it off. When she had babies (they weren't his, we were lied to as she was pregnant when we got her) we socialized them with our male and even they get on fantastically.     But I know this doesn't always happen. Some guinea pigs just don't hit it off just like some people don't mesh.  If you get another one though you have to be prepared to take care of it separately if they do not get along.|`|D08wOiW9aa	I had a female guinea pig and adopted another one a year later. They got along terrifically. Males will probably not be so accepting unless they were in the same litter or were in close proximity at birth.

I agree with Kristin.     Anything that isn't registered and looks like a pit bull, is automatically a pit bull in there eyes. They actually have taken away Labs because they "look like" pit bulls. I would reccomend you have proof that the dog is an Am.

The Johnson type is a larger dog with a shorter muzzle than the Scott type. However, many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types. In general, American Bulldogs weigh between 27 to 57 kg (60 to 125 lb) and are 52 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) at the withers but have been known to greatly exceed that. The Johnson type is often confused with the "white" Boxer due to the strong resemblance between the two breeds.    Either way, whatever breed you get make sure that you are prepared to be a responcible dog owner of a high energy dog that can get aggressive if they are not worked and challenged enough (but as a dobie owner, im sure you already know what high energy truely means, lol)    This breed tolerates children and can do well with them, provided they are socialized or obedience trained early to expose them to other dogs and people in order to ensure that they can be controlled around company as they mature. This can be done in the simplest of ways by walking them regularly in a local park where they can meet other people and dogs. If properly socialized, this breed can become a great family pet and guard dog but has a very strong prey drive.    They are working dogs with high energy drives, and so American Bulldogs do best in a home with a large backyard and plenty of exercise. They can sometimes be wary towards cats and smaller pets, but the correct socialization at an early age can greatly increase the chances of them accepting these animals.    They are truely wonderful, and stunning animals!!  Good Luck!!    ** Okay, apparently people didn't like my answer.. which is fine, but i'd liketo add that you can get genetic testing done when its a pup if you decide thats thedog you want to get, and then you would have papers to prove it.  And seriously?? people in the UK can't tell the difference, thats interesting to me  **
enC9TvxUaa	- Do you use a crate?  this would allow for your Mom to do her things and leave the puppy in there for periods of time.  Sorry, but if they say she has to go back, then you will need to respect that and be happy you have loving parents!|`|AA11992723	This is the most demanding time in your dogs life until he is a senior. and in a few months he's going to be demanding alot of exercise time. dogs need a walk every single day.     it's a shame you didnt get him during the summer so you'd be home from school. if you can't keep this puppy, the summer will be a better time.    Your mom has to take an 8 week pup out every 2-3 hours to potty. ONLY when your mom can not watch him should he be in a crate, but he still has to go out every 2-3 hours for potty or he will soil the crate and himself.    she can tether the puppy to her waste or confine him to the kitchen only. does this pup have any toys? what is the work your mom is saying is too much exactly?    at 4-6 months vets vaccinate with rabies. after that and after he's neutered (PLEASE NEUTER for the sake of your dog and all dogs) you can take him to puppy obedience classes. you and your mom can learn easy techniques to having a calmer and obedient dog.    Also here is a free new puppy info and training book you can read online:  http://www.dogstardaily.com/files/AFTER%...    Show that to your parents. and remember the weekends are for you to give 100% to your puppy. no going to friends houses yet. no playing sports. you have to take care of the puppy or give him up.    ALSO take your puppy to the vet! Take off the flea collar and stop the flea powder! those are toxic and don't do any good for fleas!!! Your puppy needs monthly heartworm pills and flea/tick prevention! he needs dewormings and needs to be checked for heartworm!! see the vet!|`|agh18eT2aa	Go to pet store, get the pheremone stuff for dogs that smells like a lactating mother dog.  Plug it in near your puppy's crate.  You can also get this herbal supplement that calms your dog.  Ask you vet how much is a puppy dose.  Dog dose might be too much.  And keep something with your smell on it in the crate (I assume the puppy has a crate to use as his den to make him feel safe).  If there is no crate, do that NOW.  I can't stress that enough.  Dogs have to have a safe haven.  A crate is the best.|`|JYsV0KfKaa	beagles are hard work to train.  if your mom isn't going to have the patience to train him you should probably let him go.|`|OCHM0Q7paa	Buy it lots of toys and buy a fairly large cage.

Its hard in the begining and does require lots of work to train, but luckily the puppies learn with time. Its all you need, time and patience and lots of care. An 8wk puppy is like a newborn baby, he needs attention, and if he cries its because he wants to be with people. If you and your sister are at school, make it a point and a routine to spend time with your new puppy when you get home. All members have to be willing to take this new task in training a puppy. You'll see in a few weeks its going to be a routine. Don't leave all the work to your mom, come home and take the puppy and take him off her hands, play and train your puppy, right now its crucial to keep an eye on him 24/7 this is gonna take weeks and sometimes months so don't give up keep working with him. He's a member of the family now and with patience and love you'll get through it.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Seems like he's bein a normal puppy but your mother isn't willing to put in the work involved in a puppy. Heck puppies are less work than babies. They are reliably trained in about 7-10 months. Humans can take 10 years. They don't have to be carried everywhere unlike humans babies and you don't have to hand feed a puppy unlike human babies hat need bottles! So, if she took care you guys she can handle a puppy. Also, beagles are known to be noisy. Ya'll should've did your research. If you do take him back get a puppy that isn't known to be noisy. I've had Yorkies, Yorkie/Maltese and Pomeranians and after the first week they've all been quiet. Also, you've had him for what 4 days or a week? He doesn't know the routine and you just took him from his mother? Of course he is going to cry.|`|UECCsRKvaa	My aunt has a beagle and she cries a lot, so I know how your mom feels! All you have to do is tell her "No" whenever she howls or cries, don't make it too firm, just make it so she understands. If it doesn't work when you tell her, just tap her on the nose. (Puppies like to be comforted, too, so tell your mom to try picking her up and cuddling her. Just make her feel loved! :) )
AA11484393	Are you using the same old litter box and litter you used before?  Cat's don't like change and if you changed that as well as moving that could be your problem.  Is she peeing very frequently and all over?  If so it could be a urinary tract infection.    If none of this is true, then you just have to work with her.  Bring her down to the box several times a day.  Have her sit in there and give her treats.  Let her jump in and out some.  Also if you make scratching movements with her front foot it will help her get the idea.  Also, if she poops anywhere outside of the box, put it inside the box and let her see it.  This should do ok to help her get used to it again!|`|3arJsZ91aa	Have you had her checked for a urine infection?  The stress of moving might have upset her.

gjD8pndjaa	The genes for Collie Eye Anomily (CEA- a common eye problem in Collies) and PRA are a recessive trait.    Dogs can either be positive for the disease (CC), carriers without the disease (Cc) or non-carriers (cc).    A non carrier will not be able to pass on the disease to the offspring|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	It means they do not carry the recessive gene complex that produces Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) and cataracts.  Approx 60% of collies have some sort of visual defect, so a noncarrier dog would be worth every penny you spend on him.   It's tragic to have a super intelligent, loyal, and beautiful dog go blind on you from genetic degeneration.  This puppy sounds like a keeper!  Please post pictures when you do get your new family member!    Merle is a whole different issue.  It's only a problem when the dog gets two copies of the merle gene, one from each parent. That's when you get mostly white coats,  eyes with all kinds of developmental defects, and hearing impairment.  A normal merle, one with only one copy of the gene, is perfectly sound even if his eyes are blue.    Added:  Since your breeder is really on top of things, ask if they test for the MDR1 mutation.  This is the gene that makes collies so sensitive to common drugs.  It's rampant in the breed. The testing kit comes from the University of Washington.  They can tell if the dog is normal (no copies of the gene), sensitive (one copy), or ultra sensitive (two copies).  Ivermectin is one of the biggest offenders in toxicity; make sure your new friend gets Interceptor for heartworms instead of Heartguard.  Yes, the dosage is supposedly low enough not to cause problems, but why take a chance?|`|qS2ugtlNaa	none|`|HKoo2PfYaa	Bailey,    As far as I know, this is what you want - a non-carrier collie.  Apparently collie's can have problems with their eyes and it is inherited from the parents.    A non-carrier is a normal eyed collie who possesses, or carries no affected genes. He therefore cannot produce anything but normal eyed collies.    Hope this helps and congrats on getting a puppy!|`|CPxmHjx4aa	some collies have a gene that causes a blue coloring in the eye..  i had a blue merle collie and one of his eyes had blue in it (he wasnt blind though)|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Collies including borders have hereditary diseases and one only is called 'collie eye',They have far more problems then this so make sure the Breeder has COMPLETE clear certificates not only for eyes but HD and everything else.GO to the AKC website and look up collies and see what they can carry as hereditary diseases you may have an unpleasant shock.One test for collie EYE is not enough by the way|`|I3foEBp2aa	A carrier is an animal that carries the genes for a certain health problem.  If a breed is prone to, say, PRA (progressive retinal atrophy), and the breeder knows that none of the dogs on either side of the pup's pedigree have ever been diagnosed with PRA, then he might say that his pups are non-carriers for PRA.    Sounds like this breeder probably does health testing, so do a little homework, find out what health problems are normally associated with the breed, and ask about those as well.  He should be able to put your mind at ease about all of them, or, if he's honest, let you know if there's a possibility of any of them being in his lines.  (Remember: NO lines are completely free of problems!)    Have fun with your new puppy!|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Collies are notorious for eye problems, specifically Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA).  15 or so years ago it was virtually impossible to find a non-affected Collie.  But responsible breeders have done a lot of selective breeding and are slowly getting a handle on the problem within the breed.    A "non carrier" means that the dog does not carry the gene for PRA.  And "normal eyed' means that they don't have it.  This is a good thing.  :-)    It sounds like you're dealing with a good breeder here.  I commend you.|`|RecUV33Daa	it probably means that they aren't Merle colouring and don't carry the gene for it, therefore having brown eyes.

AA11887983	Some medical conditions, such as allergies, skin infections or hypothyroidism can cause the skin to have an imbalance of oil and an unpleasant odor. Golden retrievers are prone to some of these things.  When you go to the vet, make sure to discuss it.      You can also check to make sure her ears or not infected, that she does not have really severe periodontal disease, or that her anal glands are what is causing the smell.      As for shampoos, you can actually sometimes worsen some conditions with too much bathing, so keep that in mind.  But you may want to try a soap-free shampoo like *efa HyLyt.  It should not worsen a skin condition, and it is gentle enough for frequent use.  It is a veterinary product but you can get it in PetSmart stores, usually.     Good luck, and make sure you check with your vet.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	That doesn't sound normal. I own 3 dogs (including a Golden) and none of them smell bad.

The first would be ear infections.  Most of them are caused by food allergies.      Poor quality food will also, actually, make your dog smell.  The dog 'off gasses' the chemicals and undigestible portions of food that it eats.  Find a food without corn, wheat or soy, and one that is lamb-based.  It will take some months for your dog to smell sweet, but I know it will happen.      Make sure your vet or groomer expresses her anal glands also.|`|HKoo2PfYaa	Nice Avatar :)    Dogs have glands that secrete oil into their hairs. When it gets wet on dogs it get extra stinky.

Owners can learn to do the clip with the right tools & instructions.  But it goes much faster & is less stress on the dog if you take it to a groomer every 4 to 6 weeks depending on the length of the coat.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	l breed standards and most pet  people in summer like to have them clipped shorter than their usual coat..It does not harm them but the more it is clipped the softer the coat is when it grows back so if you do  not mind this as it is a pet that is fine.l am lucky l breed standards with what is called a natural coat so my puppy people or people who have my dogs do not clip even in summer as all they do is pull out every few weeks a few of the longer hairs and it looks like a show dog except for the extra things we do for the show ring.Given you are in Florida,l would advise a clip is necessary as they have a double coat and it is too humid and hot in summer there.Ask your groomer not to clip right back but leave about not more than a quarter of an inch all over except to clip the ears,bum,throat.They have all the blades to do this but they will try and convince you to have a full clip with no hair do not go for it.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	*shrugs*    It is pretty much what your opinion is.

I have had schnauzer's for years and have never given them the schnauzer cut.  I just shave them down every spring and keep them cut short until fall.

(It's more common to males than females, and almost always involves urination; dogs rarely mark with feces.) Your dog uses this tactic to say, "This is my turf." The trigger can be anything from the arrival of a baby to the acquisition of a new vacuum cleaner. Sometimes, simply noticing a squirrel zip through the backyard is enough to prompt marking behavior. While excitement or fear can also stimulate your dog to deliberately urinate, the most common explanation is that he's just identifying his territory.    check out this link on how to resolve this canine problem. goodluck!  http://dogtime.com/marking-housesoiling....|`|Tsjy6fu2aa	A dog who urinates when he's excited does not do so intentionally - it's an involuntary action that's beyond his control. Therefore, a dog's excitement urination problem is not a traditional behavioral problem like housebreaking where the dog can be trained to stop urinating at a certain time and place.    The key to resolving a dog's tendency to urinate when excited involves lessening the amount of extreme excitement that the dog experiences through changes in human habits and through boosting the dog's confidence level.    Boost the Dog's Confidence Level    A dog who is confident will be better equipped to regulate his emotional state. Confidence in a dog helps him to remain mentally stable, without the extreme fluctuations in mood that are seen in dogs who lack confidence. Dogs who lack confidence tend to rely on humans for happiness and a sense of well-being, so when the dog's human family members are not present, the dog's mood dips into feelings of anxiety and unhappiness. A confident dog will have a more stable mood and he'll be less apt to become incontinent when excited.    The most effective way to increase a dog's confidence level is through training. Obedience training provides the dog with an opportunity to interact with the owner in a positive way where the dog learns a command and then receives a reward for performing the command. Three or four ten-minute training sessions per day are the simplest and most effective ways to improve a dog's confidence.    Notably, improving a dog's confidence level will also help to resolve issues stemming from submission. Submissive urination is a separate, but related problem and many dogs who urinate as an act of submission will also urinate when excited.     Make Exciting Events Less Exciting    Greetings are the most common time for excitement urination. Therefore, family members and guests must work to make the greetings less remarkable for the dog.    When returning home, verbally acknowledge the dog in a calm voice, but avoid physical contact. Physical contact such as petting during a greeting can send a dog's excitement level through the roof, leading to involuntary urination on the dog's part. Use of an excited voice should also be avoided, as the dog picks up on this as a cue that says "This is a time to get excited!"    Once the initial excitement of the family member or guest's arrival has waned - usually after five to ten minutes - it is acceptable to physically pet the dog for a physical greeting.    Meal times are another time where a dog's excitement is high. Feeding more frequently with three or four small meals per day will help the dog to feel less hungry, which will remove some of the excitement. Preparing the meal and putting the food down when the dog is not present is another way to eliminate some of the excitement that's associated with the anticipation of the meal.    These measures should resolve problems of excitement urination in the vast majority of dogs. In cases where there's little or no improvement, dog owners should contact an experienced trainer to assist. A visit to the veterinarian is also helpful in these cases, as an underlying physical problem like a urinary tract infection may be to blame for the dog's bathroom accidents.|`|EeJMITyCaa	THey doesn't sound like excitment urination. That sounds like submissive urination. Most puppies stop this eventually. However, if he hasn't stopped by now and he's already been neutered then I would seek help.Did you spank your puppy or yell at him a lot? If so then this is why he is doing this. He is showing you that hey you're the boss. See I'm so scared of you I pee on myself!|`|H5NL2bTlaa	This all depends, what kind of dog? Cocker spaniels are known for submissive urination. If he is still a puppy, then that is self- explanitory. Before trying to train, first take him to the vet and rule out any medical issues. If nothing medical is wrong, you an talk to your vet.    Hope that helps! =)|`|73fb776922f2d7ae393d2e11bb5a54ebaa	Is he a puppy still?  My staffy mix would pee every time he saw someone.  It lasted till he was around 10 months old, than he stopped on his own....I would say give him  time as he grows and matures he will likely grow out of it.

3YMETqStaa	Youre probably going to get some vicious comments about having pups and not being a proper breeder, however I believe in constructive criticism.  As it has already been said, puppies don't quite understand body language yet so they can do stuff that will piss off the older dogs that no better.  It's also an issue of socializing you older dogs.  If dogs have been removed from interacting with other dogs then they do not know how to act around them when the time comes.  You will have to introduce them slowly.  I would suggest keeping the puppy in a gated area that protects it from the older dog but they can still interact.  After they get to know one another they can be allowed to play but you must supervise them.  After a while they should get a long quite nicely.      Another thing you can do is take them on tough walks or hikes together.  It's just like with humans, if they endure hardships together they bond.|`|AA11887983	It is not uncommon for older dogs to act somewhat aggressive to pups.

They have male hamsters, and you can choose from a variety, at no cost to you. Go on some websites and study.|`|lhmsAlQuaa	General information         Being steppe-prairieanimals, the common hamsters are       modest with regard to feed and need little drinking water.       Moreover, they are odourless even for delicate noses. And it is just this undemanding nature that has made of the dwarf hamsters, even more so of the golden hamsters, a most popular "toy" for children. It must, however, be emphasized that dwarf hamsters are of limited suitability for small children. It's true they may be more active during the day than the golden hamster, but they, too don't want to be woken up in the daytime just to be stroken. Furthermore, dwarf hamsters                                                                                        are such tiny animals that only older children dispose of the necessary fine-motor capacity to stroke these little fellows without running the risk of crushing them to death.   Social behaviour   Hungarian dwarf hamsters are shy animals by nature who over and over again scrutinize the environment closely from their hiding place to be sure that the coast is clear. They go and get their feed  la hamster, stuff it into their cheek pouches and bring it home to safety. This way of life of a "grabber" always nearest to himself has, of course, a solitary character. He doesn't want to share, but just wants to look for himself. He doesn't enjoy company. Dwarf hamsters are, however, much easier to get on with fellow species than the golden hamsters. When two unfamiliar animals meet, they first go around one another several times, sniff at each other and then continue to go peacefully their own way. This allows the pet owners to keep several peaceable nest brothers and sisters together.   Behavioural disturbances   The blowing up of the legendary chubby cheeks is a display pattern and not a behaviour disorder. Neglect, keeping the animals in ways not appropriate to their species, wrong feeding, diseases, irritation through noise and touching the animal the wrong way promote the tendency to bite and to cannibalism. Because of the latter it is important that the dams are not disturbed the first week after giving birth and the cubs should under no circumstances be touched. Otherwise it can happen that completely distraught mothers eat their cubs!  Man-Animal communication   The first step to be able to communicate is the effort to get to know as much as possible about the life of the dwarf hamsters in the open countryside. This will help to soon be able to interpret body posture, behaviour patterns, vocalization. For instance one will detect that animals with put up bottom and erected tail signal their humility. Or that they stand up straight and take up a threatening position with blown up chubby cheeks. If the pet owner feeds the dwarf hamster with a calm hand, the animal will come to trust him and become tame. He then climbs on his hand and later on the whole person with familiar smell.   Animals "talk" to their fellow species by body posture, position of the tail, facial expression, vocalization and many more. If the human being has the position of companion and substitute for fellow species, then he must try to make up a little bit for the big deficit. The easiest way to do this is to talk calmly to his pets. Just the way he would talk with other human beings. Animals are extremely capable of learning and understand very quickly what words, the tone of voice and gestures want to say.   Undesirable behaviour   With his sharp teeth the dwarf hamster can cause considerable damage. He should only be allowed to have free run in the apartment when he really has become tame and when he does not seek refuge anymore from men. He will try everywhere to gather padding for his little house and put it in his chubby cheeks: Carpet fibres, pieces of wallpaper and many more. The run-out yard is indeed very risky for the animal (accidents!). It is far better to have a large enclosure.   Mood barometer   DThe body posture of the dwarf hamster tells a lot about his state of health and his mental state. When he eats and sniffs curiously and when he assiduously cleans his pelage, then he feels well and lively. When he puts his ears back, this can mean a lot: Fear, tiredness, bad mood, aggression. When he stands up straight and blows up his chubby cheeks, then he wants to threaten and impress ennemies (also the human hand) and possibly put hem to flight. This is the time when one must leave him in peace, because otherwise he might bite. If the dwarf hamster jumps in the air, then he certainly is in a good mood and high-spirited. If the animal flinches or cleans himself suddenly and persistently, he he got a fright from something. It is important then to leave him in peace.  Psychology of animals.  A nocturnal animal and active also in the twilight who feels well above all in caves and in the security of a store cupboard filled to bursting, is everything else than a cuddly toy. If the dwarf hamster is frightened and shy, he ca|`|cDz6jxxnaa	a regular hamster u can gte long haired or short haired and they are really cute and freindly. i have a teddy bear hamster and he is just fine, i think it was just ur particular hamster.
w1lh1INHaa	There is something about a visit to the vet that increases any cat's heartrate.  And yes, the malnourishment could have had a lot to do with it, as your cat was starting to become anemic.  With fewer red blood cells to take oxygen to all corners of the body, the heart pumps faster to move the blood faster.    Normal pulse in cats is 150 - 240 beats per minute -- now, that is a pretty big range, and if your cat is normally in the upper range, and the trip to the vet caused stress, I could see why the vet might feel concerned.  While your cat is resting comfortably at home, without stress, you can check her heartbeat yourself.    To check the pulse, feel for the femoral artery which is located close to the surface on the inside of the thigh at the groin.    I  found it difficult to find the femoral artery to check the pulse, another method which I found much easier was to feel the heartbeat. To do this press against the rib cage over the heart. With the cat standing, feel the pulse just behind the elbow.    Either way, count the number of beats in 15 seconds & then multiply by 4 to get the total number per minute.     That she is eating well is a hugely good sign, and I expect she will be fine and be with you for a long, long time.    ADDED:  Please let us know how she makes out tomorrow.  And, please calm down and stop stressing, or your kitty will sense and pick up on your stress....and this will upset her and make her heart race!    ADDED 2:  Phew!  Good news!|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	You won't have to take her back to the shelter.  No one is going to force you to give up your cat if it has a heart problem. It is excellent that she is eating, but you can't hide from scarey things.  If she has a heart problem it needs to be evaluated.  It may not be severe, maybe something managed with some medications.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Hi   Thanks for caring    Whatever the condition of your cat. you will not have to give her back and no one can force you to.   You didn't say how the vet diagnosed a bad heart. If it was just by listening, it could have been stress.   Also, although it may have been crucial, by your vet actions the cat's condition was  not as bad as he said. If this was life threatening. the vet would not have just given an appetite stimulant but would have kept your cat and put it on fluids as well as recommending a feeding tube or such.    I would go to a different vet for a regular checkup  that way there is no prejudice in the diagnosis  Best of luck|`|IsozKRNeaa	Well if she is eating now, she should be fine. Good Luck to you.|`|WZDlBuUyaa	If she does have a heart problem, and you take her back to the shelter they will kill her. Most animal shelters are horrible places, and one tiny thing could be wrong with an animal and most animal shelters will put that animal down. So you keep her and keep her happy for the rest of her life. Think of it as a child, would you give up your child because it has heart problems?|`|AA11736483	A quick diagnosis at the vets for an abnormal heart cannot be taken seriously. Cats are typically very stressed at the vets and they will have elevated heart rates. Malnourishment doesn't help either. The best way to check for proper heart rates is to do it at home, or leave the cat at the vets for a day or so. They should take multiple readings throughout the day.
HKoo2PfYaa	Congrats on the new puppy!    Puppies do have "hyper" bursts of activity at various times throughout the day.  This is normal.  It can occur after eating with the increase in blood sugar and simply in response to the excitement of eating (dogs love to eat!).  Also many dogs have a case of the "zoomies" in the evening.  You'll notice behavior patterns like this if hyour observant.  They do outgrow this somewhat as they age.    However, you shouldn't allow the dog to go overboard and bite at you.  I am not sure you are experiencing this but most people do.  Gentle mouthing is normal, but I like to establish a rule that there should be no teeth on skin.  Dogs normally play this way with each other, but they can learn not to put teeth on humans.  To teach this, when playing with your puppy on the floor, continue the "game" until you feel that first tooth.  When you feel that FIRST tooth, even if it doesn't hurt, quickly stand up, clap, and say in a startling voice, "Leave it!"  Look away, standing with your hands up and out of reach for 5-10 seconds, then get down to the dog's level and continue the game.  Repeat this process every time you feel teeth and the dog will quickly learn that to contiunue play, he must refrain from using teeth.  If the dog is persistent after several repititions, give him a 2 minute time out in the crate.  This is VERY effective because it FORCES the dog to stop the behavior and makes your command effective.  You always want your commands to be followed and if the behavior continues despite your attempts to stop it, the dog has learned that you are completely ineffective.  You really have no way to enforce the rules and there is really no consequence (other than the brief few seconds of interuppted play).  If your timing is good, the dog will make the association of this behavior --> consequence.  Expect improvement after just a few days (or less).      Hope this helps and good luck!|`|UgVuQJriaa	If I were you I would make sure to let him play outside and take him for walks daily so that he can get rid of some of the extra energy.

Lawn ornaments.  Throw them food once a day, make sure their 5 gallon water bucket is clean.  That's all we did as kids growing up.  As an adult, I assumed that was OK.      When we moved to the city, into a townhome, we had to bring the dog inside.  With Gwyn, we use a crate when we're not at home and at night.  She's not the biggest fan of it, but leaving her loose results in accidents.  Leaving her in the crate, she is accident free.      The rest of the time, she is loose, on the couch watching TV with us, begging for attention and licking my feet which actually annoys the heck out of me after a while.  However, I still love her.

HKoo2PfYaa	Great question and I will try to make this as short as possible!    Here is some of the interesting facts I have recently learned:    Many common foods are actually harmful or even fatal to dogs. Some of these (listed below) will surprise you. Others are things you would never give your dog purposefully, but now you will be more careful to not let them be in your dog's reach. And some just need to be limited to small amounts.    Avacados are toxic to dogs - (fruit, pit, and plant).  They can cause difficulty breathing; fluid accumulation in the chest, abdomen and heart; or pancreatitis.    Onions can be fatal to dogs. Onions destroy red blood cells and can cause anemia, weakness, and breathing difficulty. Even small amounts can cause cumulative damage over time. This includes onions or chives - raw, powdered, dehydrated, or cooked.    Garlic is harmful to dogs. Large amounts of garlic cause the same problems as onions.    Grapes and raisins can be fatal to dogs. Grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure in dogs. As little as a single serving of raisins can kill him. If the dog doesn't eat enough at one time to be fatal, he can be severely damaged by eating just a few grapes or raisins regularly.    Tomatoes can be fatal to dogs. Tomatoes can cause tremors and heart arrhythmias. Tomato plants and the most toxic, but tomatoes themselves are also unsafe. (All parts of the plant except the tomato itself are also poisonous to humans.)    Nutmeg is can be fatal to dogs Nutmeg can cause tremors, seizures and death.    Caffeine is harmful to dogs. Caffeine (from coffee, coffee grounds, tea, or tea bags) stimulates the central nervous and cardiac systems, and can cause vomiting, restlessness, heart palpitations, and even death within hours.    Xylitol sweetener can harm dogs. Diet products containing the sweetener Xylitol can cause a sudden drop in blood sugar, resulting in depression, loss of coordination and seizures. Unless treatment is given quickly, the dog could die.    Macadamia nuts can harm dogs. Macadamia nuts can cause weakness, muscle tremor and paralysis. These symptoms are usually temporary.    Walnuts are poisonous to dogs.     Chocolate can be fatal to dogs. Chocolate can cause seizures, coma and death. Bakers chocolate is the most dangerous. The darker the chocolate, the more dangerous it is. But any chocolate, in large enough amounts, can kill a dog. An ounce of chocolate can poison a 30-pound dog, and many dogs will happily consume more than this. The symptoms may not show up for several hours (and so might make you think all is well), with death following within twenty-four hours. A dog can consume milk chocolate and appear to be fine because it is not as concentrated, but it is still dangerous.    Fruit pits are toxic to dogs. Apple seeds, cherry pits, and peach pits, pear pips, plums pits, peaches, and apricot pits contain cyanide, which is poisonous.    Too much salt is harmful to dogs. Too much salt can cause kidney problems. Also, large breeds of dogs that eat salty food may then drink too much water and develop bloat, which is fatal unless emergency treatment is given very quickly.    Too much fat is harmful to dogs. Too much fat or fried foods can cause pancreatitis.    Ham and bacon are bad for dogs. Ham and bacon contain too much fat and too much salt, and can cause pancreatitis. Also, large breeds of dogs that eat salty food may drink too much water and develop a life-threatening condition called bloat. This is where the stomach fills up with gas and within several hours may twist, causing death.    Too much liver is harmful to dogs. Raw liver or too much cooked liver (three servings a week) can lead to vitamin A toxicity. This can cause deformed bones, excessive bone growth on the elbows and spine, weight loss, and anorexia. Check the label of your canned dog food to be sure that it does not contain liver if you are giving your dog liver also.    Wild mushrooms can be fatal to dogs. Wild mushrooms can cause abdominal pain, drooling, liver damage, kidney damage, vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, coma, or death.    Raw egg whites alone are bad for dogs. Raw egg whites contain a protein called avidin, which can deplete your dog of biotin, one of the B vitamins. Biotin is essential to your dogs growth and coat health. The lack of it can cause hair loss, weakness, growth retardation, or skeleton deformity. Raw egg yolks contain enough biotin to prevent the deficiency, so this is not a problem with raw whole eggs. Raw egg yolks could contain salmonella, so you should get your eggs from a reliable source or cook the eggs.    Cooked bones can kill dogs. Cooked bones can splinter and tear a dogs internal organs.    Dogs need their vegetables cut up.

And as a parting gift, neuter his dog for him. I could NEVER spend time with someone who dumps a dog like this outside all day AND refuses to neuter him.  Some serious masculinity issues there with your BF.      In the meantime, call your vet and ask about spaying the female now.  It's safe as early as 6-8 weeks, so your vet may agree that because of the awful situation your BF has put you in, that it's fine to do now.      Only allowing them to play 'when you are home' is still dangerous, unless you are watching them each and every minute you are home.  Literally.

Cats can get acne from bowls, so be sure to alternate two or three and run them in the dishwasher or scrub really well.     I have never used plastic bowls, just ceramic, so it is the build up of food and saliva rather than allergy to plastic. I wash the bowl every day!|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Use benzoyl peroxide pads like they sell for acne to gently wipe her chin area.

This should only be done when you are very sure the skin is ready to come off.  If you have to tug to get the skin off, then leave it be.  Else you are just hurting your iguana by literally ripping his skin off.      Iguanas should be misted/sprayed irregardless of shedding as they like it and they need the humidity.  You are correct though in that it will help with shedding.      A young iguana will almost constantly be shedding due to constantly growing, so you will get used to this condition.|`|Eyawiwc5aa	Fountain wont help much for humidity. Using a humidifer or vaporizer will help much more then a fountain.  Spraying/Misting a couple times a day will help ... daily to every other day will help. Supplying a drinking dish and a soaking pan will help your ig too, when igs learn that the water is where they go potty sometimes they will soak in the water in there living space and then go to the bathroom.    jonathanleeriggs is very much correct on the not pulling of shed ... if you have stubbern shed specially on the toes use mineral oil ... use vasoline for spikes    Sites for you to read:  http://www.greenigsociety.org/ - http://www.iguanaden.org/ - http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html  A great book to read and have on hand:  Iguanas for Dummies by Melissa Kaplan  Yahoo has some great sites for Iguana owners... these groups helped me and still help w/ questions .. if you'd like to join:  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyI... - http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Iguan...|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Iguanas need high humidity.  They need a pool large enough to soak their entire bodies in--a cat litter pan works well for small to medium igs.  Definitely they need heavy misting at least twice a day with warm water.

bPdqwkpPaa	This is a pretty general answer site.  If the answers you got before didn't work, then it's probably time to get a REAL LIFE trainer who can work personally with you and your dog.      Yelling and screaming at your dog won't make him listen.  Training him ON the leash and in smaller enclosed areas, eventually working your way up to 'playing outside', should work.  Take more time and take baby steps.  You can't expect everything to change in a few days time, especially without proper behaviour and expectations from you.|`|AA11992723	keep doing that and youll get a dead dog. he'll get hit by a car or picked up and not returned to you. or you'll get fined.    he can't play outside unconfined.     He's not pulling stunts...he's not out to make you unhappy or miserable. There is no fool proof way to keep a dog in the spot you want unless he's leashed or fenced.    BTW, the more mad you are at him, the more he'll run away from you. dogs can smell the hormones we have, he can smell your anger at him. it's not good for him, or for you, to get so angry at your dog.    the more you bring him outside without a leash or fence, the more he'll just keep running away even just out of habit if no other reason.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	Do NOT yell or chase pup. You need to always make coming to you a great experience. But first, you have a lab and they need a lot of exersize. several hours a day, minimum or you will continue to see bad behavior. Start inside your home.get some yummy treats for pup and keep them near by. Wait for pup to voluntarily come to you and when it does say"come" and treat the pup and praise him. Every time he comes to you, do this. Then start calling to him "come" and when he comes treat and praise. When he does it inside 90% of the time he has to be taught outside without any distractions (No dogs, people) when at 90% add distractions.|`|qUcCWuT4aa	get a chain     other wise get a under ground fence|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Teach him the "settle down" command. A hyperactive dog can really wear your patience thin sometimes so its best to teach him to settle down and be quiet some of the time, especially at times when you want it.    Check out this link and learn how to do this. goodluck!|`|1vwYhsQRaa	You need to teach your dog to "COME", when he's trying to run away, not "NO". Also, when he does come, reward him with a treat, otherwise he will pretty soon understand that "COMING" to you is not a good thing and won't "COME" at all. You need to train with him in a more confined area and with a leash. Your dog does not understand "NO", what is he supposed to do when you tell him "NO" ? He will be confused, teach him to "COME" and he will know what to do and where to go. Most importantly: Be consistent!|`|cIqpL3tGaa	Call the Dog Whisperer.|`|iHSj8iUNaa	put something in front of him like a piece of meat then you will let him know when he can get it and sqirt him with water wen he does sumtin wrong|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	Sounds like you need to teach the dog to "come"  Not "no"  Use a leash... This dog will never learn if you give this dog freedom outside.  When I was young, I would get real frustrated when my dog would not come..... Alas... he knew I was MAD and he'd get in trouble for not coming right away... What I did was teach this dog that it was not safe to come.  He never came well.. and it was MY fault.    Stop going outside to PLAY and go outside for a "learning session" - patiently teaching this dog to "COME."    Labs are usually easy to train.|`|fQ1qDMaqaa	Try using his/her favorite dog treat. Eventually they will always think you have a treat for them, and hopefully obey you. If this doesn't work, get a dog trainer to give you some tips.    Hope I helped. :)

hdQvbs0naa	Where is she bleeding, how deep/long is the cut, and how much blood is coming out would you say? This is important because if it's a very bad cut and bleeding freely she may need to go to the vet and get stitched up. If the cut isn't too bad you'll have to let it heal. You can try putting neosporin on it, although they usually lick it off.|`|44kEtDvIaa	They were probably having a little disagreement which does happen.  Treat it as you would with any wound and the bleeding should stop.  If it doesn't, or if you see a reddening as indication of infection, then you will probably have to see a vet.|`|hFU31zm7aa	you really shouldn't put a male and a female together if that's the case or to females in heat|`|UF5ZwzHCaa	Is it still bleeding?  Try putting a little bit of pressure on it using a clean piece of cloth, gauze....etc.  Clean it with a little soap and water and let it dry.  Keep an eye on her for a couple of days.

You may even see a little blood on one of the other rats nails if they were fighting.  Good luck!|`|FedwTHHlaa	I wouldn't worry about it.

And it may help you to know if there are things that you are doing that are unintentionally causing your dog to think this is a good idea.      Training is a must!  If someone gets hurt, you and your dog could get into a nasty situation.  Find a good, reputable trainer, and then get started.  And make sure that you talk to the trainer about your problem.  My dog's trainer had several dogs like this in our class, and we used parts of our class to help desensitize and teach those dogs as well as train our own.|`|AA12377116	Absolutely, get her trained.    Some times dogs who are adopted too young never learn not to bite, as this is learned from their littermates between 6 and 10 weeks of age.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	Have you ever seen the Dog Whisperer with Ceasar Milan, well he says that when dogs do this they are being dominant, and think they own you. You belong to the dog not the dog belonging to you. You must be leader not follower. I totally agree with this. I had a similar situation a long time ago with a dachsund I had, he was very aggressive with dogs and people he didn't know. It took me a couple times, but I had to correct him, and not allow it to happen. I had to take charge and not think its cute or protective, You have to take charge and put him on a leash, tap him  and even stand in front of him when people approach, let him know your the boss not him, and your the one in control. I swear to you this works. My dach was better behaved, specially on our walks. I hope this helps.|`|fCS6oecCaa	never hit a dog.........get some trining|`|xYsCC5UXaa	you *don't* let this happen.  train her. now.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	Tell them to bite her back.|`|pmr65Sgraa	keep her on a leash when people come over and when she goes to bite them pull back on the leash make a loud noise and put your finger together and tap her hard(with our hurting her) on the back then say really loud NO!|`|s23w0I3Baa	and you let your dog do this why???? hello. ever heard of training???|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Why have to allowed this to go this far?  It may have been cute as a puppy but now it isn't fun & games, it has gotten serious.    You have two choices.  1. Keep her away from other people & use her as a guard dog.  2.  Train her that this behavior is no longer acceptable.    Below is a list of sites that may help you.|`|djjVYhWiaa	Please enroll your dog into obedience classes right away before he bites anymore people.  Dog bites are extremely dangerous.|`|krzbXZLkaa	First, temporarily keep your dog away from people you do and do not know as you work on this problem.  A dog bite could cause a bad situation for you and your dog if the dog is taken away from you because of a bite.  Next, make sure your dog is up to date on rabies vaccination and keep proof of this on hand in the unfortunate case your dog bites someone and it's reported to the Department of Health.  Last but not least, start working to break this behavior (both yours and the dogs).  If you can't afford a dog trainer, check out materials on Cesar Millan's website that might help you train her/him yourself. http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/about/  Please do not give up on your dog.  All problems have a solution.  If you give up and your dog ends up in a shelter, it's a sure thing the dog will be euthanized. That's a sad and unnecessary ending.  Your dog has taken the dominant alpha pecking order position with you.  You need to take the lead, change your approach and behavior around the dog first.  You want the dog submissive to you so that the dog will immediately respond positive to your firm commands.  Be CALM, assertive and confident. Never act afraid, nervous or fly off the handle. Read, learn and be patient. Slowly test your dog in a safe, calm and confident manner as you make progress.  Soon you will transform your dog into a happy healthy companion for all concerned.  Hope this helps.

xyPpruSjaa	A plain 'ol 10-20 gallon tank! NO WATER!! xD     Super easy to clean, better than those plastic pieces of overly expensive garbage (your regular hamster cage). Trust me I've had experience with them.    Right now, I have 2 gerbils in a 20 gallon aquarium and 1 hamster in a 10 gallon aquarium. I have had NO escapes in the history of owning pet rodents and housing them in aquariums :]    Pros: Easy to clean, inexpensive, escape proof, chew proof, easy to see through, easy to have access to your pet, and you can decorate it with your own personal taste in colors and toys instead of having those ugly pieces of plastic slides and built in wheels jutting out from everywhere in a normal cage.      Cons: A bit heavy, but I have a back issue and even I can easily lift my 20 gallon tank into the tub to wash.    Prices may vary a little, but over all they are about the same.    20 gallon with a lid = $45  10 gallon with a lid = $22    I have included the lid in the prices because it is highly suggested you buy one. They can stand up on top of one of their toys and possibly climb out, or bugs/foreign objects can find their way into the tank and can be poisonous.     They sell lids at the pet store in the reptile section, find the one that appropriately fits on the top of your 10,15,or 20 gallon aquarium.    To attach a water bottle to your aquarium, buy some sticky backed WHITE velcro (sold at hardware stores) and use it to attach the waterbottle anywhere you want :D    Good luck!

It's never to late.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You mean the dog never lays down?   Of course you can. You train him that just like you train him to sit.

Once a dog knows "down," you can use it to gauge her personality or mood. A submissive dog willingly goes into a down position; a feistier pup won't be so eager.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Thank you, Rotten Rotts, I was thinking the same thing.  I was visualizing this poor dog who has made it through five years of life without ever lying down! :-)  He must be exhausted!    Oh, you mean lie down "on command"?  Of course it's possible and actually quite easy to do.|`|FNYEkyqLaa	Have you taught your dachshund (correct spelling) any obedience commands before?  Of course not, you can't even spell its breed name.  You and your dog should enroll in obedience classes.  This will teach you about dog behavior, how to teach, how to correct bad behavior.|`|s23w0I3Baa	why wouldn't it be possible?|`|qUcCWuT4aa	ya why not?  that is a big fat myth that you cant teach a older dog a new trick  i can  my dog is five to and i just tought him to play dead|`|cIqpL3tGaa	No, dogs dont listen after a certain age.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	its possible with all dogs|`|ydshiNrKaa	Sure you can teach older dogs basic commands.  Depending on how willing he is to learn how to do it is another matter.  It may take longer but he should eventually lean the commands.  Lots of repetition, treats, and short training sessions will probably help too.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Very easily.     Get him to sit.   Have a treat in your hand, and move it slowly down to the ground so his nose follows it. Hold your hand on the ground with the treat until he goes into the down position. Pop the treat into his mouth. Once he seems to understand the hand thing, start adding "lie Down" or "down" whenever you do the lure with your hand. Over time, start making the hand signal smaller until you're satisfied with it.|`|6idi2E7caa	First of all try to make your dog sit. Next try to help him to lie down by forcing his legs out in front gently while saying firmly "down". And don't forget to reward him by showing enthusiasm when saying "good dog!" or by petting him.  ------------  Reward your dog all the time for movements in the right way, then for the whole action, then for best attempts. Rewards can be food in the form of treats or part of your dog's dinner, praise, or a toy or game. Remember it is only a reward if your dog wants it.    To get your dog to sit, hold a titbit just above its nose, then move your hand over its back. As its head tilts up and back, the dog will sit. As it sits, say 'sit' and remember to give a reward. Don't hold the reward too high or move too quickly, as your dog may jump up or back off. Alternatively you can simply wait for your dog to sit, as most dogs naturally sit a lot. As it sits, say 'sit' and give it a reward. Practice the technique at kerbs and when greeting people.

pcvcMePXaa	you should get a leopard gecko their so neat i have 2 i love em they dont mind being held and are tame some you have to work with to tame them, also dont listen to myimmortal she has no idea what shes saying, never feed a captive animal wild caught food they can carry parasites and other types of bacteria and disease leopard gecko dont need a big tank 10 gallons is fine for 1 gecko they need a minimum of 10x10 per leopard gecko, they eat crickets and superworms i wouldn't suggest meal worms because they are less meaty and more shell to them also you can feed them wax worms but only once a week has they are high in fat. They need to be fed about 3-4times a week and babies and juveniles about 5-6 times a week, they require a dry hide and a moist hide moist hide is use to aid in shedding, and an undertank heater and a heat lamp temps should be 85-90 in warm end and about 75 in cool end. they are nocturnal animals.

KnT943rjaa	FISH FISH FISH!!  Im naming what ever you get Calvin...just fyi :P jk...ill refrain from naming it anything...|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Whole sale places are the worst. They don't keep fish long at all. They get them shipped in and keep them for a couple weeks and then ship them off again. I would say look for a local breeder if they breed in captivity. Why do you want salt water ? its such a pain. They have fresh water sting rays too that are much easier to care for because they don't need the whole salt water set up you have to watch so closely. Although its worth noting that the fresh water sting rays are still Fragile just like all rays and sharks are. Good Luck|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	A 180-gallon tank is really too small for either a shark or a stingray.    The blue spot stingray, if it's the one I'm thinking of, is a freshwater fish (from rivers in South America), while all the sharks you can get through the pet trade are marine (salt water), so you certainly couldn't keep both in the same tank.    Stingrays are hard to keep alive without special tanks, special filtration, and special foods. Getting one from a local wholesaler would be no guarantee that the specimen would be healthier. Any stingray you get would be recently imported after being wild-caught, since nobody that I know of is breeding them commercially in captivity.|`|07lCZh28aa	Your best bet, go to www.saltwaterfish.com   Best prices!! Trust me.
Wn3LGHTvaa	That "fluttery thing" is also done to intimidate a competitor for space and food. It is not always  foreplay to mating.

TYohMrlXaa	You will have to keep up with your water changes, no slacking off! That is a lot of work for a whole year. But while you have to do it, changing  the water everyday is rather stressful for the fish. Also Goldfish produce a LOT of waste and I don't think the water in that bowl will ever be right.     Stunting his growth is rather serious, the main concern is that while the fish stays small, his internal organs will still grow. Goldfish normally grow the fastest in their first year too.  This will be stressfull too, and your fish will have less resistance to disease. Combined with the everyday amonia buildup, the plant can't handle it all, I am very concerned for your fish.    If you just can't get a tank yet, at least you can find a bigger container for him. It may not be as pretty, but your fish will be much healthier at the end of the year.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	You can get a 10 gallon tank for about 10 dollars, and a filter for about 30. You can't keep a goldfish in a bowl for a year, but a 10 gallon tank should be fine while he's young. He'll need more space eventually, but I really, really would recommend at least a small tank now. Ten gallons are pretty cheap. You don't need to buy a fancy stand or hood or anything, just a tank, lid, and filter, and then some gravel and silk plants.  MUCH better environment than a bowl.     If you wait a year, your fish might not still be alive.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Water changes good, plants wont grow without some kinda light over the bowl depending what kind of plants they are. Try to upgrade in the next 6 months and he may be ok. Still though 1 gallon is so small I just can't see him making it. Good Luck though.|`|hFyodb4Daa	No it won't be ok your fish probably won't make it after a week if your lucky goldfish grow large very fast they also need a filters and changing water too much is bad even though you don't want wate to kill your fish either so really its a lose-lose situation. You need a 20 gallon tank with a heavy duty filter NOW and 20 gallon ktis aren't too much you can get one at Walmart for $30-50
jkBOhhkbaa	thanks for your service :)    before beginning anything, make sure its wings and claws are clipped, to avoid as much injury as possible! although its beak cant really be clipped, definitely avoid and lunges!    patience is key, for one thing. begin with basics, like the holding your hand in its cage for periods of time and letting it get use to human contact again. once you feel comfortable, go ahead and begin the normal step up/down commands.     try to remember when you first got the bird, and go from there!    good luck!, and again, God bless you for your long service :)|`|1gDTiPVyaa	1st, thank you for your service.  My best bud has served several tours in the middle east.     2nd, good luck.

Good luck to you sir.|`|ae54b4a7f13587570ec2a88d765bbedeaa	These are all good answers.     The biggest thing I want to add is to tell you not to put your hand in the cage right now. If the bird is giving you problems, it considers it's cage his/her own territory and you are an intruder! Later on it will be different, but for now, open the cage door, let the bird come out (yes...I would get it's wings clipped) and then try to work with it in neutral territory!  \  Good Luck. If you survived Iraq I know you can survive this parrot!    Thanks for your service....|`|xGmbEzOZaa	Just allow time for your bird to get accustomed to you again. You need to regain her trust slowly. It may take a while, but just be patient. Start by clipping your bird's wings. It might be a good idea to get a person who your bird isn't familiar with to do it. Otherwise, your bird's trust may be even harder to gain.    Then try hand-feeding your bird her favourite treats. Eventually, some trust will be gained when she takes them willingly from your hand.    Does your bird still remember how to step up? If not, after she's more used to your presence, press up against her abdomen until she steps up. Then reward her. I would recommend doing this while wearing thick gloves, as she may bite.    Good luck. With time your bird will be back to her old self.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Start all over just as you would with a rehome. Start with step ups ,Get his wings clipped. That may change his attitude a bit.
bPdqwkpPaa	That's a pretty reasonable number for that area.     Your brother should call his breeder.  If it's a responsible breeder, he may offer to help out your brother as ACL tears can be genetic.      If your brother cannot afford it, then he should visit http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/what_y...  Lots of organizations on there that he can contact for help.     And remind him that part of owning a dog is being prepared for expensive emergencies.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I had a number of clients over the years that had that surgery done & it is the price here in GA.

However, if there are any follow up visits, those wouldn't be included if you couldn't make it to the vet that did the surgery.|`|qUcCWuT4aa	every time a dog needs surgry  it is not going to be cheap|`|MT0gw2hmaa	Do you have a petsmart in LA? The Banfield clinic is much less than the vets office and they have a healthplan available to puppies and dogs. They have a Vet and are open late most every day.

FYI-30-50% of dogs with a ruptured ACL (called a cranial curciate ligament in vet. med) rupture the other one with in a year.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	depends on the age of the dog    it will not heal by itself|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	I, unfortunately, can believe this as it happened to my cat and it was $1,800 to fix it!  If I were you I'd call around for other prices, just explain what has happened and ask how much they charge for this type of thing.|`|7HGKJYenaa	I'm so sorry to hear that, and unfortunately feel you pain.  My 6 year old chow mix tore both of her acl's within about a month of each other last year.  I did have the surgery done at my regular vet.  It was about $1500 per leg and he worked out a payment plan with me.  I have heard that there are two different surgeries available, the one we had and another option that is about twice as expensive.  My dog weighs about 50 ponds so they were able to "repair" her acl.  The way i understood the procedure is that on one leg (she completely tore the acl) the went in and put in a "suture" to hold everything in place and act as the ligament/tendon (im still not 100% sure what an acl is)  on the other leg the used a different procedure because it was torn but not in half.  I have heard that in larger dogs and depending on the tear they have to go in and actually create a new acl, which is the more expensive surgery. I have heard that if you go to a specialist it will be more expensive as well.  I'm sorry if I rambled a bit but I hope it helped a little.  I would definately recommend calling around and talking with a few vets as far as price and a possible payment plan go.   There are also a couple of sites on line that will help cover the cost of surgery if your application is accepted, you should google that.  I hope things go well, the recovery takes a long time so be prepared for that as well.  Good luck.  Again Im sorry for your brother &  "nephew"
u61yKsE3aa	They are illegal for the average owner you can however get permits through the USDA that allows you to own certain native mammals including ringtail foxes.  These are hard to get though.  Ussually they are given to exotic breeders, zoos, rescue facilities, and educational reasons not ussually given for people to keep as pets.
u61yKsE3aa	raccoons require permits through the usda to own in california.  Not sure what you mean by ringtail There are animals like ringtail lemurs ring tail coatis, rind tail cat but not just ring tails.  All these require the same permit through the USDA to own in cali though|`|iUE6K5HQaa	Pretty sure that you aren't supposed to own raccoons anywhere.|`|CVXCSTHoaa	Ok I am not Completely sure what you are asking. But from the question i am going to take it as this is it illegal to hunt ring tails in California.   Yes they are,Prior to 1967, the ring tail was harvested as a fur-bearer. It  could be taken in season with no bag limit. As of January 1968, the California  Legislature conferred the status of fully protected mammal upon the ring tail;  it cannot be taken in any manner at any time of the year except for scientific  purposes under special permit issued by the California Department of Fish and  Game.    If your asking if you can have them as a pet NO, raccoons carry rabies most of the time, and most state you need a license to keep animals like that    If that's not what your asking you might need to add Little more to the question.|`|9xS763YWaa	you mean like the hair dying fashion thing?  or the ones on the butts of raccoons?  the hair one I'm sure is legal but i'm not sure about the animal ones...why would you have raccoon tails?      now there are raccoons out there that don't have tails....they are probably in their tree right now crying because all the other woodland creatures are making fun of them for not having a tail.      are you happy you are the reason a poor raccoon is crying?!?!    lol Just kidding, im not sure.
p3vjvzRPaa	I agree with Toy Fox Terrier that it depends on the dog not on the gender.    Eg, if your boy is quite dominating with other dogs, then another dominant dog (of either gender) isn't a good idea.    If your boy is quite boisterous and wants to play all the time, don't pick the pup who likes to wander off from the rest of the litter and have their own space.    Some people claim that 2 dogs of the same gender are more likely to fight.  Well, I know a spayed ***** that fights with the neutered dog it lives with.  It really is about the nature of the specific dogs not whether male or female.    There are pros and cons with each gender - I think base your decision on them too rather than thinking just of how a pup will get along with your boy.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Some people find that male/female pairs seem to get along better.  However, it comes down to the individual temperament...look to find a compatible temperament first, regardless of gender|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	I dont think it really matters to be honest. I know people that have pairs of both.|`|tZV7DAcVaa	It really just depends on what your boy dog likes.  Go to a shelter and take him with you.  Let him help you pick out your newest family member, especially since he will spending the most time with him/her.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Less complicated to get another boy really.  But it depends on the breed mix, and the individual puppy.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	it depends on the individual dog and the breeds  i  would say either would be fine because the boy and girl would get on   and the boy you already have would be fine with another boy because he is nuetered so he will be calmer around him    i got a boy then a girl and they loved each other to bits then she got pregnant and we kept the girl puppy now the mum and daugter argue a lot, but don't really fight just growl at each other!!  we had the boy chopped when he got the girl pregnant!! no more pups!!|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	Boy;is my opinion|`|KFu7596Paa	i would go for a male but you would have to get him carstrated as when hes older o it might start a fight
e2HW9iQ5aa	Ugh! I would NEVER feed my cats Hills Science diet. It's crappy, overpriced, and made with very low quality ingredients. I don't think I'd give much credence to someone that says they are a "Hills Advocate" for that same reason. Even though some of that advice was good.    Go to www.catinfo.org and read up. the answers to most/all of your questions can be found there.|`|GnYw9Pvwaa	Give the new stuff slowly to him or just give it to him. My cat is really picky but not on fatty stuff. My cat won't even drink milk. Do what's good for the cat.|`|vXnGBmGQaa	slowly mix the kitten chow with adult cat food   keep doing this until all of it is regular cat food   it will take him a couple of weeks to warm up to it, but if he is hungry he will eat, he wont let himself starve.|`|x0BKX1XWaa	i'm not sure you should call a vet. plus if he likes it let him eat it.|`|njCyVnKjaa	I have a male cat who just turned 3.Like most cats he is very picky when it comes to food. Usually you mix the new food and the old ( my cat sorted the food so it didn't really work) or you just leave the new food out. He will eventually get hungry and eat it.Try to control his amount of food if he still refuses to eat anything else because I think kitten chow have a alot of protein in it and it's important you don't overfeed your cat.|`|KOX2J7uXaa	As you know a cat's needs change throughout thier stages of life. As a kitten they need that excess protien and nutrients to grow and develop properly, but as they get older excess of those things can cause more harm than good. At 1 year of age a cat reaches adult hood and is no longer growing so excess nutrition make his kidney's and liver work harder to filter them. After 1 year of age it is time to transition to an adult cat food that is balanced to fit it's proper needs. Obesity also causes many health problems, making the heart and lungs work harder, not to memntion stress on the joints. It takes one mile of blood vessel to support one pound of fat! Think of a hose, the longer it is the less pressure and longer it takes the water to travel from the spiket to the spout, now think of that as a vessel carrying blood. Later in life a cat should be changed to a senior diet but that age is about 7 years old for a cat. With that being said I know cat's can be finiky eaters, so you just have to find the right shape, size, and taste of food that appeals to your cat. Find a good quality adult cat food and gradually mix the old food with the new. Even if he picks out the old food and leaves the new keep doing this every day until the old food is gone and only the new is left. Trust me, eventually your kitty will become hungry and give in to his appetite. You can always mix a wet adult formula with dry food to help encourage him to eat. I do suggest though you make the switch to an adult diet since your cat is well into adulthood now and has differtent nutritional needs.|`|JeNKlpMUaa	my cat was the same way. just leave him the food. if he's really hungry, he'll just eat it.
b0f1169c2e4176c7d4ef22c1b9dff6b9aa	Please listen to me.  ASK YOUR VET.  As you can see from your answers, there are some very strong opinions out there.  I asked the same question a few times here and got similar answers.  As you can see, some people write lenghty replies citing sources, percentages, etc.  The arguments sound reasonable and logical.  I foolishly followed their advice and my cat ended up at the emergency room this weekend.  Very costly mistake!  Not just for my pocketbook, but for my poor kitty.    Your longest answer was actually cut and pasted from numerous other yahoo questions.  Do you think it's a coincidence that the guy answers so many cat food questions?  I'm guessing that some of these perpetual answerers are employed by these lesser known companies as a form of marketing.    I'm serious; I tried what they suggested and my cat got sick and the vet told me point blank it was the food,    If you can't trust your vet, you need to change vets.  FEED KITTY WHAT YOUR VET TELLS YOU!!!  The advice of strangers on yahoo answers is not reliable.|`|JeNKlpMUaa	Purina Healthful Life!!!|`|rIDc1L8Vaa	i always get fancy feast|`|X4v0AQyeaa	I personally think Purina Cats of all ages is the best because I feed it to my three wonderful kittys and they really seem to like. I also fed them to  one of my late cats who had stomach problems and it didn't make him sick.|`|wxRPKEeYaa	Totally Frisky's. Just because that is what I feed my cat & it is better for them. Fancy Feast is too expensive and has too many ingredients for my cats. I've never tried purina healthful life, but my friends say its really good & that's what they feed their cats. So I would say either friskys or purina healthful life. Fancy feast is just way too expensive unless you like it.|`|rLzfhCJxaa	All are crappy- Ken S and troubles gave you a good answer.

ALWAYS.|`|doWkvrDNaa	friskys thats the only thing my kat will eat|`|sOaqLLS6aa	Purina, but it depends on what type of cat you have, house cat? Outdoor? Exotic? Really if you have a high maintenance cat then the cat will need healthy, pricier food. Outdoor cats who get a lot of exercise should be fine with purina|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Neither... both are crap!    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Excellent raw feeding information for cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...

Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|AQsiugSpaa	Actually none of these foods are high quality. Cats need meat protein for excellent nutrition, and food that does not contain grain, by products or other "stuffers" to bulk up the food.    If I were you, I would change brands slowly to Wellness brand, Natural Balance, Nutro or Evo, which can be obtained at PetCo.    If you cannot get to a PetCo, you can purchase these brands at http://www.petfooddirect.com. They have a huge assortment of high line foods.     Wellness is actually not that much more expensive than Fancy Feast, and Natural Balance is also around the same price.    Here is a great article on feline nutrtion for you.  http://www.catinfo.org/    Even if the better brands cost a little more than the supermarket brands, the money you can potentially save having a healthier cat will well make up for the difference in the long run.

And I treat him with canned gravy food (Whiskas)  occasionally. It's important to balance out your cats diet. It's Ok to give him some milk too, but you should be careful...they can get worms.Iv'e been following this diet and my cat is perfectly healthy even though he tilts a wee bit towards the chubby side :)

bPdqwkpPaa	Honey, he's a puppy!  He's a mutt that likely came from a bad background and constantly telling him that he's doing wrong isn't going to cure him.     You can't expect him to be housebroken at 7 weeks old.  Because he was taken too early, it's likely that no one ever worked with him and that he was allowed to pee everywhere.  It could take months to overcome this.     The biting is normal behaviour for a puppy.  Again, because he was removed so young, mom did not get a real chance to correct him and socialize him.  Biting is a HUGE problem in dogs removed from mom too soon.      Learn his name?   He's a puppy.  Don't expect magic.     The drinking too much is not a behavioural issue and it scares me that you'd try and correct him for this.  If he's drinking excessively, then he needs to see a vet to rule out kidney problems, systemic problems, thyroid problems, and diabetes, among other issues.    I wish you nothing but success with your lab/boxer mix, but I really don't think that you are being realistic right now.  Are you sure that you have the right home for this dog?|`|AA10112346	Your mutt needs a trainer before your mutt gets out of hand.    I want to get blocked too!    Your dog is a mongrel mutt. You should NOT have taken the dog that early. What is wrong with you? That is illegal.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I hope you got your mutt from a shelter and not a 'breeder'.      Puppies bite, chew, and everything in between.  He's 7 weeks old and isn't going to learn everything overnight.  It WILL take him a little bit before he learns his name, tricks and anything else.      You have to take your puppy outside every hour, about 10 mins after he eats and drinks.  Take him to the same door each time and say something like 'Go potty', 'Go outside', 'Go pee'...something like that.  Each time he goes potty, (outside) give him lots of praise and treats.  If he goes potty inside, no praise or treats.  You could also go to your local pet store and ask for books on training puppies.  They should more than willing to help you.    Good Luck!|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	product of poor breeding..    high energy dog..  needs exercise and training daily    inhibited biting , amongst other things is a learned trait that only a mom and littermates can provide    block me|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Hey, guess what?

During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums.    His peeing is probably his marking on your house. Your dog is trying to identify his territory.     Check out these links for some help. good luck!|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	he bits everything because he is teething, he doesn't learn his name yet because he is still 2 Young,he pees in the house because he is marking his territory and will stop wen he is about 3 or 4 months, and all dogs drink when they are thirsty|`|zguucR8yaa	You need to give him time. At that young age, their memory and attention span is very limited. You have to be consistant. Maybe a puppy training class would help you learn to train him.  What on earth is a boxadore anyway?|`|qehH3fobaa	Well for one thing the pup is only 7 weeks. it is a baby. He will grow out of the biting. With the peeing problem that will take some time and training. They don't come potty trained.Sorry.   With the drinking to much. you need a feeding and watering schedule.   For instance feed a breakfast. then let him free feed( only give the amount recommended on dog food bag.) then feed a dinner about 4:30pm.   By breakfast and dinner I mean small amounts on can food.     then pick up the food(that was not eaten from the bowl) and water at 5:00pm do not offer food or water till morning. he will not dehydrate in that shout on time.   His bladder will grow with age.     Good luck with your new pup.  Also please get min fixed between 4-6 months on age. After that they have a tendency to mark their territory. Even in doors.    EDIT- Good for you for getting the pup. it is kind of like adopting a dog. Please,Please,Please just  peasant  with the pup and also be constant with the training.    Hang in there it does get better with age.....

oo2Hqqanaa	In my opinion, organisations such as the Kennel club offer no more than the "prestige" of membership. They will take your money yet give very little in return. If you are taking your pup to obedience classes, there will be at least one of the instructors that will point you in the direction of a good local "agility school".

Over the years I have had close experience with 6 different males.  You'll find this breed at a rescue shelter or very reputable breeder by contacting your local county kennel club, listed in the phone book.  Do not look for this breed from a BYB for a lesser purchase price.     If it's a puppy you want, It is important for you to be educated on how to train up a puppy with children around, no matter what the breed.  A local puppy kindergarten class should be affordable, yes, there were children at ours.      Whatever you choose, have the children with you interacting with the puppy more than one visit prior to purchase or adoption (great idea, too.) Let them observe how the puppy is properly handled.    If it's an older dog you want,  positive exposure to children is a requirement.  Not a recommendation, a requirement.  Know the dog's history. Make sure that dog has not been abused.    Have you had pets growing up?  This is quite a responsibility for your age, a puppy is dedication for a good 10 years or more.  Your lifestyle may change a few times looking ahead.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	There are too many to list. Any dog can be trained to behve in appropriate ways around children.

I'm not sure, I have a sheltie who's GREAT, but it doesn't depend on the breed, it depends also on the energy level, breed, age, etc... All puppies will be nippy and jumpy, and excited, a-lot of adopted dogs may be nippy or have some issues, other adopted dogs can be the PERFECT pet. Take the kids to help you choose the dog, that's the best way to do it in my book :)
90cyv9f0aa	100 grams per cat per day of wet food is the optimum calorie intake for indoor cats along with 50 grams of dry food and double that to 200 wet and 100 dry food grams per cat per day for cats that are allowed to go outside.   But the real key is to try and spread this amount over at least 4 feedings daily which is tricky... MOST CATS EAT TOO MUCH and this is sadly unhealthy.    Cats will also develop behavioral patterns towards food that will indicate they are always hungry... if they are overfed.    Be careful...DO NOT OVERFEED YOUR KITTIES...|`|WqsJf4kgaa	This is the right amount of food to be giving a kitten of eight months old.  Cats always want to seem to eat more food, so I wouldn't worry about overfeeding or underfeeding them.

When they get older, you'll want to only give them 2 solid meals a day, otherwise you will be overfeeding them.

It was always my understanding that cats don't over eat and ate only when hungry and 'not for the sake of eating' like a dog would. Could there be any underlying problem here? Although you say Stanley eats more than Elvis and is a bit bigger have they been treated for worms etc. Do they play and exercise a lot? If not, then maybe that's why he is putting on weight? If he's not very agile try enticing him to play with you if you have some string or a mouse.

This is going to be very hard...I suggest that you have some help.  Sometimes the oils in the skin build up...which could cause the aroma that you're smelling.  I have found that dogs who have not been bathed before do better when there is a bath that is full of warm water that goes just barely over the belly area.  Have a large cup that you can use to rinse with.  Sometimes water running will scare them, so avoid any extra trauma (change it a little more each bath time).  Speak softly and gently under no circumstances raise your voice or show upset...it will just make your dog feel more anxiety.  I will say that some dogs don't mind a bath at all...so I really hope this is the case.  Start when bathing from the top of the neck down...put enough soap on to make a lather.  To make sure no soap gets near the eyes is why you don't directly put soap on the head.  I usually use a wash cloth and gently wipe the area down.  I am sure that you did not have the knowledge that your dog should be bathed...so no lectures here.  I am just thankful you asked the question...now you know.  Make sure if it is cold where you live that you have a few warm towels.  You can try to blow dry him...but if he is afraid of the blow dryer when you do your own hair..just avoid the added anxiety.  Just keep him covered until he is dry, keep him in a warm area as well.  Good luck.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	OMG. Your poor dog.  You haven't bathed him in 2 years?

OR if you have the money take him to a groomer and to get a bath and then he can get put under the drier to get dry faster.    To get stinky in the first place he may have rolled in something smelly or he could just be smelly since he has never had a bath.  You should check into the breed you have and see what the grooming needs are.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Not all dogs need actual baths.  If they clean themselves, are kept in a clean environment, have their bedding washed, and are brushed regularly, they may be fine.  (You haven't said whether he has a short or long coat, that makes a difference too of course).    But, if your dog is starting to smell, then obviously something has to change.    If you're nervous of bathing him yourself, what about using a dog groomer?  Some even often mobile services out to your home.  Just keep him warm inside until he's completely dry.    Also, if he never had this odour before, may be worth checking his health too.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	best thing is to do is bath him and whatever he/she sleeps on wash it good. just blow dry him with hair dryer!!! also go to local pet store and get the perfume for dogs that comes in all driffent smells!!! use it all the time on myne!!|`|X5HhX9mGaa	My dog is 7 and has never had a smell until now maybe they used the bathroom on themsleves or something bc i even think its crazy|`|KvUJZa1Paa	take him/her to vet or groomer and have anal glands expressed, sounds like they are clogged.|`|BqO5xKLkaa	You're not allowed to bathe him?

9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	Just based on the info you gave me I would get a second opinion.  I would be very concerned about renal failure.  Producing that much urine that frequently is very abnormal.      Your vet said the urine was watered down, so I'm assuming they mean unconcentrated--another sign that kidneys may not be working properly.  Why was the urine dark?  Unconcentrated urine is usually very pale yellow to colorless unless there is blood in it.  Bloody urine can be anywhere from bright red to a brownish color.     Was the urine ever sent out for a culture? It can be difficult to see white blood cells and bacteria (indications of an infection) in dilute urine. Did the vet look at the urine sediment (look under the microscope for casts, crystals and cells).  Just doing a dip stick is not enough.      And if your dog is urinating this much why are they having you limit water intake.  A dog peeing like this should not have water restricted--you are running the risk of dehydration---if severe enough can be very serious.     what kind of pills were given?  were they antibiotics.  Was blood work done?  I would want to look at the kidney and liver function.  Any indication of diabetes on the blood work?    Now you say he dribbles----that concerns me.  has the vet done x-rays to look for stones., how about an ultrasound to look at the bladder wall and kidneys.      It sounds like it might be something serious, especially with his history of previous problems.  I hope all goes well.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Man, your pup has gone through a LOT!    My only educated guess would be renal failure.  My shih tzu started needing to pee ALL the time, and his urine test indicated that his kidneys were going out.  After three days at the vet, they were able to flush him out, and he is fine now.  Another guess would be diabetes.  My siberian developed diabetes as an old gal, and she peed so often that she actually wouldn't make it to the bathroom in time.    Good luck, I hope that there is nothing seriously wrong!|`|C5RdjN57aa	Have they checked him for bladder stones?  That will make him feel like he has to go a lot, make his urine dark in color, and start blocking the urines passage out.

If you offer a means for him to cool down and he feels he needs it, he'll use it, if not, he's probably just fine.  I wouldn't wet him down, as a body can quickly go from over heating to hypothermia because the body's regulatory system is bonkers.  They can best use a cool spot on their own verses being manually cooled down.

kRUqHPdlaa	It sounds like you had an ammonia spike.    Basically, when your fish poo, and also when you have uneaten food in the tank, it starts to break down and produces ammonia - this is REALLY bad for fish!  In a 'mature' tank, bacteria will have developed that will convert this to less harmful substances, but these are quite easy to kill off. Using tap water, for example, contains chlorine which will kill the bacteria.  Also, an excess of food (did your mum overfeed the tanks?) can cause more ammonia to be present than the bacteria can handle.    As for the white fungi, that's probably exactly what it is. It sounds like an infection brought in by your new fish. You can get medications to treat these, and they're worth having around in case.    Things to do:  1. Cut down on feeding - fish tend to not need as much food as you think - only feed as much as they'll eat in a couple of minutes, twice a day maximum.  2. If you're using tap water, make sure you use a product (easily available at your fish store) that removes the chlorine. I wouldn't recommend distilled or bottled water, as they do not contain necessary minerals that your fish need. Tap water + dechlorinator is fine.  3. Do not change your filter! When it gets dirty, clean the sponges out by swishing them around in old tank water to rinse the gunk out. 99% of the beneficial bacteria in your tank live in the filter, so don't throw them away!  4. Start changing your water every week - not all of it, about 30-40% a week should be fine.  5. Read up on the hobby - there's plenty of websites out there that can help. I've put a couple of good sites below.     If you try and treat the tanks for the fungi, follow the advice above, and slowly start to restock your tank, you should be fine - good luck, and happy reading!|`|hFU31zm7aa	It sounds like you have allot of fish its com-men for fish to get stuck in filters but if they are getting hurt you should get a different kind you might want to get a bigger tank so your fish can spread out. the white stuff is ick u can pick up som medicine until then seperate the sick and heathy fish. get a net type thing with small holes in it and tape it around the entrence of the filter i have this problem my self.|`|EKg97zZlaa	i know what your fish died of!    Gill Flukes...  signs of Gill Flukes  -accelerated breathing/shortness of breath  -reddening and swelling of gills  -rubbing the head or gill covers along the bottom of your tank or against decorations in the tank    Treatment...  difficult; pet stores sell various excellent medications to use for this condition.Be sure to follow the directions carefully,and use only in water with hardness of at least 15'' dh.when used on small fish like yours the dosage has to be exact and possibly a litle bit reduced  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...     first of all make sure that before you add tap water to a tank to must get the chlorine out,then let the tank cycle for about 2 days minimum before adding any fish to it.      Make sure that in the filter where the water is suck ed in (that tube that comes out of the filter into the water) make sure that the holes where the water enters are smaller than your fish,even if you can't feel the suction very much those fish can feel it due to their small bodies and light weight (even if they are healthy)      try reading some manuals before buying more fish! =D    Good Luck!|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Ahh well this is a problem.    In teh first tank, when you leave, don't trust other people with your fish.  Most petstores contain 1-week feeders shaped like shells or whatever that u throw in and sink to the bottom and last for that amount of days.  Your filter may not be strong enough if your fish died.  Catfish shouldn't die that easily.  Another problem may be what water you used.  YOU CANNOT USE TAP WATER.  Only distilled water or bottled water will work.  You also therefore can't dump in any water in the bag when buying new fish.    In the second tank, the scars were more likely from other fish biting them.  Guppies are susceptible to this because of their pretty tails.  The fungus is called ick.  If your fish are strong enough, they can recover without medication.  However, drops and medicine to prevent it should be used anyway.|`|3lB8bhcaaa	oh gosh....  well my suggestion is Start all over again.  Don't buy anymore fish until....this happens  u need to get rid of all the water in the aquarium  rinse it all out good (decor etc.)  buy a new filter  put new water in tank, make sure u have water conditioner bacteria supplement, etc.  let the aquarium run for a good week At LEAST 3 Days   and then add new fish, float them for a good 30-60 minutes  feed them twice a day (once in morning and once at night)  in the 10 gallon aquarium do a 10% water change each week  and just a little in the 2 gal aquarium.  and u should be good to go.  But just in case, do NOT Buy really expensive fish,  and don't overcrowd the aquarium, im gonna say a maximum of 5 fish for your aquarium,   and get a snail or an algae eater to.  and they also sell food for the algae eater too.  I hoped I helped  OH AND I dissagree with that alex kid up there, u can use tap water but  u have to make sure u use medication and bacteria supplement.

bPdqwkpPaa	Are we talking shock collars? I have no reason to use one.  With proper training that's constantly kept up at home, they simply arent necessary.      For the average pet owner, 99% of the time they are a lazy owner's way out. An owner who didn't start training with a puppy and isn't committing enough time to training now.    If we are talking choke chains and prong collars, then get a good trainer and ask them to teach you how to use it and to help you select one for your dog.|`|AA11992723	those collars will not have positive results for all dogs. some dogs, especially in the herding and terrier group, react bad to that kind of punishment.    you'll have much better luck with positive reinforcement training. the time is worth it. there's no quick easy fix that even training collars can do.    here i'll share many experiences: Shock collar on dog. Dog sees another dog or child as he's being shocked for not coming back in time or for whatever reason. but he doesnt know why he feels pain except what he SEES while he is feeling pain. Dog then becomes child and interdog aggressive.    add: digging is usually a sign he's not stimulated enough mentally. teach him commands or play games with him..you can do alot of harm shocking that puppy and create a very expensive and problematic dog with a shock collar. at least get the help of a behaviorist if you go ahead with it for the sake of the dog..|`|ctiKoGGfaa	Digging is normal and fun for dogs.

I train dogs to work as much as a 1/4 mile away from my side. It is important to understand that the collar can't do anything that that isn't done with a normal collar and lead. It just dose it by pushing a button instead of popping a lead.  tri-Tronics is the brand that I use.    If I wasn't training field trial/hunt test dogs, I doubt that I would use one at all.|`|aCqSF87Raa	By training collar i assume you mean e-collar? Or do you mean Prong/Pinch collars, slip collars....?    I use an e-collar on my dog. Now before i get thumbs down and loads of ignorant ramblings about how bad they are and how bad of an owner i am for using one...     It was recommended by my trainer for some of her more annoying (and dangerous) behaviors. We tried all methods of positive re-enforcement training (praise for good behavior, time-outs, ignoring her, etc), we tried other negative re-enforcement training (removing her from the room, noise distraction, water squirts, etc) and finally we went with an e-collar.    I was instructed in how to introduce it, how to use it, and when to change levels. She is on level two, which is next to nothing. I tried it on myself and it feels very strange, but it does not hurt. I would never have put it on her if it hurt at all, as pain is not how you teach. It is no more uncomfortable than a leash correction or a squirt of water in the face.    She wears the collar on and off during the day, sometimes with days in between, so she cannot associate the collar with any type of correction. She does not see us with the remote and she does not notice us watching her when she is corrected.     We back up good behavior with a treat and praise, and only correct if she doesn't immediately listen to a command or if the behavior is dangerous.     For example: if she hops on our end table she gets an "eheheh" - if she hops off she gets praise, but if she doesn't we wait a second then i push the buzzer... as soon as she is off, i give a reward for listening. However if she goes for something dropped on the floor i immediately push the buzzer - that something dropped could easily be a pill or something sharp, and i would rather her have a few seconds of discomfort than an emergency trip to the vet.    Within a week we noticed a change. Small, but it's there. She no longer tries to climb on our end table (it's right next to the couch and we place food and stuff on there.) She no longer tries to bolt out our doors. We added more exercise, some different treats, and more outings to the local park and that calmed her down enough to take care of the rest.    So for us, it worked. We still do backup training and she wears it from time to time, but i rarely have to do anything with it. We used it mainly because my parents asked about it as a solution to the bolting and eating dropped items (she's gotten loose several times and we had a few vet scares.)     This is what we use:  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...|`|062cfd9edb812ebceaa817bc46b024eaaa	What kind of training do you want to do? Basic obediance or walking by your side (heeling)? I use a head collar for my dogs called The Gentle Leader. It's not harmful like choke or prong collars and it puts the pressure at the back of their head versus the neck which stops the pulling about 90%! I love this thing. It's a miracle for dog walking and it's an instant stop to pulling (or it has been for my dogs and I have a Wheaten Terrier and a Weimeraner). It also comes with a dvd so you can use it to obediance train as well and the dvd teaches you how. It's between $15-$20 at any pet supermarket (wal-mart probably won't have 'em). The only drawback is that my dogs try to stop to take them off their face with their paw. It takes some getting used to on the dog's side but pawing at it doesn't make it any less effective. Hope this helps!

Black, yellow, chocolate.. the one's I have met have always been very calm and loyal.  Most of these behavior traits you are seeking will require training though, not just a specific breed.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Easy - get a pit bull.  They do shed (most dogs do), but are extremely loyal, sweet, and great protectors!!!  Our pit is our 3 1/2 year-old son's best bud, and has never even growled at him.  She does give him a fair share of kisses though!  Labs are awesome too, but require more exercise than 30-45 minutes per day (in fact, most dogs do).|`|hfu63hoxaa	GET A BEAGLE. they are sooooo nice and are to said as the friendliest dog in the world. i have one and it always lays next to u when u sit down. . they arent aggressive but they are super playful. they have lots of love and they dont shed much at all. + my beagle has never broken anything. if u get a beagle get a male beagle they are better in personality... they do not druel at all! a blue spotted beagle is very smart so if u want one get a blue spotted. very strong and when they do get hurt they give a puppy look u pat on the head and right back to play! they always want to play and when u dont like i said they lie down with u. it does  love to go outside(if a good weight and healthy)mostly in the mud lol. since u dont want to walk it muck i would get a strong all terrain chain so it would last years outside. be careful if it gets on the lose have some treats in hand they are very fast.    so hope this helped|`|2cb452ad1394f4b424e3b72e7818648faa	labrador Retriever     click on the link , then click on a picture and a breed and it will tell you if there good for kids .    http://www.dogsindepth.com/list_of_all_d...

8owlj2xHaa	Wow a good bit of misinformation in some of these answers.     It is said that the outstretched tentacles are to aid in Photosynthesis, they tend to do this more when hungry.  Do not aim a power head at him. To much flow will stress him and make him move. A moving anemone is an UNHAPPY anemone. They also use a lot of energy to move it puts them under a lot of stress. It also could be you do not have strong enough light for him.|`|07lCZh28aa	Then he is doing really well. Make sure if you have a powerhead, aim it sort of towards him. He will love it.    He will change his places a couple of times, till he gets comfortable in a good spot to catch food, good light, and a good flow of water hitting him(but not too much).|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Well anemones don't usually retract unless being attacked or buffeted by a strong tide, so it probably won't retract.  Looks better that way tho.|`|Gta9wO3taa	Please add more info on your tank. Anemones are funny, mine had bulbs at the store and was bleached. After awhile the tentacles got rid of the bulbs. Now my anemone is full of color after 2 years and from time to time has bulb tips. Don't worry feed once a week for the first month then go down to twice a month feedings. Some people think long tentacles means they are looking for food, but that has not been proven.|`|0jZ4afUJaa	hey man we got the same avatar!! tripy! but yea anemones don't usually retract unless being attacked or buffeted by a strong tide, so it probably won't retract
u61yKsE3aa	I had some and I loved them.  I thought they were pretty easy.  They are very social so I would keep more than one.  you will want same gender otherwise you will have lots of degus.  They eat gerbil food with fresh fruits and veggies.  They should also have alphalfa and timothy hay.  They need a large cage and love to climb so I would go with a multi level.  I had a huge cage so I only cleaned it weekly.  If your cage is small you will need to clean it more.  They like to bathe in dust just like a chinchilla.  The biggest thing is they are chewers.  not like a gerbil or rabbit like if you have a plastic cage the will chew their way out.  They need tons of wood to chew and you need to be a metal case for your water bottle they will eat it.  They also need a ceramic bowl they will eat a plastic one.  But seriously besides the chewing they are awesome.
GduRpnn0aa	Unfortunately, what most vets do no tell you is that using products like Program, Frontline etc, can cause allergic reactions to cats as well as liver damage to both you and your cat, due to the chemical insecticides that they contain.     Instead you should try to use something a bit more natural to get rid of your cats fleas. I use Feline Target Spray, as it contains a natural insect repellant. http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-fleas-p6...    Also, to help your cats hair grow back you could apply Feline Ouch Away made by the same company as above. It is a natural treatment for cat skin irritation.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	That's a common side effect of any of the spot on treatments.  She may be sensitive to something in the Frontline.  Maybe next time try Advantage?  Some cats are sensitive to all of the spot-ons, some only to a certain kind.|`|WZDlBuUyaa	She could be allergic to it.|`|mbhAPC2naa	She could be allergic to the treatment, or you could be using treatment for short haired cats instead of long haired.
aBLYU5FKaa	No, colors make no difference when it comes to cattle.  They are more attracted to movement.  When the bullfighter waves the red flag, it is actually the movement that attracts them.  I was watching Mythbusters, and they had one of their people dressed in a red bodysuit stand in the middle of an arena with a bull, and had two other people running around, and the bull never went after the guy in red.    Also, contrary to belief, bulls are not color blind.  They see colors, but they are more muted and not as bright.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	No.It's the movement that catches their eye.|`|2x2LYkj4aa	due to most people's beliefs, no. bulls are mostly color blind. its just the fact that this waving thing is in front of them that may look threatening, so they charge at it, which is their instinct, and also how they are trained.|`|Ma7mwVt6aa	Absolutely not, cattle are color blind, just like most animals.|`|vLiKVSrmaa	no|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	no, it's mostly the movement.
bFzu835Aaa	Just keep her warm, watch her feet for signs of frostbite injury, and try to keep her in a pen or someplace you can have hay or other substrate down to act as a barrier from the cold at night.|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Just keep her warm. Don't think there's anything else you can do. :]|`|HA8Ehs3Gaa	She should be fine. Keep her somewhere warm and figure out what kept her frozen to the ground. Watch her feet to make sure they get back to normal and can actually walk like normal. Good luck with her.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	well just be there mainly
lQpqSb8yaa	not a pug, they won't be up to as much excercise as your situation allows.  You should definately rescue - many dogs are given up for the sole reason that they have enery and their previous owners couldn't handle it.  You obviously can, so go for a larger dog, and a rescue!    Good Luck!|`|KlkUj6uFaa	One that needs the most exercise.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	omg i lovee pugs|`|NKE6Apz9aa	sheep dog!   or pug|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	no pug,, they have breathing issues..    border collie would be nice    http://www.bcrescue.org|`|fUhosu5Raa	pugs are ugly.. i would get a dog from a shelter since soooo many dogs are getting put to sleep now a days|`|AA10112346	Beagle!|`|1XLZdOcQaa	The two best things to consider in getting a dog are your personality and your lifestyle coz most likely, the dog you're getting will have to adapt to it.

I think you should get a mix breed from an animal shelter. So many  animals in shelters get put down every year just because they can't find a home. You will feel really great knowing that you potentially,  saved a life. But if you want a purebred, I'd go for the sheepdog.  They need a lot more exercise than a pug and they have a lot   more energy, too. If you like exercise then your dog should. That  way your dog can join you on walks and/or runs at the park.    Whatever you choose to do, I hope you have fun and find your  perfect furry friend!!!|`|8prsWNXYaa	i have a fenced in yard and i have two beautiful shetland sheepdogs they love the fenced in yard and run and play  mine are brother and sister and they grew up together and get along fine .get a sheltie there loving and fun and gentle dogs and smart dogs you do have to brush them alot maybe twice a week and take it for bathst and grooming every  4 months . good luck.|`|FrmKbM8waa	Mutt!!! ? from ur local animal shelter =]|`|rCc5uBDTaa	sheep dog.  they're active.  and cute(:|`|DPnaFbeOaa	Pugs are so ugly, you should get a sheep dog mix or whatever.

J9xA5iEMaa	Chickens aren't noisy at all unless something is trying to get them, and roosters aren't actually that noisy either unless you have a bunch of them.  Like everyone said though, just make sure that where you live allows chickens because not all places do & if you're planning on getting eggs out of them, make sure you have laying hens for that or the eggs won't stay good & keep the roosters away from them.  Trust me, I've owned plenty of them, you don't want a fertilized egg to eat!|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	First you might need planning permission to keep chickens so check this out out your local town hall.   Chickens during the day make a lovely noise that makes life rural and easy going. When they start doodle dooing at 5 in  the morning then they are a great pain for everybody within earshot. So be very careful and even with planning permission be prepared for the complaints.|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Roosters are pretty loud and sound obnoxious. But the chickens are pretty quiet they just sorta bock to themselves. I think it sounds cute.|`|u61yKsE3aa	Usually only the roosters are loud enough for your neighbors to hear.  stick with hens and you should be fine just make sure they are aloud where you are( ie no city ordinances)|`|FC5BxnoPaa	Usually they are fairly quiet, unless they are frightened.  Be sure you only have one rooster or you will end up with a lot of fights and noise.|`|rDs2e1Nhaa	Chickens are not very noisy but there will be  smell and vermin tend to lurk around cages. Ask the council if it would be acceptable and also how many you could have.
1XLZdOcQaa	Maybe your dog is constipating. Most dogs pass one or two stools a day. It's not uncommon, though, for a dog to go a day or two without having a bowel movement.A common cause of constipation--especially in middle-aged and older dogs--is not drinking enough water. When your dog's dehydrated, the colon can overcompensate, resulting in harder feces that are more difficult to pass.    Check out this link and find more helpful info on how to go about this. good luck!|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Be patient.  She will.    Check around to make sure she's not making "deposits" in out of the way places you're not aware of.    Unless she seems uncomfortable or in distress I wouldn't worry about it.  If she does seem to be having problems, then a vet visit might be in order.    What goes in must come out -- eventually.|`|BuY3rjQhaa	Take the dog to the vet. That's a very serious problem. Which can lead to death in dogs.|`|LWEceVT4aa	I've heard of people feeding there dogs canned pumpkin, when they were constipated, so give it a shot!!!|`|AA11825776	some cooked rice with a little burger and about a quarter of a teaspoon of laxitive should help.Did you switch dog foods when you got her? that could be the reason.|`|hfu63hoxaa	buy puppy fiber it will help it worked 4 me. and if its cold this will be a problem. if it doesnt go 4 another day bring it inside and let it do its bussiness there because its warm. and also this is a big reason. if your dog is used to pooping on hay and u switched to grass then it will take about 3 days 4 it to get used to it. or its eating wronge(cat food) bring it to the vet and ask about these reasons^|`|fboC1N7gaa	Canned pumpkin will help (trust me) as will salmon oil.  Also, sometimes my dog won't poop unless he has had a lot of vigourous exercise, so you might want to try taking her out for at least a 45 min walk and see if she goes.  If she doesn't, call the vet.|`|r62mRF3waa	Tou should go to the store and by some medicine for that. You break it up in small pieces and put in her food. Good luck.|`|AA10112346	Feed her and then exercise the poop out of her.. literally. : }  If she doesnt go to the vet.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Canned pumpkin can help with constipation.  If it continues, contact a vet
07lCZh28aa	Good idea. What other fish do you have with them??|`|0TFuR8IRaa	A 2.5 gallon tank is too small for and 4 fish you might want to upgrade to 10 gallons. think of it like one inch of fish = 1 gallon|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The 2.5 gallon is too small for danios.    The curved spine could have been due to poor nutrition.
bPdqwkpPaa	There isn't one.      Instead, she needs to contact purebred rescue and relinquish the dog to them.  http://www.akc.org/breeds/rescue.cfm    That's assuming that she used a puppy mill/backyard breeder to purchase the puppy and doesn't have a clause in her contract that requires that she return the dog to them.|`|AA11992723	dont list the dog in any newspaper or online community. people who want dogs for lab testing routinely check them for dogs and other unwanted animals. very irresponsible of your friend. surrender to a rescue ask the dog's vet to help you find a foster rescue.    IF you go ahead and list the dog somewhere anyway make sure you get at least 2 references from the potential buyer, ask what vet he will take the dog to and have a contract where you can take the dog back if any abuse or harm is done to the dog.|`|AA10112346	SURRENDER the dog to a shelter. Why make a profit? Just make sure it goes to a good home.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	find a good home dont sell wut kind and age|`|Eug52iQDaa	They can put an ad in the paper or any number of on-line sales sites.  It's after they start getting calls that is more important.  They need to accept applications for the dog.  Why do people want the dog?  How long do they intend to keep it?  How many dogs have they had in the recent past, and where are those dogs now?  Interview people carefully.  Then, go to the dog's prospective new home and SEE if the people actually have a fenced yard or not.  See if the home is safe for the dog.  Meet everyone in the home and make sure that the dog is going to be a welcome addition to all of the members of the home.      Make sure that they have names and contact information written down for the new owners.  Call and check every couple of days for a while to make sure the dog is adjusting well.

Too bad.|`|lQpqSb8yaa	classifieds are a good option if you plan to do house checks on people, or require references.  otherwise, anyone can buy your dog.  another option is to go thru the humane society in your area.

You can also post on www.petfinder.com to get your dog adopted - but you may have to go thru a humane society as a courtesy listing.  the BEST option is to find someone you already know and trust to take it, such as a family member, friend, or neighbor.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	Try finding a good home for it, you could put up papers, or walk him around town and tell people that they can take him, or in the end just give him to a non killing care center. Why is your friend just going to give a dog away, because they are board with it?! When you take in a dog, you should keep and take care of it in till it dies or you don;t have the money to buy it food or something. I feel sorry for the little guy.=(|`|fboC1N7gaa	Don't sell it. Give it to a no-kill shelter or a friend you know would give it a good home.  A dog is a living creature not a used car, so you really shouldn't "sell" it at all.
AA10129150	Please take your cat to the vet and tell them everything that is going on. You might need to have some blood drawn to make sure that the cat's organs are functioning properly. There is really no way to know what is going on without a vet looking at your cat, sometimes these changes can just be age or time of the year, but it is best to have the cat looked at just to make sure.|`|KOX2J7uXaa	I would be concerned about his change in behavior and onset of symptoms. The fact that he is chubby increases his risk for having developed diabetes or heart problems. Congestion, snoring, sneezing, lethargy can all be signs of a respiratory problem. Refusing his favorite treats is another red flag. There are many illnesses/diseases that could be the causing this but only a veterinarian and proper examination/testing can determine that. I hope your kitty just has a cold, but this could be more serious and the sooner you find out the better. I recommend you get him an appointment to see a doctor right away.|`|LnHOn5JOaa	I would definitely bring him to the vet if you think there is something wrong. Being overweight could cause some of his symptoms. Have you had him since he was a kitten? If you got him from someone or a shelter he may be older then you think. But you should take him to see a vet.|`|0c5462a9878ff6bd05502d19e1c12ce9aa	Well there is a simple answer to your problem... Take him to the vet, if you are that concerned about your cat you should have already taken him to the vet.
AA11739700	Old ones are fatter, longer, and typically slower. Young ones show their dewlap (the skin flap on their neck) more.

Good luck!|`|hqBkLu40aa	Sounds like a high energy dog and will probably require a good run outside now and then. the main thing to remember is that if your dog is disobedient or doesn't pay attention well, he isn't getting enough exercise.|`|dc04e1c0c2a5baa20235a13a2c865ab8aa	sounds like he is going to have a lot of energy. im saying start at an hour walk a day. if he still goes nuts in the house then he needs more exercise.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Not all dogs require the same amount of exerciseexerciseexercise. In considering this question, we also must expand our human concept of exerciseexerciseexercise. DogDogDog exerciseexerciseexercise comes in aaa variety of forms not regularly practiced by people.    ExerciseExerciseExercise needs have very little to do with size. Instead breed tends to count the most. For example Jack Russell Terriers and Shelties often begin to misbehave when given too few dogdogdog exerciseexerciseexercise opportunities. On the other hand, aaa mastiff, and many other large dogs may be happy with aaa couple of daily walks in the park or aaa 15 minute game of catch the Frisbee.     Little dogs quite frequently require more exerciseexerciseexercise than larger dogs. Many exerciseexerciseexercise needs for small dogs can be satisfied in an apartment or back yard. If the small dogdogdog has adequate toys, or aaa dogdogdog or cat companion, the dogdogdog can generally meet all its exerciseexerciseexercise needs. However, dont miss walking the dogdogdog on aaa daily basis too; aaa walk proves healthy exerciseexerciseexercise for both the dogdogdog and its owner.    Mid-size breeds also vary in their need for exerciseexerciseexercise. Expect dogs that are natural hunters or herders to require more exerciseexerciseexercise. Beagles, hounds, border collies, Alaskan sled dogs, and Australian shepherds are naturally going to be restless if cooped up. They need time to run around, catch things, chase things, and to walk or jog.     Many of the working dogs benefit from having another dogdogdog companion. They also will benefit from visits to dogdogdog parks. AAA thirty minute to one hour visit to aaa dog park each day frequently gives the dogdogdog as much exerciseexerciseexercise as he needs because playing with other dogs requires exertion. Also expect to walk or jog with these dogs daily.  Some dogs also require mental exerciseexerciseexercise. Dogs, like people, can get bored. Certain dogs get bored enough to engage in undesirable behaviors like destroying potted plants or eating your shoes and furniture. New toys that require some work to get reward are fantastic for dogs that need aaa mental challenge. Also, daily interaction with your dogdogdog will help satisfy some mental exerciseexerciseexercise needs.  Since many dogs are mixed breeds, it may be hard to know what type of exerciseexerciseexercise requirements aaa dogdogdog has. Once you get aaa mixed breed dogdogdog observe its behavior. If the dogdogdog enjoys basking in the sun most of the day, it probably does not need as much exerciseexerciseexercise. Conversely, if the dogdogdog appears restless and wanders around the house or yard relentlessly, its needs may be better met by more exerciseexerciseexercise. Also, older dogs tend to have less daily exerciseexerciseexercise needs than do younger dogs.  As with people, be wary of providing too much exerciseexerciseexercise in hot temperatures. During hot months, allow your dogdogdog to take breaks and bring along water. Also choose exerciseexerciseexercise periods from the coolest parts of the day, like right before sunrise or right after sunset.|`|fboC1N7gaa	2 long walks daily and plenty of play time (fetch etc.)  You want to make sure he gets enough exercise and stimulation|`|AA11992723	he can definately use a run. use what resources you can. if you have schools nearby,  take him to the school fields at night so he can run use a long rope.  incorporate mental stimulation in his exercise routine to make him tired  too. if he has a retrieving personality, that's easy to just keep throwing the balls in water (you can buy a baby pool for $20 at target) that will tire him out in no time. or if he's got more of a spaniel personality you can practice hunting games with stuffed animals.|`|r62mRF3waa	A simple walk a day is enough, but you want to give him as much exercise as possible.

They can give you a good idea of his energy level.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	at least a walk per day|`|AA10112346	2 hours minimum daily.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Depends on the individual dog.    Kelpies can be very high energy.  Some spaniels too.  But not all - you can get laid back or 'lazy' dogs in all breeds.    Sometimes it is also more a matter of mental stimulation than physical.    A 30 min walk/run at the park may be enough physically, and then games/toys and interaction with you at home may meet the rest of his needs.

But if you use the proper training method I think anyone would do fine! I would suggest searching petfinder.com for a list of your local shelters that have bichons or buying from a reputable and responsible breeder.

He adores playing with water. If we give him a bowl on the floor we have to hold it down while he drinks. I'll be interested to see other answers to this question because right now he drinks out of the sink while I'm cleaning my teeth and we've conceded defeat by just putting a bowl in the sink and letting him jump up there. He's not allowed on any other surfaces but at least in the sink it doesn't matter if he plays. Funnily enough, he doesn't try to tip the water over in the sink.|`|WZDlBuUyaa	Our cats love doing that too! We got them a self waterer and it is too big for them to tip or move.|`|mbhAPC2naa	My cat for some reason doesn't like to drink out of bowls. After I take a bath, he jumps in there (our water doesn't turn off all the way) and starts licking the tip of the spigot that the water comes out of.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	you can go to walmart and get ceramic pet bowls that look really nice. There would be no way she could knock one of those over.|`|KqfTXGSUaa	If you find a solution, please share your information with me. My cat spills his water every time I give it to him. He actually puts his paws in the dish and licks the water from them. I think he likes to see the water ripple when he moves the dish. This drives me crazy! I tried the dish that has the attached water container but he still managed to tip it over.|`|AA10129150	It sounds like you have one of those common cat problems. My cat does the exact same thing. She even somehow spills water a foot away from her water dish without any water between the puddle and the dish. We are now using one of the large water dispensers like a water cooler but with a dish at the bottom. It works ok, but still we find water around her bowl from time to time.
acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	No I have never owned a Bat.... Bats are beautiful and mysterious and many people wonder about keeping them as pets as an exotic addition to any house. However, due to their wild nature, most bats kept in captivity live less than a year and usually suffer from depression and loneliness. If you are looking at taking care of one temporarily for an agency or to release into the wild you can follow these instructions.    1  Be aware of the state laws in your area and know that most bats are protected by a variety of rules and organizations and can not be kept without a license from the USDA and can not be transported without explicit permission from the CDC. If you have these things, there are a few things you can do to make your winged friend more comfortable.  Step2  Knowing as much as you can about your bat friend can be helpful in helping to care for it. Over half of the species of bats in the world are on the endangered list.  Step3  If you are installing a bat house on top of a tall pole, it should face toward the south and your home should be within 1/4 of a mile of water as bats need water, insects and variety to survive.  Step4  Placing these houses on the side of houses or on poles is the best way to protect your friends from predators. But, it should be placed within 20 to 25 feet of tree branches so that the bats have a place to hide and escape if attacked by predators smart enough to invade their neatly-made house.  Step5  Install your bat house in the summer and be patient. There isn't anything specific to attract bats to the house but most of the time the bats will find it a cozy getaway when they return in the summer.        *  Keep water close and make sure that your climate has enough bugs and other natural bats to make sure that your environment can handle and sustain your pets.      * Never try to handle a bat as some of them carry rabies and are not pets that should be kept indoors. Enjoy them from a distance and teach your children not to feed them candies or other treats, although this may be very tempting.|`|40dki79haa	Um.. yeh thats normal (NOT!!!!)|`|sGv3RebZaa	Well, I don't know that there is a normal type of pet to want, but I know very few people who actually have bats as housepets (at least, not in invitational situations) Bats are not generally domestic creatures.    But a fruit bat would not be a wise choice for a pet. They are very gergarious creatures and keeping one isolated away from its own kind will not be healthy. There is also the size to consider, since the fruit bat is large and needs lots of space. Feeding and caring concerns will range depending on the age and type of fruit bat.    I would suggest, as an option if you're into fruit bats, you can check with local shelters or wildlife organizations about volunteering to work with them and give them care in the wild.|`|l5qCHrsnaa	First off... do your research on this animal. LOTS OF RESEARCH!!! Fruit bats are wild animals so you need to take the time to understand what you need to do to take care of one. Also MAKE SURE that this animal is even legal in the state/country you live in. Some state/countries ban certain animals because they can disrupt the natural cycle of things if they get loose. So just do your research and remember that fruit bats are pack animals so you will need more then 2 and they need allot of room to fly around... do you have the finances for this? Etc. Think it through before you get one... just like any animal... hope this helps!!! :)     PS: No its not weird to want a fruit bat... they are kinda cute!
8bTder08aa	Well, I'd say either a GELDING or a mare would be okay for a beginner.  Nobody but an experienced horseman who is in the breeding business should have a stallion.    (A gelding, in case you didn't know, is a neutered male horse.  The vast majority of male horses are neutered early in their lives and become geldings.  Geldings are without the aggressive behaviors and sexual urges that make stallions dangerous.)|`|IhjFjoKDaa	Stallions are always a bad idea for a beginner. Owning a stallion is a lot of responsibility. People generally think studs are prone to misbehave when in public and while not all of them are this way - the testosterone does flare up with inexperienced handlers.    You should consider buying a mare or possibly a gelding (castrated male) as these horses can be pastured with any gender, are less prone to testosterone driven behavior, and in general are more appropriate for a beginning horse person due to their more laid back temperament.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I agree with Emily... If you don't know that a beginner shouldn't have a stallion, you shouldn't have a horse at all.|`|yDgYSHvaaa	A beginner should definitely not be getting a horse at all, especially if they don't know about geldings. A gelding is a stallion that has been castrated (neutered) and they are the most popular everyday gender. Stallions are aggressive and they will breed the mares they're turned out with and fight - sometimes to the death - with the other males. Most mares tend to be moody.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	stallion are for very experienced horse people.  i've always preferred mares, but a lot of my friends say they are to moody and like geldings.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	If you don't know that there are geldings, you shouldn't be getting a horse! A gelding or mare would be best. STALLIONS ARE NEVER FOR BEGINNERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	GAHH!  AVOID A STALLION!  YOU'LL GET KILLED!  I would get a mare or gelding!  Mares have their heat cycles.  Geldings sometimes have stallion moments!  SOmetimes, mares are jerks during cycles.  Whichever horse suits you best!|`|42dHANvqaa	mare! Don't get a stallion unless you are experienced!|`|CSlw9Snbaa	you defiantly do not want a stallion if you are a begging!!   Maybe a Gelding- which is a castrated horse-- in other words has not testies. A mare is also good. but make sure you get a good horse that is not to excited.. if you do not know what you're doing bring and experienced horse owner with you.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	Mares can be ' moody mares ' so they can have an attitude   Stallions are not recommended for beginner owners, they can be a little crazy sometimes !  My vote would be a gelding because they are very sweet.  I would also recommend trying a few different horses other than trying 1 and saying ' oh hes the one! ' rather than later on finding a better horse and regretting buying the other one.  Hope it helps :) Lots of luck with your new horse !|`|fydy8Zjpaa	wow...a gelding duh. Never get a stallion as a beginner.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	Start by taking horse lessons, before getting a horse, and try to help someone who has horses.  After two years and you are still interested in a horse then with any luck, will find a gelding that would be suited for a beginner like yourself.    Stallion are tougher to work with but is fairly predictable and it is harder to find boarding for.    Mares can get moody, aren't all females? and somewhat unpredictable.    Gelding are more docile and even tempered but if a problem develops it is harder to figure it out.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	gelding dude! stallions&mares are def. a hand full (no effence to anyone that has them) but its like having an un fixed dog, thier almost cocky and hyper. for a begginer owner. gelding. they are the best and u won't regret it.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Stallions are strictly for highly experienced riders.  You must pay attention constantly or the mare in heat in front of you could get a free breediing.  Unfortunately it could be with the rider still on the mare.    No stallions are for those with LOTs of experience.    Mares can be a bit moody.    Geldings tend to make the best beginners horse, but I have seen mares that are just as calm and don't get moody.|`|6EUbvmfHaa	really i think a gelding.  mare can be a bit "mean"  stallion can be "wild"  gelding are really sweet|`|Edg8rjTwaa	actually neither,  you should get a gelding.  They are much calmer, easier to learn on and they arnt moody.|`|DdpvxfkNaa	GELDING. Mare have their moments and stallions are for experienced riders and they can be dangerous. Hope this helps!|`|4U93EoUtaa	Have to agree with Mandy and Emily.  Find out a lot more about horses before you actually own one.  You ought to know about geldings if you are buying a horse.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	Get a gelding. They are calmer then stallions and don't have the attitude of a mare. My mare has such an attitude that only I and my trainers can ride her.|`|KY53VWHNaa	i have always lived by this     You can Tell a gelding                Ask a mare        and plead with a stallion|`|7Xkcs9rXaa	a gelding is the best choice. they're usually the nicest, though some can be mean. and some mares as they get older they can meaner or "prissy". stallions are usually crazy and better for experanced owners.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Ask a mare  Tell a gelding  Discuss things with a stallion.    Go with a gelding|`|RloOJ43haa	Gelding
QNdpLJmfaa	They are fertile just keep up the good work no it will not effect them in any way just do not check up on them uneccisarily because they may have deffects from tempurature fluctuation
xKjecOTYaa	Put A LOT of paprika or pepper in the hole. The dog will breath in while digging, and have a sneezing fit. The paprika will burn his/her nose and mouth, thus teaching them lesson not to be forgotten. I had a Golden Retriever that would dig a hole to China, however a quart of pepper and paprika cured his digging desires.|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well:you know it is the owner's responsibilitiy with "Dogs and  they should be given an Command just whistle 3 times yes  very important Among Pets "|`|AA10112346	Instinct. No way. Have fun trying though.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	y dont u want him diggin|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Like many undesirable canine behaviors, destructive habits usually develop because a dog is bored, lonely, or both. Here's a link that can help you understand this canine behavior and resolve it. good luck!|`|YNDMwFEJaa	put a lot of pepper in all the holes the dog is digging in.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Dogs dig for 3 major reasons.    1.  The breed is a 'digging' breed and he's searching instintively for prey.     2.  He's bored/not exercised enough.     3.  He's not supervised enough.      1 can be cured by correcting  s 2&3.  Exercise him more and don't leave him outside unsupervised and you'll be fine.|`|KnypnLfxaa	You get rid of him,NO MORE HOLES!!|`|AVYUwkftaa	distract him/her with a dog toy, take him/her out for a walk, play him with him/her, put him inside the house. :)|`|UyAGXNCsaa	2 ways.  Dogs usually go back to the same spots to dig:    1.  put dog poop in the hole and lightly cover it with dirt.  This may or may not work - you may end up with a digger with poopy paws.  2.  This worked for us - blow up water balloons until they're tight.  Bury them in the hole so the dirt barely covers the surface.  The dog will pop it when they go to dig again, which will scare them but not hurt them.  The only concern here is to make sure your dog doesn't eat the broken balloons.  Mine didn't but if your dog eats everything it might.  Our dog stopped digging the first day, and never went back.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	We laid some chicken wire flat on the ground where our dog was digging (near fence, patio, etc) and covered with dirt.  (Kind of bury the chicken wire shallowly).  The dog can't dig where the wire is.  It worked.    That will prevent your dog from digging out or tearing up the yard, but it won't help the real issue.  Your dog is probably bored or just acting on his instincts.  Whatever you do, please don't punish the dog.

zwaXYoRbaa	Some reminisce over their lives. They start regretting things they could've done differently. Some panic and go into denial about the whole thing. Others welcome death with open arms. Is your dog withdrawn lately? Kind of keeps to himself? You should show him you're there for him,..through what may be a difficult time for him.|`|AA11992723	see a vet. it's animal neglect (illegal) if you dont.|`|Eug52iQDaa	You really need to get the dog to a vet right away, if you know he is sick.  The barking could come from a number of causes.|`|lu9FVC1Zaa	You don't tell us what he is sick from and how do you know he is dying?  Dogs near death do not bark!  Call a vet!|`|877d6b95dea06d73a08b9f3551cd7766aa	Im Sorry. I hope you feel better. My Rabbit died 2 weeks ago. You can put out a dedication for him here: http://rainbowsbridge.com/.
Eug52iQDaa	It sounds like he became used to peeing in his kennel.  He may associate the bed with the kennel and the old, bad habit.  Poor baby!   I would remove that bed completely.   I would not give him a 'bed' for a while, but let him use the floor (sorry) in different areas for a few weeks.  Hopefully when you get that one bed washed (use bleach) and properly aired out, and enough time has passed, you may be able to give that bed back to him without the old habit coming back.      You sound very caring and patient with him.  He's a lucky boy!  Best wishes.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	go to petsmart or petco and they have some spray called NO GO housebreaking aides for pets. suppose to spray it on stuff and they wont go anymore!!|`|AVYUwkftaa	take him out side for a while and keep the routine up, just keep taking him out every other hour. and if he doesn't pee outside, just wait. He'll break :)|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Since this is your new dog, he is 'marking' his territory. Most often, marking is an instinctual behavior and iIt's more common to males than females.    Your dog uses this tactic to say, "This is my turf." The trigger can be anything from the arrival of a baby to the acquisition of a new vacuum cleaner.While excitement or fear can also stimulate your dog to deliberately urinate, the most common explanation is that he's just identifying his territory.    Check out this link and find out how to treat this problem. Good luck!|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Make sure you fuss at him when he does it, so he knows that he's being bad. Maybe he just thinks it's a toilet. :)
ErSbeRlzaa	I highly doubt it was the ghost shrimps as they can't do much damage to a full grown beta. It was most likely the ram all fish will fin nip betas especially male betas. Just watch him closely and keep your water quality at its best to avoid fin rot. As a precaution go out and buy some fin rot medicine just in case and if the fins get any worse or more of it start to disappear it'll probably be best to remove him or the ram.  Hope it helps  Edit - Soz my mistake dunno why but i thoght you were talking about ghost shrimp, If there a different species any bigger than ghost shrimp then it is possible, and they might do it again. But your doing the right things any way and with time he's fin should get back to normal. Have you thought about movng the shrimps, they'll probably e better of in a tank with no long finned fish.
Rch3XNkkaa	I'd go with male, males are usually easier to take care of: i want a male bearded dragon so bad. mangeable, i'd say male.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I have 3 males and 2 females and really don't see a lot of difference in them at all. I really think it is how they are cared for as in how often you interact with them such as just holding them close to you.  If I were you I would start with one, either sex, as you don't need to be putting them in the same enclosure. 2 males could and most likely will fight thus someone gets injured and in the case with male female, you have breeding concerns with him stressing her out and with 2 females, one will become the dominate one and intimidate the other from eating. So think about all of this before you go for 2. They are not cheap to have as the lighting itself is expensive.|`|vV425TqZaa	Ok well i started out with a male and i would say that the male is a bit better manageable, but also if in the future you ever plan on being a breeder start with a female, they are hard to find for breeding purposes.  but also considering that you are a girl you could relate more to a female. if i were you, go for the female you will have tons of fun and bonding with her and she will love being around you, as i own a male and female, i am a breeder and i have found that my female will eat a bit more and is always calmer considering a male is around her. just go with a female you'll be much happier.|`|JiUKeyhGaa	it doesnt matter they are both freindly
IMlt9H4qaa	You need to contact your DC and ask these questions, they will help you. Also you should be learning what is involved in the test at Pony Club.     Finding the questions and answers is cheating don't you think? Not very fair on everyone else?
iJtuhLMTaa	You may be able to find them at stores that sell pond fish|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Bait shop, or a pond. That way you'll be able to get a native species that you can release.    There are always "Grow A Frog" kits, where you send away for tadpoles, but those are African clawed frogs and a. are not releasable and b. have a high mortality rate before they reach adulthood.    You can probably find a few pretty hardy bullfrog tadpoles at a local bait shop, assuming you live somewhere where there are people who fish. You might not be able to find any until spring, though.|`|07lCZh28aa	Tadpoles are hard to get nowadays. Used to be able to get them in the 80s-early 90s with no problem. Sadly enough my friend, you may have to get them online or catch them yourself if you live in like Florida.
gjD8pndjaa	Females will hump, too.    both are relatively the same after neutering.  the differences between genders are negligible when you compare it to the overall differences between the individual puppies temperaments|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Humping is not a sex issue - it's a dominance issue.  I've had males that never hump and females that hump if you leave them for 5 minutes.      If you are using a good breeder ( http://www.pbrc.net/breeding3.html to see if you are), then allow the breeder to match you up by personality, not by sex.|`|KnypnLfxaa	I dont think so here are some reasons.  1.they will go in heat.  2.they can to hump.  3.BABIES!!!  4.They are some what harder to train.  5.I just dont think so.  get the pup r\that comes first to you.

07qFHL6iaa	Parents are parents. Offer them something in return. Like say that if you get good grades (what's good? U and UR parents decide) then they'll get u 1. Or be SUPER good and do your HW the minute u get home and then don't play or watch TV, take care of your cat and do chores. Dont beg for a guinea pig and be polite and don't talk with your mouth full (Not saying you do but that tends to annoy parents.) Be a perfenct child and dont get into trouble. If you know your parents are gonna ask u to do something then do it before they ask, but if they ask don't let them ask twice.   Then, after a week or 2, tell them that u are very responsable and U want a guinea pig. Say that U will pay f 4 everything yourself and take care of it yourself. Say that they won't even know it's there and you'll keep up the OUTSTANDING behavior. That should impress them if you do that is a buisnessy manner. Then tell them you'll give them time to think about it (even if they say no or yes. Make sure that u dont beg and stay polite and buisnessy during the conversation). THe next day tell gether them up again and tell them everything that U did responsably, what u did without them asking and what u did when they only asked once. At the end say "So do you think Im responsable enough to get my guinea pig?"    Remember:  Stay buisnessie  Stay polite  Keepe up the polite bahavior even when you get the guineaa pig (keep your fingers crossed)  If your parents ask u why you're acting like that all of a sudden say "What? Im not allowed to be polite and responsable?"    Good Luck!!!  Everyone else is right. Either U dont get the guinea pig or u do but still give ur cat alot of attention|`|5fI8D1seaa	Well you already have 3 cats. I think that's plenty of animals! Please don't neglect the animals you have now. If you want a guinea pig within 2 months from now, then try to convince your parents that you are responsible enough by taking really good care of your cats and play with them (not for just those 2 months, you should do this your whole life until they pass away).|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	three cats? wayy too much. the average human has about one pet, and you're asking for four. people with seven pets are people with seven pets, they arent you. either A, kill one of your cats, and make your grandparents get you a guinea pig to cheer you up, or B, suck it up. you dont own the house, you're not the parent, you dont make decisions. you have three cats, are you going to neglect them because they got boring???|`|hfu63hoxaa	i no how u feel i want a cat but i cant get one. idk what to do either im looking here to ALSO see what to do|`|8AHUuhbvaa	don't get just one guinea pig, if you're going to get any, get at least 2 cuz they're pack animals and they can become lonely and listless.  you have 3 cats also which can cause stress to guinea pigs.

First off you need to figure out what kind of dog you personnally can take care, as far as vets, grooming, nutrition, and so on. Second off, How much time do you have for your pet. Different kinds of dogs take different amounts of time. A larger dog is going to take more time, hence the bathing and walking and playing and training. All of those work with any size dog actually wether he/she is small or big. So you really need to think about it. Also why should color matter? Like said below... They are not an accessorie, they are part of your everyday life. You can't change them like you do a pair of shoes or your clothes. You need to make sure that you have a big enough place, enough financial stability, and all the means necessary for it. If you are asking a question like this, then you can't be serious. If you are serious, then you are way to uneducated about a dog period. Sorry to sound so cruel but it is the truth. Owning a dog is alot of work and takes alot of your daily time.|`|PM23RDycaa	The sad thing is I can't tell if you are serious or mocking the people who ask this all the time.|`|MX9M36B4aa	This all depends on your living arrangments and the size of dog you think you can handle.And as far as the name dont you think you should pick that out...  lol:)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	You can get a dog that will fit in w/your apt/house, how much grooming it needs, etc.  these are all things, along w/dog's temperment that you need to think about.  color?  you must be kidding...Pink, purple, etc.  Dogs are animals that need love and care.  Lots of it.  they are not accessories for an outfit!  Make sure you think about this carefully.|`|KnypnLfxaa	WHY?  there are mutts out there.to answer you....  border terrier,IT DOES NOT MATTER,trooper for boy,and Daisy for girl  WHY DOES THE COLOR MATTER!!! what is wrong with people?|`|9LTRmLi4aa	perhaps one of these?  http://www.tapirback.com/tapirgal/gifts/...

5PsKGss7aa	As a couple ppl mentioned it really depends on the the vet & which company they are with..  But remember, with a puppy, they will be expensive the first year you have them.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Varies tremendously based on the individual practice and what the dog requires, vaccinations and worming and such.  Call your local office for estimates|`|qehH3fobaa	If you got the pup from a pet store or a breeder. you should have gotten a free first vet visit. I gave them out when i was a breeder. I am retired now.    But if you did not ask or get a free vet visit just pick up the phone book and start calling. That would be your best bet.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	The first visit is about $100 give or take.  The puppy shots are monthly until the puppy is about 4-6 months old, then you spay/neuter him/her, etc.  Dogs are expensive.|`|0AEi70ywaa	Well I certainly hope you did not BUY a puppy that did not have any vetting.  It is illegal to sell puppies without their first set of shots.  Other than that, for a general physical, and probably a few extra vaccinations, you can expect to pay $200-300 for the first vet bill.  That may or may not include the flea & tick treatment, and the heartworm prevention medicine they will recommend.  This estimate is assuming your puppy is healthy and doesn't have kennel cough or anything like that from a junky breeder!    Expect to pay $300-400 when the puppy is ready to be spayed or neutered (which should be done ASAP that your vet says.)
bPdqwkpPaa	Check with the American Boxer Club http://americanboxerclub.org/ and the Boxer Club of Southern California http://www.boxerclubofsoutherncalifornia... for referrals.     Use http://www.pbrc.net/breeding3.html to learn more about what a responsible breeder is.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	A really good way to find a good breeder is to go through a proper Boxer dog club.    The American Boxer Club website link I give lists all the boxer clubs in the US.  If you contact the club they should be able to refer you to reputable breeders in your area.    If you check out the other parts of the American Boxer Club site you'll get lots of good info on what good breeders should be doing in terms of health testing which will help you to choose the right breeder.    The other link I give is not from the US but has info and links about choosing breeders, health tests etc

KeevlZnTaa	Tumors don't usually cause pain. However with a tumor you will eventually have to euthenize. Tumors leach off the body and cause it not to get enough nutrients. As it grows, your hamster will get thinner and have more trouble keeping weight on.    You may want to go to the vet and see if it is removable. I have adopted rodents with larger tumors and they were successfully removed. Many rodents develop mammary tumors, which are often easy to remove and have a high rate of recovery.    If you are not going to remove the tumor then just keep your hamster comfortable. Try and feed higher fat/calorie foods as the tumor grows. Baby foods, nutri-cal, etc, can help to keep the weight on. You should not need to euthanize until his quality of life goes down. The basic rule of thumb of knowing when it is time is comparing how they are now to the former self. Do they still eat? groom? are interested in contact? etc. Even if he is maintaining weight and seems otherwise ok, there is still a possibility that the tumor will rupture and he will bleed internally. When the tumor becomes very large, you will also need to consider euthanasia.|`|44kEtDvIaa	May not necessarily cause direct pain, but could be a cancerous growth.  Difficult to say what the cause is and a vet will probably have to be involved.|`|07qFHL6iaa	Probably. It puts on extra wight in places where there shouldn't be weight. Also, most rodents die while they have toumors so take that into consideration before u kill it...|`|6sKF4MOVaa	well if you sterilize scissors or a needle after you give antistatic you can cut the tumor out antistatic will numb its entire body for a while|`|MCMGakkNaa	Tumors probobly do cause animals pain. However, you dont have to say goodbye to your hamster just yet. If you can find your nearest exotic vet, they can preform surgery to remove the tumor and help your hamster.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	if it causes a human pain, it causes an animal pain, no matter how small it is.|`|UMfumO1paa	If its weighing in on major organs it is extremely painful. If its like a mammory tumor probably not
aBLYU5FKaa	My cat chases my dog.  I have a huge fluffy cat named Bernard, and when he comes in the house he chases our giant lab puppy.  It is backwards.    Oh, and the same cat seems to think that he is a dog.  When you are walking, he walks in front of you and then rolls over and asks for his belly to be rubbed.  He also loves it when you brush his belly, and he talks A LOT.  He knows his name, and when you say "Bernard" he comes running, meowing the whole time.    We used to have a poodle that would make a high squeaky noise when we walked in the door, and it sounded exactly like she was saying "Hiiiiiii".   It was amazing.  I loved that dog.  She lived til she was 17 years old.|`|2x2LYkj4aa	every single time i come home, my cat will meow for ten minutes. straight. doesnt seem so long? it is.|`|uFwnaRJEaa	everytime someone goes to pet my cat it meows...and not in a nice way. ahah even if you just walk in fron of him. and my dog sometimes just runs really fast in and out of the room like 10 times

9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	I would put this dog down.  I know that it is sad and you are attached to this dog, but he is a public risk.  A dog that bites, especially kids is dangerous.  Not only should he be put down to prevent him from injurying people, but you are setting your self up for a lawsuit.|`|MX9M36B4aa	I completly understand your situatin because i was in the same boat two years ago.We had a male dog that had never bit anybody then one day he bit my husband and we thought well maybe he was sick or didnt want to be messed with at that time.But about five months later my son had a friend over and they were playing with him and he bit my sons friend and at that time we new we had to get rid of him as much as it hurt us and my son we could not take any more chances.So the best advice i can give you is to let this one go to someone who is aware of the problems and who has no children,and then take your children out and get a new puppy.Time and the new puppy will heal all hearts.I hope my story could help a little and i am sorry for the choices you have to make:(|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Pitbulls are really protective of their owners. I don't know what to tell you about putting him down though. :(|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	4 bites?  That's a lot...  Usually it's a 3 strike rule with animal control.    You have two very active/hyper breeds mixed together, and we don't know it's exercise regimine, how it's walked, controlled, trained, etc.    You need to be evaluated by a professional trainer/behaviorist, who can give you an informed recommendation.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I used to train protection & attack dogs & I had to keep them away for people.  The dogs were not aggressive but they were trained to be aggressive.    Keep him in the back yard & in your home.  When people come over put him away somewhere.  Don't give him the opportunity to bite.  When your husband runs with him maybe the dog should wear a wire muzzle.  The dog can eat & drink just fine with this type muzzle but cannot bite wearing it.    Of course training is another option.  Find a trainer that is familiar with aggressive behavior & not a trainer that just trains regular basic obedience or advanced training.  Get a professional Behaviorist to help you.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	If a dog is attacking/biting humans -- it should be put down.  Especially if those attacks/bites were unprovoked.    If, on the off chance, they did provoke him [hitting, smacking, aggravating, etc]; it needs to be retrained and re-socialized with both humans and dogs.|`|FC5BxnoPaa	He needs some behavior modification training, take him to a trainer.  In the mean time keep a muzzle on him when visitors are over.|`|85d25c63c9c8d4e4ad0e4c097927a33faa	My opinion is as soon as a dog bites a human, unfortunately he has to go. The taste of blood can do terrible things to a dog. You have a duty of care to protect your (and other peoples) children in your home.|`|sunuId5aaa	awh, i really dont think you should put him down.  i think you need to socialize him with people..  thats hwat we did with my dog after he bit my brother when he was 4.  i hate the fact that people have to put the dog down for soemthing like that.  i honestly think you should give him one more chance.  or keep a muzzle on him.   watch him when he is by people, watch what he does before he bites or snipps at someone, so you'll know.  if you do decide to put him down, before that see if anyone else will take him.  (: aawh, poor pup, i love animals. dont put him down):|`|uhyUFhfeaa	Definatly training is a must.  Make sure its a trainer that can work with your dog.  Don't just go to anyone that says they're a trainer.      DO NOT muzzle it when people are over.  The dog will just learn that there is a reason to bite.  Keep the dog on a leash around adults and away from children until the problem is fixed.      Give your dog treats and praise when he is good around people.  He will learn that people are good because he gets treats and love when they are around.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Once again, to correct people on here, Pit Bull breeds are not traditionally human aggressive.     If this were my dog, I'd get the dog to the vet to make sure that he's not biting out of pain.     Then, I'd get a trainer to help me figure out WHY he's biting.  Fear Aggression?  Previous Abuse?  Lack of Training?  Resource Guarding?  Protective Insticts?     If at least two good trainers/behaviourists said that he was beyond help, then I'd talk with them about the next step.      When he goes out, he needs to be muzzled.  When people are at your home, then he needs to be separated and kept away from them. This needs to be Standard Operating Procedure until you can get this worked out.  And I CERTAINLY wouldn't allow my children near him until I had a control on it.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Hire a professional dog trainer. Until you have the problem resolved, get him a muzzle. The last solution would be to put him to sleep. My nephew was bitten by a dog when he was 2 or 3 years old and he still bears the scars. He was bitten in the face. You are very lucky that your dog hasn't bitten your babies yet. I think you should muzzle him as an extra precaution.|`|KK7sjmr2aa	have you tried obedience school?|`|wolW47AHaa	Don't put him down. get him training and a mussel or something but don't put him down.|`|W2SaOVknaa	i agree with Mandy|`|3BMBZtDxaa	If this continues, you may not even have a choice.    Honestly, just work with them. You need to teach him not to. This may mean provoking him to nip just to show him it is not allowed. Never let him nip during play! This is just motivating the behavior. Even if he opens up his mouth in a biting manner (you can tell the difference between that and a yawn) correct him harshly for it. Any move to bite shouldn't be approved.    Whenever he nips during play, squeel and turn away. Play time is then over for the day. He'll catch on quickly. When he bites other people, give a good "EHHH!" and grab him by the collar and shut his muzzle close with good force and tell him "NO!". It sounds harsh, and it is, but with a problem this serious you need to be. Personally, I'd much rather use a hands-on approach than risk my dog's life.    If he opens his mouth to bite or does that "cute" thing where they have their mouth open usually when they're on their back and you're rubbing their belly and they wriggle their head around and touch it by your hand and what not, not even biting but just that, disapprove it. These are biting behaviors which should be stopped.    When you go out or don't have security of him, I'd honestly suggest muzzling him so it doesn't happen. This will prevent law suits and euthanasia. When you do, work hard at training! Don't leave a moment of biting undisciplined!    Good luck!
w1lh1INHaa	What kind of laxative are you using?  Psyllium hulls (Metamucil)?  If Psyllium isn't helping, this is the time to bring out the milk.  A little milk will help soften the stool, as lactose frequently has that effect on cats (has your vet prescribed lactulose?).  A little yogurt with probiotics will often help get digestive health back on track.  Yogurt is lower in lactose than milk, so you can mix a wee bit of milk with the yogurt.    I would certainly look into a no/low grain diet, as cats can become grain-intolerant, which can cause large, dry, bulky stools.  Look into EVO, which is a very, very good no-grain wet food.  Simply do a "no grain" search on the internet for other alternatives.      Good luck, as I know megacolon can be a serious issue if not controlled.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	He needs to switch to an all-canned diet - the dry foods (even an excellent one like Wellness) are not what he needs.  He needs as much moisture in his diet as possible - that helps many many cats.  Some benefit from the high-fiber diet, others do not.      Is he on both lactulose and propusid?  If not, have her discuss those with the vet.|`|MaUlbbCMaa	If your kitty is that bad off why doesn't the vet give her any of the prescription laxative syrup that Vets give? I would do research on it on google. I read on a website last week a ladies cat had to give her cat that. I know there is a better way, I tried all that on my cat she has problems with dry dry stool.. I give her laxatone it comes in a tube in pet store or vet, but I would not stand by and let her suffer, ask the vet for a prescription!! GOOD LUCK

Its a tough decision, but i think the best thing to do would be to hand your cat over to the vet, or shelter, tell them your situation. They will probably take the cat, give her proper care, the surgery, and then put her up for adoption. Tell the vet that you love your cat but cant afford to care for her, and that you hope they will find her a loving home.   I know this is hard, but its your cats life, and I'm sure you want to save her life.     when the time is right, and you are sure you can afford the vet bills, maybe think of adopting another kitten...    Good Luck!|`|AA10129150	There are a couple options, you can look into groups that help people pay for their vet bills, you can try and work something with your vet like maybe be able to volunteer in order to help offset some of the costs or working out a payment plan if you decide upon surgery. The other major decision is that the cost is too much and the chances are not good so you can put the cat to sleep. If you decide to put the cat to sleep try and give her some special time before hand, if she is really sick she might already be ready to go. I'm sorry for you, trying to make such a hard decision.|`|EbNQDAHPaa	I ran into a situation a few years ago that I was faced with a sick (almost dead) kitten that I had just adopted 5 days prior and a $1500 vet bill. I had the choice to put her down or pay the $1500. I was so upset, crying and emotional (and I had only adopted the kitten 5 days prior). I asked the vet for her opinion, and she told me that if it was a cat that I had a lot of time invested into and love that I should do it. The survival chances were 50/50 as well, and I wouldve had to risk driving her to the ER vet to get the blood transfusion. I took into account that I had 5 other cats at home, I had not had a lot of love invested yet.. so we put her down :( Your vet may work out a payment plan with you, or find one that will.My advice, Please do something....

j77Yqrlnaa	Hunters show knee patches....NOT FULL SEAT! Full seat is dressage!!    The rest is basically up to your preference. I'd get full length, because I have long legs and plus, it's easier so your socks don't fall down and then your skin is rubbing against the boot. The colors are basically tan or beige...nothing else. No black or white or any other funky color. The zip is up to you, a lot of people like side zip.|`|9LSZfzzxaa	For hunters you should get side-zip, knee patch breeches in a green-beige color.  You want something that has a bit of a relaxed fit, not a second skin.  I'm pretty sure that full seat breeches are illegal, at least in equitation.     The pictures on the website do not do these breeches justice.  They are much nicer than my $200 Tailored Sportsman and Ariat breeches.  I think these are selling for only $90.    http://hoofandwoof.com/Equestrian-Team-A...|`|Xobbmd7Saa	My hunter/jumper show breeches are beige knee pads. I don't reccomend full seat for showing.

I'd pair it with a nice navy or hunter green jacket, personally.    If you have tall boots you need breeches - if you have short boots you need jodpurs.    Full seat provides better grip but it's also more expensive. My show breeches are full seat - my training/ just riding ones are knee only.    I personally ride with knee patches and no pockets as it is functional for me. Zip is a preference thing.    Just remember - understated is better. I know some people show in rust breeches - but that is very passe! Go beige!|`|pnDZcQKpaa	i have two pairs for schooling and one for showing. my schooling ones are the regular knee-length ones. they have knee pads, and they are the olivey-beige color.  my show breeches are also knee length with knee pads, but are a light beige color. i personally don't like the side zip, and i think that the?ones that button in the front are better.  hope i helped!|`|DdpvxfkNaa	I show hunters and here is what I use and everyone I know. Full seat breeches, beige or a khaki color, no zip or zipper in the front( zipper doesn't really matter) full length. It can be a little short cause it will be covered by your boots. Should have knee pads. pockets don't matter but normally no. I would recommend Devon-Aire for show breeches. I know you don't want me to mention a brand but I have too. lol :) The show breeches Devon- Air there cheap unless you want to go all fancy with ariats. Over all, full seat, beige, knee pad, and whatever zip. Good luck and hope this helps :)|`|0f9b2cc233e37affd9dd86a519176889aa	Full length, knee pads or full seat, I definitely like at least one pocket, doesn't really matter wear it zips, I prefer hook and loop (velcro) closures at the bottom as elastic can be painful after awhile. Color is the real only here and they must be beige or khaki. I really like http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...  they fit great, the color is great, and the price is definitely right. My advice would be to get 2 or 3 pairs of a cheaper breech instead of one $200 pair if you're only going to be using them for showing. Breeches are going to get gunk on them at some point and its good to have an extra pair to change in to.|`|7lsU5bcoaa	It doesn't matter how long your breeches are as long as you are showing with field boots. If you are showing in paddock boots(must be 13 or under) , you need jodpurs. The should have knee patches. They should be beige, lightish with no green or brown tones, just a neutral beige. Side zip and front zip are acceptable but IMO side zip is much better. Pockets in the front are OK if you want them. Don't get anything too low rise for riding.   good colours for breeches:  http://www.equestriancollections.com/mmE...  http://lh4.ggpht.com/hamshoegirl/SGgO0Ea...

The only problem is they only live up to 3 years, but I think they would make the best hands on pet. Oh, and he is totally missing out on birds, they are the best pets ever! Oh, and do lots of rat-specific research!!!  Don't get a mouse or hamster. I used to have a hamster and now have a mouse. They aren't fun and cuddly and don't like much interaction.|`|u61yKsE3aa	Sugar gliders.  They are small and even though some would argue I find mine to be easy to care for.

IhjFjoKDaa	Why are they fostering your dog? Shouldn't your dog stay in your home?    Anyway - usual lease agreements for horses contain:    Agreed lease beginning and end  duties that the leaser (person leasing) is responsible for ie will they pay for feed, board/kennel costs, veterinary care, and so on.    With horses most contracts state where the animal will live, that it will be fed appropriately for its age/size/performance level and gives a brief outline of what that would include.    It also discusses emergency information, what would happen in the case that the animal is irrevocably damaged during the lease (ie breaks a leg and has to be put down) and so on.    don't know much more about dogs - still a bit confused as to why anyone would be fostering your dog.|`|42dHANvqaa	That at any time you could take the dog back if you feel it is necessary. Also that they are responsible to feed, groom, and care for the dog. Plus that they are responsible for any injuries or illness that the dog acquires while in their possession. Hope this helps :) lol
znGpjsGjaa	It depends on the breed and the weight of the rabbit. In some breeds a junior is under 6 months of age. In some breeds you have an intermediate which is a rabbit that is 6-8 months old, not a junior anymore but not a senior either.   If you tell me the breed of your rabbit I can give you a better answer. I have the SOP right here with me I can look it up and tell you.    *** 2/3/09 EDIT- With the breeds you have listed they are juniors until they are 6 months of age. They are not the breeds that have a 6-8 or intermediate class.So when showing your breeds they will either be juniors or seniors. yes they can be shown during the 6-8 months old period, they will just be senioers if they are older than 6 months. The other poster was incorrect in saying there are just juniors and seniors. The meat and some of the duel purpose breeds have an intermdeiate class. This is stated in the ARBA SOP on the pages of the breeds (such as New Zealand, Satin, Flemish Giant, Californian,Beveren, etc)***|`|nugOKrqaaa	A RABBIT IS CONSIDERED A JUNIOR FROM THE TIME IT IS WEENED UNTIL 6-8 MONTHS OF AGE.THE PERIOD BETWEEN 6-8 MONTHS THE RABBIT CAN BE SHOWN EITHER AS A JUNIOR OR SENIOR DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
bPdqwkpPaa	How would you know?  You would have had a mentor that you trained with for 3-5 years so that you knew all the signs.      If you are a kid, you can watch for her to bed and den down.  She may also pant.  At that point, you go and get your parent or their breeding mentor.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	contact your breeding mentor and your vet.  and then get your dog fixed.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	My approach to breeding dogs is probably different to your's, but here's how I would know...    From the date of the matings I'd be able to estimate likely due date.    I would have an ultrasound done by my vet to confirm pregnancy and get a rough idea of how many pups.    I would be monitoring her temperature before the due date.    A drop in temperature suggests whelping may occur within the next day or so.    My girls usually start panting and nest building before whelping.  This can go of for many hours, but she needs to be supervised so that you can see if there are contractions - if there are contractions but pups are not being produced after a period of time veterinary intervention may be required to save her and the pups.      Some dams may pass fluid before a pup is produced. If a pup's sac is burst and the pup doesn't appear soon, once again, veterinary intervention may be required.      Have you considered sterilising your girl after this litter? Puppies are quite hard on a dog. Or if she needs a c-section, sometimes you can spay at the same time.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	Yeah but the dogs usually do it on their own|`|nPuZVGFRaa	What my dog did is just layed down on her side and breathed heavily.  My dog is small though (shih tzu/ poodle mix)   Your dog might be much bigger.  She just had puppy's 3 weeks ago.  Hope I could help!  Good Luck!  SammyC(=|`|nxW1zZ9naa	panting, not eating, nesting, and a puppy is coming out... its going to be messy.  Is she due now? It takes 63 days for a dog to have the babies. She will tell you with her body actions, she will look uncomfortable, pant alot, want to go out side to go potty, look for a place out of the way to have them.   You need to get old (clean) towels ready as it will be a mess. They normally will have them at night and it takes up to 12 hours for them to be done depending on the size of the mom and the breed.     Good luck and let us know how many and what kind.
qGy9fR7xaa	It's possibly a tumor. My old hammy was nearly 2 when we found out she had a big lump on her belly. It wasn't painful to touch and could move around. When we took her to the vets, the vet said it was a tumor attached to an organ in her body. Apparently it had been there for a while, and was quite big - but we hadn't really realized it was a tumor, because you could barely feel it. In the end, she had, like, a hemorrhage and she couldn't breath well, eat, she was cold and couldn't stand up. But the next day she seemed better. That's when we took her to the evt, just in case, and we found out that it could happen again and go thorough stages when she seemed fine, then very ill the next.  In the end she was put to sleep ;(  It was very sad, and i'm hoping that this isn't what your hamster has. Though, if that description sounds similar to what your hammy has, then it probably is a tumor. You could take it to the vet to be sure and get information and that.  I hope everything goes well with Your hammy! :)|`|0jDuZRGfaa	my hamster has a tumor for 1 year now, and hes healthy! =D dont worry lol|`|07qFHL6iaa	You'll probably want to search the internet but her's what I know:  Hamters are proned to tumors  If they have a tumor they have a slight chance of living.   Talk to the vet
5PsKGss7aa	Have you registered her under your name since you've had her(like maybe a microchip)?  Do they have any papers for her? if not, they probably cant do nothing.. I would suggest you contact local animal control and explain the situation.|`|qioH81tiaa	You tried to locate the owners - how?  Did you contact all the vets in town?  The animal shelters?   The dog rescues?  Put up fliers in the pet stores?  On posts/mail boxes/etc. your area?    Sorry, but dogs are considered property - and the dog is not yours.  3 months is long to you - but not long in the overall life of the dog.  Just think of this as your good deed.    Add: for all those who are saying things like "possession is 9/10 of the law" - if someone steals your wallet, and keeps it for 3 months, it doesn't make it theirs.  Taking in a dog without doing everything you can to find the owners - INCLUDING CONTACTING THE LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTER is THEFT!!!|`|AA10112346	Take it to court if you want to otherwise dispute it among yourself. Unless there was something in writ ting your out of luck.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Call your local shelter and ask them how long you have to hold the dog before it becomes legally yours.  In most places you can legally claim ownership of the dog after the period of time for which the local shelter or animal control is required to hold a stray.  So if the local shelter can put a dog up for adoption after 1 week then you can keep the dog as yours if you don't find an owner in 1 week.  Regardless, the standard period of time that a piece of property left unclaimed is considered abandoned is typically either 30 or 60 days...and at 3 months you are well past either of those deadlines.  Possession is 9/10ths of the law...if you have had the dog for 3 months and made an attempt to find the owners when you first found the dog (placing a found ad in the paper, calling the local shelter and giving them a description of the dog, etc) then in most places that dog is legally yours and the previous owners have no legal rights to the dog.  Especially if they are not willing to reimburse you for the money spent on the care of the dog while she was in your care and especially if they can not prove ownership.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I don't think they have claim to her.  After two weeks of trying to find owners I had to turn a dog into AHA.  But was told that if I  wanted her I just had to get her current on her shots & get her spayed & chipped.     So according to what happened with me I'd say to just tell them to go jump the atlantic or pacific or to jump into a ditch.  Take there problems elsewhere.    How do you know that they were the owners?  Could it be just some idiot that heard about the dog & decided they wanted to pull the wool over your eyes & deceive you & just told you they were the previous owners.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	personally, i'd question their motive for not taking the dog back for three months; and then suddenly wanting her.    i wouldn't give her back if I were you.  and if they take you to court; you can use that "ploy" or argument.  they didn't want it for 3 months, but knew it was still there and taken care of; and now they suddenly love it again.|`|EeJMITyCaa	I'd make them prove to me that its their dog. If they cant prove it then they're screwed because it would be my dog then. If they can't prove its theres then how can they get it back. It seems like a scam to me anyway. They probably saw signs that there was a lost dog and decided to take advantage. If my Phoenix or Nala was lost for three months and I found out that someone had found them and taken care of them I would be more than happy to reimburse them!!!!|`|sOTRIqLCaa	the owner probaly misses it too and needs it. so u have to. its is sad|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	What kind of proof do they have that it's their dog?  Is it microchipped or tattooed?  If not, how are you sure it really is their dog?    Frankly, if they are not willing to reimburse you for your expenses, I'd say they are out of luck.  Most *responsible* people would be happy to reimburse you and even pay you a reward for finding and returning their dog.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	If they have no proof (photos, microchip, etc) that the dog is theirs, I'd keep it.  If it was me I'd never surrender a dog to someone just because they say it's theirs.  Get proof. If they hassle you, simply call the police.  Good luck!|`|ae2463081bceefeded7bc1d2928595baaa	They saw the dog before? Did the dog react? Was the family in bad economic circumstances? Are there kids involved?     This is tough. Maybe you could see who offers the better home for the dog. There might be all sorts of factors as to who that would be (who to that particular dog). Can you both have dog time? If not, I think you're fair to request compensation to return the dog. If they don't offer something reasonable, I'd keep the dog. And if they offer it in stages, don't give up the dog right away because whatever they give up front might be all you get. I suspect they have money issues.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	Ask the owners if you could buy the dog off them or ask if you could visit the dog once in a while & ask to petsitt it when there gone .. that will give you time with the dog :)|`|062cfd9edb812ebceaa817bc46b024eaaa	I don't know. That sounds like a case I would see on "Judge Judy". lol If they want the dog back I agree that they should compensate you for the fees you paid to care for the dog. Keep the dog. What can they do except take you to court? If they take you to court just be prepared to have proof of what you spent. You will either get money back or lose the dog and that's a hard one for only a judge to really decide who is right.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	It was their responsibility in the first place to make sure that the dog didn't get loose. If you put an ad in the paper, they should have responded at once. If you tried everything you could to find the owners and had no success, then by all rights I believe the dog would belong to you. I would not give a dog to anyone who came along and said to me "That's my dog and I want to have it back!"   They have to have physical evidence linking them to that dog. I would not give the dog back to them. Not for nothing. If they want it back so bad, they will give you the money you spent on the dog for what it had to have. If you still have the receipts, you can total up the costs, write a bill(make a copy)and then tell them that when you have been paid in full that they can have the dog back. They should also show you proof that they own her and give you the vet number. The vet will be able to tell you if the dog belongs to them, and the way to do that is provide him the number on the dog's license tag or give the vet the name of the people and name of the dog. And if the vet tells you that none of the information matches up, arrange to take the dog to the vet and have the "owners" join you. The other thing you can do is ask them to make an offer. Buy the dog from them. They can then go to a pet store or shelter to find themselves a new dog. If they don't want to buy the dog from you, they should at least give you money for taking care of the dog for the past three months. You can then go out and get yourself a new dog with that money. By giving you money, they would be showing their gratitude. Good luck to you!|`|ARVuep1waa	haha....................................... but seriously tell them that you have had it for 3 months and to back off and ya....................still haha|`|euow3qazaa	Ask for proof of ownership from them.  If they cannot provide it, then it would appear that it is not their dog and you have as much legal right to their dog (if not more as you have possession) than they do.    Edit: "for all those who are saying things like "possession is 9/10 of the law" - if someone steals your wallet, and keeps it for 3 months, it doesn't make it theirs. Taking in a dog without doing everything you can to find the owners - INCLUDING CONTACTING THE LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTER is THEFT!!!"    A wallet usually contains ID, and proof of ownership is easy to establish.  HOWEVER, if the so called owners of the dog cannot establish legal ownership, then please explain how this is theft.  In this situation, if someone walked up to me and said, "hey, that's my dog, give it to me", I would really like to make sure that it was indeed their dog BEFORE I gave the dog to them.|`|NbvTyN7saa	This is an issue for a lawyer.  It comes down to home much you can prove you did try to find the owners and how much they can prove they tried to find their dog|`|b4NcFBhraa	Okay, first of all, are they responsible for the dog? DO they have ownership of the dog? do they have the dog's paperwork from when they purchased it? if they do then it's legally their dog, sorry. If you can buy him off of them then great. Just give him back and go adopt a dog that NEEDS a home, not one stuck between two. I'm sure the dog misses his owner. THink about the dog too :(   Sorry but if you don't have ownership proof they can take you to court. I'd just comply. But say that the money YOU spent on the dog should be their money and if they really care about the dog they'll at least pay you HALF of what you spent on him Don't be selfish, give the dog back to his original owner. I've had to go through worse don't worry. I found a puppy that these kids owned and just threw out. I took her in with my mom's permission and cared for her for a few months and then one day after school my mom got rid of her w/out telling me, she said it'd hurt worse to get a goodbye, at least you get to say goodbye.   Sorry about your misfortune. Give the dog loves and give him back to his family. Go adopt a dog if you want a loyal buddy. :) (legally)|`|FhHkT0bBaa	The same thing happened to us when I was younger.When we found the dog it was filthy,hungry,and badly frightened of people.My folks took her to a vet,had her groomed,and within six months she was the happiest,most loved dog in the world.One day I was taking her for a walk around the block,and these people ran out of their house and snatched her leash from me(I was only 12) claiming she was their long lost pet ,I ran home got my parents and the battle ensued.Long story short,after the police were involved and lawyers,we lost and a few months later we saw her in the yard and she was filthy and horrible looking,and we heard she died soon after that.It was heartbreaking,and she truly was better off with us,so my advice is if you feel your the better owner then the heck with em,let them know that you tried to locate them and now youve spent money and bonded so if they want it they will have to sue.Bet you a dollar to a doughnut that will be the end of it.They probably only want it back cause youve taken such good care of it,I regret to this day not fighting for bebe when those bast*rds snatched her lease from me.FIGHT ON!|`|YEfplvXtaa	i wouldnt want to give her back either since youve gotten attached to her plus if the owners seen her many times before and did nothing about it but if you decide to give her back i would make the owner pay the expenses you have paid for because its not fair to you when you have been taking care of her and spending the extra money and they were not responsible enough to keep her from getting lost and not coming to pick her up earlier.....you have been paying her vet bills, food, shelter, and all the accessories for her too like toys leashes bed      i adopted a puppy and didnt notice till after i adopted her she had mange and other problems like vision and walking problems...and just having her for one day we probably over $100....when we thought she was healthy we called the owner the next day because we knew she would be too expensive to keep (constantly throughout her life she would have medical problems)and we knew there were plenty of healthy puppies.... but in a way i feel like we got scammed because we gave the meds the dog needed and all her shot records and we came out of it with no puppy...but i feel in that situation we should have gotten paid back....|`|8cikAYp3aa	after 3 months, if  they hadn't already came forward then I'd tell them no. Honestly.  If I had lost a dog I would be plastering the neighborhood with flyers, contacting vets and the dog warden.   Assuming you checked with the local dog warden/animal control and there were no reports, and you put up flyers for a found dog,  then I'd keep her and contact the police on the matter.  if she had been picked up by animal control they wouldnt have her, or even know where she was.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	this is a real tough dilemma...    1) Technically, the dog does not belong to you. Imagine if you lost your dog, saw your dog with another family, and they refused to give him back to you    2) Three months of care (food, walking, toys) Im sure that you and the dog have created a bond and you seem like a good dog owner    When you say that no one looked for it..were there lost dog signs posted, did you contact various shelters..becuase if the family did not make an effort to locate their lost dog, they may not be the best family for him    Dogs are capable of moving on much more quickly than humans..they live in the moment..you DEFINATELY should be reimbursed for your time/money and by the way, if someone found my lost dog and cared for it for 3 months, I would be forever grateful to them..I cannot believe that these people are not more appreciative of what you have done    I hope that this works out for you in the end, you seem to be a better match for the dog than its previous owners and I hope that you can work something out and YOU can keep the dog...good luck|`|JM4Uiunqaa	The first thing is to see if they have proof of ownership of the dog; pics, vet records, microchip, tattoo, collar with tags? And how did you try to find the owners? Did you put up posters, go to/call vets, call local shelters, put adds in the paper, look in the paper, get the dog scanned for a microchip? If you made a reasonable attempt to find the owners and cared for the dog for several months, you may have a legal claim to ownership. I don't know the specific laws in your area, but many have a clause on dog ownership that states that if the person/group who found the dog made reasonable attempts to find the owner and has cared for the dog for x number of days, the dog becomes their property. Talk with the local humane society, they may be able to help you with the local laws or know how can.
8QeEjeqiaa	well i own a pet shop in New Zealand and you have to aim it towards the kids because they are the ones that like to go and see animals and they also beg the parents to buy a mouse or a bunnie. in my pet store we have animal mascots that are our remembrance to words the children, also remember to get all the latest stock and have heaps of animals and cages, and also i am just going to tell you that our grooming and vet part of the shop brings in us a heap of money just to let you know. thanks hope this helps.

The hairs are simply your pup coloring.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	The only things I can think of are allergies if she seems itchy or shampoo left behind after bathing causing irritation.  Assuming it would be a short-ish haired dog I'd think shampoo wouldn't be a problem.    I have a lab, with allergies, who started out having dry, flaky skin as a puppy which progressed to feet chewing, ear inflammation and a hotspot ( like a rash/hive ).  I would consult a vet if it starts getting worse and exam the type of food you're feeding her, common allergens are corn, wheat, soy and sometimes for labs chicken by-products.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Has she had a well puppy check up? I don't know about the grey hairs. She might have dry skin especially if the heat source is different than it was at the breeders. Just push her hair back and check her skin. You can use a oatmeal PUPPY shampoo. Not human shampoo. You will need to make sure she is calm when you put her in the water and do not let her slip. You want it to not be scary.  Dry skin can also be a result of a low quality food.  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/ if you do change foods you must due it slow.|`|XtcSx6lLaa	Bathe your puppy with Head and Shoulders,it will help the skin from being dry,(the cheaper store brand works just as well or store brand T-Gel shampoo.)

Live bearers like guppies, molly and platy's will even have babies readily!  Most of these though are schooling fish and need to be kept in groups.  Semi aggressive fish tend to be sold small and get big, so watch how big their potential can be.  These are the fish that are usually fun to interact with.  Things like a needle nose gar will need live food!  This section includes things like most cat fish, bala sharks, gourami, barbs an eels.  You just need to make sure you're aware of how large each of these fish are going to get, most about 6-12 inches.  Cichlids are a wonderful choice as well.  South american cichlids tend to get very large and are very aggressive.  These include things like parrot cichlids, oscars and dempsy's.  Just be very careful as to how large they will get.  I don't recommend oscars b/c of how large they get and how messy they can be.  African cichlids tend to stay smaller, but still get about 6 inches in length.  Peacock cichllids  can be very beautiful and relatively peaceful.  This group of fish can range from many bright and lovely colors.  I don't recommend goldfish, as you'll only be abe to have 2 maybe 3 in your tank.  A goldfish needs 20 gallons for the first and ten gallons for each additional one.  Plecos are a great sucker fish and can live with a wide variety of fish with no troubles.  Just make sure you see what kind you get and thier full size potential.  Many dwarf breeds reach about 5-6 inches, but most common plecos reach 18-24 inches and can quicklly over power your tank.  Best of luck!|`|AA11708471	You need to cycle the tank for about a month and also add some source of ammonia before you add fish.

9GMePSopaa	I've had a leopard gecko for several years now (and I'm only 17), and they're really easy to look after. They're pretty inexpensive.    I have my heat mat on 24/7 and the lamp for about 7 hours a day, but it's not really had a huge noticable effect on the electricity bill. Obviously I'm no expert since my parents pay it, but I've had no complaints 8)    Plus, the enjoyment out-weighs the cost by far :D|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	With a heat lamp, you're talking about less than $5 a month for electricity, and with a heat matt regulated with a thermostat, probably about $1-2 per month.  You can actually figure this out by looking at an electricity bill, figuring out what they're charging you per kilowatt hour, then figure out how much it'll cost you per watt per hour.  Multiply that by your bulb or heat matt strength and estimate the number of hours it's on per day.  It's cheap...|`|p4QFqgzjaa	I don't think the bills will go up much, I have a leopard gecko with a heat lamp and a black light for night, and a firebellied toad with flouresant lighting and I don't think the bill has gone up to much.    I'm assuming your thinking about getting a leopard gecko?  You could get a Crested Gecko they do fine with just room temp and they dont need lights.they're pretty awesome.    good luck! Hope you do your research :]|`|nZf1m8TJaa	I have a leopard gecko and no they are not hard or rack up the electricity bill. They eat 6 crickets a day and 6 meal worms every other day. they have to have a red light on 24/7. they are very loving and i would recommend leopard geckos.

VSX9tzJaaa	Yeah it is okay to let her out for a few minutes depending on the temperature. if it's like 30-40 degrees, they can be out for about 10 minutes. if its like in the 0-30, then try not to let them out for more than 5 minutes. i live in chicago, and my 2 chihuahuas love going outside. however, on days that it is like in the teens and they're outside, their paws get very cold and they stand still in the snow because they can't walk. so, we have to go out and get them. so just be careful when you let her out. also, get her some sweaters so that it will be a little easier once it starts getting warm again.    as for being bored, just try to give her as much attention as possible. also, try to set a chair or couch with blankets or pillows so she can sit on and look out the window. i noticed how my chihuahuas love sitting by the window and looking outside during winter. so i assume that many chihuahuas still enjoy the view even if it means not being outside.  another thing that keeps them entertained is going for car rides. sometimes, when my family has to take a trip to the store or other places, we bring along our dogs. we wrap them up in blankets. while my parents shop, i wait in the car with my dogs. so maybe your dog will enjoy it too. hope this helps.    http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j195/t...    http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j195/t...|`|gwUMipsUaa	Get up and take her out to potty.

She won't die! You need to let her go outside! All dogs need some kind of outside interaction, even the sedentary breeds. It's like keeping her locked up in jail, in a way. Take her out. If you're putting clothes on her, she'll be more than fine. It's not like you're leaving her outside for hours on end.|`|jQglJiMhaa	i have a miniature wiener dog, and i live in Canada, i also work with some people that breed chihuahua's( and also live in canada), you're dog will be fine outside in new york|`|iHjt2nWyaa	Put a coat on it, and maybe boots too.
6Z29aDnjaa	Don't worry, this is normal. I have a tailless gerbil. Gerbils will chew there tail off if it is injured in any way. It will heal over time and your pet should be fine. And as for how it tail got injured there could be may reason, like if there is another gerbil in the cage it could of bitten its tail, it could of got caught on something, picking they up by the tail could of also caused it. Ether way, it will be fine.|`|AA12071655	Gerbils will indeed chew their own tail off if it has them trapped just as a wolf will chew it's leg off to get out of a trap.    You dont' see the tail anywhere? Odd.    It'll grow back though without the white tuft.
TGgo4w0Haa	yes you should as male guinea pigs are very dominant and shall try to harm the babies so that the female will come into season again. they will also not like another threat from the babies. also remove him as when the babies are born she can become pregnant as soon as thirty minuets after the last pup has been born. if she gets pregnant again her condition will worsen and the first litter  will be abandoned by the mother when they still need her as she will devote herself to the second one and then you will have to rear the first one which could be a problem and also there is a chance that the first litter will harm the Second one     put the Male in a cage or if you cannot afford one a makeshift one will do as you can put them back together again, unless you didn't want them to breed any more , then i suggest neutering the male or spaying the female. your other option would be to buy a nice big cage and keep them separate from now on.     good luck with the babies =) have u got names for them yet? i bet u can't wait !|`|J7o7FtZdaa	yes she should be kept along w/ the babies until a certain age of the babies.|`|AA10196640	Yes! He can impregnate her as soon as 30 min after she gives birth, which is not healthy for her. Give him his own cage ASAP!|`|7TuMvfraaa	yes.|`|uvU5DnHcaa	The answer is yes only if you don't want a post pardon mating. The sows are in season from the time they deliver the bubs to anytime from 5 - 8 hours after. Boars do not hurt the young at all , not like people suggest. If your sow is still young, under a year and you in tend to bred her again there is no reason to take the boar out. If you do re-mate her I  do suggest that you rest the sow after that for up to 5 months. Also ween the babies off her at 4 weeks as this will give her time to put back the weight ready to have the next litter. Feeding her high protein and calcium enriched foods from now and til she delivers again.  When breeding from post pardon matings remove the boar after a week. The sow will cope and raise the young better.    The main issue here really is if you don't need to breed her , remove the boar now. Unless you breed to exhibit your animals there is no reason to breed them.|`|10eguzBCaa	yes|`|Bs8sllD9aa	take the male away it might try to kill the babies. They are very dominating  and they feel threatened by the babies.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	yes!|`|3sB49YNnaa	Take him out unless you want you want your sow re-bred shortly after she delivers.  This is not a good idea idea since it doesn't give the sow a chance to recover from the pregnancy and delivery before becoming pregnant again.    You do not need to remove the male for fear he will hurt the pups - he won' but you should remove him for the sow's sake.  I'm not at all sure where the wide spread idea that males will harm pups comes from, it is simply not true as anyone who has raised pigs for any length of time knows.     In nature and in many commercial colonies, groups are housed in large colonies with many sows and a male.  Babies are removed at weaning and everyone else stays together, boar, sows and young pups.  The pups are not harmed by the male, certainly not while they are young.  A boar may be aggressive toward a young male as it reaches sexual maturity but that is a different matter entirely!    I personally don't like the system because the sows get re-bred as soon as they litter but it is done.  These guys are raising animals commercially and if the male was harming pups, they would have fewer to sell so you can be sure they wouldn't do it if it lowered profit!
7f222aac2ff9b3cf155ecfc961dfc183aa	I had a problem with 2 of my dogs fighting. They are bascially fighting for "top dog" status. As dumb as it sounds the trainer we had for my dogs said that as the master we have to remind our dogs that WE are top dog and neither of them are. Some suggestions inculded  1. not sitting on the floor or lowering yourself to them for "puppy" talk  2. marching around like your tough(this one looks funny but it scared the crap outta one of my dogs)  3. talking in stearn voices    The trainer said they are still going to fight sometimes cuz thats what dogs do but it wont be as bad and it will be less. Also she suggets having your female dogs spaded because that will calm them down too. My dogs are well behaved now for the most part. they even sometimes cuddle together! Goodluck|`|AA12128656	keep them separated when you can't directly watch them.  if one of them starts posturing like it's going to fight, you need to remove it and put it away from the other dogs.  having them altered will help, if they aren't already.    you don't need to hit your dogs, but you do need to correct them when they are acting in a way you don't want them to. do whatever you are comfortable with that's effective to them. (i.e. throwing a shake can, spraying them with water, etc) always remove the offender.|`|j2albguDaa	dog whisperer|`|yXs7I2gyaa	pull them appart when they are fighting and smack them lightly.|`|xldYvzw6aa	i have used the techniques from the Monks of New Skete and the Dog whisperer for the past 2 years on my german shep pup and have have absolutely positive results.  the latest things he's been taught to do, be completely social with humans and dogs, close doors when commmanded, walk off leash and stay in close proximity and come when commanded.  and now he's working on turning off the lights....
sGv3RebZaa	Introducing any pet to a new pet is always a tricky process. When the new pet comes home, give it time in a separate room to get used to the smell and feel of her new home. Meanwhile, the other animal can sniff at the closed door. Expect some hissing or growling. Try and limit for the first few days any interaction beyond smelling and the new pet's transition. Give both animals plenty of attention.    After the first week or so (doesn't have to be a week, but certainly more than 3 days), rub a towel or sock on both animals and put the scented towels in the separate rooms (or you can exchange animals into the rooms so they get used to the other animal's smells. Then, after a couple days of that, allow them to meet face to face, preferably by way of a gated door or open the door slightly to allow faces to be seen, but no room to squeeze inside. Expect some more hissing and growling, but do this for a few days, along with allowing your pets to spend time in each other's space so that the scent is gradually mixing for them.     After all this, you can allow your pets to interact, but all animals are different so you may need to back track on a few steps until they both feel comfortable around each other. Always remember to give your first pet lots of love and encouragement so he/she will not feel jealous or territorial.    They may not be the best of buddies, but certainly will be quiet and comfortable with you and each other.

CTc3ZUtNaa	Absolutely! But ONLY use puppy shampoo!  Also, you want to make sure that if your puppy's breed has a long or thick coat of hair/fur you want to be sure to wash all of the soap out... What I recommend is rinsing until you think it's all out, and then rinse again! ;) If you don't get it all out, it could leave behind a layer of soap that could irritate your puppy's gentle skin. :(  Also, make sure you keep water from getting in your puppy's ears!! Ear aches are no fun... and neither are vet visits! :(  Another tiny piece of advice- always wash your puppy's back, legs, tail, chest, body, etc.. BEFORE washing your puppy's head, neck, and face. Once you get his/her face and neck wet, all they want to do is SHAKE!! I save that area until the end! ;)  Good luck!!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Yes.  Use puppy shampoo.  Don't bathe more than once a month.|`|AA12128656	use a good quality pup shampoo and make sure he's completely dry before letting him out of the bathroom so he doesn't catch a chill.    i like to put my dog towel in the dryer (on medium, not high!!!) while i'm bathing them, because it seems to dry them better when it's warm.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Either take him to get groomed, or use something mild like kids shampoo.

There are grooming sprays for puppies also, I would suggest one with coconut oil.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	By all means - give him a bath!  Be sure to use puppy shampoo!  And be prepared to get wet!

Use a 'no tears' baby or dog shampoo.  Put a rubber mat beneath his feet so he isn't frightened by slipping.  Make sure you thoroughly rinse off the soap, as leftover soap itches like crazy.  Dry him thoroughly, but don't frighten him with a blow dryer.  And know that you've washed away the oils that kept him warm and dry, so take extra care to keep him warm and to protect him from rain, snow, etc., for a couple of days.
ArBOK95aaa	oh where to start :)    First, make sure you are financially able to care for a pet, not only the day to day expenses, but have a little reserve in case of an emergency.  as much as we hate to think about it, things do happen.    Next, nutrition.  Check out http://www.catinfo.org it is run by a vet who studies feline nutrition.  Most vets don't.    You'll want to set up one room for a new kitten or cat to get used to before having free run of your house.  return the cat or kitten to that room when aren't around to watch it directly for the first few days.  Make that place a good place to be by providing food, water, litter and bedding, and visiting the cat often and playing with it.    as the cat is more secure in the house, you can let it run around longer and longer periods of time with out direct supervision.    Cats are natural climbers.  You'll want to get a piece of furniture for the kitty to climb and scratch on.    kitties are also most active at dawn and dusk.  that is when they were designed to hunt and catch their prey.  It is when they see the best as well.  your kitty will most likely wake you up before she starts to understand that it is better to wait till you wake up.      Simply ignore behavior you don't want.  If the kitty gets aggressive demanding attention, remove the kitty from the situation (put on the floor)  Cats generally do not understand the word NO, so if you frame your requests of what you want with out using negatives, they understand a little better.  firm tones go a lot further than the words when trying to express a negative (as in do not get on the counters)   hitting and punishing your cat rarely is effective, it simply teaches them not to do it while you are around.  Praise however goes a long long way.  Cats soak up praise like sunbeams.      the more you hold your kitten, the more it will want to be held as an adult, but never hold a kitten against it's will.  Put the kitten down on the floor (don't let it escape, but place all four paws on the floor or sofa) when it starts to struggle.    Oh I'm rambling now :)  one more thing though, adopt from a reputable place that tests and vaccinates their pets.  Even better if they are already altered.|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Try and get one from the pound.  Get one that has clear bright eyes and shiny fur.  Try and get info about the kittens parents and ask if the kitten has any history of family sickness and how its personality is.  Make sure you get a litter tray, food, collar, toys etc.  Don't let it outside until it is at least a year old.   Stay away from the kitten for a few hours to let it look around the area and calm down.  If the kitten comes to you stay calm and let it lick your hand.|`|dmdq0byMaa	I wanted a kitten and got one about 5 months ago. You should never take a kitten from its mother before 8 weeks, and preferably at 12 weeks, by this time they should have learned all the skills they need to know and be totally weaned. They will need injections - 2 lots - in the uk it is approx 50-60. They also need wormed every 3 months - and de flead every month. you should buy these treatments from a vet as supermarket products are not really effective enough. A kitten also needs to play, so plenty of toys and stuff, and dont leave it on its own all day. Two kittens are always better than one. And when they are about 6 months old, they will need to be spayed or neutered.  Kittens are soo gorgeous and they are easy pets to have, they are clean, dont need to be taken for walks and are very cuddly. I would highly recommend it!|`|1saOKrSwaa	make sure its after christmas, two kittens V's a christmas tree... not good! gotta love em though.|`|lK6FzBAuaa	- potty train it immediately!  - play with it alot, or get two so they can play together!  - buy a scratch post, otherwise they'll scratch up everything else in your home!  - and don't buy meow mix, (mine didn't like it) (:  (:    that's pretty much all i can think of    - also change the liter EVERY DAY, or every other day, cause it gets stinky(:  - pet pride litter deodorizer, helps alot.|`|iCdnucujaa	If there is a vet near you that has an adoption clinic in it, I definitely recommend getting the kitten there.  I have learned from experience that they are much healthier there.  If there isn't one look at the condition of the living space and animal before adopting it.  Sometimes at shelters there are a lot of sick animals.  Also have at least one litter box on every floor of your house that the kitten would have access to (recommended, but not necessary).|`|Yr4sJH53aa	somethings you need to know are that kittens love to hide.  any small area they can get into, they most likely will.  so if the kitten goes missing for a day, it's normal.  also, feed them kitten chow.  adult cat food they can't digest right.  and unless you want your couch torn to shreads, get them declawed, unless it is going to be an outside cat.  and as soon as you get it, take it to the vet.  get it checked over and given all the shots, including the one for kitten leukemia.  the rest of your answers can be ansered by the vet.|`|GZqaWCGBaa	cats are very loving creatures, and they need attention in order to feel loved back. as kittens, they are very playful and use everything as a toy; so buying some cat toys is a great idea to keep them entertained. most cats don't like being held like a baby because they feel like they are going to fall if their feet aren't under them(since cats always land on their feet). buying a specialized kitten formula of food is a good idea since kittens aren't as mature digestively speaking as adult cats are. Also, if you are considering de-clawing your kitten to avoid the damaging of furniture, its a good idea to consider the fact that if your pet gets loose and runs away, its claws are its main defense, so without them they are basically defenseless. hope this helps :)|`|ZKLFRxduaa	I never knew anyone to not have a pet before. Good luck. If you are thinking about getting a kitten, you should think about getting a book with it. There are a few out there that have advice on how to care for a kitten. Buy your kitten from the pet shop or registered breeder, or you could adopt from your local animal shelter. Get it registered and give it lots of love and affection. Have fun|`|aQQ1VoIoaa	Kittens are way fun! I've had several. The main thing you'll want to do is make sure he is comfortable around people (i.e. not really timid) or it will hide under couches or beds and behind furniture, and its really hard to find 'em when their little. Make sure that your kitty is at least 6-7 weeks old. By then they are typically ready for the litter box, or are already trained depending on who you get it from. Also, when your kitten reaches 6 mos is a great time for getting it fixed. You'll want to do that, cause if its a boy he'll spray and if its a girl, well, you'll have lots more kittens to deal with! Hope this helps!|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Getting a pet is a life long commitment.  The life of the pet that is.  You should consider where you will be in 15 years, and will this pet still be able to be a part of your life.  Will the cat be an indoor or outdoor?  Can you afford yearly vet visits for vaccines and general health check up?  Can you afford vet when something goes wrong with the health of your pet.  Cats are very independent creatures, but require your constant commitment to it's well being.  They are great companions.  I personally like the males, they seem to be more loving and affectionate.  I would consider adopting a pet from your local SPCA, there is always an animal that requires a forever, loving home.  You have not said how old you are, do you live alone?  Do you live with others that may object to a pet in your household?  A responsible pet owner has their animals spayed or neutered.  I'd not advocate getting a pet if you are not willing or able to commit for it's entire life.

iCdnucujaa	It's great that you wanted to help the kitten.  If you can't take care of it, I recommend giving it to you vet (if they have a adoption center) or giving it to the SPCA.  If you leave them your email they might be able to keep you updated if you are really attached to it.|`|0XsykyuFaa	You have done a right thing saving that kitten    You are depressed because of your worry for that kitten|`|90cyv9f0aa	YOU DID THE RIGHT THING!!!  But its a complicated problem... a malnourished cat may require medication and will probably have some digestive problems that will drive you and your family crazy. Furthermore, you should really isolate all cats from this cat for a while.    IF you can somehow overcome all these problems with LOVE, PATIENCE and DETERMINATION--- as well as convince your family to keep this cat--- YOU should eventually solve these problems in uopwards of 1-3 months and then you may have the GRATITUDE and devotion of this CAT FOREVER... and you should be glad that you mad it... but it won't be easy...    TRULY WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK WITH YOUR CHALLENGE...|`|tpG1KBj4aa	you did the right thing. Think about this-  an unhappy kitten or a dead kitten. try buying some toys and give it alot of attention. if you cant take care of it, find a loving home with a lot of toys and yummy food for it    best of luck:)|`|3arJsZ91aa	I would do exactly the same thing as you and try to take care of it.  Perhaps you could find a humane shelter or ring the RSPCA and see if they would take it in.  At least there, it would get vets attention and perhaps someone would adopt it, or perhaps they would take a look at it for free as you have rescued the poor little thing.  You are doing the best you can and that is a good thing.  Your other kitten is jealous about you bringing another one home.  Perhaps your mother will soften and allow you to take care of it properly.  I can't see that you are doing anything wrong.|`|1saOKrSwaa	you dont find a cat, a cat finds you. yo jack the ripper, aint you seen a cat take dump in the garden?!|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	what your doing is such a good thing, the kitten feels like this because its not feeling well. if i were you, i would do whatever i have to because the poor kitten must be in so much pain. you should call the RSPCA or any other animal charity.  you are doing the right thing and later on you will feel happy that you helped, your very kind to care for this kitten.   please help this kitten, it doesn't matter about everyone else, how you feel is the only thing that matters.    keep your kitten away from the ill kitten.|`|4tI5tE4Oaa	you have a great heart.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	It was very brave of you to take on an orphaned kitten.    She will need veterinary care for a few months until it starts to get better. Eventually it will grow to like you. Cats never forget and if it remembers you saving it, it will love you more than anyone else in your house.    The kitten's probably missing his mommy and feeling hungry. You haven't brought a burden into your home. The gift of life and saviour is better than any. Be happy that you got to the kitten in time.    I would keep your other cat away from the kitten just in case it has an illness.    Well done. You're a good person.|`|sGv3RebZaa	You have, of course, done the right thing.    If you're concerned about being unable to take care of the kitten like it needs to be taken care of, you can take it to a local shelter or humane society that is able to care for it.    It's good that you're thinking about other pets in the house because stray can carry diseases and things like ear mites or fleas that wouldn't be right to expose another animal to.    It sounds like the best option would be to take it to a shelter so they can give it the medical and physical attention it needs.
d8a511ed8e2c16768c6913c95d9f11b7aa	I don't know much about dogs, but I did have a one year old cat that was diagnosed with a significant heart murmur. At the time, the vet said he could live for a couple of months or an entire lifetime...he was put on meds, and passed away last September at the age of 12...so there may really not be an answer to your question...but I would take the very best care of her and enjoy all your time with her, as long as that may be...I hope it's a very long time...good luck!!!...
IrdZKYT3aa	What's your water quality?  If somethings off he may be responding to it.  What's your temp?  These guys actually prefer cooler waters.  You just got him today?  Most fish don't eat their first day, it's very stressful for them!  They get chased around and netted, popped in a bag, taken bumpily home to be placed in an entirely new tank. I'd turn the lights out an dim the room and just leave him be for the day, offer him some food tomarrow.  Most fish can go several days without eating so one day will allow him to settle and get a little hungry. More than likely he's just stressed and scared, allow him some quiet, dark alone time to get settled in his new home : )  Best of Luck!|`|hwQoOSfRaa	Strangely enough, sometimes fish need a 'settling in' period.  Especially if it's only been in the shop for about 3 days, as the constant moving is stressful for them.  Be prepared to call the store if you have no difference by tomorrow lunch time ish. Tell them and take them a water sample.  As if he dies, you should have 48-72 hour warranty at least.   xx|`|JvTF7UrMaa	its probly just seteling in and getting used to the water like fish do, he will stop in a few days each fish has a level in the tank and fantails are mid level fish ::D|`|bVLwH4jlaa	Give him a day or two to settle in.

NnYB9eXiaa	Most commercial hamster food blends are fine for dwarf hamsters :)  Just make sure that millet isn't one of the top 3 ingredients and always supplement with fresh foods.  It ends up being a matter of what your hamster likes the best - just make sure they don't just pick out the yummy bit and leave the pellet foods.  In my personal opinion, Harry Hamster is one of the best foods and my dwarfs all loved it :)    I'm going to give you some fresh food tips, and I'm leaving it with non-dwarf foods listed in case Syrian hamster owners read this as well :)    Any time you introduce a new food to your pet, do it in very small amounts, only feed it once and see how their little tummy handles it.  Some hamsters do better than others with certain foods, but with a little time you'll come up with a snack list that your hamster will love - and that will give them the extra nutrients they may not get from their daily food mix or lab blocks!    Note: Because dwarf hamsters are somewhat prone to diabetes, it is prudent to avoid much sugar in their diet, so avoid fruits as treats for dwarf hamsters. Items with *** should not be given to dwarf hamsters!      Some suggested fruits and vegetables:    *** apples (no seeds!)  *** bananas  *** blueberries  *** cherries (fresh, no pits)  * broccoli  * carrots  * cauliflower  * cucumber  * dandelions greens  *** grapes  * kale  *** peas  * potato (cooked)  * romaine lettuce - not iceberg  * spinach  *** strawberries  *** sweet potato  * squash  * zucchini    Other treats:    * hay   * whole grain bread or toast  * whole wheat pasta (cooked)  * brown rice (cooked)  * whole grain cereal (no sugary cereal)  * meal worms  * crickets or  * small pieces of cooked chicken  * bit of hard boiled eggs  * nuts (no almonds; unsalted) - in moderation  * unsalted peanuts - in moderation  * pumpkin seeds  * lentils (cooked)  * sunflower seeds - in moderation  * plain air popped popcorn (no butter or salt!)  * plain dog biscuits    What to Avoid    * celery (the fiber strings can choke them and high sodium content)  * watermelon (high water content)  * high amounts of lettuce (high water content)  * pork  * raw beans (kidney beans, black beans, lentils)  * raw potatoes  * almonds (they contain cyanide which builds up in the body)  * citrus fruit  * garlic  * onions  * rhubarb leaves or raw rhubarb  * chocolate  * peanut butter  * any sugary or salty foods  * any junk food|`|okH04Nhlaa	Petsmart or eBay|`|oFTbqICiaa	petsmart    petco|`|10eguzBCaa	local market or any pet shops good luck xx

CrNrqvQFaa	A lot of this is just patience. It may take her quite a while to adjust, she's only been there what- a day or two? It may take weeks. If possible, keep her confined to smaller spaces at first and then once she's comfortable there...give her a little more roaming room. She's probably been carted to and fro a lot for vet checkups, people just wanted to touch a cute kitten, and being checked out by strangers who wanted to take her home.    Cats like to do things at their own pace. To be honest, your best bet is to ignore her (not neglect her, just let her have some space to explore so she realizes nothing is going to jump out and hurt her). She's in a new place and doesn't understand it's a home she can live in and be happy the rest of her life, even though you do. If you make a big fuss, and try to pull her out of hiding place she will just think she's been proven right- that there IS something dangerous. You.    Get a cheap variety toy pack, and a bag of treats. See if you can lure her out, but if she isn't ready then just let her be a while and try again later. Cats feel better with a routine, so if you can feed and water her at the same time that will help.|`|d3496b1eb0b2a2ec70adb2a7b6100d89aa	Give her a little bit of time. She's just a baby and she's in a new place away from her mother with a strange cat and people... it's no wonder that she's a little frightened.    For the first couple of days, it's best to keep her confined to one room with food, water and a litter box and some toys. Spend as much time with her as possible. This will give her a chance to adjust to you and bond without being intimidated by your older kitten (and that few couple of months makes a huge difference in their developmental stages). It will also give her a chance to get her bearings and develop a bit of confidence.    When she is comfortable with you and seeks out your attention, you can start slowly introducing her to your other cat. Start off by bringing into her room a pillow or blanket that your other cat uses so she can get accustomed to his scent. Then you can bring the two of them together under close supervision. Being that they are both young, they should adjust to one another fairly quickly. Be prepared for the occasional spat but unless you see that she's really getting beat up on, let them try to work things out on their own.     Just take your time with her adjustment and introducing your other cat and she'll be just fine. Good luck!|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Put her in a room by herself a few hours.|`|90cyv9f0aa	YES.. but you already made some critical first mistakes...    you must seperat these cats at first even for as long as one week... they must never be allowed to see or touch each other... its okay if they smell each other and play under doors... there will come a day that neither hisses at each other... that is the day they can live together...   its very frustrating...  but the best way!|`|1saOKrSwaa	time my friend, time. you could try handling her more, showing her round the house and getting them to eat together, separate bowls though, close together.|`|iCdnucujaa	Kittens do that when you first bring them home.  Try putting her in a room and closing the door.  Go in there with her and try to play with her so she can at least get adjusted to you.  When you let her out of the room just try to treat them as normal as possible and eventually they will get adjusted.  There might be some hissing and fighting between the two cats at the beginning but eventually they will get used to each other.   It will probably take anywhere from 1 week to 1-2 months.
h4wNRqf9aa	if you move everything in the tank over (sand/gravel, filters, decor, water etc) then fill the rest up with dechlorinated tap water, you should see little to no cycle    i'd let the tank run for a while before adding any new fish|`|OsVswissaa	Water holds very little beneficial bacteria but it you can put some filter media in to your new filter that would be better.  If you already have the filter you may be able to set the media from that into the old filter.  Some fish keepers just always have extra media in their filters in case they need to start a cycle.  If you move the filter media in before there are fish in there, you have to add another source of ammonia or the good bacteria will die, so I've done before is this:  put the new filter media in your old filter,  wait a few days, put the fish in the new tank, when you get an ammonia reading in the new tank move the new media in to the new filter.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	well if you add the decore from your old tank to the new one for a day before adding your fish then it would be better as the beacteria would have time to multiply making it not the best conditions for your fish but it would make it livable thats what i did also add a little water from your old tank into your new one like a few jugs full :D and then your fish will survive well myne have for over 3 days now :D and i did it a few days ago when i got a new aquarium|`|qEp9fxU9aa	You don't have to re-cycle ever again.  Take the filter you are going to use in the new aquarium and add it to your 20 gallon.  Let this run for a few weeks to build up biological filtration.  When it is time to set up the new aquarium add gravel from the old tank to the top layer of the new tank, add the filter you purchased for this aquarium, and fill the aquarium half way up with the old water and do a water change in the old aquarium.  When you do this siphon some of the detris and nitrifying bacteria from the top half inch or so of the old aquarium and you shouldn't have any problems.  Some additional tricks to to add a sponge filter to the old aquarium and transfer that as well.  Add some sponges or biological media to the old filter and transfer this when the time comes, you get the idea.  The key is to kick up the biological media in your old aquarium so it becomes seeded and transfer this to the new aquarium along with a good portion of the water and some gravel if the decor will allow this.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The beneficial bacteria inhabits your substrate and filter media.    You may use a piece of the old filter, or some of the old gravel to "seed" the tank, but I would still wait for at least a week just to be sure that the tank is ready for new fish.     ~If you are using the old filter, and the old gravel than it would be okay to add in your old fish.
W0buucLsaa	Echoing the previous advice - get a crate. Even if the dog is perfectly housetrained and doesn't mark, he will appreciate the crate (dogs like to have their own dens; it may depress them if they can't find one). You can put the bed in the bottom of the crate, he will like that. Also, put some treats and toys in there when he first gets home, so he can get used to his new den.    If you want to get really crazy with it - like I do - take the dog bed cover to bed with you and sleep on it for a few days. I know that sounds weird, but dogs identify with their world primarily through smells. They like to sleep in piles of their owner's dirty laundry, for example. They use smells to emotionally bond. (Lots of people would think I'm NUTS for this, but I think it helps, and I've never had a dog yet that isn't fascinated with my pile of dirty clothes.)    I'd also go ahead and load the crate into your car when you pick him up, because some dogs are quite ill-behaved in cars. You don't want to have a wreck on the way home because you're batting the dog away from your face or trying to prevent him from standing on the console. Even if you don't plan on putting him in the crate, it's a good idea just to have it around in case he acts a fool.    Thanks for adopting an adult dog. =) Good luck!|`|nlMfJtxcaa	I'd nix the dog bed and get a dog crate instead. Older male dog + new house full of new smells = lots of marking. Get a crate and get started with potty training.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Many adult rescue dogs come with imperfect housetraining--or none at all--and even dogs who were housetrained in their previous homes will need a refresher course if they didn't get regular walks at the shelter. The good news is it's fairly easy to teach an old dog this new trick. In fact, adult dogs are easier and faster to housetrain than puppies, especially if you use a crate.  here are some guidelines:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=906623316639...    hope this helps.
KnwsvnTjaa	Kittens do need to sleep a lot because they are young and growing.  Teething is normal too.  So don't worry, its ok.|`|VMxqr5iWaa	Kittens/cats sleep a lot and play a lot. when they teeth they can lose multiple teeth at a time. they grown back completely in a few weeks to a month.

ixFbNr4taa	All dogs have them to one extent or another.....    The scientific term for these finely tuned sensory structures is "vibrissae." While the hairs themselves don't contain nerve endings, their base is surrounded by erectile tissue and a rich nerve supply. For instance -- like human eyelashes, they prompt the dog to close its eyes when they're brushed. The whiskers on cats and dogs are highly sensitive to air currents and vibrations. Dogs react quickly when anything brushes against their whiskers -- see for yourself (with a friendly dog, obviously).     Here's a bit from Wiki  Vibrissae (singular: vibrissa), or whiskers, are specialized hairs, usually employed for tactile sensation.  Vibrissae hairs commonly grow around the nostrils, above the lips, and on other parts of the face of most mammals, as well as on the forelegs and feet of some animals. Vibrissae are usually thicker and stiffer than other types of hair.    Vibrissae consist of inert material and contain no nerves, but do have special sensory cells associated with them.  Vibrissae are different from other hairs mainly because they are implanted in a special follicle sealed by a capsule of blood, called a blood sinus. Touching a vibrissa causes it to bend, and the blood in the sinus is pushed to one side or the other. The blood amplifies the movement and allows the mechanoreceptors at the base of the vibrissa to detect extremely small deflections.    In some mammals, the follicles of vibrissae are surrounded by a highly developed sheath of muscle tissue which can be used to move them, such as in the case of whiskers found on cats, dogs and other mammals. A large part of the brain of many mammals is devoted to processing the nerve impulses from vibrissae because it is important to their survival.

Your dog will become used to these kinds of people and be friendly towards them.  I would suggest taking your dog to some kind of training classes (puppy, obedience, etc.) so it can learn basic commands and how to behave.    All in all, make sure it gets used to meeting new dogs and people and knows how to behave.|`|I08iONdaaa	If you brought him/her up well, chances are it'll be fine. Most pits/ dogs that are aggressive tend to be so because they have neglect issues and aren't properly trained from a young age. I think the best idea way to know if they have aggressive tendencies, however, is to observe how they react around smaller animals. Does he go bezerk around cats and, if he does, is it hard for you to control him? Or does he stop when you yell at him. Is he submissive or dominant around other dogs? If he lies down a lot around other dogs it means he's passive, if he harasses them with his tail up he's more dominant. since he's good with other dogs, it's a good sign that he's probably fine. I would just watch for signs that he's ignoring your commands, or getting out of control, which could be signs of potential aggression.|`|s0XR8cxLaa	ohh thats cool your pitbull is friendly   just take care of it and give it care so it wont develop any hate or  anything   like i was saying thats cool i had a pitbull/laborder and my  mom gave it away it was way to aggressive|`|DuNMpJleaa	With pit bulls you can never be to sure if they are going to be aggressive.  Just make sure that no one ever corners (him or her) and gets on their nerves, because dogs can't just push a person annoying them away, then they might bite.  Just raise it with love, make sure you socialize it with adults, kids ,and other dogs. If you do that you won't have any problems. Hope this helps.    Debz|`|tZV7DAcVaa	Why would your pit become aggressive?  Are you mean to him or are others?  Do you taunt him or keep food away from him?  Aggression is a learned behavior.  It's usually a survival technique.  Just because your dog is a pit does NOT mean he/she will be aggressive.  Don't blame the breed, blame the owner.  I have 2 pits.  Both are as sweet as can be.  One actually is my 10yr olds dog.  His favorite thing...getting belly rubs from my son.  If you want your dog to be sweet and loving...then treat him that way.  They feel that their job is to please you.

He is loving, playful and frankly too friendly for my own comfort. He assumes all humans are wonderful. We recently adopted a beagle and my vet (former vet) was convinced it was a horrible idea because he thought my pitt would attack her. Well it has been two years and Achilles (my pitt) loves his new little sister. They play tug-of-war together, sleep together and chase each other around the house.     Pitts have as much chance as any other dog of becoming aggressive, but they are not genetically inclined to be more aggressive. This is a myth.     It sounds to me like you have a loving loyal pitt and I don't think you have anything to worry about.     check out this link:    http://www.pitbulllovers.com/site-map.ht...|`|YUQgyPT3aa	There is no reason for your dog to just >POOF    If the dog is well cared for, healthy, exercised regularly, affectionate, well-trained / obedient, you really shouldn't have to worry about an aggressive dog....regardless of the breed.
I38WF5aFaa	Rabbits are easy to care for but they are better as small livestock than pets.  Rabbits are an excellent way for someone to raise his own meat without needing pasture space or expensive housing.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	Not really they will eat carpet, wire cords and a lot of things that are expensive. Bunnies are great to eat thou. Chow down.|`|KkSZ1BfCaa	Well it depends on if u like them because bunnys dont really do much, there cut but all they do is sleep and eat.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	Bunnies can make good pets and may be the ideal pet for people living in small apartments. They do require a great deal of socialization in the early months, as well as intensive litter box training. They are also better suited to families with older children, children well instructed in bunny care, or for adults with no children. Young children may be too anxious to hold rabbits, and this can result in a bunny that is poorly bonded. Contrary to popular belief, bunnies can be litter box trained. They do, however, have the tendency to explore things by chewing, so one should have a bunny-proofed environment. It is especially important to supply lots of safe chewing opportunities and chew toys. As well, electrical plugs and exposed wires are very dangerous to the bunnies, so these should be kept well out of sight. A bunny should also not roam the house without supervision, since investigative chewing is likely to occur under these circumstances. Instead, when one cannot be home with these animals, it is important that they have cages equipped with a litter box, and spacious enough so the bunny does not feel confined.    Small bunnies should have a cage that is at least 2 feet (.60 m) by 3 feet (.91m), with a height of about 1.5 feet (.45m). Larger bunnies need a bigger cage, and minimum dimensions should be 2.5 feet (.76m) by 3 feet (.91m), with at least a 2-foot (.60) height. This is the minimum. Most rabbits enjoy a slightly larger cage. Multiple rabbits may be housed in large rabbit condos that have several levels.    Bunnies can be affectionate, but as irresistible as they may seem, they dont like to be held. They also usually dont like to sit on laps. They do however, like to be close to the people with whom they have bonded. One can lie on the floor, and the bunnies will likely stay close by, or cuddle up close.    Since normal rabbit behavior usually involves rabbits living together in burrows, one can understand why the rabbit likes to lay close to a person it likes. Rabbits also may enjoy being petted or brushed, especially if they are trained to accept these behaviors early on.    Rabbits do have strong smelling urine. The smell reduces a little if the rabbit is spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering is very important. It promotes docility and prevents rabbits from feeling the urge to constantly mate. Rabbit health care is slightly more expensive than cat or dog care. Small animal specialist fees may vary. Certain breeds seem to make better pets. Large lop-eared rabbits seem to be more docile as a rule, and tend to be a bit more affectionate. Smaller rabbits like Dwarfs, and Mini-Rexes, tend toward more behavior problems. Most fans of rabbis will disclaim this however, and point to various examples of each breed that are excellent pets. However, consider choosing a fairly calm pet if this is ones first rabbit experience. One wont get the same interactive quality from a rabbit that comes from a cat or dog. However, rabbits do like to play with toys, and an affectionate rabbit can provide quite a bit of entertainment. Care for the rabbit is a bit more labor intensive than care for an outdoor cat, for example. Many however find that the care is well worth the price for having rabbit friends.|`|YXywKp6Caa	Bunnies are not easy to take care of. Every day you'll need to change out their food and water and every other week you need to clean their cages. They need a lot of attention. About 20-30 minutes a day. You'll need to also make sure that they have plenty of room to run around. A good size bunny to get would be a Netherland Dwarf or a Mini Rex. You might want to look for breeders to get one of these bunnies or try a local pet store.
nZf1m8TJaa	don't feed him too much meat and start feeding him more fruit. they need to eat lettuce too, but good job staying away from the pellets, I would never suggest them|`|CdRlOsnyaa	dont feed them to much or there shell will grow to uick adn start to pyramid, and when they get older lay of the protein and switch to veggies like watercres lettuces carrots and some fruits.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Baby RES eat mostly live whole food for the first year and then are mostly vegetarian with a little meat after that. I would advise not feeding toomuch krill especially if it's freeze-dried.     For the first year, feeder minnows or guppies, earthworms, bloodworms, and gutloaed crickets make good meat choices. Avoid feeding goldfish. They get alot of their calcium and nutrition they most need at this point of life because they are growing so fast from the bones and liver of whole food. You can supplement with vegetables and pellets now but later on switch to the other way around. Good veggies would be turnip greens, kale, watercress, shredded carrots, spring mix (bagged salad mix), and in small amounts romaine. Strawberries, canteloupe and bell peppers make good fruit treats, but they should not get these more than once or twice a month. Good pellets include Reptomin sticks, ZooMed natural aquatic turtle food (pick the right formula for your turtle's size, it comes in hatchling, growth, and maintain formulas), cichlid food, and Aqua-Max (trout chow). These should not account for more than 15 or 20% of your turtles' total diet.

9kceDOTraa	It could be any number of things.  Sounds to me like wherever you got them from wasn't keeping their tanks in the best of shape.  Also, the addition of such a massive load into your tank all at once isn't the best of things either.  Just what size tank you trying to keep such a stock in?  How mature is that tank?    Melafix for now is not a bad option, but in the future, keep in mind, it's not very wise to put any medication or chemicals to treat affliction in, unless you know what you are treating.  You are more likely to do more harm then good if you go tossing in meds without first knowing what is the issue.    It's really hard to say here what's going on, at least with the eyes.  That rapid of onset, it's one of two things really.  Either they are just carrying it in from the tank they came from, or it's already in your tank.  Without knowing the past history of your tank, how old, size filtration, what's been in there, who knows for sure.      Consider that moving fish like this is stressful and many afflictions could already be in a fish, and be suppressed by the immune system and introduce some stress and shock, that's all it takes for the pathogen to act up.  How long did you acclimate the fish to your tank water?  This could also have a shock factor involved if you didn't use a long enough acclimation process, and there are vast differences in your tank water chemistry and the tank they came from.
V5Ib9BCsaa	im all for adopting from the pound. there are so many dogs that get put to sleep and never get to have loving forever homes. you never know the temperaments of dogs you get from the pound. not jsut pits, any dog. pits do make wonderful family pets. they are great with children. the ones you see in the news are jsut products of bad owners. chaining dogs in yards cause aggresion and most of the bites you here about are from chained up dogs. pits get severe seperation anxiety and need alot of quality time. they actually pass the temperament test in the top 90% with a 84% passing rate. they score better than labs and cockerspaniels. here is a video id like you to watch. its only a couple of minutes and it will show you how great of a family dog they can be                                    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeuy_PBlq...      i have no idea why i got a thumbs down but its ok, i know that everything i said can be found on the internet as true. i have done my research, have you? i even offered a video to help prove my research.   and to the person that said since they were bred to fight they are aggresive towards humans are wrong. it was frowned upon in the dog fighting rings to have a human aggresive dog. they got these dogs to fight because of the loyalty they had towards their human. they always stood were the dog could see them often in the ring. they were almost always family pets. now though people mistreat them to make them human aggresive but they are one of the few breeds of dogs to never be bred to be human aggresive.....|`|6AqFenaSaa	When you adopt a dog from the pound or from a rescue org, it will be neutered or spayed, up to date on shots, have recent vet records, be non-aggressive, be socialized with people and other dogs and have passed a temperment test. This all is standard.    The temperment test we use is a 100+ point questionairre that the dog's handlers perform over a few weeks, rating the dog on very specific and indicative situations and their reactions to certain stimuli. It's invaluable because every dog is different and has had individual experiences - there are ill tempered pit bulls that can't be trusted and there are sweet pit bulls that make wonderful family dogs, too.     i.e. The ups guy delivers a package. How strongly/ actively does the dog react 1-5 ?  1 being no reaction,   3 being barks and runs to door   5 being goes nuts trying to break the door down.     or Food aggressive 1-5   1 being never   3 being sometimes   5 being always. etc.    If you save a dog from the pound you are doing 2 great things - obviously you're saving an animal's life but also your donation to the shelter enables them to treat other unfortunate abandoned or mistreated pets with medical problems or too old to be adopted.    Now is the time to adopt a pet form a shelter because so many people are losing their jobs and their homes and finding themselves unable to keep their pets any more. Surrenders are higher than they have ever been and adoptions are at a record low. Please take this route when you get your pet, if not with this particular pit bull than please with another homeless dog.|`|1oJtJCaWaa	There are a lot of good answers here and I can agree with most of them.    The one thing you must remember is that pit bulls were bred to be fighting dogs.  Aggressiveness is in their blood.  With the instinct to fight, a docile, gentle pit bull could easily turn, and they have the ability to with their extra strong jaws and chest, let alone one that has been through the stress the ones from the pound have. Being couped up in a cage for goodness knows how long and maybe even coming from an abusive family, or even being taken away from a good family could exasperate the dogs temper.  Please remember that this is a living, breathing being and not just some toy that can be discarded when your tired of it.  It needs love and affection, time and money (it being a pound puppy, more so than most).  If you are not prepared to give all of this, don't even consider it.|`|F27az9NEaa	I adopted both of my American Staffordshire Terriers from the pound and it was the best decision I ever made.  I guess the best thing about it is with older dogs what you see is what you get. Puppies have the potential to grow up to be good, or bad depending on the owner.  A APBT isn't the breed for everyone. They have high energy and will require an outlet. He will need sufficient exercise and mental stimulus.  You'll also be saving a life, so kudos on that.    I honestly, can't think of any negatives. Like with any dog you will adopt, you'll want to take him to the vet and have him checked out & neutered.  Since he's at the humane society, they've probably done a temperament test on him, if not I would ask about that.    --  Like another poster said, you'll want to check with your landlord. Many places havea weight limit, or may have breed restrictions which may not allow you to own an APBT (or mix) in your home.   You'll also want to be sure you've got a fenced in yard and enough patience, time to commit to such a responsibility.  && please, please, remember that if/when you bring him home, he will (or he may not, generally most dogs need time) need time to transition. He's moving to a new and unfamiliar place.|`|wS9TkFcvaa	It will not eat you and your kids!!!     Talk to the people at the shelter, often times if its been there for a little while they come to know its temperment. Tell them about your lifestyle, daily activities, such as that. They won't let you adopt an animal that won't suit you, they don't want to see him back in there in a few days or weeks.     As far as the aggressive thing goes that depends on you. Take good care of the dog treat him nice and he'll do the same. Dogs are like kids they learn from watching you, and are believers in the golden rule. Just do your homework and if you decide to adopt I'm sure he'll be a wonderful dog.     Good luck!|`|SbLeCOjZaa	I adopted a pit mix from a local shelter about 6mos ago and it was the best decision I've ever made! You have to be prepared to go for some long walks to get the energy out, but other than that, they really aren't difficult to own.

They are nicknamed "the nanny dog" because theyre good with kids. You will need to be extra diligent training, exersizing and socializing this breed due to public opinion. You will have to be prepared for lots of negative remarks, reactions to your pup even if it IS well trained. Do lots of research on training methods and know how you will train your pup. The up side is the shelter will probably evaluate the dog before you get him and vaccinate/ fix him. The only down side to shelter dogs is that you probably wont know pups history. Check local laws where you live to see what laws there are regarding pits, and know what will happen if he bites someone. Good luck and thank you for considering adopting the pooch.|`|n8jrLDblaa	You want to do some serious research before committing to a pit bull.    As terriers, there are some breed-specific behaviors you have to be mindful of...like prey drive, and animal aggression. Also, these are HIGH energy, athletic dogs. If you're a couch potato, it might not be the breed for you. They are capable of being very destructive when bored, so be sure you can provide adequate physical/mental stimulation before committing.    Also, be prepared for funny looks, nasty comments, and troubles finding an apartment that will accept a pit bull, and insurance difficulties of you own a home. Unwarrented as they may be, it sorta comes with the territory.     AND, bear in mind that once you are a pit bull owner, you are responsible for making your dog an outstanding example of the breed. That responsibility cannot be taken lightly.    I've included sites to start your research below.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Some states require insurance for that type of dogs, and some apartments don't even allow them, so look that up first.    The only con in getting any animal from the shelter is that you don't know if it was mistreated before, so you may have to work more on it to make the animal feel comfortable.  They may have some trust, behavior, or anger issues.    Good luck! ^-^|`|igGDiiczaa	Pit Bulls are Agile, Athletic and FUN     The Flipside: Pit bulls can be Escape Artists!   Many can climb tall fences, dig underneath, or Houdini their way out of the most secure yards. Many are forever lost or stolen once they're out. Owners should provide a very secure set-up and supervise all play when the dog is outdoors, and keep him indoors when no one's home. If indoor accommodations are not possible, we recommend an outdoor kennel run with a good lock, or a well designed cable tie-out. Always have a collar and tags on your dog in case they do get lost. Microchip your pet too! Animal shelters are so crowded that they can't hold lost dogs for more than a few days and yours could be destroyed before you can find her if she isn't tagged and/or microchipped. On behalf of all the lost pit bullies who never make it safely back to their home, BAD RAP asks you to PLEASE be extra safe with your dog!   Sally, above, is enjoying her supervised yard time with a favorite toy.    The Brightside on the Flipside: Pit bulls are impressive dogs to show off in agility work, fly ball, and other exciting dog sports. You can utilize a pit bull's athletic talents by having a great time with your pooch in ways that may surprise you. Check out these dogs who have helped raise the sport of skateboarding to a whole new level    Pit bulls Love to Swim, Run, Play Frisbee and Romp in the Great Outdoors    The Flipside: Finding places where your dog can run offlead can be very difficult, if not impossible! Many areas don't allow pit bulls to be offlead and areas that do can be difficult places to visit. If your dog gets in a fight with another dog, things could go very badly very fast. You may be the one to get into trouble and your dog could end up in jail, even if he wasn't the one to start the fight.  Because of the current prejudice against pit bulls, because your pit bull can cause a lot of damage to another dog, and because it's impossible to completely avoid poorly managed loose aggressive dogs in the parks (this incudes YOUR dog if you're not on top of his dog aggression potential!), smart owners of mature bull breeds choose to play it safe and steer clear of these places in favor of safer options. Photos: Lola is taking a dip in a 'secret' place far from the maddening crowd and Roca Bean is enjoying her own private baby pool.    The Brightside on the Flipside: Because many pit bulls tend to be happier around dogs that they know, you may be able to find or create 'play groups' where your dog can regularly visit with other dog 'friends' for fun and exercise. Both and you and your dog will benefit from the extra socialization.  The Other Flipside: Pit bulls can be very active dogs that need a LOT of run around time and exercise. Don't get a young pit bull if you live your life in the slow lane.  The Brightside on the Flipside: Your dog will nudge you into getting in shape, like it or not! We like to say "A tired pit bull is a happy pit bull". So your runaround time spent exercising your dog will reflect in your improved health and happy outdoor glow. Enjoy!    Pit Bulls are Social Butterflies    Your dog will LOVE to go places with you to see the sights and visit with your friends, family, and strangers on the street. The pic shows 'Sally' very excited about the idea of going out for a ride in the car.        The Flipside: Over the last 20 years or so, the pit bull has fallen victim to the careless deeds of unethical breeders, irresponsible and even shady owners. This bad combination, along with the handiwork of a sensationalistic media, has done a terrible thing to our beloved breed. As a result, myths, misdeeds, misunderstanding and hysteria abound! When you walk around with your bulldog, you'll no doubt encounter people who'll be afraid of her or who give you trouble for having a pit bull.   The Brightside on the Flipside: By taking your well behaved bully out into the world, you'll have the pleasant opportunity to talk to lots of folks that you meet. By doing so, you can help dispel the myths about pit bulls as you proudly show off your dog. Hanging out at the local coffee shop with your lovable pit bull by your side will probably bring you more interesting conversations then you ever thought possible. And undoubtedly, you'll be making friends while you're busy changing minds. Enjoy!   Not sure how to explain your love of bullies to someone who's been corrupted by nasty news reports?

If you have the time, space, energy and ambition, you shouldn't have any problems.    Ask the shelter if you can take him home with you for a weekend to see how well you will fit together. Our shelter allows this in certain cases.     good luck and thank you for adopting.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	they are GREAT dogs  but there are the 3 breeds generalized as pit bulls:  American Staffordshire Terrier  American Pit Bull Terrier  Staffordshire Bull Terrier    they are loving, loyal...anything you could ask for a dog.  they are great running partners  and will never leave your side    they are beautiful.    but. as with any dog...there ARE downsides    they were bred for fighting/bullbaiting  so remember that
kWwgWSSgaa	A well breed Dobermann is anything but mean, but is *not* the breed for the weak willed or novice handler, as they very much have a mind of their own & need to be able to respect their handler/pack.     Dobes are an incredibly loyal, faithful and devoted dog, valued for their physical and mental ability. The Dobermann needs mental stimulation as much as physical exercise. They thrive on being worked and mentally stimulated, and will not be satisfied being house-bound 23 hours a day with one hours run around the park.     Dobes love to work, they need mental as well as physical exercise, so if you want a breed to walk around the park for an hour after work, a Dobe isn't the breed for you. When they are fully grown, Dobes require a minimum of 1? hours hard walking/ free running each day.    Dobes are a very sensitive breed, and being over harsh or shouting too loudly will never be forgiven. However, you do need to let your Dobe know his or her place in the pack, and that is at the bottom of it!     As with all dogs, a combination of love and discipline is important, and there is a very fine line between being too hard and too soft. Hard handling can make for a shy, cautious animal which is as much of a danger as an over-confident dog. It is finding the right balance that determines how successful you would be in owning this breed.    Dobermanns are usually excellent with children. Provided your child is old enough and kind with animals, and the dog knows their place in the pack, they will rarely if ever see themselves as dominant over a child. Children and dogs should always be supervised, not necessarily to protect the child, as children can often unwittingly hurt a young puppy.    A well bred Dobermann in responsible hands is an asset to the family. It's my breed of choice & I currently have two adult Dobermanns.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4rL7lcfF... Watch these videos. Dobies have been breed over the years to not be so aggressive. They are very smart pups and see the chihuahua terrorize the dobie. They are really funny.|`|igGDiiczaa	i personally love dobdobs there so sweet but here are some thingsto consider... i hope this helps and good luck!    If you want a dog who...         Is large and strong, yet sleek- and elegant-looking   Has a short easy-care coat   Thrives on exercise, athletic activities, and challenging things to do   Looks serious and imposing, so makes an effective deterrent even when friendly   A Doberman Pinscher may be right for you.        If you don't want to deal with...         An extra careful search to avoid dangerous lines   Providing enough exercise to keep him satisfied   Rowdiness and exuberant jumping, especially when young   Aggression, sharpness, suspiciousness, or shyness when not socialized enough   Aggression toward other animals   Emotional sensitivity to stress and loud voices   Physical sensitivity (tendency to react defensively when startled or mishandled)   Shedding   A multitude of serious health problems   Legal liabilities (public perception, future breed bans, insurance problems, increased chance of lawsuits)   A Dobermann Pinscher may not be right for you.        If I were considering a Doberman Pinscher...       My major concerns would be:      Unstable temperaments. Doberman Pinschers are a dime a dozen, and most of them are bred and offered for sale by people who don't have the slightest idea of how to breed good-tempered dogs. Obedience instructors and behavioral consultants see LOTS of Doberman Pinschers with neurotic behaviors, including aggression and biting, extreme fearfulness, and hyperactivity.    Providing enough exercise and mental stimulation. Doberman Pinschers MUST have regular opportunities to vent their energy and do interesting things. Otherwise they will become rambunctious and bored -- which they usually express by barking and destructive chewing. Bored Doberman Pinschers can make a shambles of your house and yard.    If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking or swimming, or to get involved in agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or tracking, or schutzhund (protection), or a similar canine activity, I do not recommend this breed.       Providing enough socialization. Many Dobermann Pinschers have protective instincts toward strangers. They need extensive exposure to friendly people so they learn to recognize the normal behaviors of "good guys." Then they can recognize the difference when someone acts abnormally. Without careful socialization, they may be suspicious of everyone, which could lead to biting. Some Dobermans go in the opposite direction -- without enough socialization, they become fearful of strangers, which can lead to defensive biting.    To teach your Doberman to listen to you, "Respect Training" is mandatory. My Doberman Pinscher Training Page discusses the program you need.       Animal aggression. Some Doberman Pinschers are dominant or aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex. Many have strong instincts to chase and seize cats and other fleeing creatures. If anything goes wrong in the breeding, socializing, training, handling, or management of this breed, it is capable of seriously injuring or killing other animals.    Emotional sensitivity. Be honest...is there tension in your home? Are people loud or angry or emotional? Are there arguments or fights? Doberman Pinschers are extremely sensitive to stress and can end up literally sick to their stomachs, with digestive upsets and nervous behaviors, if the people in their home are having family problems.    If you have small children, I do not recommend a Doberman Pinscher. First, young Dobermanns (up to about two years old) romp and jump with great vigor, and things can go flying, including people. Second, Doberman Pinschers may try to protect their own children from other children, which could lead to tragedy if kids are simply roughhousing and your Doberman decides to stop it. Finally, there are just too many Dobermans who feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result.       Shedding. Doberman Pinschers shed more than you might think. Their short coarse hairs come off on your hands when you pet them, and stick tenaciously to your carpeting, upholstery, and clothing.    Extremely high prices. Some breeders are charging over $1500 for a Doberman puppy. In my opinion, this is absolutely absurd and I wouldn't even consider supporting prices like this.    Serious health problems. In the health department, Doberman Pinschers are extremely risky. An alarming number of Dobermans die of heart disease and cancer at an early age.    To keep this breed healthy, I strongly recommend following all of the advice on my Doberman Pinscher Health Page.       Legal liabilities. Doberman Pinschers may be targeted for "banning" in certain areas, or refusal of homeowner insurance policies. Your friends and neighbors m|`|DuNMpJleaa	Get one they are awesome guard dogs and very cute, playful, active, and friendly! I |`|f7fce61e2d91eb61eb61040f54dca83eaa	They are very loyal and smart dogs. They are also very high energy dogs. If you do not have the time to walk them or take them out to let them run DAILY, I would not recommend one. They can also be very vocal both in barking and whining. The barking can be a good thing if you are looking for protection, but it, along with whining, can get annoying.|`|iMOePEWlaa	i do not recomend this dog to first time owners.    The Doberman pinscher is an intelligent dog, It is also a loyal and adventurous companion. It likes to be mentally challenged and is a gifted obedience pupil,if properly trained. this breed dosnt do well with punishmentbased training. It is sensitive and very responsive to its owner's wishes, though some can be domineering. It is generally reserved with strangers. It can be aggressive with strange dogs,but with time and proper socilaztion this can be avoided.    needs daily mental and physical exercise, lest it become frustrated or destructive due to bordom. Its exercise requirements can be met with a long jog or walk on leash, or a run in a safe area. The Doberman can live outside in temperate climates, but it is a much better companion (and better behaved) if it shares its human's home    iv had 2 one was a rescue and wasnt to good with other animals due to an abusiv former owner. the other was the perfect pet.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I have one. Great temperament. My 5 year old nephew will rough house with him and he plays great. This includes trying to ride him like a horse. They are extremely smart. I think they are in the top 5 smartest dogs. Here is a link to intelligence. http://petrix.com/dogint/1-10.html  They easily are trained, and pick up on new tricks quickly.   Ours has never shown aggression. They are protective though, not aggressive. Ours will go sit at the edge of the yard if it sees other people out. No barking, No growling, just watching to making sure there is no threat. They are high energy and need walks and exercise. Ours loves to play in water and to rough house with our other dog. They are big time lap dogs and get really attached to the family. I hope this helps.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well i had one as a child .. very smart can be taught about anything. there not super hyper but do like to be walked and get out .. not a dog to keep pined up. there very clean  don't shed hair like some breads. I like them .. if i had my choice i would say there a good around dog. As a child i enjoyed mine. but like all dogs it is more training than breed.. That is the key to having a well rounding pet...|`|riCfCxjEaa	My family had dobes when I was a child and my home has never been without one since!  They are extremely smart and trainable but they do need to be trained.  Find a great obedience class and you will form an awesome bond with your dobe.  they tend to follow you around and want to be where ever you are.  They are loveable, great with kids but as with all dogs, they need plenty of socialization as a puppy.  My dobe has just become a certified pet therapy dog and we go to schools and the kids love him!  They need structure,obedience, and lots of exercise!  Good luck!

Where you the primary person who gives him attention?  I bet you are!  What you need to do, is talk to the cat, trust me it work... Have him know he is still  1, even a new baby is on the way.  I know it is hard for you to move, have your husband get you a a nice long string.. where it does not take you any effort to play with the cat.  Have your daughter spend more time playing with him.       All the best, take a brush and brush him and communicate, it should help change the personality!     Good luck!

I got her vaccinated and rabies in october and the vet didnt ask if I had her on heart worm treatment and i never thought about asking! this whole time we thought she was pregnant BUT what was happening was her belly swelling and she was to anemic! there was nothing they could do so we put her down. my heart is breaking, right now my four children cry at sporadic moments.we are numb and what i keep hating myself for is that THIS ALL COULD'VE BEEN PREVENTED! if we had just had her checked. i killed my furbaby. burying her with all her toys in my son's favorite jacket is the most excruciating thing we've been through. please do take her to the vet.

OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Dog-dog aggression is a very serious matter. Until your dog's successfully treated, keep him a safe distance from all other dogs ("safe distance" meaning the minimum amount of space he needs to remain calm and unstressed).  here's a treatment:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=511597766131...    hope this helps.
MGxDgsKZaa	Odds are she poked it on something or scratched herself, in which case, it should be fine by morning. Don't worry about it unless you see lots of discharge or if it's worse tomorrow (in which case, call your vet for advice).|`|AA10372466	It could be something as simple as having had the surface of her eye abrased by something.  She could also have an infection beginning which could be easily cured with an antibiotic of some kind.  Knowing how vulnerable a precious little kitten is, I would not waste time trying to do an in-home diagnosis.  I would definitely take her to see a vet as soon as possible.  Her eyesight depends on YOU.
w1lh1INHaa	Those can be symptom of a few issues, but my first reaction would be some kind of dental/oral or jaw issue.  He could have been injured whilst outside, or the mouth issues could have just blossomed and/or gotten to the point where he is finally showing the distress.    In any event, this requires a visit to the vet tomorrow to determine the problem, and get proper treatment.|`|qPz4Dem3aa	It may also be feline leukemia. I had three cats with those similar symptoms a few years ago and I had to put them all 3 down due to it. Get him to the vet ASAP.|`|dcc094e2921578d9e4b6e4f1fe43a6d8aa	Get him to a vet NOW.  This sounds too much like rabies.  If you've kept him vaccinated, then he'll be in the clear for that at least.  However there are plenty of reactions to foriegn things such as garden plants, vermin poison, animal poison, and yes, other diseases that can't be fully vaccinated against.    Get him to your vet as soon as you can!  Any longer and it may be too late!|`|Mq6B3VSjaa	Uh...I would think an alleged certified vet tech would know a little more about rabies and the symptoms.  I doubt rabies for a lot of reasons.    Yes, Feline Leukemia can show those symptoms, but the jaw clacking makes me think, also, that it is dental or the jaw.      However, none of us are vets (and that includes a CVT) so get him to the vet and checked out.
42dHANvqaa	lol ok first TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND HOLD IT IN FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN SLOWLY LET IT OUT. lol that should help the screaming thing. Ok now about the drill team issue... I completely understand where you are coming from. My parents always say I spend too much time with the horses too. Anyways, I would try to remain calm and don't yell or cry to your parents, or beg. Try to spend more time with them. Maybe you could incorporate your parents and horses. Go for a trail ride together or have them come and help groom and love the horses. Show them that horses are your true passion. Then they should understand.|`|0f9b2cc233e37affd9dd86a519176889aa	Well other people probably aren't going to like your suggestion but if you have a license and can pay for it why do you need there permission to do it. Can't you do it anyway?|`|6irSIW7xaa	you should feel lucky, I worked for a lady when I was 11-13  (until my parents told her it was no deal unless I got some pay as they were at any point I was working for her boarding 1 or 2 horses, and paying $500 a month for each ), never got a penny out of her, nor anything in return for my work. I was working some pretty long day's, came in at a moments notice, and helped out the other workers when I was not working.    oh yea I forgot, she sometimes let me exersize her daughters bat(insert word here) crazy horse, who her daughter was too scared to ride, and let me ride this standardbred that was so crazy some of the better riders in the barn wouldn't even go to catch her in the paddock.  oh and she yelled at me alot. Horses got loose when I wasen't even working? my fault. Daughter fell off? my fault. Sink breaks when I am not in the bathroom? yep that apparently was my fault too becuase I was the only one (at 12 mind you) who had the guts to tell her what the heck happened...     It's alot more than you think, they are lending you a horse is return for labor. The horse still eats food, the coach still needs to be paid, and tack is quite expensive. and on top of the economy right now, you should be glad they are even willing to do this. You really should be happy they let you ride. I know so many kids that would kill to be in your position right now, to even be able to ride once a month at that.     Drill team is something extra, sure you might want to be on it, but honestly your still riding either way. I was on a drill team for 3 years. I was a rec. leader, secretary, co-captain, and finally (a week or two before I quit) captain. Yea it was fun, but if I never had gotten a chance to do it honestly I don't think I would have missed out on a single thing.|`|8bTder08aa	I'm going for the "thumbs down" storm here...    Lauren:     You say:  "They say that they already do soo much for riding, which really isn't true at all! "    You don't get to decide this for someone else, any more than you would like someone else to decide for you whether you're doing too much or not enough for them.    In reading your rant, we're told what you feel, what you think is fair, what you are doing, but I didn't really read anything at all about their side of the story.  Unless your parents are complete ogres, they must have a reason for feeling the way they are feeling.  It would be an indication of maturity if you were fair enough to be explicit about what their issues are.    You say:  "All they pay for is gas!!"  Well, as a car owner who has to pay for the mechanical beast, I have to tell you that every extra mile you put on a car costs you in wear and tear that leads to repairs, that there are things like tires that wear out, and that the more miles you drive the more often you have to do oil changes, filter changes, and other such things.  And for a while this past year, gas was up over $4/gallon (in my area, it was over $5/gallon in some locations).  That adds up.  It's never "just" the cost of gas.    There is also the issue of time.  Your parents have responsibilities and things they have to get done, that they cannot do if they are ferrying you to the stable.  (Heck, they might actually have things they would like to spend free time doing, if they have free time.)  I have to say that your parents are probably irritated as all heck that you seem to think that for them to take the time to drive you to the stable is not a big deal.  I have a 16-year-old daughter, and if she was that cavalier about making commitments of MY time, which I might want/need to spend on things that are important to ME, I wouldn't feel very much like going out of my way to drive her.  (In fact, I'd be kicking myself for allowing her to fall into such an egocentric and inconsiderate attitude.)    As a parent, I can tell you that you're a thousand times more likely to get your parents to do something that IS, in fact, an inconvenience for them, if you take an attitude of humility and consideration for the fact that they are entitled to decide how they spend their free time.  They have no obligation to drive you anywhere.  It is in fact frequently an inconvenience for parents to arrange their schedules to play chauffeur.  And it is an attitude of ingratitude to appoint yourself queen, or princess, or goddess, and decide that   you have the right to decide how much inconvenience for them is too much or not enough.|`|pR4JVtSJaa	The sad truth is, your parents do get to decide what you are and are not allowed to do until you move out and support yourself.  Yeah, it drove me nuts sometimes, too.    So regardless of who is paying for what, it will NEVER help to tell them they're wrong.  At least not in so many words.  Ask them if you can schedule a meeting with them to talk about drill team.  This gives both them and you a chance to organize what you want to say, and makes the thing more formal so both sides are more likely to keep their cool.  You can even dress up just a little, wear khakis instead of jeans or something, just to show you're serious.    Write down why you want to be on the drill team.  Take notes on what you already do to support your hobby.  Write down what else you will do to support drill team, how much more time it will take, how you will get to the barn and back, how you'll keep your grades up, and so on.  See if there are alternatives - can a friend take you there, or drop you off afterwards?  Will there be costs about going to shows or competitions above the rehersals?  What about costumes or uniforms? Are you expected to help fundraise through selling or some other supporting activity like even more work around the barn?    Ask your parents what their objections are.  Even if your grades are perfect, they may worry about you exhausting yourself, or one more activity taking time away from your studies so grades will suffer.  Maybe they think they see too little of you as it is.  If you don't understand a reason, say so and ask them to explain again, or explain why you don't think it's a problem.  Just never bring up the whole "I sacrifice more than you" or "I pay for it and you don't" thing.  Parents hate that bit.  The more you act like an adult, the more reasoned you are, the more they will respect you.    They may not agree in the end, but hopefully you'll know and understand why if they don't.  I really hope you make it, though!!|`|IhjFjoKDaa	No reason for your dad to be spending the money you saved. I'd open my own bank account in my name only if i were you.    As to the $140 - if you've got the money then pay for it. Bum rides until you get your license and then drive yourself.    Do it if you want to and can do it without asking your parents to pay for it. They'll always love you.
fZCfJWpOaa	I worked in the fish department at a pet store and have owned two bettas myself (Betta Bob and Charlie the Tuna).  I had mine in a 2.5 gallon tank and a 5 gallon.    That should be find for one betta.  Betta fish don't need a large tank, and one betta in a two gallon tank is enough.  I used to have both of mine in 5 gallon tanks (one for each) but one flipped out in it and hid in a corner for several days until I moved him back to the 2.5 gallon.  Of course, bigger is always better for fish, but Betta Bob survived for 4 years in a two gallon and preferred it.    Don't use a heater, they don't need it (unless the room temperature of your home is exceptionally cold).  Room temperature should be fine.    With the plants (and it seems you're already aware of this), make sure there's room for the betta to sip air at the top of the tank, that the plant's roots don't take up all the room.  Bettas do use their gills but also sip air at the water's surface, too.    Make sure you get water conditioner to neutralize the chlorine in the water!  Good luck!|`|gPYqGoZBaa	We aren't here to give you answers you want to hear. We are here to tell you the truth, whether you like it or not. If you want to talk to some one who will tell you what you want to hear, then go to petsmart.    And as for the question, no. Everyone who said that a vase is not a good place for a betta to spend the rest of it's life was right.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	i agree with gaeta, get a 5 gallon. The more space, the longer he can live.|`|19iyBoD3aa	it will be fine only if you keep up with the water changes and don't add no more fish in the vase|`|psqkf6rMaa	you good they do not need a heater room temp is fine sure you can have a heater but ive kept mine with none|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	They need a filter also. its better to get a tank.    If you wont get a bigger tank, then dont get a betta.|`|3n60UxgQaa	The word "vase" threw me off a little.    I'm assuming you know that bettas prefer to take oxygen from the air rather than from the water since you mentioned that it was "enough for a betta to breathe," right? =]    Here's my opinion:  It'd be best if you didn't use the vase.  Unless of course, you can fit a filter in there.  And the filter shouldn't be powerful, either as if it disrupts the water surface too much, the betta won't be able to breathe.  The problem with vases is that there's less surface area.      If you had a bowl that was 2.25 gallons and it could fit a heater and filter, it'd be fine. =]|`|07lCZh28aa	I wouldn't suggest it, but, they have done well in a environment like that. But chances of survival are very slim after a month or so. Try a 5 gal tank setup. They are pretty inexpensive these days and come with filters!|`|16rikzbLaa	It may still need a filter, just a small 5 gallon is enough. 2.5 is minimum They will live longer with better maintenance tanks. Won't it be hard to do water changes in a vase? But I believe if you do enough water changes, maybe without a filter is fine but I'm not so sure on this so don't take it seriously! =)  But if you are going to do several water changes then I guess it's fine.    Good luck!|`|AA11708471	No bettas need 5 gallons minimum|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	You could but you need to buy a heater for the tank.     And make sure you feed it because they do NOT eat plants|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	don't forget to feed him|`|FpMaAlozaa	yes u can they can live in Little cups but the 2.25 gal should be good and u don't need an air pump Betta's can go up for air then hold it for a long amount of time and heater would be good but don't turn it up 2 high because i the small amount of water it will get 2 hot and it would die     good luck with that|`|w13meRXRaa	For now it is, try saving up some money and buy this tank    http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    a vase doesnt have much surface area and oxygen, a regular 3 gallon tank with proper filtration and heating should workout fine for a betta    its ok for now but definitely not as a permanent home.  i used to keep a betta in a vase, he did really bad in it, he only came up for food and would lay on the gravel alot, now he os sparkling with energy and grew silver fins because i gave him to a friend who has the exact same tank and has proper filtration and heating.  he is a yellow pineapple betta and grew silver fins wich i think is a little odd lol but pretty take care :)|`|1827d79e1a59bbeb213b8e03785ba568aa	yes, you can put it in a 2 gallon vase. i have a betta in the past to live for 2-3 years in a vase, and i had put rock in it as i would a tank, and a tree of some sort. it went well. they come up for oxygen, where some fish have to have a filter, and pump.|`|ssHzAVlwaa	Of course! I have my betta in a beautiful 1.5 gallon vase. he does just fine. And it seems like your bigger vase will be the perfect home for it. Just don't over crowd with the plants.|`|AA12205365	What you suggest will work.  PROVIDED:    - You are religious about water changes every 2-3 days.  - New water, and old water are the same temp to the touch.  - Your water temp is in the 75-85F range  - You don't over feed (food eaten in 1 minute, feed 6 times a week)  - You keep a varied high protein diet  (mix of blood worms, brine shrimp...)  http://www.firsttankguide.net/vase.php    PS- I still think a 2.5-5 gallon tank with filter is a better idea.
IhjFjoKDaa	Open barrel races (which is what your Morab would compete in) dont' care at all what the horse is named.    The only way the public hears about you is    Next up is Mindy Smith  On deck is Jane Doe  and in the hole is Robin Clark      Your horse name is never said in any of the barrel races I have been to or competed in.
