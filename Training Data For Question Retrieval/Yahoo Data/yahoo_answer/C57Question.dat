I got married to my American girlfriend (of 6 years) in October, I have filled my Green card application a few weeks ago and i am waiting for my EAD and for my green card which i believe will take a while.      The Business I am working for on my H1B visa is failing fast and it looks as if i may be soon out of a job.      The question is: Will I be out of status if i lose my Job before my EAD arrives?    And once my EAD arrives am i legally allowed to get another job and still be allowed to stay even if I lose my H1B employment.      Also Will the EAD employment void my H1B status once i start working for a new employer?      Thanks for your help.

20090203151452AAP21i9	Politics & Government;Military	Working on a career in law enforcement/ considering military?	Right now I'm 18, and I'm 2 1/2 years shy of being able to join the police academy.       I'm living with my parents, AGAIN (I was living on campus last semester), and I can tell my step father is anxious for me to get out.       I've got a very good job working in a dental office assisting a hygienist, doing reception work, and sterilizing instruments. I make more than 2 dollars an hour more than I did working at a grocery store, and the work is much more rewarding, but I don't make enough money as I only work 2 and 1/2 days a week. My mother works as a dental assistant, and she wants me to go to school to become a hygienist and make the "big bucks", but I'm not interested in the least bit.      I've been applying for jobs around here as a security guard, but none of my past experiences are valid, and therefore none of the companies are interested in me. It may even be the fact that I'm female that's keeping them from being interested...      I can't see myself only going to college for the next 2 1/2 years for law enforcement classes, and doing nothing else pertaining to law.       So, I'm considering becoming a military police officer. I know I'll make more money. I know it'll make schooling much less difficult, and it won't cost me the 2,000 a semester it has been costing me to continue my law classes. (I'm now 4,000 in debt.)      But I can't figure out if there are any other options, or if the military IS the best option out there...      Opinions?

She's mentally unstable and refuses to take the medicine she needs [which I take coincidentally]. She's always angry, and I mean ALWAYS. My father and her are divorced but he lives in the same house still, and is physically and mentally ill. Recently because of my stress at home my grades have dropped dramatically and my enthusiasm for doing schoolwork is down to nothing. I don't have a job currently, but am working on it. I have many friends and family friends that are more than willing and able to support me until I can find a place of my own with a job. Now here comes the legal part: Am I allowed to leave without being emancipated? My parents would never agree to it. Please help and thanks for reading.

"The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington, D.C. and the democrats intend to lead the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history"??      Nancy Killefer, will withdraw her nomination following the revelation that she had a $946.69 lien on her property in 2005 for failure to pay taxes.      Killefer joins the ranks of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who failed to pay more than $40,000 in payrolltaxes when he worked for the International Monetary Fund, and Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee Tom Daschle, who -- as ABC News was first to report last Friday -- on Jan. 2 filed more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest, having failed to disclose more than $300,000 in past income, including the use of a car and driver for three years.      Rep. Charles Rangel, Chairman of the Powerful House Ways & Means Committee, is in a bit of hot water for not declaring more than $75,000 in income between 1988 and 2007 on a rental property/second home in the Dominican Republic.      Previously unreported problems involving taxes and a household employee came to light during the vetting of Caroline Kennedy and torpedoed her candidacy for Hillary Clintonâ€™s Senate seat, said a source close to New York Gov. David Paterson.       Mr. Daschle also didn't report $83,333 in consulting income in 2007.       Sandy Berger - Democrat - National Security Advisor during the Clinton Administration. Berger became the focus of a criminal investigation after removing highly classified terrorism documents and handwritten notes from the National Archives during preparations for the Sept. 11 commission hearings.      John Murtha, Jr. - Democrat - U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania. Implicated in the Abscam sting, in which FBI agents impersonating Arab businessmen offered bribes to political figures; Murtha was cited as an unindicted co-conspirator.      This is just a parcial list...I could go on and on...is this what you dems thought she meant when she made that quote??

We are launching a musical called "A Little Princess", which has at least 9 child (aged 6 - 16) actors in it. Problem is, we don't want to have to have a parent of each child accompany each child to the performance. Mainly because we would have to pay an additional person, pay transport for that person and food, lodging, etc.      Indiana law does state this:       IC 20-33-3-32   Permitted child employment; exception        Sec. 32. This chapter may not prevent a child of any age from singing, playing, or performing in a studio, circus, theatrical, or musical exhibition, concert, or festival, in radio and television broadcasts, or as a live or photographic model. Employment certificates are not required for employment or appearances set forth in this section, but a child less than eighteen (18) years of age may not be employed except under the following conditions:           (1) The activities described in this section must not:               (A) be detrimental to the life, health, safety, or welfare of the child; or               (B) interfere with the schooling of the child.           Provision shall be made for education equivalent to full-time school attendance in the public schools for children less than sixteen (16) years of age.           (2) A parent shall accompany a child less than sixteen (16) years of age at all rehearsals, appearances, and performances.           (3) The employment or appearance may not be in a cabaret, dance hall, night club, tavern, or other similar place.       Is there anyway to make do a temporary transfer of guardianship to a member of the stage crew? That way the child can travel without the parent.        I know the courts could probably do it, but is there an easier way, like a form or contract?      Thanks much!

20090203160342AAxSs3i	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Gun Laws, lovers....what are your thoughts on this bit of hard truth?	Guess our national leaders didn't expect this, hmm? On Thursday, Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton , Colorado , was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee ' s subcommittee. What he said to our national leaders during this sp ecial session of Congress was painfully truthful.       They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:       'Since the dawn of creation there has been both good & evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.       'The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used.. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain's heart.       'In the days that followed the! ! Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel's murder I would be their strongest opponent.       I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy -- it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselve s. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best.          Your laws ignore our deepest needs,    Your words are empty air.    You've stripped away our heritage,    You've outlawed simple prayer.    Now gunshots fill our classrooms,    And precious children die.    You seek for answers everywhere,    And ask the question 'Why?'    You regulate r! ! estrictive laws,    Through legislative creed.    And yet you fail to understand,    That God is what we need!             ' Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, mi nd, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present within our educational  systems for most of our nation's history. Many of our 20 major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact. What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy occurs -- politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws. Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts.       'As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, he did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in  America , and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him. To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA -- I give to you a sincere challenge. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone!       My daughter's death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!'
20090203162747AATOq7d	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Caught a guy stealing in our office/lab and had to physically restrain him. Am I liable?	Yeah, last night I was working late and caught a guy breaking into the building and stealing a bunch of lab stuff. So I had to knock him on the ground and physically restrain him. This resorted in a dealing a few more hits than I would have liked, but he was persistent. So after having to hold him down for about 15 minutes the cops show and so does our security people and they just took him and left and I didn't even get to tell them what happened!? So now I'm wondering if I'm going to get sued or something ridiculous like that. I don't know if I hurt him bad, but I know I probably torqued his shoulder and a couple ribs and bruised up his face. In my defense I just told him to come quietly and no one would get hurt and he threw a beaker at me and then tried to punch me. Am I going to get sued?

My dad doesnt talk very good english so he just took the license and left.   Just a couple of minutes ago he told us about it and we took a look at it.

20090203160304AA5kR81	Politics & Government;Elections	Stimulus Bill..................?	Basically, Obama's new "Stimulus" bill is a 647 page document, comprised by the House, that, essentially, gives Obama and his cabinet the power to tax as much as necessary and to spend it all on random, new plans with no approval needed.      Much of the document approves the spending of 700+ billion on projects that do nothing for the economy. And let me remind you all that the economy is our main problem right now; the state of the economy is what caused so many people to vote for Obama in the first place. But he's doing nothing to help the economy with this new bill!      Opinions please? I know I've made my opinion clear but I'm curious to see what you all think - especially those who voted for Obama but might be having second thoughts now because of this bill.      Thank you!

20090225064601AARtbHg	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do people think raising taxes on business doesn't effect you?	Think about this a bit. If you are anyone else has a business the sole purpose is to have more money coming in than goes out the door. It's call profit. *LOL* If there's more money going out than coming in you had better have very deep pockets or you don't last long in that situation. I know. Been there done that. I don't care what kind of creative accounting you do or try, if income doesn't exceed outgo, you go.      The price of the product or service is figured to include all those things listed as outgo plus a percentage to turn a profit. One thing listed as outgo is taxes. Now if everything else stays the same but taxes go up what is going to happen to the cost of the product or service? It's just got to go up. The customer will have to pay more for what they buy.      And in the end the customer is you and me. So will you please think about that every time a politician talks about raising taxes on companies? They may tell you they aren't raising your taxes. And they aren't lying. But what they don't tell you is they ARE raising the prices on everything you buy.

This is the one act, that Bush can't just explain away, without really implicating himself as a villan, and I'm smelling illegal tactics with Mexico, in the fact that these two are still in Jail.

I support the President, I just don't support his "stimulus bill", or his budget, or his entitlement programs, or his policies in general, would the democrats still be frothing about him?      It was fine for the democrats to say "the war is lost",   it was fine for the democrats to say the Marines were "cold blooded killers"   it was fine for the democrats to say "I support the troops, I don't support their mission"   it was fine for people on this forum to accuse President Bush of building concentration camps for political dissidents.

20090304180537AAMW2gO	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can you sue Shaw Cable in small claims court in B.C. canada?	I am so upset with the treatment of shaw cable and there harassment. First thing 4 years ago we moved into this house and rent the whole thing. Shaw came out and said they needed to see our rental agreement to prove that there was noone living downstairs because it has a kitchen and the owners, who had lived in it before we did, rented it out to their relatives. SO we showed it to them. And they left. A few months later they came out again and was snooping around a house. Again we showed them our agreement. This has happened at least 4 times since we have been here and the last time I told them to get off my property. The guy was mad and stayed outside in front of our yard in his truck surveying and I phoned shaw and complained but again.      Then a few months ago we were going to go with satelite and shaw and shaw gave us a really good deal on channels including a PVR free as long as we kept it for a year. I told him from the start that we did not ever want to pay over 40 as we dont watch a lot of TV and dont feel the need for extra money going out. But the deal was good and so we took it.  Since then we have had nothing but cable issues and them cutting off the channels they had promised us. So each time we have had to call back and get them reconnected again. The last straw was we all of a sudden got a bill that was over $100. I called and was connected to supposivly the same guy that gave us the deal (so he says) and he said he never said that but stated that after 6 months we would have to pay for half of the acutal cost!! I  told him he was a lier and I had told him from thet beginning Im a student and cant afford expensive TV products and that I dont watch a lot of tv anyway. He was rude and said he was going to come and take the box and he wouldnt even listen to me and so I said I had to go as I was upset.      Can I sue them for everything they have done to us in small claims court?

20090304183453AAljPd0	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do I hear many people calling Obama a "socialist"?	1)Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.    2)The stage in Marxist-Leninist theory intermediate between capitalism and communism, in which collective ownership of the economy under the dictatorship of the proletariat has not yet been successfully achieved.     http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dic...       That's the definition of socialism. How in the world does Obama meet this definition? It's not like the gov't just gave a bunch of money to the auto industry and wall street with strings attached. It's not like central banking hasn't been discussed.     I mean, when does taxing the rich, telling them how to run their companies and basically funding their industries make you a socialist?

He has already been elected president, there is nothing that can be done about that for four more years!  Why not give the man a chance and see if he can do some good.  Now, I am not old enough to vote but avidly followed the election as best I could.  Did all you McCain supporters listen to his speech after he lost the election? I believe it was one of his better speeches, and he is a decent speaker, I will give him that, and he urged people to give Obama a try.

They can't drive on public streets.  Their kids can't go to public school.  If terrorists bomb a city that votes Republican, our army would be silent.  No Social Security when they retire or if they're disabled.      If these right-wing nutjobs are so indignant about having to pay taxes, why don't we just give them what they want?

20090304175952AAANpF9	Politics & Government;Immigration	Who's Running Immigration? New York Times Editorial What's your opinion?	 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/opinio...       I would like to know for statistics and a global class if you can give me your opinion on this Editorial posted in the New York Times on immigration.    Immigration enforcement ran off the rails in the Bush era, when federal agents stormed factories to shackle workers and local authorities staged their own crackdowns with little or no oversight from Washington. It was a war without a plan, and it solved nothing.      Related   Times Topics: Immigration and Emigration      President Obama has repeatedly promised to take a smarter path. But if he and the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, are making a clean break with the Bush way on immigration, we havenâ€™t seen it yet. That shambling machinery lurches on.      Two recent examples tell the story.      The first was a large, peaceful protest in Phoenix on Saturday. Thousands stood up to the feared sheriff of Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio, who has brutally misused his powers under a program called 287(g). It enlists local police as immigration enforcers. He has terrorized Latino neighborhoods with relentless sweeps and has paraded shackled immigrants through the streets.      When she was the Arizona governor, Ms. Napolitano was an outspoken supporter of delegating neglected federal immigration duties to local authorities. Sheriff Arpaio is an example of that concept run amok. He has seldom been challenged as forcefully as he was on Saturday â€” not by government but by a dogged organizer, Salvador Reza, a few clergy members and politicians and thousands of people who dared to say: Enough.      The other example was the first workplace immigration raid of the Obama administration, late last month in Bellingham, Wash. More than two dozen people were arrested at a family-run company that rebuilds car engines. They were charged with the usual paperwork offenses. The company said it was blindsided, and so was Ms. Napolitano. She said she had not known about the raid in advance and promised an investigation.      Americans who might applaud any crackdown on illegal immigrants, particularly in a recession, should know that scattershot raids and rampaging sheriffs are not the answer. The idea that enforcement alone will eliminate the underground economy is a great delusion. It runs up against the impossible arithmetic of mass expulsion â€” no conceivable regime of raids will wrench 12 million illegal immigrants from their jobs and homes.      The country is not a safer or better place because one more business and two dozen more families are torn apart outside Seattle or because Sheriff Arpaio has much of Maricopa County terrified. The system under which illegal immigrants labor, without hope of assimilation, is not any less broken. A new report from the Government Accountability Office shows that federal oversight of the 287(g) program has been sorely lacking.      So, a question: Are Mr. Obama and Ms. Napolitano in charge or not? Let them show it by ending the raids and Sheriff Arpaioâ€™s abuses. Something has to be done about immigration, but it has to be smarter than this.

But for the present moment and for the next four years, we as Christians must support Obama. Why?       I just went to the grocery store....and while i was there...loading up my goodies...i see an 17-18 year old black girl..shopping. She was beautiful....comfy beautiful. You know the good type :). She was obviously wearing old clothes and an old jacket. And she bought a total of 5 cans of soup. I didnt know what to do. My conscious was telling me...pay for her food...and yet my wallet was saying...you cant afford it. As a Christian, i didnt know what to do.       So the answer is...while many of his economic policies...which he is forcing through..and destroying our economy (health care, etc) and he is leaning WAY WAY to far left...bringing us close to financial collapse..and i acknowledge that he lacks the strength....to stand up to the Democrats...and remove the PORK...to unite our country.      We as Christians...must support his decisions. I will not argue...when people need food. We must come together as Americans.       If anyone has any comments please post.       I also highly doubt...most democrats...see all the opportunities Obama is ignoring. That he is soo far left...he could collapse our economy at any point. That he lacks the experience...to stand up to the Democratic party.  His inexperience...and lack of leadership...is showing.      But as Christians...will you let people go hungry?

20090225070650AAEE9YE	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	UK> had some trouble w the police in the past. How do i know if i got a caution (dont remember)?	I was stopped by sniffer dogs on a train station. I had cannabis on me. The police took me to a van and searched me. They saw no ID. Took the substance from me and kicked me out of the van. I dont remember what they said to be honest.       On a second occasion I had an ugly argument w my girlfriend. Our arguments would regularly get physical and onthis occasion I hit her on the top of her head with an open hand. She closed her mouth abruptly and chipped a corner of her tooth. She called the cops but changed her mind once they got there cuz she knew it had been an accident. However, I was still taken in for identification. In Wales, its normal procedure. There was no charges and no investigation. We both agreed it was an accident, although i did hit her, the resulting damage wasnt intended.   I was interviewed by the police and it was recorded. Photograph and dna samples were taken. Nasty stuff, but in the end i wasnt charged. Just a statemnet was taken from me (none from my gf)   would i have been cautioned on any of thiese cases?
20090225070426AAsEg8t	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do I ask the president to prove he is a natural born citizen according to the constitution?	He was born in Hawaii but that does not automatically make you a eligible for the presidency.(or a natural born citizen, not even illegals who come here to have kids, this true for them too). His mom was not here long enough after giving birth and she left soon after his birth. He was then living in Indonesia going to public school. In Indonesia to go to public school you have to have Indonesian citizenship to go to public school, (his mom married and Indonesian that adopted Obama) which means he was claiming Indonesian citizen ship, the guidelines also state that you have to have lived in America for 14 years consecutively before taking office and that hasn't been proven either, given his college years.       All of this is in the book that he wrote about himself.

Like forbidding me to use the washer, then the kettle , then the kitchen and then last- the bathroom!! Yeah, I dont like him very much. Needless to say, we moved out but I wasnt allowed in the house to pick up my stuff. so my boyfriend had to get everything but couldnt fit it all in the car, and then we werent allowed back in anymore.    I left some expensive make up, and sentimental stuff, that doesnt have any money value, but means alot to me. Ive asked people who still speak to them to get it back but with no luck. Now lots of time has gone and i gave it another go, but they say they dont have it anymore!!!   How can I get it back, or compensation or get this bastard done for this??

20090304181638AAUiJoU	Politics & Government;Politics	What reasoning do most people use to counter the "life potential" argument against abortion?	The idea is that when some one kills a human being the main thing that makes the act wrong is that you are depriving them of the rest of the natural life that they would probably have lived. This is what makes killing wrong. If you killed some one who was at the end of his/her natural life a moment before they actually died, then as long as it was painless, you haven't done anything nearly as wrong as what happens in most murders, because this some one had no more life left in him/herself. The point is to prove that if some one innocent is killed by another person, in most cases, what really makes it wrong is that the victim was deprived of his/her remaining life.    People who are pro-choice argue that a woman should be able to kill the life inside them if they so choose. Why? In most cases, it is because a woman may become pregnant too early in life preventing her from getting higher education and a better job or because she does not want the child of the man who got her pregnant. The emotional distress a woman can face as a result of this is also part of the reason. So, it's about money,preferences and emotional distress. The problem with this reasoning is that in no other case in society can you legally kill a person if it would get you a better education and job (money), or because you don't like the father of this certain person (preferences), or because you're really upset about the affect this person is having on you (emotional distress). Also, if a woman had a one-year-old that was preventing her from more prosperity and she also didn't like the father she wouldn't wouldn't be able to kill it then, so why does a human being have no value in the beginning of its life when it has the most potential? Life does begin at conception scientifically speaking, because an individual organism is created at the moment when two haploid cells (sperm and egg) merge to create a zygote which is the first cell of the new organism containing DNA from the mother and father. There is no question of when life begins. Keep in mind this is according to scientific fact.    What could possibly outweigh the value of the lives that babies who are aborted every day would have lived and justify killing them? If it is wrong to rob the rest of the life of any human being after a certain amount of time in the womb, what suddenly changes between that time and conception to make it legal, the decades of potential life certainly exist for any fetus, they haven't disappeared, so why when it is wrong and illegal at any other time to take away this potential life, as described in the beginning of the question, is it not just as wrong and illegal in the first several months of life? How can any of the reasons for most abortions, (which could never be used to justify killing the same human being if allowed to live a little longer, or any other human being alive long enough for that matter), really be justified if the same exact thing is done in abortions as in the killings of an older human beings, (namely depriving the victims of the rest of their lives)? You may disagree, and I respect your opinion, but I would be interested to hear a sound argument that could challenge this reasoning. Thank you for reading. I would appreciate any good responses.

Iâ€™m just asking this because I've seen some comments that make it seem like people think everything conservatives do is perfect and they can do [almost] no wrong.      I would ask the same question for the liberals, but there donâ€™t really seem to be any liberals here at all, so I would just be wasting my breath.

Great Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was created on July 5, 1948. As with all government programs, bureaucrats underestimated initial cost projections. First-year operating costs of NHS were 52 million pounds higher than original estimates1 as Britons saturated the so-called free system.   Many decades of shortages, misery and suffering followed until 1989, when some market-based health care competition was reintroduced to the British citizens2.       Unfortunately for those requiring care, a mostly socialist health care system still has problems. The articles and commentaries in this section identify some disasters caused by government intervention in the British health care system.

A friend of mine got fired...sorta and is telling me that the way she got fired is illegal so I was curious and want to know if she's right.       Ok so my friend, Lisa, was scheduled to work Sunday morning. She got her shift covered up until 11am by her coworker, Alania, and even asked the afternoon girl, Rachel, to come in early because Alania couldn't stay the whole shift. Rachel got to work at 11am and nobody had been there all morning (this is at a coffee shop). Alania said that Lisa forgot to say "ok" and figured it was a "nevermind" but Lisa thought Alania had covered her shift. Instead nobody showed up. Monday morning the owner worked and wrote a note ABOUT Lisa but not directed to Lisa and this is what it said:   "Lisa never showed up 4 her shift on Sunday 3/1 & didn't call anyone. So don't put her on the schedule, she no longer works here. Owner."    Alania (the one who was suppposed to cover Sunday) worked Monday evening, saw the note and failed to mention the confusion on Sunday as the owner left the building. Wednesday the manager worked and Lisa stopped by for her coffee. The manager did not tell her she had lost her job but minutes later told Rachel as they switched shifts. Rachel had to be the one to break it to Lisa. Lisa says that the owner did not tell her she was fired but told everybody ELSE she no longer worked there. The owner failed to answer or return any of Lisa's calls.       Is it illegal the way the owner got rid of Lisa??

20090304191602AAe7iy6	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	I am a female who was assaulted in my home by a male roommate, boy friend who was scheduled to move out?	the next day. I just tried to defend my self. The primary attacker was the other female, the 2 males helped. She trashed my home also. I was the ONLY ONE arrested; yet HONESTLY, I did not attack them. I believe the cop was dishonest or lazy. I was charged with simple battery. The 2 men & 1 woman, who assaulted in me MY HOME, made up a big lie on their police report. All the evidence to corroborate MY story was right in front of the cops nose. He refused to look at it. I am actually innocent. The 3 attackers said in their police report that I assaulted the other female who was with the 2 males. My male roommate was in my home LEGALLY. The married couple who attacked me entered my home against my will. I called 911 after the attack. I was the ONLY one arrested. The cop should have arrested every one or no one. They told a big lie (Whopper LIE) on their police report to avoid going to jail.  The female attackers GOAL was to have me arrested on felony assault. SHE attacked me. I NEVER attacked her, (I have too much to loose to behave like a looser nut case!) Yet their lie was obvious. Why did the cop only arrest me and not every one or no one? How will the judicial system view this case? Should I consider filing a complaint against the cop after the court case is settled? Should I sew the police department?  It happened in Florida, on a Sunday night.

I have been a long-time pot smoker and recently quit just over a week ago.  I was honest about this with my recruiter and told him i wanted to be sure that it was out my system before i went up to MEPS.. he said that it was fine as he used to smoke also before he joined.. So to be sure i was clean before i went to MEPS he gave me a test in the recruitment office.      I failed..He said that was fine and scheduled me to come back in one more week to see if it was out of my system by then. So my question  is.. when i eventually do pass the test, and i go up to MEPS, what is this going to mean for me? What should i say? What should i not say?  etc... thank you.
20090304194156AAlBK0U	Politics & Government;Government	What is the perfect system of government?	As was said before, ''Democracy isn't the greatest system of government, just the best one we've got''.      Well, there must be a truly perfect one.  I believe either Aristotle or Socrates tried to hard to discover the truth.  Could any of you possibly know?   Please don't say it's a direct democracy.  It isn't, because although the power should belong to the people, some people are idiots.  It's a pure fact that not everyone is a born leader and not everyone can decide what is best for the world or even themselves.      Then again, there are governments were people force their rule over others.  These are your dictatorships and monarchies.  There are extremes on both sides.      Could we ever have a perfect government?  Or will we continue to stumble along the dark path of imperfect and unjust rule forever?

I know someone who recently received what they perceived to be a Christmas card in the mail (keep in mind the letter was -never- opened), and although they knew who it was for, they no longer had the address to contact them because this person did not want to be contacted. So this person assumed that they obviously shouldn't open the letter, and decided that since nothing could be done about returning it or assisting it's delivery, it was disposed of. The recipient of the letter found out how the situation went down, and is currently trying to press federal charges for mail tampering. Is this possible?

I've tried monster & indeed.com & got phone calls from people asking if I want to go to some technical schools, but what I apply for is what looks like a position for an actual company so it misleads you.

For a first time offender DUI case I have to serve 48 to 96 hours of jail in LA County Jail.  I've heard that it's common that they will check you into jail and then let you leave pretty much right away due to overcrowding in the jail and the fact that this offense is low level.  Is there a particular day of the week or period of the week that would make this more likely?  Please don't make any guesses.  I'd like to hear from someone who know for sure.  I've heard that the weekends are good for this but I've also heard that Tuesdays are good too. Thanks.
20090304202935AAdNXwh	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can I be charged with a sexual assault over 15 years ago?	When I was 13 years old, I was at a house party with a group of other friends and met a girl there. We got to romancing and making out, and ended up in a room alone. In the middle of things, she said that she wasn't comfortable going all the way and wanted to stop.      I'm not going to lie or minimize anything--I didn't want to hear that, and subsequently raped her.      I personally forgot about it up until around the age of 19 when I grew to understand the gravity of what I did. And ever since then for the past 9 years now to the age of 28, it has just been eating away and tormenting me rentlessly...especially if I hear about someone being raped or see a rape scene on television. Just knowing that I am a member of the club.      I try "punishing" myself by cutting myself, or not eating for several days at a time to make myself suffer for what I did, but I just cannot find any peace or redemption.      I have ultimately decided that the only way to atone for my horrible crime is to go to the police and tell them about it....even though it was 15 years ago, and I honestly can't even remember the girl's name and haven't seen her since the incident. I want to truly come to peace with myself and be punished by going to prison and suffering the exact same harm I inflicted on another human being.      Can I be prosecuted with no reported victim or evidence--simply my own confession?      (Note: If you feel like blasting me for the piece of sh*t I am, feel free. I promise, I will NOT report you to yahoo.)

20090304222041AAv6lwh	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What to do about my friend who was kidnapped?	Recently a friend of mine was kidnapped by 3 illegal mexicans. We live in Texas so there are a lot of them over here. She is terrified of living alone now. She got a high tech alarm system now & has a trained protection dog now too.  Do you think this will keep it from happening again? Or anything like it? She is scared that if or when they get out of jail they will come back to try and kill her because they said they would. She is only 21 and it is taking control over her life. Any advice? Also she lives in a "safe" small town. the worst crime to ever happen is some kid stole an ipod out of a car. Now with all the construction and illegal immigrants is this going to just get worse?

20090304160703AAzPAnU	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I got a threatening call from a friend of someone I know. Her # showed on my call log but police won't arrest?	I don't know if it makes a difference state to state but I live in Nassau county, NY. On 2/18 I got a phone call from a girl who stated my address, that she was going to **** me up and that I better be scared. Lastly she made a comment about my b/f being good in bed. I spoke to an officer at the 2nd precinct in suffolk county who said to go to the 7th precinct in nassau county (because I was in Nassau when I received the call) and they would file the proper paper work. After going there I was given a run around and had to be very persistent that I am fearful of this girl because of her reputation and that I have proof that she called me and I want her arrested. The investigator said they have to determine if it was a "legitimate" threat. Meaning, he has to decide if she was threatening enough to warrant an arrest. Meanwhile, I have been staying at family's house out of fear of returning to my own home. Is there anything I can do to make sure this is addressed properly?
20090304161205AA1nBtn	Politics & Government;Politics	Is George Bush a fascist?	In light of everyone saying how Barack Obama is a communist, even though he clearly is a member of the democratic party and always has been... I figured I would post this little youtube video I saw awhile back which makes the argument that George Bush is a fascist. Any intelligent person will actually watch it and see what I'm saying, of course the right wingers will not watch it they will simply keep calling Obama a communist because they have nothing else to say about him.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9mYCU0mH... 
20090304161355AAspTvc	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Who will get custody of my niece and nephew?	My brother and his ex girlfriend have 2 kids. She is an immigrant and lives in Georgia with the kids. He is a resident and lives with his new gf and her 2 kids. I don't think that he sends his ex any money for the kids, but he wants custody of them. If he tries to get custody would he get it? I'm actually kind of hoping that his ex could keep them because he's too busy with his new gf's kids. He wants to get her deported, but i don't know if that is possible since the kids are both born here. Also, his new gf is also an immigrant. Who will get custody?
