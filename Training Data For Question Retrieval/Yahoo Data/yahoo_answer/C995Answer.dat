0bzIkdyOaa	Yes running can make you thinner as your muscles get more toned and you will lose weight, just add on some more healthy calories to keep you weight where it is. Since Breasts are mostly fat tissue the more lean muscle you have the smaller the breasts can be. If you eat a healthy diet and maintain a healthy weight your breasts will be whatever they will be.|`|sz2rRg9Xaa	well it does make you skinnier depending on what you eat and how much, if you don't want to lose weight...the night before you run, eat some carbs like pasta...and the only reason it will make your chest flat is if your losing weight, otherwise your fine. and with hurtles im not sure, maybe if when you run just throw in an occasional jump that you would do to try to work on that routine of run then jump. just eat more than usual, still in a healthy manner and you can maintain your weight or even gain muscle.|`|xtX7aaLqaa	i started the same as you. I am not 16 and 98ish lbs so no worries =]<br>  Just eat enough and gradually you will become tonned! It took me a few months and I actually have calf muscles now!!<br>  best of luck with the hurtles<br>  I cant say much on that one because I am a distance runner. You should look into steeplechase....distance plus hurtles! hard stuff!|`|IITnJjAjaa	Well if you run slow you'll lose weight and if you run fast you will build up muscle. I hope that answers your question. And also get two pots and a bamboo stick and jump over it. or practice on the side of your couch the movement :)|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	as long as you eat right and enough, cut out the macdonalds, and run your weight will adjust to it's natural weight.  I reccomend doing balance drills and acceleration drills.|`|m6znGNXxaa	If you're already skinny, running will probably help you gain muscles rather than lose weight, especially if you do train on short to middle distances.  As far as I can tell, thin girls that run track are usually more graceful and less bony than thin girls that don't play sports.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	As long as you're taking in the same number of calories as you're putting out, your body fat level will remain the same.  Make sure you eat a balanced diet with enough calories and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  As for practicing hurdles at home, there isn't a lot you can do for practicing the hurdling part, but you can do workouts to make you faster, like sprint repeats.  And you can do extra stretching (after warming up the muscles of course) to keep you flexible to help you getting over the hurdles.  Then when practice starts with the team, just work hard and focus on the detail stuff (starting from blocks, proper number of steps, etc.).<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

BiMkowVMaa	LeBron got the triple double, Kobe got the Garden record.<br>  <br>  LeBron actually needed those assist and rebound to win the game, Kobe ... the game was over by the beginning of the fourth quarter, his team blew out the Knicks.<br>  <br>  LeBron didn't have another person score more than 15 pts. Kobe had Gasol throwing in 31. LeBron had the only double figure rebounds. Kobe had 0 rebounds but Lamar and Gasol both had 10+.<br>  <br>  Wilson Chandler had  20 on Kobe while Harrington hung 39 and 13 on LeBron.<br>  <br>  The crowd chanted MVP for Kobe and not for LeBron.<br>  <br>  Most importantly both won.<br>  <br>  Personally I think the triple double was more amazing. I also think the 61 point show with the array of offensive moves and the "can you believe it" shots was sooo impressive. <br>  <br>  So I'll just say I enjoyed both. I had a blast watching these two MVP candidates battling it out, and scoring 113 points between them in two nights. Amazing.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	Kobe scored more points.  <br>  <br>  LeBron had a better performance.|`|YNJTjImtaa	How come Kobe lovers say he has a better game in MSG than Lebron? 61-0-3 against Bron's 52-10-11? That's a no brainer! Every basketball expert would agree that Lebron definitely had a better game. I could concede that Kobe has a better scoring game but, Lebron top Kobe w/ a better all around game! Kobe was just concerned on scoring the whole night on that game. While Lebron's play was still multi-dimensional. If you would factor in the assists Lebron made and multiply that 2 pts then, it sum up to 72 pts againts Kobe's 67! Do you all understand now? I suppose those people who still believe Kobe has a better game are ignorant of true team game of basketball. I would take Lebron's game anytime!<br>  <br>  Heck, even Jordan can score 61 pts any given night but, he won't have 0 rebounds and lesser assists in a game unlike Kobe. So, stop hattin you Kobe lovers! Don't be blinded anymore! Time to realize that we are now living in James World of Basketball!

yEsw7UkWaa	I guess you could say it started with Hogan leaving AWA for a much better deal in WWE in 1983.<br>  McMahon was putting an end to regional wrestling, and Gagne had made some bad business decisions for AWA. This added to the loss of momentum AWA suffered in the early 80's.<br>  A month after Hogan defected, he became world champ and mainstream media took notice of wrestling. The spotlight was on WWE and the money flowed in. AWA couldn't compete with the money being offered, though they only became inactive during 1990.<br>  <br>  WWE scouts saw both AWA and NWA as great pools for future talent and were smart enough to keeps tabs on guys like Shawn Michaels, Curt Henning, Greg Valentine, Roddy Piper and Orton snr.<br>  <br>  I think if you watch an old AWA show like All Star Wrestling, you'll see the difference between the two. One of the best feuds to watch (if you can find it) was the one between the Midnight Rockers and Buddy Rose/Doug Sommers. Um, quite hardcore considering Jannetty and Michaels then became WWE stars.<br>  <br>  WWE now owns the rights to the AWA footage (well, most of it)|`|7f2GSDmqaa	WWF was more based on cartoon characters and gimmicks, while AWA was pretty straight laced wrestling and presenting it more as a real sport|`|9ijwrcTZaa	money and VKM promise to make them national and household stars.

yEsw7UkWaa	I agree with you 100%.<br>  CM Punk is better than the WWE allows him to be, he could be World Champ if the ego's would move over.<br>  And I have long said that Shelton is totally wasted in the mid card area. He has the US title and he should have moved up to world title by now. He has nothing left to prove, even his critics (and I'm one of them) have to admit that he has the stuff to carry a world title.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's been a while since Orton held a world title, so it may be interesting having him as champ again...as long as they get him a decent storyline. (Maybe Priceless could turn on him and challenge for the title?)<br>  <br>  WWE is too quick to lean on their dependable stars, like HHH and Edge because they know those guys are sure to make money.<br>  Like Vince says, It's all about the money. And the WWE would rather have a guaranteed taking on a tried and true champ, rather than risk it on a new guy.<br>  <br>  How any of the real good young guys are meant to get ahead is beyond me. The 'HHH gets another title' thing is starting to get as old as it was when Hogan did it.<br>  Same story different ego....|`|WCX6kYITaa	Matt H raises some good points. I'm not a Punk fan but I think WWE needs to think about its future as a large part of it's A-list is over 40 or nearing it (Undertaker, Triple H, Jericho, HBK, JBL, Batista). The younger guys need a push and Punk is one of those guys and Morrisson even more so than Punk. Shelton is one of the most complete wrestlers and unlike most people, I like his mic skills so yeah, he should get the push too. But the most important is Kane. I know he's getting old too but with Taker's era coming to an end, Kane needs to be pushed now to ensure he can fill the void left by the Dead Man's departure - at least for a few years. We need the fearsome, destructive Kane back - not the one who gets beaten by Kofi, Mysterio, etc!|`|DJeij6Pgaa	Just be happy with wwe they know whats best just shut up man and enjoy or just stop watching it.|`|TzCu3igraa	i totally agree, they completely screwed up cm punk and his title reign.|`|5WttD4V5aa	We have seen all these storey lines before. i wish they would just **** batista and Cena off because they are so over rated.<br>  <br>  And Let some of the younger more telneted guys have some titles. i agree with wat u say about Shelton he was beating Former WWE/WHC back in the early 20's but now he gets beaten by people like Kung Fu Naki. Like what the hell.|`|hoZxIQkkaa	I have been saying this a lot on things. CM Punk has the potential to be a Stone Cold like superstar. He could be a bad *** that is notnecessarilyy a face or heel. The fans fall in love with that. Cena is atreblee wrestler bu the kids who by the merch can't getenoughh of him so he will continue to be pushed. The legacy faction isgettingg decent. If you think about when wrestling was great it was built around factions. Thecorporationn/ministryy. DX. nWo (WCW). Vince Rouso understood that TNA is full of factions. WWE isunfortunatelyybecomingg more and more a show for kids. They can't be blamed kids are the main consumer.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	the Orton/Triple H storyline is so worn out and now they're doing it again. it makes me sick. it should've been Orton vs. Cena or Kane. but i think how CM Punk won was a good one. although u gotta admit he's not World champ material, at least i don't think so. i do think Shelton Benjamin is way overdue for a world title.<br>  <br>  PS: i just started a new show on youtube, check out the first episode, u should like it. here's the link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP22EqpjEoU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP22EqpjE...</a>|`|RpsbIXDsaa	ok guys i can see how you may see this as **** with hhh/orton again but if you remember last year it was a 3 way with john cena in it, the storyline last year wasnt that special either, this year its just them two with a bigger and better storyline, you got the mcmahons in it now making it feel a lot more real now. cm punk is a great wrestler no doubt about it but he still fresh in the wwe and still paying his dues, give it time he will do it again i mean look at aj styles? why isnt he the champion right now instead of sting, they gave joe a long run but not aj. shelton benjamin needs to change or update or find a better gimmick, he is boring me with his title he bores me when he comes out and talks hell even his matches are starting to bore me yes he is a good wrestler but its not just the wrestling you count on to get you over its how you promote yourself and appeal to the fans. he got nothing there. i like this storyline with orton and if they play it right it should go down well in history. you can also tell that the storyline is good because last raws ratings were higher than the week before with flair and taker.

Ro03hVb6aa	10k runs, wind sprints up and down the pitch, circuit training at the gym and then basic core strength exercises such as dead lifts, benches, chin ups & power cleans.<br>  <br>  Aim for a bleep test of about 13, a bench of body weight plus 10% for reps, a dead lift of body weight plus 80% and 10 k in a little under an hour.  A lot, yes, but but it is a demanding position.|`|IDBasYahaa	I used to play openside flanker, but for all loose forward possitions, you need good fittness, lots of cross training, cycling, swimming, running (mix in sprints with the running). On top of that, in the gym, work on leg, lower back & shoulder strength.

He would give the Lakers a solid 3 (or you'd play him at the 2 and move Kobe to the 3) - but the Lakers wouldn't necessarily need him to win.  So they shouldn't trade away any of their key pieces or pay more money than they need to.  T-Mac is injury prone so he'd only be worth it say if he was willing to sign for a million to end his career with a ring... <br>  <br>  Nickster|`|f9soMMuiaa	Never will happen. T-mac's career is plunging down hill. His style is similar to Kobe, except Kobe makes plays consistently and is skilled, and is still running hot without any signs of slowing down. But T-mac always comes up short and is only getting worse by the minute. <br>  <br>  Yes Mike, Kobe was all about spotlight back then. Now... he STILL darn heck is the same cocky player who wants the complete spotlight on him and thinks he's the best in the whole league. I don't think he got more mature. But he can back up his talk with his performance. <br>  <br>  And he won't be wrestling the spotlight with T-mac. Because he will win the spotlight over T-mac. T-mac is nothing compare to Kobe now. And they're the same type of player, so why would a team want both of them?|`|wuDplG1qaa	Yea when he's a free agent and is willing to sign for the mid level exception for a chance to win a ring. He can really help spread out the court for Gasol and Bynum. Put him in that small forward position.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	That will never happen. Besides, Kobe would want the spotlight on him in L.A and the Staples Center isn't going to be big enough for Kobe and T-Mac together|`|kFcdwVwdaa	it still wouldn't work. Mcgrady is the man on his team. Kobe is the man on any team. they wouldn't mesh together. well, maybe though. only because if you think about it, McGrady has said he has so much respect for Kobe that he would probably lie down and be second for him. but no one really knows. you might think that kobe is more mature now, but he still feels the need to take the winning shot, instead of someone who is open. so your theory is wrong. i like kobe though. i've been a laker fan all my life|`|urqGJPwpaa	He never said he wants to play with Kobe.

2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	During my years of nationally competing I would do the following.  For kata and weapons kata I would run my kata halfway again without any rest after doing it each time.  This helps to extend your endurance and stamina and keep your kata strong all the way through from start to finish.  Resist easing up as you get to the end also which is bad habit some people have or develop.  <br>  <br>  For fighting I would spare several different people in a row the running time of a match without any break, always having a fresh opponent.  You are correct on breathing out but you also have to remember to breath in and this is one of the things sometimes people also forget to do and while breathing out or doing several kais they sometimes neglect to take a short, little breath in.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	search yahoo for "australia tournament" and you'll have a results page. go through them and find your poison. link below <br>  <br>  you have to control your breathing. in kempo, we had special meditation seminars that helped. just don't freak out. link below<br>  <br>  you could try endurance training. go for a jog in the morning. do a hundred front snap kicks, making sure to breathe like you're supposed to. <br>  <br>  my particular discipline forbids tournaments. so i've missed out. lol. good luck, and have fun.|`|Vjh7WXpbaa	you are out of shape jogging will help. fight people that are strong and well known and make a name for yourself

Their financial status is very sound. They are not in dire debts. They have owners who do not interfere in the everyday affairs of the club.

Everyone at the club knows their job and do not interfere with others. <br>  Simply put, they are the best managed club in the world. Plus, they play great football.

"Why do you think Man Utd are the worlds greatest football team" Stating it as a fact just makes you sound like a numpty. Greatness is achieved by having won the most cups in all categories and this is purely not the case with Man Utd. They are no doubt a class act but come back when you've won the most league titles and European cups. Until then, replace the words Man Utd with the words Liverpool.|`|w7POq8Ijaa	They aren't silly, Liverpool are.<br>  <br>  Can't think of a football team that can beat man u?<br>  <br>  I'll give ya a few,<br>  <br>  Barca , ac milan, LIVERPOOL, arsenal!!!!! to name a few!|`|ff7fc6889663558c1c97fb10a9748022aa	I think Brazil are better.<br>  But if you mean club team it's certainly debatable.|`|jrETScoHaa	I know!

Even though we're top now we don't have to brag this much about it.|`|O8IYSGLpaa	Becoz they rule & r simply the best|`|6wW7iLrbaa	Many reasons, experience for one, we know what its like competing on multiple fronts, Fergie knows when to rest players etc. I think that every other club team in the world has a weak link in defence helps us. Every single member of our back four is brilliant- as is Brown and Evans. Compare this to Barcelona Valdes, Carecas, Abidal, Pique- all weak links. I don't mind people telling me that Carragher, Pepe, Cannavaro, Chellini, Puyol and Terry would start for <br>  an Utd. It is hilarious because they are clearly inferior to Ferdinand and Vidic. In the attacking department we have numerous threats all of which draw attention of one another which gives them more space. Also both of our centre mids track back- be it Hargo, Fletch, Scholes, Carrick, Anderson etc. and so will Park Ji Sung. This makes us even more solid and teams need to pile on the pressure to score, when they do this Rooney, Giggs, Ronnie, Tevez etc. counter attack and score. The reason why we are the greatest in the world is because of how well all of our players fit into our system. Barca have 5 players who do some tracking back, we play attacking football and have 8- 9 if rooney and tevez are playing.|`|lGNfanzyaa	I'll emphasize more on the exact question here, Manchester United being the "greatest" football team. Thats rite because United not only game wise are the best but what makes them great is the their illustrious history and passion for the game. most of them would answer this question as saying that they are just in good form at the moment but if we focus more on the term "GREAT" there are only few that come to mind. <br>          What makes clubs great is their contributions to the national team to the nation which the club belongs to or to FOOTBALL in general, i mean producing talent from within your academy, and not just buying players throwing out large sums of cash. Manchester United have done that over the years and are on the verge of producing yet another golden generation of top class young footballers(The previous golden generation as i refer to is the generation of Scholes, Giggs and likes of Beckham who rose at Old Trafford),this generation certainly being Rooney, Ronaldo, Fletcher and more younger players with the likes of  welbeck, Rafael, Fabio, Gibson, Evans.<br>              I dont mean that united dont buy big players but they do along with a great blend of talented youngsters having the potential to take in the world!! This makes United the great club it is. and to mention ofcourse the history at Old trafford has been so dramatic and emotional which has always connected with the fans all around this Holy green earth!!!!|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Because of their glorious manager, Sir Alex Fergusson. Fergusson is so experienced and so good that he will always lead man united to 1st place in Premier League and hopefully champions of europe. Man United have THE greatest players too like Rooney, Evra, Ferdinanad, Vidic etc. Their defense is THE best too with 14 consecutive clean sheets in a row. :)|`|D1L8Ficgaa	Dont be so cocky, its really annoying.<br>  <br>  Although though I have to admit....Man U is hot right now and can not think of a club that could beat them.<br>  <br>  Btw I am diehard liverpool fan its just the simple fact, Manchester United is hot right now and anyone denying it(I dont like man u btw) is just biased.|`|Ul7JvV6Vaa	Ok they have won the World Club Championship, so at the moment they are world champions.<br>  <br>  I think past history plays a part of United's culture of why they are a great football team/club and success in the past years also helps|`|UEaxNCd5aa	They're pretty good right now but sometimes they play really amateur like. Although I'm a Man United fan if we look at the most league titles won and other international competitions like the Champions League Real Madrid is the best team of the last 50 years or so.|`|ibT2QVszaa	Man u is not the greatest football team.People call it because Cristiano Ronaldo "The greatest football player" is in that team.I do not like man u,i like liverpool fc.|`|ccHkqic7aa	I DOONT SUPPORT ANY PREMIERTEAM BUT THE NEAREST TEAM TO MAN U ARE WIGAN WHAT STEVE BRUCE HAS DONE WITH 37 PENCE IS TRULY AMAZING|`|qTAkrB5Aaa	Alex Ferguson<br>  <br>  "What a great coach/manager"|`|N1JzxrmUaa	Because your forwards are ugly. eg Tevez and Rooney. wOw what hit them in the face.

UxooffHZaa	Generally speaking, there will be more "bad" 1st round picks than good. If I had to guess, I'd go with the usuals, Lions, Browns, Bengals will draft someone who will be in jail, etc. Lions have 2 picks, (1 and 20) so lets assume one of them becomes a fairly productive player, eventually and probably for the Patriots or Steelers or someone else. So, I'll go with the Browns. I say they take Sanchez, who busts out, trade Quinn who becomes a Pro Bowler.|`|MqyoCDrFaa	I personally think the Lions will.

Comunque, Andrea sta migliorando sempre di piÃ¹, e i raptors sono anche una squadra vincente quest'anno, oltretutto le medie del mago aumentano ogni mese e nelle ultime tre partite Ã¨ stato il miglior marcatore per Toronto, purtroppo credo perÃ² che il titolo di rookie of the year andrÃ  a Brandon Roy, che sta facendo una stagione fantastica, anche se in una squadra perdente.... per me dovrebbe vincere Andrea, ma la sfida sarÃ  con Roy, considerato che Adam Morrison di Charlotte sta peggiorando sempre di piÃ¹ dopo un avvio esaltante.... sarÃ  comunque una bella sfida a due.... sorprendente, visto il numero di scelta Ã¨ anche la stagione di Millsap di Utah... ma non a livelli dei primi due.... comunque forza mago !!!!!!!!|`|4bq1KmMdaa	Non so ancora cosa penso di me.....  :-)|`|69e2d16b521ddfe1957edde06916ac5eaa	Ã¨ il migliore di tutti....l'orgoglio dell'italia!!!!!!!|`|Beba4koSaa	grande IL MAGO!!<br>  e con tutti gli altri giovani che si stanno facendo strada nelle grandi squadre avremo una grandissima nazionale!!<br>  Forse non vinceremo le olimpiadi perchÃ¨ sono troppo vicine, ma gli europei 2009 sono nostri ....e poi l'assalto ai mondiali!!!!!!!!|`|caf052a27575a048bce35cc3ecc680b2aa	Era un grande in Italia e lo dimostra anche in NBA!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Finalmente un italiano che dimostra il suo valore negli states!|`|txNWhQ9caa	si , Ã¨ bravissimo , ma io non lo metto ancora nei "grandi" della nba!|`|zvieUhgJaa	Ultimamente ha segnato 15-20 punti a partita.

I Toronto Raptors quest'anno vanno molto meglio, sono piu' coesi in campo e una parte del merito e' del Mago.
db2591f3bf5f2cf261284c0b57b2a696aa	Credo che fare un paragone sarebbe inutile, sono forti entrambi, ma molto diversi fra loro, ti posso dire perÃ² con certezza che Bargnani avrÃ  un futuro in nba, Belinelli no.... il gioco oltreoceano Ã¨ profondamente diverso dal nostro, e il mago saprÃ  adattarsi sempre di piÃ¹, a maggior ragione a toronto, insieme a Garbajosa e Gherardini (gm), Belinelli Ã¨ un tiratore puro, e in nba Ã¨ pieno di tiratori puri, magari peggiori di lui, ma fisicamente Marco Ã¨ molto gracile, e la il fisico conta davvero tanto.... Quindi per me Ã¨ piÃ¹ forte Bargnani ....  E Belinelli in europa potrÃ  essere comunque un ottimo giocatore, oltre ad essere le due pedine per il futuro della nazionale insieme a Gallinari, Gigli, Mordente, Amoroso ecc....|`|0433bfc07d4bf8482e709ec23e437fe6aa	Bargnani Ã¨ molto forte, piÃ¹ di tutti in Italia, ma stanno cresciando bene sia Belinelli e il giovanissimo Gallinaro.<br>  Con loro, piÃ¹ i vari Soragna, Mordente, Garri, Basile, Di Bella ecc. penso potremmo avere una nazionale molto competitiva per le prossime competizioni|`|130229947c26fb41b8e714067640c8d5aa	Per molte cose il Mago.<br>  Nel tiro Belinelli Ã¨ superiore|`|5b84010c9dc41b17ba9be36654a24c4daa	ora come ora il mago... agli europei vedremo.. non vedo l'ora|`|65c39d1399bd5cbe62004d887eca4f7eaa	Mago x ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|69e2d16b521ddfe1957edde06916ac5eaa	e lo chiedi pure???? bargnani!!!|`|6LkJKcXKaa	Belinelli|`|iGZH2cn7aa	ora e' il momento di bargnani.<br>  ma belinelli ha un talento incommensurabile... e' uno di quei giocatori che possono far fare al basket italiano un passo in avanti...|`|urAB3WOpaa	Sicuramente se belinelli andrÃ  nella NBA  non avrÃ  lo stesso impatto del mago che Ã¨ un lungo atipico mentre di giocatori come belinelli lÃ¬ ce ne sono a decine,anche molto + forti.<br>  Io dico il MAGO e dico anche che fra qualche anno avrÃ  superato pure NOWITZKI|`|9e61e4cb7f7d2691a6c8817238932d54aa	per me belinelli,Ã¨ piÃ¹ estroso,un vero fuoriclasse.|`|5ded96258a950d506b628bf90dd954c5aa	E' piÃ¹ forte Bargnani, lungo atipico e giocatore a dir poco unico; a gia vinto con la Benetton e ora Ã¨ tra i primi giovani nell'NBA. Belinelli ha tantissimo talento ma deve dimostrare ancora tanto... soprattutto di essere un leader. Ancora un po' di pazienza Ã¨ si capira veramente il valore di Gallinari, il piÃ¹ forte di tutti... puÃ² dominare in europa e diventare un grandissimo anche in America.|`|26Cn99E7aa	bargnani nn c'Ã¨ paragone!!!! poi al mondiale l'italia nn andra da nessuna parte... forza usa|`|b5b565335ffa0aa8d741f03724197e9daa	Ã¨ difficile dirlo visto ke giocanno in 2 ruoli abbastanza diversi (Bargnani Ã¨ una power foward mentre Belinelli Ã¨ una shooting guard...) comunque in questo momento Ã¨ quasi scontato dire ke Bargnani sia piÃ¹ forte, visto ke Ã¨ stato draftato come prima scelta assoluta... Appena Belinelli approderÃ  in NBA si potrÃ  fare un vero confronto...<br>  Comunque io rimango dell'idea ke il migliore in assoluto lo diventerÃ  Danilo Gallinari!!!|`|c3af48df18351d4c337821aa60e235dbaa	Bargnani senza dubbio...senza nulla togliere a Belinelli, che mi piace tantissimo e resta un signor giocatore, Andrea e' piu' forte, piu' completo ed ha i mezzi per diventare una stella anche in Nba...Belinelli probabilmente sara' nelle prime 15-20 scelte Nba di quest'estate, ma il suo futuro sara' da specialista tiratore, perche' spesso si intestardisce in quello senza provare altre soluzioni...a me piace, il talento ce l'ha, speriamo riesca a svilupparsi bene, ma Bargnani e' di un'altra categoria..e Gallinari secondo me e' il piu' forte di tutti, vedrai tra un paio di anni! ;)|`|ez7AlI4Daa	il mago bargnani

58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	The  Most Prestigious Belt without a doubt has to be the World Heavyweight Title that is currently held by the Undertaker.  It's been around the longest, and the people who have held this title Ric Flair, Harley Race, The Von Erich's, have all worn this title with pride and humility.  The WWE title which is currently held by John Cena has had it's share of great title holders, but as you can see in the last 3 years or so, it's reinvents itself. I think it's a slap in the face to the past champions to have the WWE title look like it was made for children and wanna be thugs, with a spinner by all things.

db2591f3bf5f2cf261284c0b57b2a696aa	GiÃ ... Bryant Ã¨ certamente il miglior scorer della nba... quando Ã¨ in giornata Ã¨ l'unico giocatore che ti puÃ² fare sempre 50 punti... ma vi ricordo che per farli si prende la bellezza di 35-40 tiri, che, in un economia di squadra sono indubbiamente troppi per un singolo giocatore, perÃ² visto che i Lakers non hanno altri scorer, lui puÃ² permettersi di farlo, preciso perÃ² che se in squadra avesse avuto compagni come quelli di detroit (per esempio), questi tiri non se li prenderebbe... e poi cosÃ¬ bravo lui, ma senza una squadra intorno non vince mai niente.... avrebbe bisogno di altri compagni, soprattutto di un tiratore perimetrale come Redd per esempio che gli consenta di scaricare fuori la palla anzichÃ¨ forzare sempre, anche se sa farlo benissimo..., ma non lo paragonerei a Jordan, che a differenza sua sapeva tirar fuori il meglio dai compagni (anche se i suoi compagni si chiamavano Pippen, Rodman, Kerr, Kukoc, e quelli di Kobe Vujacic, Walton, Cook....).... <br>  Carter .... semplicemente non Ã¨ un vincente, ha un talento unico, ma ferma sempre il gioco accentrando sempre l'azione sui suoi uno contro uno, e troppo spesso si accontenta di tirare da fuori anzichÃ¨ penetrare... poi stesso discorso, intorno a se non ha una squadra degna di fare piÃ¹ del primo turno dei playoff, molto probabile che nei prossimi 1-2 anni si sposti in un altra squadra....|`|OT6krvbfaa	kobe Ã¨ un giocatore fortissimo ma + forte di giordan nn c'Ã¨ nessuno!!!|`|leq6PidJaa	Spero che tu stia scherzando!

2rYKFlzPaa	I heard that there are four candidates for the job: Tom Crean of Marquette, Rick Barnes of Texas, John Calipari of Memphis and Rick Pitino of Louisville. Now the last name may be a shocker but he is seriously a candidate. He will not leave UofL fan and UK fans still hate him, but he is already in the state of KY and his team has been doing quite well in the Big East with little known players. He isnt going to go to UK. The most likely guy is John Calipari, mainly because Rick Barnes probably wont leave Texas and why would you choose Crean over Calipari? Calipari has won everywhere he went at the collegiate level (Just not at the NBA, sound familiar) He has gotten great recruits to memphis, albeit guys from the ghetto who probably would bring more spunk to UK's roster. Regardless, Calipari will replace Tubby.|`|SANNBvxHaa	definately not som1 as good as tubby. i think maybe the michigan coach.|`|q4I46wyGaa	UK has the money to temp Billy Donovan.  He is my choice however, there are several good candidates all mentioned here.  It won't be Pitino.  If Mitch Barnhart (A.D. at UK) wants to keep his job.  Too many mad UK fans over Pitino leaving.  The past UK players would be nice, but currently none are experienced enough to tackle this job.|`|AA10743378	Let's just not hope it is one of his assistants, but it's hard to replace a coach like tubby. Maybe, if everyone make him feel so pressured he might've stayed. I'm not sure who kentucky will get to replace him though.|`|AA11068872	Billy Donovan or Pat Riley<br>  <br>  edit to post below:<br>  YES!, I also heard that he bought some land on Winchester road in Lexington, also rumor is he has been spotted on UK's campus twice in the past few months. I did'nt want to say anything, but since you did, there you go...|`|bcc280d14bd6be1dabb59424542af666aa	IMHO, I think Billy Donovan would be a good candidate.  Rumor has it that he bought a house in Lexington...don't know though, just an unconfirmed rumor.  If Florida wins another NCAA championship, he will have accomplished a tremendous feat and could leave easily.  Only catch, I think he and Tubby are pretty good friends, could be sort of touchy???|`|AA11520285	Maybe the USC coach. He's done a terrific job with their program, but it would be hard to see him go seeing O.J. Mayo on his recruiting signings. Also the Oregon coach. He obviously saw potential in Tajuan Porter, (who's only 5'6) a freshman starting varsity player. The dude is like Florida's football coach Urban Meyer or USC Football coach Pete Carrol in recruiting if you ask me. An under the radar coach is UCLA assistant coach Jim Saia. I mean look at UCLA Bruins head coach Ben Howlands former assistant. His facing him in the "Big Dance," Pittsburgh head coach Marcus Kahn. Their are a lot of other coaches too though...|`|afcc6eb5eca7b537cb838cb7d036ab17aa	I can easily see a dozen candidates, but let's concentrate on the serious entries:<br>  <br>  Travis Ford--Coach at Massachusetts.  He was a Kentucky player who transferred from Missouri.<br>  <br>  John Pelphrey--Coach at South Alabama.  He was a part of the Unforgettables.  Previously assisted in Florida.<br>  <br>  Chris Lowery--Coach at Southern Illinois.  Defensive minded coach who built the Salukis to a mid-major power.<br>  <br>  Todd Linklater--Coach at Butler.  I think we've all seen just how well they've done this year.<br>  <br>  Billy Donovan--Florida Coach.  Reportedly, he's had some contract problems with the Gators.  But this could be just a case of keeping the options open to striking it while it's hot.<br>  <br>  John Calliperi--Memphis Coach.  It's possible that he might be interested.  He has a lot in common with Pitino, so I'm not saying yes, but it is possible.  Then again, he might use this as a swerve to get Memphis to cough up more money.<br>  <br>  Dennis Felton--Georgia Coach.  Work with me on this one.  He's actually stuck several wins on Kentucky in the few years that he coached here.  Before that, he worked for Western Kentucky to build up its tradition.<br>  <br>  Basically, I'd rule out Pitino (he loves the challenge at Louisville too much)  and Amaker (an actual downgrade from Tubby Smith).

Booker T is a multiple time United States Champion, has held more tag titles than I can count, a five-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and just last year was the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.<br>  <br>  You take WWE too seriously...watch TNA or ROH|`|88092cfe573b761b4a7d814f425a5b40aa	King Booka needs to change his name to the Booka King...Lawler was "The King" before the WWE ever had their first King of the Ring tournament. He was "The King" while Booker T was still working at Wendy's, before being arrested and serving 19 mos for armed robbery. This is going to lead to a match where the loser can never use the word "King" in their name again...which, Lawler will of course win, because removing his nickname of "The King" would be like if they stopped referring to Flair as "The Nature Boy". Booker T has to lose this feud. Its the only logical outcome.<br>  <br>  PS, The Star, you are a moron if you think Lawler wasn't a great wrestler...Lawler holds the record for most championships won, at 126 different title reigns.
a00612184f85ade9887ba74ced75ad24aa	I absolutely love that they got KG! With him Ray and Paul they will be amazing. I do however have some setbacks..<br>  All three of them are aging superstars and the only way these trades will work out is to get that 17th championship withen the next 3-4 years before all of them retire, right? When the three of them do retire though, what are they left with? Ainge traded like 5 of their young prospects away for a aging superstar! Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, they were all promising and developing. What are we going to do once the three (KG Ray and Paul) retire?? The Celtics are left with almost nothing. But nevermind my rambling, we need to think about the presant because in the upcoming 2-3 seasons the Celtics will be a force to reckon with if the three of them stay healthy! Go Celtics!!!!!!!|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	The Celtics will make the playoffs for sure now... and compete as well!

KH6t0IkDaa	Right before the tackle a good tailback is gonna lower his shoulders. The key is to get underneath him and aim your shoulder directly at his stomach. Grab behind at least one of his knees, ideally both, then throw all your weight into him.

YQ9YXcEkaa	Most running coaches and experienced runners will tell you that a good general rule is don't increase your miles by more than about 10% per week.  Exercise physiologist Jack Daniels suggests you can add one mile per week for every running session you do.  So if you run once a day, five days per week, under Daniels theory you can add five miles per week.  Daniels limits miles per week added to ten (that would be ten running sessions, meaning you are doing two workouts or "doubles" three times per week in addition to running every day).<br>  <br>  It's also a very good idea to throw in a "cut-back" week every few weeks, say once a month, where you reduce your mileage.  The mileage reduction in your plan is fine and won't hurt you.  It probably will even help prevent injury.<br>  <br>  I think what you're proposing is probably ok, though I might throw a week of 35-36 miles per week in between the 30 and 40 week, just to be safe.  You know your body best, and as long as you aren't getting sore, you'll be fine.  Just be sure to back off if you start feeling sore.  While you want to come into cross country season fit, what's even more important is you don't want to come in injured.|`|UBIlwiALaa	Well I think you'll be OK, just be careful on the week from going to 30 then the next going to 40.  That is an increase in 25%, it can be done.....but may want to think about maybe doing 36 or so that week.  Don't over do it, b/c it will suck big time to miss any time b/c of an injury!!  Just listen to your body, hope this helps.|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	What you are doing is building up to your mileage.  When you get to 40 miles per week and you don't think it is too much at the moment stay their and maintain.  Then work on your speed after a few weeks and when it comes time to compete add speed for a workout and then at state drop mileage, add quality and kick butt.  By the way you are using the cut back technique.  Good job if it works and good luck.|`|AsOno1Wdaa	As long as you are consistant during your workouts, the changes in the amount of mileage you are talking will not mess with your body.  Listen to your body as you increase your mileage and don't get caught up in the numbers.

Se nota que son los dos mejores del mundo y cualquiera de los dos que hubiera ganado, serÃ­a un justo ganador porque los dos jugaron tan parejos, lucharon todas las pelotas, punto por punto.

Good Luck!|`|igvu3ifUaa	i ran thoes races!!! i would always eat oatmeal for break fast, 2 granola/power bars before lunch then i generally just ate a lite lunch like a sandwich and a bottle of water. the night before make sure to get TONS of carbs!! like pastas and bread and stuff.

vBVyn2Iaaa	No offense, but if you don't know, you probably havent been skating long enough to be sponsored. You might be an exception, so here it is. Check out your shop to see if there are any comps, and if not, start making a video of about 2 mins of your best stuff. make it have everything, and not just stairs and rails. make sure to have manuals and etc. if you get sponsored, you will go to comps and endorse your shop, maybe get an ad on a magazine, or make a shop video. sponsorships are to boost local morale and make them want to rep the shop they live by, which is where you will help out! happy skating

But your small and slow. When I was a freshie, I played FB/SLB and I ran a 5.0-4.95 40 yrd dash and I was 165 lbs. My suggestion, add weight and speed; as much as you can before the season starts.|`|AotAniBnaa	If you can throw good and hit your target you might be a quarterback, but if you can't do that and you're somewhat fast you will probably be a RB if your agile and can make people miss. If you can catch good and run good routes you will prob be a WR and probably in the secondary on defense. But just give it your best and try out for what you want to do and can have fun playing and it will all work out.

But then still the top teams are the only ones who are good to watch|`|Mn97YDIyaa	The referees. You can't go through one quarter of a basketball game without going through 15 fouls, stopping the game and wasting time.|`|csKyqot0aa	I love watching The NBA. I watch almost every Cavs game whenever I can. |`|2wrenQfuaa	I agree as of late the NBA has become really boring to watch. I guess it's because all the good players are one side.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	The NBA is very boring ,The playoffs are when I pay more attention.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Whats wrong with YOU!!!|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	I think the whole ref scandal with Tim Donaghy and the betting that went on made me really dislike the NBA... my Pistons would have won back to back titles... they even said that the 2005 finals were affected by the betting scandal and that's when I was in love with the NBA but now I'm not so sure... I don't care as much as I used to because I still see ref's make horrible calls all the time... sucks but I guess I have to get over it eventually or just get over the NBA.  I also hate how teams can just buy championships now a days - take the Boston Celtics for example... the turn around they had because of the big three they got in Garnett, Allen, and Pierce was rediculous they didn't have a chance with just Pierce and then they go out and get one of the best players of all time in Garnett and one of the best shooters of all time in Allen... don't get me wrong I love all three of those players but wow was it stupid to watch... everyone knew they were going to win the title after that.  The game is all about super stars now... that's why I still like the Pistons because the base of their team were all cast offs everywhere else and they made that work but now even they have kinda sold out by picking up Allen Iverson... I love A.I. but I think he's messing up one of the only true team games left in the NBA... I guess only time will tell if he can mold and fall into the team game or just destroy the team by playing 1 on 1 basketball...<br>  <br>  all in all the NBA needs some fixing... players being paid too much, tickets being to high priced for descent seats, and the whole league is base around promoting superstars and not teams... It should be based around promoting a team game and superstars because even though you'll never be able to get rid of people loving superstars you need to market a team sport as a team game.|`|mezX9Ao0aa	its always been like this, players get millions of money. it really doesnt get interesting till the playoffs, but some of the intensity is there from players ie KG, Lebron, Kobe etc...and then there is players like Starbury who just want their money and i dont blame him but show some respect for the game....ive always watched the nba more cuz i kno the players better. |`|VFMt6g2iaa	I still like the games since then. But it might be because I think most of the guys are so cute! How can I not watch cute guys playing basketball. <br>  <br>  But it has changed since then but I can't put my finger on it! |`|FzybxapSaa	All the travelling, super star calls, lack of hand checking (80's and 90's ball was much better).  Too much dissecting into the player's lives off the court.  You don't see the passion that college has|`|20i0AnLjaa	Everybody gets to take 5 steps now and don't get called for traveling.  |`|1V9wEQQVaa	NBC did the NBA better|`|X2lZEs0Daa	You should watch college basketball.  The players have more heart.|`|POriIGJtaa	I watch hockey instead

cHtP31pZaa	The cowboys are back baby.  Owens, Jones, Romo, Ware.  Dallas has already had some big games, the Giants and the Bears.  Look what happened, they k**led them.  The cowboys are a great team this year.  They are finally back to playoff and superbowl contenders, just like back in the day.  Look for them to be one of the best teams this season.|`|Uv7E7r42aa	Next week is another test. The Rams can be dangerous, especially if they are being overlooked.|`|d7df39fb8a4db9508c907b64d85496e3aa	knocked out by the Sea Eagles. Were very disappointing|`|e8b6e4f6497bb089a340da39af89e158aa	I refuse to get excited in week 3. Remember how great the Cowboys looked after week 10 last year? And then they decided to look average and they snuck into the playoffs as a wild card team. And we all know what happened then. They looked good. And right now they have to be considered the best team in the NFC. If they win the game against the Patriots, then I will start going insane with anticipation of the SuperBowl victory that will cap off this incredible season. but for now, I am just happy to watch them play well.<br>  <br>  And every team in the NFL can be a test.  It's easy to underestimate teams, but the players on the other side are paid to play as well.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	I just love watching them play week after week and the Bears got that a** spanked tonight.|`|aee02965b0dc0ed8851675e55692d648aa	put rex on dallas or Pitt or patriots and they would be 0 - 3 meaning its not that the cowboys ran over the bears its that Rex takes everything from them and they have to be playing pissed off because of rex i mean come on the d. is not trying to stop the other team they are trying to score cause they know rex wont and that has them playing f'ed up like i said if we had romo yesterday we probably would of won 34 - 0 but it is what it is we got the bum

H8Yv3Kreaa	Well if the #1 seed is very over-rated it can happen like the Mavs last year!!|`|HqstXr4Waa	actually there are only problems after teams and individuals make assumptions about their oppenents when in truth they never know what can happen. in this celts hawks series just like in the sixers pistons series the better teams underestimated the reselience of the so called lower teams. each team has a leader, or plays as a team and i'm sure the rookies do it with a lot more energy than the vets.|`|ye3L3yfaaa	Yeah they can its the NBA the best players in the world. any team can win and any team can lose no matter who you have on your roster. people are forgeting that the hawks have there own 3 in (josh smith,Mike Bibby, and Joe Johnson).|`|WCyfCxs1aa	seedings dont mean nothin. any team can beat any team on any given day. and as you can see in that celtics series...record doesnt mean ****!!!|`|TMOlF4t9aa	hhahhahaha celtics loose again.|`|89d90e8b7abfad77d3b34f53849307a8aa	If the refs call bs fouls that knock out key players like the have been for the last few years then yes.|`|AQvq1cs4aa	no they shouldnt|`|sDoJCo6Oaa	watching close game actually KG isn't doing that bad. but other then that your right there shouldn't be a problem|`|S5ycFa0taa	no|`|HW4VXfMpaa	it depends on who it is.|`|MTbgg5eyaa	Celtics have lost 3 times to a 37 win Hawks team.<br>  <br>  Lakers have swept a 50 win Nuggets team.<br>  <br>  <br>  Who's better!!!!|`|WXpPZDRmaa	well the hawks are really not a good team, so its kind of embarrasing for boston. boston was to be all cool and calm and easily sweep this team because they won 30 more games then them in the regular season. the mavs last year had a pretty big upset, but goldenstate was a blossoming team last year. it was not like they were totally horrible [the warriors] but they somehow managed to pull off an upset..
MwwWKaFAaa	yea he gave up on his team quickly.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	I don't think he's a sore loser because I don't think he cares enough about losing to get very upset about it. <br>  <br>  His actions off the court right before the playoffs tell me that winning basketball games is not currently at the top of his priority list.  Hopefully he gets his priorities straightened out soon.|`|WCyfCxs1aa	carmello is a loser. period.|`|7K81dA6Maa	Yes, but i would be too if i got swept|`|8Y2C7eHLaa	He's a Dud...he has no fire, he cares more about his braids and getttin drunk than he cares about his shot. His head is as light as the air in Denver.|`|oThS1vR2aa	ya he gave up too quickly. if he gave more effort the nuggets might have followed and maybe put up more of a challenge|`|QRiGx6Faaa	no he's just not a smart baller, same for the team (except fo AI)|`|AQvq1cs4aa	i think he smokes weed|`|HW4VXfMpaa	yes|`|MTbgg5eyaa	Carmelo "DUI"|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	Hey Money Masta,<br>  <br>  i don't know if he's a sore loser- because he was pretty gracious in defeat. But i think he's a little young and even though he's won in college and high school- he does not have the character or leadership to win a title in the NBA.  <br>  <br>  i mean when he got busted for drunk driving- it was during a time when the Nuggets were fighting for one of the last playoff seeds.  He got drunk in his worst performance of the year-- but his team won by nearly 15 points. He should be able to understand as a leader of his team- that the team comes before himself.  <br>  <br>  He has some growing up to do-- and until he learns that he's a good scorer- but not in the same category with the best in the league.<br>  <br>  Nickster

70vs2rlWaa	I would suggest talking to your x-country coach, he should be able to help you, right??  Or maybe do a google search for training plans for running 5 minute miles, something should come up :) Also remember, you are just a freshman, be patient, I'm sure your times will just get faster over time, with more training ect. Just don't over train!! Good luck, I hope you reach your goal!!!!!!!|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	Well, I ran my first year of track last year and got down to a 4:41 1600 meter time.  If you want to run a 5 minute mile do this.  Pace someone who can get close to it.  Then run faster than them at the end.  Also if you want to improve do a lot of intervals, you know how .  Use your arms a lot and even better yet get relaxed and run very hard.  Do not make your first lap the quickest but make it about a 1:17 for the first lap and make the others faster.  Sprint the last 250 meters and you will break 5 minutes.  I hope the best for you, but I must warn you once you break 5 minutes you will be looking for the 4 minute mile.  Good luck man.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  By the Way!  You don't have to run 58 second 400 meter dashes to run sub 5 minutes.  My fastest and full out 400 m ever was a 1:04, yeah run 58 second 400 meters if you want to break 4 minutes.  Don't listen to that guy.  He is either crazy or he doesn't know his own abilities.  I ran my intervals in the 1:13-1:08 range and about 8 of them.|`|AA11122150	What I like about your best times in terms of the mile, two mile and three mile is your consistency. Some runners can run a three mile race in 17:00, but cant run a mile faster than 5:15. <br>  <br>  Here's what I would recommend (this advice comes from 4 years HS long distance): <br>  <br>  1. Focus on your 400 m time in practice. You need to run atleast 59 or 58 second 400 meter repeats to break a 5 minute mile.<br>  <br>  2. During the race, find someone on the team who is faster, and follow them. Run right behind this person, and dont let them get more than 1 second ahead of you. I used to follow a friend who would consistently run 4:50 or faster, and he would kick away from me on the last lap, but I would end up running a good 5:00-5:05 mile. <br>  <br>  3. Run atleast 30-40 miles a week, maybe even more. If you want to be dedicated, sometimes you can do additional running after track practice has ended. I cant stress how important it is to simply just run many many miles in order to get a very strong endurance foundation.|`|YAMv1fauaa	dude! your a freshmen and running 5 40. thats awesome keep up the training and you will get your 5 minute mile|`|reXOIhgaaa	Run faster..<br>  Just kidding<br>  <br>  Um it really depends on what kind of course you are to be honest.<br>  If you are on like a cross country course, what I usually do is find the fastest way to complete it.  And what I mean by that is to try not to follow the curves and try to make a straight line because if you don't you'll add about 1 more minute to your total time.<br>  <br>  If you need training just do speed workouts.. Ladders would probably help the most for making your faster. And some minor things would be to check your gear I mean like you shouldn't be running in 1 pound shoes I'm over exaggerating but yeah.
SglUXJ5Uaa	if you writing a book on teenagers the best source of information you can get is by asking TEENAGERS themselves as they will be able to advise you|`|y29GSws0aa	Hi<br>  <br>  I must pose the question concerning your intelligence as well. You make the claim to have this knowledge yet ask us in the hockey section for help. Would it not be best if you wrote your book over what you know? I would suggest as a first course of action taking a couple college level classes over English Composition. Then maybe that will give you a couple years to grow and mature and truly have some life experiences. I am sorry but no publisher will take the rantings of an uneducated 13 year old seriously. <br>  <br>  Thank You|`|9542ed4319ebe4bf999d083cbfbdeb05aa	I really find it ironic that you talk about being smart in social situations and make the faux pas of asking this in the hockey section.|`|k2bjQzMfaa	why is this under hockey?|`|217tJ0UEaa	how about you write about not spamming the hockey section?|`|oJsrGmmPaa	Smart my as$.|`|3080f407ab5573c161020776a5377bb3aa	<br>  The first word of a sentence is capitalized, and so is the pronoun "I."<br>

Since you are quite young, 40 miles per week with a long run of 8-10 miles would be a good start.<br>  <br>  If you backed off the training the week before your 5K, your time improvement would be immense.<br>  <br>  If you want to reach you potential, you should find a coach that can teach you about hill work and speed training.|`|zATV9Ehoaa	if you could try to work out 5-6 days a week then that would help you even more, you want to try to mix in threshold (1 mile repeats) and long distance runs (45 mins or more). Also after a threshold workout try to finnish with a few sprints.<br>  <br>  I think you have a very realistic goal and you should be able to reach it.<br>  Good Luck|`|AA11558572	keep practicing and you will become faster.|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	It is not possible.  You must be a RUNNER.  |`|bc12b3e60b0bad75a0255fc7888e3b38aa	Your plan looks good on paper.  I'm not sure that shaving almost 2 minutes a mile off your time in 10 weeks is realistic, but it looks good on paper.   I would suggest a mixture of long runs at an easy pace (5 to 8 miles), speed work, and tempo runs (3 to 4 mile runs at 80-90% of your goal pace).  day 1, do long run day 2 speed, day 3 tempo, day 4 rest, then repeat this process over and over.  While it is possible to get down to 20 minute 5K just by running 3 miles as hard as you can as often as possible (i;ve done it before) it's not the best way to do it.  
73mroS8Uaa	no way is that a lot.... just try to weighlift ... because like me , then you're going to get skinny with a lot of fat... because you lose muscle while running aside from fat|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	Great first step, man.  That is the way to do it, keep it up.  |`|VAEEwD4uaa	a mile every day isn't over doing it. Unless you are running way too fast. You shouldn't be going all out every day. but running at least a mile is a good thing as long as you are not wearing your body out. I run 30+ miles a week.|`|dR7cfnTaaa	Its perfectly fine, start out at a mile a day, then go to 1.5 then 2 miles. Just keep in mind that every once in awile you need to let your body rest. I give myself at least one day every ten days where I do nothing strenuous. This lets your muscle rebuild and leaves you to improve. Personally I go 1 day 1.5 miles, then next day 2, then 1.5 again, then 3 miles, then back to 1.5 miles. The days I only run 1.5 miles are my resting days (letting the blood flow through the muscles helps them recover, but you still need a day of rest to let them fully get recovered)|`|CEGY13QYaa	That's healthy!<br>  I wish I had the motivation to get myself to run that much!<br>  But I've got school and we don't run a mile every day of the week.<br>  <br>  Woah, 9:40...haha I'm slow compared to you!

6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	cool man, you are in the situation that I was.  The difference was I could only run a mile in 8:00 and I waited a little longer and joined crosscountry in 8th grade.  That is a very tough sport but well worth it.  I will give you a crash course.  The basic distance for high school crosscountry is the 5k ( 3.1 miles) .  You should try and run your first race at about a 7:30 pace or lower with a lot of training.  Right now I currently run every mile in practice at 7:15 and lower and my race pace is about 5:25 per mile or about a little under 17 minute 5k.  What I would advise since you are so young is too do a few things. <br>  <br>   1.  Work on foot turnover. Try and get your feet going and hitting the ground smoothly and fast ( about 90 times per foot per minute.)<br>  2. Cut out the soda, you will not miss it.<br>  3.  Work on speed development , not as much about mileage. <br>  4.  work on breathing.<br>  5.  Drink lots of water.<br>  6.  you need to get comfortable while running fast.<br>  7.  Work on running hard in a race but live just a LITTLE left at the end for a final "kick" or pickup at the end.<br>  8. Never be afraid to ask your coach questions.<br>  9.  Do not be intimidated.<br>  10.  Never ever give up and just have FAITH in God or in what you run for.  |`|qVhS0VSeaa	well i can run a mile in 5 min so i think your good but what i did to run faster was just adding ankle weights and a backpack of rocks when I run for a month every where i went i wore them the ankle weight are comfortable and the backpack just helps with weight over distance. when your body is used to that amount of weight and you take it off them you fool your body to think its lighter and that helps you excel your weight faster plus this helps with your balance and in cross country this will help and a change in technic, your body needs to shift side to side with an erect back this helps with endurance and speed.<br>  remember don't use really heavy weight once you start to get tired the weight feels double what it is and exhausted the weight can feel unbearable.  OH yeah food eat an apple instead of a fruit bar or something the apple will give you all the energy with none of the calories not to mention it is easy on the body and makes everything easier to digest so after a snack an apple will improve how quick you use the calories and still give you energy.|`|pDSlV0Jnaa	In order to be a fast runner, you have to run faster.  You need to do speedwork, such as 400 meter repeats and 200 meter repeats.  As you incorporate speedwork into your running routine, make sure you have rest days of easy workouts and some long runs to maintain strength.  I recommend "Long Distance Running" by Marty Liquori.  By the way, it's great that you can run a mile in 6:30, but please don't go around telling people that you are fast.  Wait until you get down around 5:00/mile.  Then you will be fast.  6:30 runners are a dime a dozen.|`|SQIMT4AKaa	i run cross country and we do workouts everyday and we run continously, nonstop for up to 70min than we have meets were we run a mile ( i'm in 7th grade) and you have to get at least 6 min to get in the top ten. i usually place 2-5|`|JfwzuyLyaa	just practice running like half a mile every day n u should c results by 2 weeks top
57XQeNZ1aa	I wouldn't call it luck.  I would call it, being hopeful?  I also hope he has a good game, just because I'm a Brady Quinn fan back when he was in Notre Dame.  But going against the horrible Denver D does help!|`|NeYFiGmRaa	This is a mystery until after Thursday night.  He'll either live up to the hype and fight for the job, or he'll choke (or his teammates will).  If you're in a tight matchup, he may be a bigger risk than Flacco or Rosenfels.|`|cgVaN9jHaa	Jason Campbell is my QB too...I am trying to figure out who to pick up.  I guess if Quinn has a good game this week, and if they play a weak defense.  This week will be the ultimate test for him.  I am excited though because I am a Notre Dame fan. |`|vnOnVq8Zaa	Quinn is a good pick esp vs DEN def.  Hes got a lot of good targets in Edwards (if he doesn't drop the ball) and Winslow (as long as he doesn't talk bad about the team).  Jamal can run against DEN so I think its a good bye week pick in Quinn.|`|c56fLEzqaa	You're crazy.  If he proves to be a good fantasy QB then you got lucky, but at this point he's just a QB with almost zero experience on a really bad team whose number 1 WR has got some butterfingers.|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I think your lucky my man. Kellen Winslow will be back in the linuep and should open things up for Braylon Edwards.

BSl1eDUjaa	M.Lynch hes getting good and his team is getting better.|`|a6EndAPiaa	I would go with Lynch.<br>  <br>  At first glance Lewis has a better match-up -vs- the Broncos.  However, Broncos games often end up being shoot outs.  Cleveland does not have the defense to shutdown that potent attack so they might end up having to focus on the pass more than the run.<br>  <br>  Lynch has a tough match-up -vs- New England; however, it is less likely to end up in a shoot out meaning that the Bills are less likely to abandon the running game.<br>  <br>  The more I think about it the more I am not sure . . . it is pretty much a toss up.  But I would still go with Lynch.|`|Z9ttQ2szaa	Jamal Lewis definatly because first of all  Brady Quinn is starting his first start in the nfl so the browns arnt gonna make him throw 30 to 35 passes so jamal should get a good amount of carries and second of all the broncos starting LB and the best run stopper on the team and on top of that champ bailey CB and Marlon McCree S are out too so they are gonna put extra guys out there too help stop the pass so the holes should be open on the inside and thats where jamal likes too run and it helps that the broncos are 26th in the league giving up 144 yds per game!!!  Answer : Jamal Lewis |`|MTRtqDJCaa	Lynch, big time.  Lewis has not really shown anything this season.  With Quinn in there teams will be loading the box against Lewis. Go with Lynch.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|GQtv3b5vaa	denver has one of the worst rushing defenses in the NFL so i'd go with Jamal Lewis he can just go right behind joe thomas at LT and get some good runs out of that. 
ZyPma3NWaa	There's a couple of choices but, only one for me. Dough ball. You just get some peanut butter, maple syrup, and bread. You make it in a ball and toss it out on the bottom. I've caught about 10 like this this year! Corn has never worked for me, I've only caught Bullhead Cat's. Most people say corn is very good, you may want to try it out. Night crawlers are suppose to work very well, yet I've only caught Catfish and Shell Crackers with them :(. Also, if you don't want to make messy dough ball (extremely messy), buy some sweet peanut butter candy on the hook, preferably peanut butter roll or something like that. Other things I've HEARD have worked are Twizzlers, Bubble Gum, Bass Spinner baits and Stink baits. Well, that's all you need to know. Have a fun time carping!!!<br>  Tight Lines!!!|`|FtBHXQvHaa	nightcrawlers works for me.|`|fSJrgVU7aa	The best carp bait I've ever used is Wheaties cereal. Crunch up a handful and dip your hand into the water. Knead it into a tough dough. Pack enough around a #10 or #12 treble hook to just cover the hook completely. Use just enough weight (slip sinker) to cast as far as you need to and stand by. Any time I've fished this method in any water that held carp I've had them going crazy for this bait.|`|AA10561878	stink bait from Wal-Mart
ivsKcwwvaa	First off, Iowa has Penn State number. JoePa hasn't won in Iowa City since '99, and lost last 5 of 6 or 6 of 7 to Iowa. Second, Iowa's losses were by a total of 12 points. Could be 10-0 just as easy as 5-3. Finally, Iowa has one of better defenses in the country, along with a running back gaining 100 yards every game, and 3rd leading rusher in the nation. |`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	In retrospect, no. One team showed up to play a football game, the other didn't. Penn State played flat, like they expected Iowa to just roll over and get blown out anytime. They tried no QB sneaks up the middle near the goal line, they closed the playbook so no creativity was seen. The players didn't make the best efforts either. Passes they'd normally catch ended up being dropped. And as I said, this was not the Spread HD offense. Honestly, the only film that Iowa needed to beat Penn State was watching road game film from the late 1960s. It's the same plays that everyone's got figured out. They were creative in 1969, but now everyone knows to look for a bunch of reverses, runs up the gut, draw plays, and passes on third down.|`|AA11414524	Iowa's win was a surprise, but I wouldn't use the weather as an excuse. In any given game, both teams have to deal with whetever the weather conditions may be, not just one. Iowa stepped up and played very well, and they deserved to win the football game.|`|aqNNcCduaa	I wasn't surprised on the loss. Penn state is overated, Joe Pa is a great coach (One of the best ever), but his team can't carry out the task of being undefeated. Point is Penn state is good, but not championship caliber good. |`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I wasn't surprised that the best part about college football anybody can beat anyone on any given saturday, I'm glad they lost because Texas is back in the title picture|`|EULDW1Kwaa	Penn state = overrated|`|bsSaON6oaa	Yes I was surprised but this is college football and anything can happen. The weather played a factor but both teams had to deal with it so I do not think it hurt either team more than the other.  <br>  Penn St pretty much dominated the first half.. Iowa only had around 70 yards of offense and Penn St had the ball around 24 minutes of the first half. Penn St couldn't put the ball into the end zone. They ended up kicking too many field goals. If they put the ball into the end zone, the game is pretty much over at half.  <br>  Iowa came out much more aggressive in the second half but for the most part Penn St matched it. Daryl Clark did not play well.. I say they should of punted the ball in in the 4th and made Iowa go like 60-70 yards to get into field goal range but instead Clark throws the interception. Secod, I was surprised Penn St did not call time-out when Iowa had the ball in field goal range. Penn St would have got the ball back with about 40 seconds left and with Derrick Williams returning kicks, there was a chance that he could of set Penn St up with some good field position.<br>  Oh well, hopefully Penn St will win out and get to the Rose Bowl and win that and end up 12-1, and probably ranked 3-4 in the BCS.|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I woudnt blame the weather, I think Iowa just played big against a highly ranked team.

Good game<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|eoHvleGnaa	Daryl Clark (penn state qb) played a factor by sucking and throwing a pick at the end of the game|`|gzPhvqpOaa	I think the weather had a lot to do with it but both teams played with the same weather|`|l8NnsIFqaa	On any given week, any team can beat any team. 
wmWrcN0faa	Josh Howard is much better at this point.  Gerald Green has done some good things the last 2 games and got to start because of an injury to Howard.  But right now Howard is a better basketball player.  <br>  As far as Jason Terry it just depends on what you need I guess.|`|dd0fb6aaff0c481f534a19087147085caa	Josh Howard without a question. No Jason Terry shouldn't start, it's always good to have a scorer in your 2nd Unit.|`|oqQjnpfGaa	Overall, Josh Howard is a "better" NBA player, but I think Gerald Green has lots of potential and has great athleticism (he lacks confidence and experience).  <br>  <br>  Start Jason Terry, he is a great baller, but he might be more efficient coming in as a sixth man and score points for the second-unit. |`|Z3bpKA2caa	Josh Howard by a pretty good margin.<br>  <br>  Starting Terry or not shouldn't make a huge difference. He's one of the better players on the team and therefore is gonna get a good amount of minutes.|`|MTRtqDJCaa	Definitely Josh Howard.  Gerald Green has more raw athleticism, but Howard is better basketball player right now. I would not start Jason Terry<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|alccBWhMaa	gerald greene<br>  don't start jason terry|`|ZnHqHyjwaa	Gerald Green is not gonna see much time.

RjjJMMRYaa	Yup.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	If I remember correctly, this was all about replacing the crappy Astrodome, not any super bowl victories.|`|0P71zlECaa	The Bud Adams and city of Houston's relationship was sour. Acidly sour. Someone on the city council or their staff kept leaking details of the ongoing negotiations about the stadium to the press with a negative slant. Adams was vilified in the press and fan's were demoralized and only the loyal base continued full support. <br>  <br>  Adam's decision to move was made easier then Nashville offered them an enticing deal with their wallets wide open.<br>  <br>  I think if the Oilers had won the Super Bowl in 1993 when they had a real shot, and maybe another one before or after, the situation would have been a lot different. Adams would have had a lot more leverage with the city because of the economic impact and the more aroused fan base.<br>  <br>  I still don't know if the Super Bowl wins would have settled a new stadium deal and kept the team in Houston. But my guess is they would have stayed.|`|AA11307224	No.  Bud Adams moved the team because Houston was unwilling to build a new stadium for the team to play in.  They held to their guns thinking that the NFL would not approve Bud to move the franchise.  Tennessee put up the goods and built the new stadium, and the NFL allowed the move.  Houston then agreed later to build the new stadium in order to secure the expansion team to replace the Oilers.<br>  <br>  Super Bowl wins or not, it is doubtful that the Oilers would have stayed in Houston.|`|UKYWaeT6aa	I think so|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I think they would.  They would have made some money and the owners wouldn't have had to move.

8d41d7738cca5efe83ba048f9405c808aa	Do you mean ice hockey? This is the UK section and people are getting mixed up.<br>  Field hockey sticks are all right handed. My left handed mate played in a works tournament and the coach told him all sticks are right handed.<br>  As quoted from the international rules: 4.6 The stick has a traditional shape with a handle and a curved head which is flat on its left side.|`|2uWTFTfFaa	No...no one plays left-handed. What is this left-handedness that you speak of??? I thought everyone was right-handed on this planet.<br>  <br>  Of course you can. Just go to the sports store, they are right next to the left-handed baseball bats.|`|DqU8Ax83aa	Is that anything like a left-handed spatula?|`|47a1454f9d36a449a058a17644f9a0dfaa	For field hockey, there is no such thing as a left handed hockey stick, as it would be a huge advantage for tackling and such as everyone else plays right handed, and you can only use one side of the stick. There would be issues with obstruction and blocking if you did have a left handed one.|`|AA11004428	my sons played hockey for many years..one still does. you may not find a left-handed stick but what you can do is go to a hockey or sporting goods store. better yet..do you live near an ice rink? buy the stick itself...no blade. they sell both wood and metal. then you keep that and just replace the blades as they wear out. and they sell lefthanded blades in there.|`|wOwHliwjaa	As far as I know you can use a hockey stick left or right handed the same as a cricket bat.The head of the stick is universal. Golf clubs for example are handed due to the shape of the club head.|`|LhtM6xQNaa	There are no field hockey sticks for left-handed. All sticks have a toe with a rounded edge that faces the right and a flat, hitting surface that faces the left. To be able to hit the other direction with the flat face you have to turn the stick 180 degrees. <br>  <br>  There are many places selling left-handed ice hockey sticks.|`|xMo1ACRxaa	yes i play left handed in hockey, you can pick them up at any sports store, play it again sport, sports experts ect hokey is a great sport and it might be easier for you if your left handed<br>  <br>  <br>  TibiT111|`|ktB6SmSNaa	Yes you can. <br>  <br>  I played left wing. I was left handed. I bought a left handed hockey stick. They're the same as right handed hockey sticks, only the curve at the bottom, is opposite :)
NroJenJ1aa	It's a nice goal but it is very lofty, and unfortunately most likely, unrealistic.  When you get that low, dropping even 5 seconds off is hard.  Even if you train perfectly and eat everything that a runner should, your physical body may not allow you to perform at under a 14 minute 5k.  Jumping from 35 miles a week to 90 miles a week also seems a bit unhealthy.  The stress factor just makes the situation more complicated and you may reinjure it, which of course would stop your goal.  My personal best was a 17:02.  I'm 6 foot 2 and just am a big guy by nature.  I ate right and ran about 50 miles a week but my body just couldn't go any faster.  I still run and I am a biology major and have studied the body and constantly read medical articles that connect with running long distances.  Your body may not be able to handle it.  Make your goal to beat your personal record.  If you can do that, even by a few seconds, then you can try to beat the new one and so on.  Don't reach for the stars right away.  Good luck man, I hope you can get a 13:42, that would be amazing.  Sorry this was long...|`|nDSugp1Maa	WOOOH dude that's going to be way to hard on your body to go from 35 to 90 miles in a week! Especially if your just coming back from an injury! I would take it easy and start from those 35 and add 5 miles every week if u really want to get back in race pase.  You want to take it easy and make a smooth transition to you normal running pase. For now just make you goal to get back into running mode and then figure out how to get fast at a later time. |`|dGL5xCrqaa	I agree with the last post. After one year of running, I pretty much knew all the basic info of running, after my second year I was a training fitness and diet guru. All of my friends run in college and they're getting in 60-80 miles a week just from normal practices. They run three times a day. I only run once a day on the weekdays and twice on weekends and get 50 miles per week.<br>  <br>  According to what you have posted, you're already super fast. You much be your coach's favorite, he should feel inclined to give you the most support then and tell you how to train. If he doesn't, then ask him what more you can do training wise.|`|jgNxU0Ydaa	1 I have a problem with your post.<br>  <br>  You're a 14:42 college runner and you ask a question like this? I don't believe a runner of this caliber would ever ask such a question. They don't run men's 5K in college it's 8K and a college runner already averages into the 70's|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	A year and a half?  I think this can be done, if you've already broken 15 mins in a 5k by your freshman year of college, you clearly know how to train.  Don't make huge jumps in mileage, give your body time to adjust to a higher mileage.  Increase your mileage around 5% every other week until you get to the weekly mileage you want.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you are completely over your stress fractures before you embark on this, starting again too soon will just bring them back.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	You know you can, you were top of the country in high school. But use you head, is this what a smart runner would do?  You are top in the country and you can run the rest of your life. Should you throw this away right now?<br>  <br>  <br>  I have a question.  Can you help me with my 2 mile and my mile time?  I don't want the stress fracture but can you share some tips with me.  I have worked on my foot turn over and get about 97 steps per minute on each foot and my best times are 4:41 and 10:34.  I feel as if I can run them right now.  I really am asking, " what should I do in my preseason?"  Right now I am thinking about running hills for several weeks and increasing my long runs up to about 18 miles and do fartleks and things like that, but do you have any advice?  Hope you get over your injuries man, because I know you want to go to the NCAA Nationals.  But be smart you have 3 years left to do it.  Best of luck.
6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	What I advise is that you build up to 8 miles now.  That way you can go well beyond later.  I also recommend building up one run to about 1.5 hours.  Also end 1 or 2 runs a week by picking up the pace.  I recommend doing balance drills as well, look them up they are interesting.  Vary your pace and drink a lot of water.  Build your season now.  Also, go and run a hilly route as well and build endurance.  Lift weights every now and then but now too much.  Pullups are good now.  World class C-C runners usually have a base like yours so you can have a great season, building up to 50 miles per week or so .  Remember , God is in control, if you believe in him, run for his glory and enjoy it.  Good luck.|`|2Ulx5eG7aa	Try out new courses, or go running with a buddy. also, intervals, though  sometimes dull, can be useful in keeping you in shape. Just go on 3-4 mile runs with music, a friend, or something and remember to condition. keep a positive attitude.|`|AA12258645	run different courses and run different number of miles. and work on your pace or something. there are a lot of things you could work on.|`|AA10241450	First of all you should be doing track right after XC season.  Variety is the spice of life so you should make your workouts fun and practice speed work at least 2 or 3 X a week.  You should be doing more 2 miles X 3 and 1 mile X 4 intervals on the cross country courses.  Taking rests in between intervals will let your body recover and should improve your performance.  Run different routes such as hills, grass, dirt - do form work such as bounding.<br>  <br>  Run long distance at least once every two weeks for instance starting at 6 miles.<br>  <br>  Try running in the pool or doing cross training such as rock climbing.

He's taking a up so much cap room on the salary even though the knicks already have heeps, it's just stupid to pay a player millions when hes hardly doing anything.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Exactly|`|JV8lgDRCaa	very bad decision. im not a knicks fan but id rather want to see alston in that team|`|5FypDafWaa	Yes I mean look at all the problems they have had with him and they still want to keep him?|`|AA10341456	U actually think for 1 minute that any NBA GM wants Stephon"I"m the Greatest Just Ask ME" Marbury on their team?Hes been a piriah on every team hes been on,and to top it off,hes not that great.He and his agent were just smarter than Isiah was w/the big deal he got from The Knicks.Not that it's too hard to be smarter than Isiah when it comes to running a basketball org....lol|`|A7fGmajQaa	yeah they gotta trade him somehow|`|sts20gA8aa	yer but i dont think any team wanted to pay him 20 mil|`|wuJNQKLVaa	i think it would be foolish if any team trade him..all he has is just good old days memories..steph sucks!!!|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Yes it is STUPID<br>  <br>  Because <br>  <br>  1-They R Paying 20 Million$ For Nothing<br>  <br>  2-They R Benching A Great Guy<br>  <br>  3-They R Keeping A Player Unused
Ro03hVb6aa	Tahs played well for about 5 mins.  That's two very poor games today.  Perhaps Giteau can make the next game worth watching.<br>  <br>  But yes, a good win, you gotta win at home.  I think the talent is there for them to do well, their scrum looked ok and defence is pretty solid and there signs of a solid pattern and shape, but today was very ordinary for the most part.|`|nG4MfEbCaa	Where would the tahs be with out you Bill|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Yes Bill I am not into Rugby much but I know that the Waratahs have played good lately. Good on em.|`|IDBasYahaa	The tahs started to fumble the ball when the chiefs forward pack got their crap together & started to put presssure on the tahs pack.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Tahs are the best.

qVDY1hm5aa	Mr. Kennedy. I think if he can stay injury-free and he can show he's not ring rusty, he could definitely win the ECW Championship within six months of his debut on ECW. Plotting around on the midcard on either RAW or SmackDown, is not going to do anything for Kennedy's confidence, momentum or credibility. Turning back heel is the best career move for Kennedy and the feud between him and Christian could run ECW for months. Two big superstars. One fresh feud.<br>  <br>  BQ: I think the case is not him being boring, it's that he needs a decent manager with a considerable amount of experience in the business to cut promos for him and accompany him down to the ring. Kozlov's promo's are so boring, I almost fall asleep listening to him talk. If WWE hired a manager like James Mitchell, who's rotting away in unemployment, he could work wonders for VK. Similar to that of Umaga and Armando Estrada, these two could be a pair which are a threat to the WWE Championship.|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	Kozlov<br>  Kizarny<br>  Rey Mysterio<br>  Kofi Kingston (again)<br>  Evan Bourne As Main Eventer<br>  JBL As Top Heel<br>  Mr Kennedy!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kennedy!|`|pLYY0SlFaa	Defiantly Evan Bourne! Hes an amazing high flyer and has great main event potential,not only on ECW but he would be great on any brand.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Evan Bourne<br>  ECW and Kozlov are extremely boring.|`|nm16oIc9aa	i agree with TP cena is sooooo over-rated he does the same sht every match he should peev of to where ever that steroid freak batista is and play docs and nurses together|`|JiCfYfLraa	john morrision that kid can go and he is one of the best wrestlers in the wwe today or shelton benjamin.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Kennedy!<br>  <br>  BQ : Kozlov?

Only thing I know is Cena doesn't not deserve the push he's getting. He's the worst wrestler I've seen. Horrible in-ring and character.|`|CC3FZj9Caa	They could definitely put Shelton Benjamin or R-Truth now. MVP can also be a good candidate. Or if they really want to solidify the ECW title, give it to Khali for like a year.
PrsbAjZAaa	Don't forget Quaresma ;)      Very good question , but there's THOUSANDS of players that would have to be in , if your talking about the current super stars in the footballing world , and not the up and coming one's then      Messi  Eto'o  Villa  David Silva  Casillas  Ribery  Di Maria  Riquelme    there's just a few....there litteraly is to many to name.|`|AA11109752	Well we already have Quaresma now :-DDD CFC!

Some notable teams in the Calabria region include Reggina Calcio who play in Serie A, Catanzaro, Cosenza and FC Crotone who play in Serie C.|`|ubVSokEWaa	Of course.  Every region in Italy has at least one soccer team.  In the case of Calabria there are a few, as has already been pointed out.

oNR7il8baa	I never quiet saw Zaragoza as a weak club took me as surprise when they got relegated|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Well not really. I don't think "big" clubs can get relegated.<br>  But I was worried about Valencia last season. And now their financial situation isn't so hot.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	I  think not at these days but again what if Newcastle get relegated? what about Valencia last year?|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	yeh spurs|`|pwtmMGMWaa	I'm still praying that Madrid gets relegated for 1 season, but that kind of miracle doesnt exist. and im saying just for 1 season cuz La liga would be boring if madrid is not there to be trashed by bar?a lol 1 season will be enough to see them crying haha|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Probably not but if the club gets in to too deep debt then anything is possible, the perfect examples are Zaragoza and Valencia last season!!!|`|mvJXPDLgaa	I think Tottenham if you count them as a "big" club|`|cTaX7sFtaa	i don't think any "big" club could get relegated|`|cOPCNP7Laa	It can happen and it has (even without penalty relegations such as Juve's). For example Maradona's Scudetto winning Napoli was relegated years later to Serie C. Same with Fiorentina, a team which had been at the top of Serie A (the Batistuta days) or even Parma (they had Zola, Buffon, Cannavaro, Stoichkov, Asprilla, etc). These were all relegated AFTER they were big teams. I must admit they were relegations forced mainly due to financial reasons but of course those financial burdens meant selling their players, weakening the squads and getting relegated or simply going bankrupt. Tbh it could happen, if it happens, in the EPL. Liverpool has something like 350 Million British POUNDS of debts and they are not the only big club that is debt ridden. So yes, it can happen as evidenced by the recent past being a witness of this.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	Arsenal
zu0W6hCTaa	i cant believe they won that game at the end, it was sick|`|28d07970c3adc9d81a00eeb71a258aa1aa	Okay, it says there "OOopps sorry".|`|ilG7IV0aaa	both things didn't show up...|`|0kT9vgGxaa	i think where the bloody hell is the picture?
mezX9Ao0aa	w/o bynum then maybe yea, but with bynum its gonna be tough for the cavs.    Edit: to answer, somewhat accurate|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	I don't agree because the game still has to be played.  I think they should do what they did last time a shut lebron out of the game.  they do that and there's not way the rest of the Cavaliers team beats them.|`|mff1vstNaa	The problem with sims is that they leave out so many variables that affect the game such as unknown improvements or just personalities. Your sims are plausible, but those never can depict real life situations. I mean all sims would have had the Mavs beat the Warriors a few years ago. So no I don't agree with those results.|`|1UwKxK8yaa	Theyre both nub teams try okc thunder vs spurs|`|YhfMrppSaa	Good luck on the game|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Sounds accurate...|`|KdhNCnEjaa	The Cavs are going to win 106-97, so your simulation will turn out to be correct!|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I think it's just coincidence

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Not really because FCW is already part of WWE and is the promotion's development territory.Besides, Vince refuses to acknowledge rivals like TNA,ROH and NWA and for sure he won't want to give his competitors any publicity or tv time at the expense of WWE.|`|khU8m4gxaa	FCW vs. WWE happens all the time, since FCW is WWE's minor league. NWA is essentially just a loose collective of independents, so it wouldn't do WWE any good to compete with them. Every NWA guy wants to be in the WWE. Unless NWA got a real nice TV deal, I don't see them gaining any recognition at all. Even WWE vs. TNA is highly unlikely because Impact only draws 1/3 of the viewers that RAW does, so they're not any competition either. It's all about money with WWE, and if it don't make dollars...it don't make sense.|`|O6WSs2s5aa	yea i can see it happen|`|sqfjfR3iaa	No. I can see ROH vs. NWA vs. FIP vs. PWG vs. PWN.

IloN99traa	1. I think that whole plot was just wrong, I know Nigel is getting boring but why is he still Champ? Them involved in the match was pathetic. I don't why they just put the title on someone else    2. I don't think he's gotten stale, just plain boring in the ring at times. His match against AmDrag was amazing at Rising Above but I don't know but I find him uninteresting at times    3. I think Aries should have the title next. I think a Black vs. Aries Title match in the future would be an interesting and exciting match|`|nKSmgjylaa	1) I honestly don't know what to make of it at the moment, I just read the results a few minutes ago. I'd like to see where they take it from here. I would've liked to see Tyler as the new champ.    2) Yes, I do. I mean, I do love Nigel, he's very skilled but come on, there's on so long that you can have a title before it becomes unrealistic. It's not like he's the only legitimate champion that ROH have.    3) It's possible, but I guess no one knows for sure yet. Would I like to see him as the champ? Yes. Do I think he will be the next champ? It's very likely imo.    Nice question, a change from WWE and TNA q's.  *STARRED*  (:|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	roh used 2 be good now it sux no good wrestlers left|`|uEfoR5BLaa	ROH SUX since CM Punk, Samoa Joe, and AJ Styles are gone|`|G9LSZQcaaa	ROH is the bomb!  1. The writers probably thought it was a good storyline.  2. I think hes getting stale to, who keeps a title for more than a year? he has to give it up sometime.  3. Yes, in about 2-4 months, he will become champion.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	1) Based on what I saw on the last Ring of Honor Pay Per View and at recent Ring of Honor House Shows, this did not surprise me. I think it's called the "Enemy of My Enemy is My Friend" Principle.    2) I thought Nigel could have lost the Ring of Honor World Heavyweight Title in a number of matches over the last 5 months, but he's held onto the belt. He now has the second longest World Heavyweight Title reign in ROH History, second only to Samoa Joe. Ring of Honor many want him to break Joe's Recofd, in which case, McGuinness may remain champion for a  long time.    3) I thought that Tyler Black had the athletic skill, wrestling  skill, wrestling holds, wrestling moves and charisma to be champion months ago. He definitely should be ROH World Heavyweight Champion some day.|`|UWJinEbIaa	1.  If you wanna follow the logic of "swerves" gets people talking and excited......well then it worked.  But on the other hand it hurts the overall product because the past 6 or so years of ROH existence was not built on that kind of logic.

Why not|`|18bWZ94qaa	1.ARIES SMELLS LIKE HINDU FARTS    2.NOT AS STALE AS YOUR MOM'S CANCER STORY    3.WHEN YOU STOP FAKING PICS HE WILL BE ROH CHAMP    YOUR WELCOME
AA10080161	Last year, split between two clubs he still managed nearly 500 at bats. Ken hit .245 and 265 for his two clubs. He hit 30 doubles, 18 home runs. 73 RBI's, 424 slg%. He struck out 89 times.  Not a bad year for anyone.  Being a real pro he will show up for spring training in shape and ready to play.

He really can't get around on a good fast ball pitch any more.<br>  <br>  Homers? Maybe twenty or twentyfive max. Plus another twentyfive doubles.<br>  <br>  Ribbies depend a lot on having runners on base, but I would estimate about 75 to 80 RBI's.<br>  <br>  He definitely will not be comeback player of the year.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Set the over/under at 24.5 homers for Griffey and I'll put $50 on the under.<br>  <br>  Set the over/under at 29.5 homers for Griffey and I'll put $100 on the under.|`|5yZICXImaa	I think Seattle will awaken him and he will have a pretty big year like .280 30 100. Then I unfortunately think he may retire because he has said before that he would like to retire with the Mariners even if it meant signing a 1 day contract.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Get injured and miss 40-80 games; if he plays more than half the season, he'll be too tired in August/September to produce much in the way of power|`|RLoilwCNaa	Griffey was a great player and a better person. Father time is undefeated.|`|f35bf12a8eff1dc4cd38d5447b69023aaa	20-30 homers, 0.285avg 100rbi

w1TJ1OFGaa	hell yeah. they sucked man!!|`|9F6zgX8waa	yeah the celtics should have won that game. honestly ray only touched the ball on that offensive rebound attempt. also honestly harpring was playin dirty pierce should have gone to the free throw line a couple times AND KG got hurt so no big deal <br>  <br>  jazz fans shouldnt get too cocky they wont make it too far in the playoffs anyway<br>  <br>  dont worry banner 18 is still coming this year<br>  <br>  LETS GO CELTICS!!!!!!!!!!|`|IUxM3brbaa	I blame Ray Allen. Harpring ripped the rebound away from him and the announcers even said Allen wasn't a "man." And Allen couldn't defend Williams' last two shots. Ray Allen lost it all the way. Doc rivers certainly didnt help though.|`|Vr4r5l8Raa	it was just a total joke, pierce didn't even have a great night, don't know about doc, but he was like a newbie after that game.|`|33f9ed9362006bd098893100e4c092efaa	cant blame a team game on one person :x|`|u2QhQAxzaa	All that matters is that the stupid Celt-D!CKS lost.

Does Princess bring it on the road with them?|`|MPz9APZDaa	I know man, he did the SAME play every single time. I mean, couldn't he see that Pierce was getting owned by the Jazz defense. I guess not, well, it doesn't hurt me, I'm just happy Lakers are ahead of the Celtics.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Looking for a foul to be called on the road is bad enough, but in Utah? They can forget it.

QuLapuE7aa	Pau Gasol is one of the best nba players today, maybe top 3 power forwards now. Pau is our savior he help us alot since he came to LA. I like how he's helping the Lakers, with Pau the Lakers are title contenders again. I want to see Pau win a championship to silence his critics. He's been playing well as of late that's why the Lakers are winning.<br>  <br>  :D he's also cute.|`|y51Vt8NZaa	dude does have game.. he can shot the mid range he does have post moves and can rebound.. on the defense hes weak.. hes soft and if u get a player who plays bigger gasol can get taken out the game quick and no one 7 foot should be a non factor n da game at any point.. u dont get 100 percent from him every game.. dats y he got traded  thats why ppl knock him and thats y in da finals he looked like a kid scared to play wit the big dogs|`|62fANe2Baa	When his career is done, he will have a jersey hanging up in the Staples Center.

IITnJjAjaa	Training programme. Because it's sprinting i advise you don't do this training on concrete. If you have a track nearby great! Otherwise sand, dirt or grass is much better than concrete as concrete has no shock-absorption what-so-ever and may damage your legs<br>  <br>  These sprinting technique drills can be performed in this order or alternatively focus on just 3-4 drills. There is no need to perform multiple sets and repetitions.<br>  <br>  Raise Knees: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest<br>  Sprint 10 meters concentrating on raising knees as higher than normal. Jog for 10 meters and then sprint for 10 meters and rest.<br>  <br>  Fast Knee Pick Ups: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest<br>  Jogging on the spot raise your knees to waist height while emphasising arm action. Move forward 10 meters with this action concentrating on the number of ground contacts rather than how fast you cover the distance. Try to get as many ground contacts as possible.<br>  <br>  Flicks: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest<br>  While sprinting over 10 meters concentrate on flicking your heels up to touch your butt.<br>  <br>  Leg Speed: 60 meters<br>  This is a normal sprint over 60 meters except all of your focus should be on your legs. Try to gauge the optimum leg speed for you by taking different stride lengths to see which yields the best results.<br>  <br>  Skipping: 40 meters<br>  <br>  High Hops: 3 x 40 meters<br>  Bound from one foot to the other. The action is similar to skipping except your are trying to gain as much height as possible and stay in the air for as long as possible. Remember to recover fully between attempts.<br>  <br>  Elbow Drive: 40 meters<br>  Sprint for 40 meters concentrating on driving your elbow in a straight line. Keep your elbows flexed at right angles while keeping your arms relaxed.<br>  <br>  The best advice i can give you, is to join an athletics club where a specially qualified coach will train you to completely thrash all the other boys in you year. Good luck and i hope you win!<br>  <br>  Oh sorry just read your question again! Heres some tips! <br>  <br>  **It's all about arm action and leg strides. Practice bounding with huge strides, or even skipping as high as you can. Swing your arms hip to lip; ideally, your elbows should be shoulder high when you swing back.<br>  <br>  **The first few meters are key: a strong, explosive takeoff, with short, quick steps. Push off the ground hard. Or your starting blocks, if you're on a track. Work on getting a great deal of muscular strength in your legs and your core (abdominal, pectoral, trapezius, etc) muscles strong and big, which can be done by doing fewer repetitions with heavier weights (if you were training for long distance you'd work out for endurance and would do light weights with tons of reps.)<br>  <br>  <br>  **Watch professional sprinters for technique, etc. A lot of it is natural but there are some aspects of sprinting you can train for.|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	Just whack the 100 m again and again and again and again and again.|`|2EJoU2S4aa	keep practising run around your block a few times its what i do when i have a big race coming up it really helps me!|`|vXkPUOWdaa	eat beans they give u gas which makes you throttle onward brotha!!!
IITnJjAjaa	When you are sprinting you should be on the ball of foot/toes at all times - feet pointing forward straight down the lane. <br>  <br>  With toes turned up - bring foot down in a claw action with a ball of foot/toe strike on the track vertically below the knee - pull the ground under you into a full rear leg extension - (elbow drive assisting the whole action)<br>  <br>  - The back of your foot shouldn't touch the ground. There's no way you can sprint running flat footed. you mostly push off with the ball of your feet. Flat footed - to run most efficiently you need to keep as much forward momentum as possible. this means you want to land on you toes (when sprinting) with your foot already starting its backward motion. when you land flat footed you are slowing yourself down slightly on each step. <br>  <br>  If you run flat footed, your foot is taking too much time on the ground. If you run on the balls of your feet, you are lighter and able to move forward more quickly.<br>  <br>  ^^ lots of different resources say practically the same thing as my idea|`|isf5gDbmaa	I'm a sprinter in high school, and i run the 100m, 200m,400m,4x400m relay.  Sprinters need to run on the balls of thee feet ( toes).  You can practice by walking around the house on you toes, and you can also go to a running shoe store( running gear) to get spikes to help you run on your toes.  When you run on your toes, it really helps you pick up the speed.  It takes time and practice, but it pays off.|`|1UID5JtNaa	Your time will improve if you can learn to run the 100m on the balls of your feet.  One trick is to practice running barefoot- you'll never land heel first.  Once you reach max speed, your lead foot should be striking ground directly under hips, not out front.|`|IWyBAa0uaa	The person who said that it's ok to land on your heel is WRONG. Trust me you'll be way faster by staying on your toes the entire time it's not that long. I run the 200m and 300m with my toes the entire time. You won't find it very hard, good luck and godspeed.|`|2EJoU2S4aa	my heels always touch the ground when i sprint and i have no trouble sprinting!<br>  it would seriously hurt your toes too!<br>  you should run toe heel and youll be fine so yes your heel does touch the ground!|`|PMhJVdN8aa	You should run on the balls of your feet|`|xbqq3cvgaa	Have you got spikes?? The spikes are on the frontbit of the shoe and nowhere else because you are meant to use them to stab into the ground for you to gain speed. What im trying to say is you are meant to run on the balls of your feet not your toes not your whole foot. This will give you a better explosive method of sprinting therefore giving you a more of a push.<br>  Hope ive helped! x|`|6dABtJ1Xaa	yes it will slow u down. im a short distnace runner and i run on my toes. it doesnt hurt at all, u jst have to get use to it but after a while it will go away and u do run faster when u run on ur toes.|`|hf93gjK9aa	I ran long distance in high school. I remember the short distance runners would run on their toes. I always ran heel to toe, I heard that running heel to toe will slow down a short distance runner.
OppuEFVzaa	You can use them for jogging too. Jogging is not as aggressive sport as tennis. If you want you can use something lighter for jogging.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	I would buy running shoes for jogging/running.  The Barricade V were made for tennis movement, with extra support and weight.  Even the soles were made to give you traction on tennis courts.  Running shoes are lighter and were built specifically for running forward.  I'd recommend getting a pair of running shoes in addition to your tennis shoes.  You notice a huge difference. <br>  <br>  Here are some asics running shoes to consider:<br>  <a href="http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/Running-Shoes_Women/Asics/p1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/...</a>|`|sTyRRAeJaa	yeah although you could use them for jogging, I'd just buy a pair of running shoes.  Since the barricades don't have as much cushioning as running shoes, your knees and legs will probably feel better in the long run with a separate pair.|`|87BjduXvaa	I have them and i use them<br>  for tennis and running, should be fine|`|UbI85Ypvaa	save your money, don't even get barricade V's...

He could have gotten more. He kicked a guy from behind! It was a violent play. That's the type of play you get atleast 3 games. What are you guys complaining about?  If that happended in the Mexican league he would have gotten a similar castigo.|`|WCf9V0ZNaa	thats sounds fair...    he kicked him on purpose and got what he deserved...|`|SvNcWfdJaa	ya its fair  maybe he will learn to be more disciplined|`|7Xridrxaaa	haha well it was kinda idiotic for him to do some ish like that. Maybe he did deserve it. That will teach him not to do it again|`|LAdeGGGFaa	damn that sucks.

61itEiq4aa	Fillet both sides of the fish off. slice the rib bones off. Now you have a fillet with no bones that you can see. There is a strip of bones running perpendicular to the fillet starting from the head side. You can feel them with your finger. They run about 1/3 of the way down the fillet. Make a "v" cut and remove the strip of bones. Now it is boneless.|`|O9FojdEMaa	both one and two are correct i concur.|`|QC2NozBkaa	After the trout is cooked, just use a fork on either side along the spine to pull meat away from the bones.  You may get one or two ribs in the meat but it should be pretty much intact and bone free.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	answer 1 is partially right, after you(seperate) the meat from the back with a fork...grab by the tail, and gentley pull away the meat by pulling with your fork from tail towards the head area,...do that on both sides!|`|AA11466629	fillet it correctly and you don't have to worry about bones

AA12243350	currently there are bills pending in 7 states to that effect.

But whith the most anti gun administration ever elected in office now, we can expect all kinds of these types of bills.  shoot safe|`|UJmfDAI9aa	Yes and it's a load of crap. They've been trying to get coded ammo out for years, and fail every time.

Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."  Thomas Jefferson    So who will get the criminals who illegal have, obtain, use, carry guns to turn in the illegal ammo if they are not willing to not use their illegal weapons and do illegal acts.?????????|`|AA12274507	No that is untrue...in my state anyway.|`|xOReEw6Waa	They have the technology to do the actual tracking, heck they have the technology to identify every package of powder, every bag of fertilizer (manure included), they have the technology to track everything--if it was needed and cost effective and didn't infringe upon the rights of people. I can go and buy ammo by just walking into a store, they don't ask for ID, and I don't have to pay with a credit card. I can buy a gun with just my ID, it isn't registered, but the store keeps a record of it's sales because that is federal law. I don't have to register my old weapon, my old powder or my old bullets. I have friends who have thousands of rounds of ammo---you go tell them it's illegal as of June 30th!   Do you really think Americans would put up with the nonsense of this crap. We'll end up like the poor Brits and have to register out pocket knives next! I would hate to try and be re-elected if I were a politician supporting this asinine concept.

AiyRv4Kraa	Kung Fu. Yes yes, Kung fu.    They teach you about all of the Chinese fighting weapons and those are also on the list. A lot of fun.|`|8RCOlWdMaa	Why? I am guessing from your question that you are fairly young and immature. Martial arts are skills which go beyond just learning to use a particular weapon or learning to 'fight'. If that's all you want, then a MA class is not what you are looking for. You would find that there is a lot more to MA and you would soon give up and it takes years to become  proficient.    Remember, snipa, live by the sword, die by the sword. Take up MA to learn and develop yourself confidently - that's your best weapon.

The best place to get them is online. Second to that you can physically go to the big name gyms (I train at Legends, so I would just go down to the gym), and buy a pair of their board shorts. Otherwise, just go on Amazon.com or google "MMA shorts", and there is a TON of stuff.

RsTm8uUlaa	This is what my team does:    We work primarily on our legs. Most of your strength comes from you legs. We run stairs, squats, run laps, jump rope, and run sprints. We start by running laps for ten minutes, we then run sprints for ten minutes, then we run stairs for ten minutes. Next, be take a water break and then play "the water" game. This is where the squats come in. You hold to glasses of water in each hand. You stand on the front of your feet. You squat at a 90 degree angle. Hold the two glasses in front of you. Hold for one minute. Each minute counts as one out. If you mess up, it's an error and you restart. You stand back up straight after ever minute. We play between 3-7 innings (9-21 minutes). Don't spill the water! Next we do pick-ups. You squat, stand up, shuffle to the left, squat, stand up, shuffle to the right, and squat. We do 100 of these. And lastly, we jump rope. We do 600 skips.    If you want to work your arms, work the triceps.    Don't forget to stretch or you won't be able to move the next day. Before AND after you workout.|`|wvKSHbKuaa	stretches, definitely. ur legs and ur back. if u sit with ur legs spread in a "V" and u touch ur right leg with ur left hand, and lean to the left  and touch ur left toe with ur right hand, it stretches both. and vica versa.

hfH8c1LWaa	on a quad, the best thing to do is take a foot or feet off the pegs and place them or the back bar. quads are a lot heavier, so u really need to pull ur weight back and this helps (especially if ur new to wheelies or u have a small quad) once u get the front up, its a matter of throttle and brake control, throttle gets the front higher, and brakes get the front lower. just play with the feel of it and dont go too fast, start from a stationary position.<br>  <br>  and where a helmet dammit!|`|dWwrZs6Aaa	you ride on the back wheel if its a moterbike and the back two wheels if its a quad|`|zzvDybEiaa	Very carefully, and with a helmet!

LIKkt8djaa	You could definitely use the 147, IF it's only going to be a jibstick cause that's an ultra short freestyle deck which will be good for jibbing but if you're thinking of even riding around the mountain with the thing than go for the 152. Otherwise the 147 will turn out nicely for you as a jibstick.

AA10976536	As others have said: get a stick (for now), and join a class. Practice swords are actually a good idea, as they flow through the air differently than sticks do.<br>  <br>  Personally, I study Escrima, and we do lots of stick, knife, and bladework. As others have posted above, look for the names of "Arnis", "Escrima", "Kali", or FMA (Fillipino Martial Arts). Most of these systems cover some sort of shortsword and/or knife work.<br>  <br>  Other things you could study:<br>  <br>  1. Western Fencing - this is very much a combative sport. However, Like MMA, it can teach a lot of solid fundamentals for a more applied style: rhythm, timing, accuracy, focus, and so on. Look for fencing clubs in your area.<br>  <br>  2. The Society for Creative Anachronisms (the SCA). These are the folks that dress up in plate armor and put on Reinessance Fairs. You can learn a form of swordsmanship from them, which is essentailly a re-creation of mideval European swordsmanship; they also do fencing, staffwork, and polearms.|`|oTb67zNYaa	for starters I would suggest a fma fillipeno martial art Kali, arnis, Bastion, or Escriima also to get a quality sword I would suggest this website<a href="http://www.sword-buyers-guide.com/knight-sword.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sword-buyers-guide.com/knight...</a> they do abusive tests on swords to tell the good ones from the not so good also I would suggest that you use a wooden sword or at least  a non sharpened one for he first few years before the live edge bbbbbbbb edit I agree with bujinkan that Kendo should be avoided personally I avoid laido on the basis that they train never to touch swords Edit(against one another) but that is a difference of opinion|`|c73AAq22aa	will  you really need to go and get into a schol that teaches sword fighting then get information from them that bestest way<br>  to do it|`|cJeS3ARxaa	yah practice|`|LUnscegvaa	Join a Iaido or Kendo club.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|3BGJETHYaa	Kevin has a pretty good answer.  I'm a big fan of western fencing, since I do it competitively.  The way to get started in that is to find a local fencing club.  If you are in college, your school probably has one.  If not, there is probably one locally.  USFA has a list of affiliated clubs/schools, probably in your area.<br>  <br>  <br>  The sca is one organization that studies weapons, although ARMA is a little bit better at this.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Join a school. You can't practice if you don't know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Join something along the lines of Kenjutsu, Iaido, Iaijutsu, Shinkendo, Bikenjutsu. Do NOT join Kendo. Kendo is more of a sport.

LnJjS8BRaa	Probably Armageddon... Haven't tried vs. DCU yet though so I might have to get back to you.     If you aren't asking about a series of video games, then all i can say is that there are different forms of combat for different purposes... nuclear war is pretty good for flattening everything and everyone in a given area... not so good for using that area after wards.    If you're asking martial arts styles, then really no one style is "the best." Everything comes down to the skill of the individual and the quality of the instructor.

oFiStmkGaa	A fin (and we could see the tale fin as wll) came up out the water behind me and a mate at Jeffreys Bay as it was getting dark, the shark turned towards and that was when we hauled ourselves as quick as we could to shore. The shark must have been about 2-3m in size, I gather from the distance between the front fin and tail fin.<br>  <br>  At my local beach some 200km away from JBay, a guy in my school who I knew (about 2 years younger than me) got bitten by a Great White and he never saw the beach, they say the bite mark stretched from the rib bone down to his knee. He lost so much blood he died while riding with the white-water into shore. Another friend of mine was sitting a few feet away to that guy in the water when suddenly he saw a huge shark come out of the water and bite the guy.<br>  <br>  And the year before that another guy (not a friend-friend but someone I know well at my local beach) got bitten on his thigh and ankle, but he survived.<br>  <br>  These sharks were in the the 4m, maybe 5m range.<br>  <br>  Both shark attacks happened at the same Bay about about 1km distance between them.|`|CyWEam38aa	i was at mavericks and some guy 20 ft away got his back ripped open by a shark it was really creepy <br>  i couldn't surf for a week after wards|`|U3KAgO0baa	I saw one in a tank one time... It looked at me funny, I could'nt sleep for a week!|`|xhPKkkELaa	It was while we were chumming for the great white off Amity Long Island when the monster leaped out of the water and I said, "We need a bigger boat!"....Oh, that wasn't me, that was JAWS.<br>  <br>  To be honest, probably the closest call I ever had was shark fishing with some pals who were used to sport fishing. Most of the guys were used to sport fishing, and not used to dealing with sharks. Our first one on that night was about a seven foot Dusky. The guys gaffed it and flipped it on board like it was a marlin, with a bunch of guys standing around on the fantail. Brother shark was none to happy about being caught and the smart ones of the bunch made for the flying bridge, fast. Those guys learned the hard way to kill them while they are still in the water.<br>  <br>  My pals and I caught 4 nice 5/6 foot blue sharks overnight from a pier, fifty yards from where we normally surf in the daytime. I was there when another buddy of mine caught a nice 6/7 foot hamerhead there. Although in the daytime, I only remember one shark in the surf at that break. And he didn't particularly scare me.<br>  <br>  I have paddled out of the water a dozen or so times, when larger bait fish start jumping. When big mullet and the like start leaping, I know brother shark is down there feeding and it's time to go. Same thing when a school of bunker (menhaden) moves through and the birds start working the edges of the school. That means that something down there is eating fish for lunch. If it's dolphins, you'll see them surface to blow, if not, it's brother shark.<br>  <br>  I was diving one day when my friend and I spotted a fairly large shark. Couldn't tell for sure what kind it was, we were only in about 40 feet of water, but when he started making big lazy circles around where we were, we were back in the boat in record time.<br>  <br>  Aound 1972, I was on a LSD (landing Ship Dock) and we flooded the well deck for 'swim call" and while the stern gate was down, a 10 foot hammerhead made his way on. That created quite a stir, but he was quickly dispatched by a Gunner's mate with an M16. The rumor was that the cooks filet'ed him, and he was the filler in our fish cake sandwiches for the next week. Not that I haven't eaten some great shark! I like it smoked or broiled best.<br>  <br>  One friend of mine was victim of a documented shark bite on LBI, New Jersey in the late 70's, but it was resolved with a few stitches.<br>  <br>  I guess I have been "attacked" lots of times. Sharks are tough to kill and strong as heck. Ever try to get the hook out of one when he was still alive? Ouch!<br>  <br>  I gave up shark fising as a professional courtesy. I won't eat sharks anymore, so they won't eat me.<br>  <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Sharks/ISAF/ISAF.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Sharks/ISA...</a>|`|KkkugCJ0aa	i was fishin in the bay and i caught a little shark..i tried to plier my hook out cuz i was runnin low on tackle and it nearly bit my fingers off..as far as surfin goes ive never seen a shark out

The only problem would be i would have the 1972 dolphins in the top 6 or 7. The 1976 raiders i would also disagree with. They lost to the patriots 48-17 for the only loss of the season finishing 13-1. When they got to the playoffs they barely beat the patriots and won on a lousy hometown call. The 1991 Redskins would be in the top 5 they were very dominate and even with Mark Rypien as quarterback who is far from an all time great.|`|U3KAgO0baa	I'll do top 3 of each...

AA11760438	He doesnt have the accuracy? WTF. this has to be from someone who only sees the bad plays and bad games Russell has had.. Accuracy? havent you seen the tight bullets he throws between 2 defenders.. <br>  Its not his fault he cant find no one open in less than 3sec.(because thats how long, K.Harris would pass protect him)except for Zach Miller.<br>  <br>  BUST?LOL.. the same people who once Said, Marcus couldnt run.. and same people who said Asomugha was a bust, 2yrs ago..lol.. <br>  <br>  Russell will be fine. He needs weapons.. <br>  <br>  Take away, Wayne and Harrison from Manning, and give him a 3sec. Oline and you will see alot of similarities.. how can you throw every pass accurate when you are being chased after 2-3 sec. from the snap?|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Jamarcus Russell is not consistent himself. He doesn't appear to be able to make reads before or after the snap. He is not accurate. He missed his first year so this is really his second year coming up. He does not appear to be a leader in the huddle or off the field. He also doesn't appear to put forth the effort in the off-season that most QB's have to.<br>  <br>  Size and arm strength are good physical qualities, but QB's have to have good mental qualities, too. He has to be more involved in the play calling and choosing audibles. He has to show that he has knowledge of this offense, more than anyone else. Russell has not shown any of this. Most offenses and coaches are not looking for a cannon that throw 60-80 yards, but a field general that can manipulate the defense so that the players at the skill position can get open to make plays.|`|dCbIHBpGaa	Raiders fan also and I agree with you there. For most of the time he has been in the league he has been behind an offensive line that you have to be a brave man to stand behind with that poor protection with nobody other than Miller to pass to on a consistent basis. Its still too early to tell but he made good progress towards the end of last season when the O Line improved and Schilens and Higgins emerged as guys to pass to along with McFadden out of the back field. The smart money is on us taking a offensive tackle or a WR in the first round of the draft so that should help us too. I think we should go better than 5-11 next time out.|`|U3KAgO0baa	I think jamarcus will be a good QB, but im not sure he will prove 2 be good enough 2 justify the first overall pick...<br>  But i agree, if they get him Jeremy maclin, and maybe anothe youn WR later in the draft of or a second teir FA WR he can show his skills.<br>  P.S. i hear they will cut both Ronald Curry, And javon Walker soon, so they will need alot of help at the WideOut...|`|UgnMjtYDaa	The Raiders coaching  is not that great first of all, they also need a better O-line, They need Plaxico Burress and someone to rush the passer. Jamarcus could be real good because he has a cannon.|`|NzbJ0Jvkaa	he needs 2 get more experience and betta accuracy. hes only got 1 whole season under his belt he needs 2 jus get his accuracy down and he will b a good qb|`|aaKYVMk2aa	He doesn't have the accuracy of Tom Brady and he sure as hell doesn't have the brain of Peyton Manning's.<br>  <br>  To put it short, he doesn't have any accuracy and he doesn't know how to read defense and change accordingly either.<br>  <br>  And no racism intended, for an african-american, he sure can't run.

ZzXxRLWcaa	They'll probably trade Nady first...    Swisher is more flexible and can play all three outfield positions and first base. Plus Nady is coming off an "up" year and may have more trade value.    Dont get too down on swisher though... he's a grinder, a gamer. We've been missing that on the Yankees, he could end up like Brosius... who if you remember wasnt thought of all that highly, but won games for us.    But my lineup    1. Damon LF (L)  2.

qF1oQG7Xaa	Yes he does.<br>  He was an 8 time Cruiserweight champion, and when that division was taken away, where did he go? The IC title or US title aren't right for him, so he went for the World Title shot after winning Royal Rumble, which winning that proved he was a good wrestler, then he won at Wrestlemania to be World Heavyweight champion, which he lost quickly to Giants like Khali. He nearlly won it again at No Way Out, but was cheated out it by Edge. He has been unlucky, so I think he does deserve another shot!|`|8ivnzNi5aa	At least once, before he joins Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, et.al., in that great ring in wherever wrestlers go when they assume room temperature.|`|JiCfYfLraa	he is very overrated in my opinion. i agree with you he really isnt championship material anymore. he cant hang with the big dogs anymore like how he used to on smackdown. he hasnt even won ic or tag team gold since he been on raw. let him get the ic title first and then we can talk about him gettting the wwe champion or heavyweight. but until then no he doesnt deserve it and thats the truth.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Yes, he is one of the most talented wrestler today.<br>  <br>  I really hate when he become the World Champion in 2006 by defeating the most talented wrestler in the world, Kurt Angle.

8b96e0549932f6f7dc7802568aa00011aa	I applaud you for trying something new even though you're afraid.  You are an excellent example of what it means to live a full life.<br>  <br>  I just started basic group ice skating lessons a few weeks ago, and I'm a woman in my early 30's.  During the first two weeks I held onto the wall for dear life, and my instructor encouraged it.  "Safety first," she said.  I came to the rink a few times a week to practice and only let go of the wall until I felt safe.  <br>  <br>  As a fellow beginner, here are some tips I can offer you:  <br>  <br>  1)  Hold onto the wall as much as you need.  It's there for your safety.  <br>  <br>  2)  Remember your stance:  Always bend slightly at the knees.  It makes all the difference when it comes to balance.  Keep your eyes up, look straight ahead, and put your free hand out in front of you for stability while the other holds onto the wall.  This is the stance you should always maintain anytime you're on the ice.  Don't fall into the trap of looking at your skates.  You'll fall more often if you do that.  <br>  <br>  3)  To start, keeping your eyes up and without looking at your skates, march in place.  <br>  <br>  4)  When you feel comfortable marching in place, hold onto the wall and march yourself forward only as much as you feel comfortable.  <br>  <br>  5)  Eventually, you'll feel comfortable marching forward.  When that happens, then try letting go of the wall for, say, one set of marching forward.  Be sure and put both arms out in front of you for stability when you do this.  (EDITED TO ADD:  Putting your arms out in front of you also ensures some protection of your head and chest should you fall.)  Then grab the wall again.  When you can march in place for a good stretch without grabbing the wall, you can try what are called scooter pushes.  <br>  <br>  6)  Scooter pushing:  With one skate remaining still, bend slightly at the knees, maintain good posture, and with both arms out in front of you, push off with your other skate.  If you're right-handed, you may want to start by pushing off with the right skate and keeping the LEFT one still.  Remember, don't move the skate that's supposed to remain still.  When you feel comfortable with that, keep the RIGHT one still and push off with the left one.  If you find one foot more difficult than the other to push off with, use your toe pick to help propel you forward.  Practice scooter pushes with equal time devoted to each skate.<br>  <br>  7)  Once you're comfortable with doing scooter pushes away from the wall, you're ready to skate.  Using the same stance described above, push off with one skate and in the very next stroke push off with the other skate.  Practice doing this regularly.  Over time, you'll gain confidence.<br>  <br>  Beyond this, you may want to consider taking group ice skating lessons.  They are relatively inexpensive, a lot of fun, and you'll learn how to fall SAFELY and how to get back up safely.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this, and happy ice skating!|`|91be33a93393b2cfe2ea14aae38ab03daa	First of all, to calm your mind:<br>  Cutting your fingers: Only high level figure skaters do this becuse they grab their blades for difficult positions/maneuvers. <br>  Brain damage: Even if you somehow fell on your head, the chance of getting brain damage is extremely, extremely low. Don't worry about it. I've been figure skating for over ten years now and  have not seen a single person get brain damage. And I just want to re-emphasize the point that most beginner skaters won't even face the possibility of falling on their head hard enough. And if you want to avoid faling on your head, I'd avoid reckless skaters, holding hands with people when they skate, and letting go of the wall beore you're ready.<br>  Cutting yourself with the toepick: Like cutting your fingers, this won't happen unless you do difficult skating moves. I personally have kicked myself in the leg with my toepick a few times, to be honest, but it ws doing high-level jumps. Please, do not worry.<br>  Holding onto the edge is compeltely fine. I'd say 7 out of 8 people start like that. It's actually much safer, too. And from your concerns, I think you'd appreciate that. <br>  There is no such thing as falling too much. When I just started skating at age 5, all I ever did was fall. But my determination to get up was what told coaches that I would be an excellent figure skater. Furthermore, all figure skaters fall. So what's o say a beginner won't fall. The only reason some people don't fall is because some people are more natural at it from the start, they are only doing really easy things, and they have been doing it for a long time.<br>  Practice, practice, practice. There is no shame in using "walkers" or holding onto to wall. Just because you fall or use assistance to skate doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.|`|a8EndhDmaa	i figure skated for 8 years before and after school i only had one accident with a skate Someone was doing a sit spin i was not paying attention and her blade hit me leg <br>  i had aCompetitionn the next and i won (needless to say i was okay) <br>  the chances are slim just pay attention and remember take off your skate guards before you go on the ice :)|`|L6jfhxgvaa	don't you worry about those accidents, hun. the probability of those happening is less than 1%.<br>  if you must, hang on the the edge/railings. pull yourself forward to get the feel of what it is like to move on an almost frictionless surface.<br>  <br>  keeping your legs stiff and still ain't gonna do you any good.<br>  <br>  place abou 65 - 75% of your body weight forward to keep centre of gravity forward. Bend your knees a little for stability...<br>  <br>  don't walk like a penguin or a duck. just don't walk. you're there to skate. so, give yourself a slight push. Imagine a stretched letter 'S'. <br>  <br>  One at a time.<br>  <br>  Confidence is the only way forward. Do not be afraid to fall.<br>  If you don't do anything because you're afraid, then perhaps skating is not yours to play. OBSERVE others. Replicate. Muster up your confidence. Put it to practice! little by little, you'll be fine.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	aw honey dont worry about that ive been skating for six years and none of that has ever happened to me or any of my skate friends<br>  <br>  but dont rush into it, go slow and work on the basics before going and trying a waltz or anything, it takes time soon you wont be falling at all and will be working on your axel
ZKikquiOaa	well here's the thing, with all the jacket on you, if you fall it won't hurt much at all.  I used to worry about hitting that hard ice, until I've fallen a few times.  That first fall was the hardest, I actually did the whole cartoonish thing where my feet went forward and my body stayed back, I started doing the high kicks like those Radio City Rockettes, then I went up in the air, and fell flat on my back.  Thought it was gonna hurt, but it didn't, not much anyway.  Then I fell a few more times after that, but the rest of the times I fell forward.<br>  <br>  Just pretend you're riding a bicycle,  both hands holding the steering handles to the front, legs slightly bent at the knees and your weight slightly forward.  Do that until you get used to the ice.  It took me about an hour of doing that until I can stand straight up and maintain balance, I think it also helped me that I've roller skate before.

It's best to call them up and see. You can check for local pool halls at the third link or typing in billiards on any map service.|`|MHo2SGPRaa	Pretty much what the others say.

My friend saw a flyer with a tear off and just called and next thing you know he was in a league. I myself have been practicing a little before I join.

04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	doing nothing probably saved you getting seriously hurt or killed.youve avoided the situation for now but you need to find a way to rectify it in the mean time.|`|SpcYCBndaa	u did the right thing for now  however, you may want to go home by other means......walk with someone/group.....get picked up by car.....or something else that will keep you safe.|`|42SDcehQaa	Well can you tell us the reason why they're trying to beat you up? Do they know that you're a black belt? Oh, and I'm sorry for the guys saying that avoiding fights are always the right thing to do but there are some times that won't solve the conflict even if you keep escaping or tell on someone. I can't tell what's best since I have no idea except there's about 20 guys trying to gang up on you and beat you up. But they're going to come again. Telling the teacher won't work since it's on your way home so maybe like beat up all the guys that were trying to beat you up one by one or maybe just the one that planned this whole thing. Or just take the car of the bus home.|`|gBO908P6aa	Don't let someone follow you home, especially 20 of them!!  I'm not certain what the meaning of tunnel is but don't go through any confined areas where you have no space to run or maneuver.  Plus you're just ONE man against 20 of them.  You're lucky all 20 didn't turn you into silly putty.  You probably are a decent karateka but that's far too many of them and the first rule of a fight is avoid it and outwit the opponent.  It's not about proving how good you are, it's about getting home in one piece.  Tell an authority about it, stir up the incident and hopefully that will rattle them in the minds and make them think twice about doing anything further.    Edit:  Sorry my grasp on British slang isn't all that wonderful.  Ok tunnel as in an underpass....yeah that's not good.  Find a better place to walk, have your eyes on the back of your head and don't let these bums follow you home.  You really don't want them to know where you live.  Use your head and always stay one step ahead of them.  Good luck mate.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Yea good work, you avoided a fight. Only if you can't do anything else should you take one out, that will more than likely scare the other ones if they aren't used to that stuff. If you have no other choice take out the one they are following around, delete him from the picture and there's no point to their following him anymore.  Good job, you did exactly what you should have done.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	You're going to take on 20 guys?  I don't think so.  Avoid this a$$hole, or catch him alone sometime and work him over.      When I was in junior high I discovered that wonderful formula.  That the bully kids came in packs but weren't ALWAYS in packs.  I would avoid them while they had back up, and then catch them alone later.  Occasionally there would be a fight, but usually they were downright reasonable when it was just me and them.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	either avoid the situation, or call the police.  you are not going to be able to take 20 people.|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	I think you did the right thing by not retaliating against them. Someone who is trained and can kill someone by hitting them in the right spot might wind up in more trouble than the actual person who started the fight.    Contact your local authorities and let them know. Additionally file a police report this way their is a record.     I'm sure you know of ways to bring someone down without physically hurting them.|`|nfyYh8PSaa	I'm a black belt as well, and my philosophy is three attacks, you die. Three punches or three organized assualts same rules. hopefully its just an empty threat but if its not don't get cocky. with 20 other people with or without weapons you want to get out of there asap. Good luck|`|1ANZuNgRaa	yes, you did the right thing because they could like GET EVEN MADDER and BRING MORE FRIENDS NEXT TIME and then you would be screwed. best thing to do is to call the cops, get a taser, pepper spray, take a different route, or get a ride from a friend. oh and call the po-po (cops)|`|newfiOPOaa	You did the right thing.  At least you had the opportunity to walk away.  But I do know how you feel.  Since they are still threatening you the time may come when you have no other choice but to fight.  If their is an leader or the loudest guy in the bunch, single him out and see if he will talk to find out what he and his group want.   If he wont talk then you may have to fight.  Be prepared.  Wear an athletic cup just in case of a low blow to the crotch.  If they have weapons you may have to run like hell!|`|5RNAfpptaa	yeah beat em up cuz they sound like a bunch of jerks. so um i hope this helps.|`|8hoi0xVqaa	u learned in karate to only use it in self defense....but its hard when u have to fight a big group....they are cowards cuz they need someone to help them fight but i suggest u find a different way home to avoid a serious situation|`|8PBA3kc2aa	What you did was the smart thing to do. There's no shame in being smart. Had you been stupid enough to take on 4 basketball teams(that's what 20 guys amount to), then doubts about whether you did the right thing would be the least of your worries, not with hospital bills or worse, funeral bills to worry about.
LoFMN7Sgaa	I know a friend that dislocated her knee but then it popped back into place. she also did it in cheerleading. but that would be all i know|`|zvq3uiB6aa	My guess would be either a barely dislocated patella that popped itself back in, or (more likely), you partially tore your ASL.|`|0LEFco9xaa	Its hard to say what it could be. There are many things that can happen to knees when they get injured. I had surgery on my knee a while ago because of a birth defect that didn't bother me till late in my life. You could have done something to the tendons in your knee the ligaments or something else. Another thing I can tell you is your knee will never be the same so be prepared to deal with some sort of pain for the rest of your life. Its not that bad pain killers and therapy work great for it. Hope that helps a little.
xRZ1PRZwaa	Honestly, I think the Rock is the sexiest man in the world (other than my husband, of course).    The Rock is a big guy naturally, and has just a perfect proportion of muscles and thickness to suit that size.    Too much muscle, for me, would have been Arnold S. back in his heyday - no comparison between that and the Rock.    I hope this helps!

Even if you make a pair or Shawn Michael and Triple H, Shawn will come as Stephine. I miss the old wrestlers like Rock and Brock Lesnar.

They'd played so well all year (bar the Collingwood game) it's still a mystery why players like Mooney and Ottens choked on the big day. I think they finally cracked under the pressure, which is understandable considering what was expected of them.<br>  <br>  They will learn from the mistake and make 2009 a blistering season. They will finish clear first again, they'll finally have a key forward in the form of Tom Hawkins or Scott Simpson (most likely Hawkins, though) and their miserly defence will be at their best with Harry Taylor bulking up over the pre-season.<br>  <br>  With new rules hopefully being introduced to squash out deliberate rushed behinds, Hawthorn's weaker defence will be shown up week in, week out. If anything happens to Buddy during the season (injury, suspension) the Hawks will look very mediocre, very fast.|`|JhvW9jFRaa	Crows i hope but that's a big hope..<br>  Fair to say that the Hawks or the Cats will be there again but as long as Collingwood and Port don't win it then that's ok.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Kangaroos or Bulldogs!|`|bEGrmfJhaa	BULLDOGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7h8ffGY9aa	isn't it obvious...HAWTHORN!!!! :D lol

Though the Rays were last years AL champs and I don't think I've heard a peep out of any of them.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Whats the problem with the Mets? I'll say one thing, they're not boring like the Dodgers.<br>  <br>  ...and, while we're on the subject, we ARE the team to beat!|`|nSSKixvCaa	I hope Braves or Marlins win this year so they both can Shut UP!!!!|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Of the 6 MLB divisions, I noticed some "bickering" in 4 of them.  If there's been any debate about whether somebody can unseat LAA in the AL West (in my opinion, the A's have a good shot this season, but I haven't caused any bickering... at least as far as I know) or the Cubs in the NL Central (I've gone as far as to say the Cubs have a cakewalk of a division, but I may have ired Cubs fans by forecasting yet another exit in the NLDS), I haven't seen it as of yet.<br>  <br>  As for the other divisions, there have been widespread debates over which AL Central team will finish with the best record (while acknowledging that it's a tight race among all 5 teams, I've chosen the Twins) and which NL West will do the same (while acknowledging that Manny Ramirez could change the complexion of the entire division, I've chosen the Diamondbacks in a Manny-free scenario).<br>  <br>  Your question was born from the debates among the NL East, although I have seen the Braves and Marlins sporadically thrown into some such debates (I think this is an important year for the Phillies to repeat, but only the Braves would surprise me among the teams I've just mentioned).<br>  <br>  Finally, the AL East.  I'm grateful that I haven't heard much (if anything) from the Rays' fan base (for the record, I used to like the Rays until the beginning of June), I haven't heard squat from the Orioles' fan base, and at least what I've heard from the Blue Jays' fan base has been respectful, but the rivalry between the Red Sox and Yankees knows no boundaries (which is sometimes, but not often, a good thing).<br>  <br>  We're still in February, and the season doesn't begin until April, so there's bound to be a lot more "bickering" in the AL Central, AL East, NL East, and NL West between now and then... and there may even be some "bickering" in the AL West (particularly if my view on the A's is shared by others) and NL Central (Brewers, Cardinals, and Reds fans might speak up between now and then... and there might even be the rare Astros fan involved) in that time.  If it irks you, all I can say to try to help is to find a "happy place" where you can tune it out.
zFTSg47waa	That's the ferrule. There are different ways they are attached. Usually, it's hollow and so some of the shaft wood runs up through the center. This part of the wood is called the tenon. It's usually glued to the ferrule. Sometimes, this is also threaded. The only way to remove this is with a lathe and then cutting away the ferrule from the outside.<br>  <br>  Another option is the reverse where the bottom of the ferrule has a screw that screws into the shaft. You could just cut this off then.<br>  <br>  But what are you going to try to do after you remove the ferrule?|`|y5TTkgFYaa	Firstly, yikes.  Trick is right about the removal part.  I'm not sure what kind of cue it is that you have, but I would strongly suggest that if you have any value to your shaft you do not do this yourself.  Judging by how you asked the question, obviously you do not have any experience in cue repair and will probably just end up ruining your shaft.  Now if it isn't a valued shaft and you are just trying to learn more about cue repair, I'd do some more research and maybe check out the AZ billiard forums.  Best of luck!

R5G9h2ygaa	Hahahaha. Thank you that is the greatest question I have ever read on this site, how could i say no with your justification that all rugby players are tall.<br>  horse racing (is jockeying a word?) makes you shorter as well<br>  Playing darts makes you a fatass<br>  Participating in porn films makes you well hung<br>  Being a polititian makes you more stupid (the higher the position the greater the effect)<br>  Being a baseball player makes you a steroid junkie....oh wait.<br>  Opened up a whole new way of looking at the world|`|IDBasYahaa	Only the locks, number 8 & blind slide flanker are the tall ones. Their the guys that normaly jump for the ball in the line out.<br>  <br>  They are naturaly tall. Rugby doesn't make you any taller, infact in the case of props, they actualy loose on average 7cm of hight over the course of their career. That's due to the impact collisions when packing a scrum.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Your tight three aren't all tall and normally the 8 and blindside breakaway are tall but that is it.|`|8SRjjYg4aa	Are you serious?<br>  No playing rugby does not make you taller.<br>  They do tend to pick taller people for the forwards and such.<br>  The Hooker and Props are basically of average height but stocky.<br>  And not all rugby players are tall.<br>  Look at Peter Stringer, who plays for Munster and Ireland, he is not tall and he is still a great player.<br>  <br>  The players who are picked for a team are chosen on their skill and not on their height as a major requirement.|`|nG4MfEbCaa	they choose the best tall guys for the forwards obviously, like tall guys in basketball|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Seriously?<br>  <br>  No, playing rugby doesn't make you tall.|`|VHB2JHmkaa	I'm pretty sure you don't get taller from playing rugby, but like some of the others said, its usually the taller guys that make the team<br>  <br>  If anything, you'll get shorter when you break your spine and they have to take some of it out ;)|`|2XprgugDaa	well normally its the taller people who are selected, cept mabye hookers who are usually no more than 6 foot.<br>  <br>  were big lads :)|`|ShNT5Mjhaa	My son plays wing, I believe, for his school team, and he's nearly hitting six foot.

AA12034449	sounds like a good way to get yourself shot.<br>  <br>  Try pointing your finger in your coat pocket... you will probably get shot... but the weapons charge wont stick.<br>  <br>  If you want a 15xt head to the local store and take a look.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Don't do that.  Robbery isn't funny, and you may get yourself shot in the process, fool.|`|TeNIStN1aa	If you have seen a real handgun and you have the ability to remain calm when anyone pulled a gun on you, it will look like a toy at very close range.<br>  <br>  If you pulled that big toy out and point it at someone with a CCW, you will probably be shot on the spot. It won't matter if you survive the incident or not, you will not receive any compensations because you are at fault. In another word, you asked for it.<br>  <br>  If someone saw you point that big toy at anyone and called the police, you will be charged and most likely be found guilty in court.<br>  <br>  If a police saw you do that from any distance, you will be either arrested or shot then arrested. Once again, you will be dragged to court if you survived the incident and you will be nailed for attempted armed robbery if you are very lucky. (There is a big difference between "armed" robbery and robbery.)<br>  <br>  If you somehow made local news because of this, your story will be broadcasted over and over again on both national TV and the internet for who knows how long. The world will watch your story and laugh their as$ off.<br>  <br>  By the way, your friend could drag you to court and ask for a hefty compensation for this if he/she chooses to. Also, if you are under aged, you will probably drag your parents into this mess and you will be blamed for life.<br>  <br>  PS: Think of another way to have some fun. Your idea is not creative and it doesn't even sound fun at all. However, that prank could end up pretty funny. Too bad you won't be the one who's laughing though.

I don't have a time on the 10, but I do have one on the 15 (1.11) and the half marathon (1.47).|`|IITnJjAjaa	I run 3 times a week because i am suffering from Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome and i really shouldn't be running at all but i love it too much! I do one sprint session a week which could be hill reps, 10x400m, i then do a distance run for example 7-8  miles and then maybe to a fartlek of around 4 miles which is really beneficial for my track races. I also sometimes just do a jog around to loosen up my muscles as they often get very tight. My best 10km is around 40 minutes, but i'm a 800m/1500m runner. I prevent getting more injuries by going seeing a physiotherapist and getting a sports massage to loosen tight knots and get the blood circulation going faster. I also ice my shins after running maybe have an ice bath sometimes. The best way to prevent injury is warm up and cool down after running and wear decent running shoes (asics!)|`|pkfZXcPCaa	I run 5x a week.

nfN7IZ4vaa	At least 2 or 3 days per week for around 2 or 3 hours every time you play. Also take into account that you need a coach or an experienced person either playing with you or watching you play. This is so that you are corrected every time you make mistakes so that you don't practice the wrong techniques etc. the coach or experienced player would just be like a guide to reinforce technique/footwork/movement and other aspects of the game.|`|BRTa5h7iaa	If you can, everyday. But most can't so try to at least get out there at least 4 times a week. With a total of about 8 hours. It's better to play less every day of the week than play a lot twice a week. If you play a little everyday, you build consistency. Obviously, in an ideal world, people could practice a lot everyday, but we can't. I get out about an hour five days a week and three hours over the weekend.|`|5BUWjFRxaa	First of all, make sure you practice every week at least once, twice or more if you want to be a serious player. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should practice an hour every other day? Or, if you have someone to play with (not the ball machine thing) then you can have loads of fun, so it can stretch out for hours!<br>  <br>  More is better, but don't push too hard.|`|sptrtwxlaa	Well to get into the sport I would say practice for at least 2 hours a day for at least 5 days a week. On 1 or 2 days you should play 3-4 hours. <br>  If you stop playing, you will definitly gradually lose your form no matter how much u practice. How long is "awhile" exactly?|`|bKwQyCEHaa	3 times a week 1 or 2 hour|`|dbdKFCELaa	about 4 times a week for a couple of hours would be fine :)<br>  its like riding a bike you dont really forget how to do it!|`|GNq2rmrNaa	it's fine to practice only a couple of days a week for a couple of hours, once you start playing again you will very quickly remember you're form or anything|`|7XLKNp5paa	It's better to practice everyday and for atleast 2 hours. Minimum of ateast 5 days a week is also fine.

You need to go outside and run around your neighborhood.  Do crunches, sit -ups, watch what you eat.

LFLflsWFaa	Because your body needs to be respected, you have to listen to it. It's your car, you have to take care of it. <br>  <br>  Maybe you are overworking yourself or maybe it's something mentally. Perhaps sprititually? Only you can know. If you can't train try get out a positive outlook. Go swimming, running, write out your creativity, take breakdancing, volunteer, teach someone something so you can learn more about yourself. If you want it to get better, you will.<br>  <br>  You have to listen because the answer is in front of you.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	The most likely problem is overtraining.  If you feel shakey and irritable too, and when you fall asleep it only takes about half a second to be asleep, then it's definitely overtraining.  Rest and more rest in this case.  <br>  <br>  It's good that you're taking supplements, but are you eating carbs within two hours of training?  If not, then your muscles aren't being replenished with glycogen.  Traditional things to eat after training are Clif bars, or oatmeal.  <br>  <br>  You might also want to skip all supplements except the multivitamin for a while and add back one at a time to see if one of those causes fatigue for you.  Try to find a sustained release multivitamin so you don't get a "rush/crash" after it's absorbed.  <br>  <br>  Also, drinking a sports drink or something with a small amount of sugar in it during practice will help your endurance and focus. Stay away from high sodium drinks, sodium is less necessary than people think.  What you need is small amounts of sugar. <br>  <br>  The best way to avoid injury is to add free weight training to your routine.  But start slow.  You wouldn't believe how easy it is to overdo this when you are starting out. <br>  <br>  What works for me is to make full range of motion movements with light weights, especially targeting the arms and shoulders (what hurts is the blocking in martial arts - it's hard on the shoulders and arms).  Don't do squats with weight until you can do 30 squats and barely break a sweat.  It can hurt your knees and you really need them healthy for martial arts.  Don't play through knee pain.  <br>  <br>  For now, more carbs, and more sleep.  And skip one training session a week until you feel better.  It will take about a week or two.|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	How often / hard are you training?  It sounds like you have the symptoms of over training.  I'd advise active rest (research, walking instead of running, training technique rather than hardcore stuff) or even complete rest for a week.  If no improvement - see a doctor.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	go see your Dr., and get a complete blood panel done.

You know, you can take too much of certain vitamins.|`|9b34fdb68fec11ae0483fcbdd1ab0368aa	alkalise your body, your symptoms are a sign of an acidic diet.<br>  its probably preferable if you stop your supplements for a week or two and maybe try live foods such as vegetables, especially green vegetables. see how you go. try to avoid any artificial food, sugars are a bad source of energy intake. Try to consume natural oils, natural oils such as Udo's oil or even those found in avacado's are a good source of energy and allow you to train for longer periods of time.<br>  <br>  If i were you i'd go get your body PH levels tested, if it proves that your too acidic than thats your problem. look it up in google.<br>  <br>  Alkalising has also many more benefits apart from energy increase.<br>  <br>  DRINK PLENTY OF WATER(4litres a day) and get some good rest.<br>  <br>  I dont know how familiar you are with a man called Stu Mittleman but he's an ultramarathon runner, he ran a 3,000 mile journey from San Diego to New York City in 56 days.

Try to remedy where you think that you might have a problem.  If you don't think that you are overdoing things or losing sleep go to the doctor and get some blood work.  These types of problems can be caused by metabolic problems like diabetes and hypoglycemia.  Sleep apnea can be another thing that causes lethargy and a lowered immune system.  The key though is to go to the doctor if something obvious does not put you on the right track.|`|GZwzacY8aa	sounds like you are not getting enough sleep nor the proper nutrition and you are probably over exerting your body|`|AA11101806	go to a doctor.  get a full panel of blood work.|`|ATh0ciALaa	ur prob pushing your self too hard go too a trainer and nutritionist|`|Bb8Ijj8xaa	what you need lad is a few days off and get a few pints down your neck and relax|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Make sure you're getting enough Vitamin D. Either take a supplement or spend more time in the Sun. Low Vitamin D levels can lead to fatigue and depression. It's also believed to contribute to the cause of cancer, diabetes, and other diseases.<br>  <br>  If you don't start feeling better after a week, make an appointment to see your doctor.

LOL. If this book your writing is a general public book you may want to consider toning it down just a little bit though as so the reader can grasp a slight concept on to what your character is trying to explain even if they still have to guess at it. Also if you want your character to say that and are aiming to make him look like a poser then you might want to include at some point someone better then him having no idea what he is talking about lol.<br>  <br>  Also in what you said you may want to change face plant to face planted.<br>  <br>  However with that said Ill also point out I have heard people talk like that.

KRFaLpR3aa	because you are more relaxed and there is no pressure on you when doing your practice swing, its a state of mind that you will have to work on to be able to take from the practice to the real shot.|`|sBrummATaa	because there is no pressure to hit a shot just like the other two said in front  of me|`|wYGeg0QRaa	Patrick you have asked a question that has plagued golfers that are beginning the game forever. When you are making a practise swing you are trying to swing your club in a particular manner. When you are faced with the ball and are required to make what you refer to as your actual swing you are trying to hit the ball. There are of course different thoughts here and your body reacts to what you are thinking. One of the reasons why golf takes so much practise even for accomplished players is to try to bring the thought processes together into one and the same. This is why we often hear someone say just swing the club and let the ball get in the way. If it were only that simple. You are not alone in your frustration and the only solution really is to practise and try not to let it play on your mind and you'll soon find the ball less of a distraction as you go forward and start to make those smooth swings when facing that little round ball.|`|z58NVkOnaa	There is no pressure at the range or practice...your mind is relaxed...you have found your happy place of relaxation...but, when it is time during a round, you are not trusting you, or your practice swing, and the physical faults sets in and ruin your swing that you have developed during the course of practice...simply, to practice everyday at the range, and not bring what you practice with you during your round, is just throwing $ away.<br>  <br>  You must block out all things around you, like other players and place yourself in the practice swing mode, and trust yourself.|`|AA11215075	well your swing is like having sex ..you see if you play with it.. it feels one way,,but if you and your girlfriend or have sex thats another story..i think you get the picture so give me my 10 points..and remember to keep her head down|`|d0qpLCSoaa	because you tense up when you see the ball infront of you. try to take deep breathes after your practice swing before hitting. humming once worked for me, it really depends on you what can make you relax before you kill that ball =)|`|QwCsFKLQaa	My best guess,, is that during your actual swing your trying to hit the ball to hard,  chill out and let the club do the work.

ncthgPHSaa	No chance! Arsene has built an awesome squad, especially with the addition of Arshavin. If he makes a couple of signings in the summer (centre-back and centre-mid) I expect them to be challenging for the title again next season. The squad is immense:<br>  <br>  Adebayor<br>  Van Persie<br>  Eduardo<br>  Walcott<br>  Rosicky<br>  Arshavin<br>  Fabregas<br>  Nasri<br>  Sagna<br>  Clichy<br>  Gallas<br>  <br>  With young players improving all the time like:<br>  Vela<br>  Diaby<br>  Denilson<br>  Ramsey<br>  Wilshere<br>  Djourou<br>  Simpson<br>  Randall<br>  Gibbs<br>  <br>  I leave out players like:<br>  Silvestre<br>  Toure<br>  Song<br>  Bendtner<br>  Eboue<br>  <br>  A couple of ins and outs in the summer and the squad could be amazing, and this is all thanks to Wenger. I don't think he'd get the complete control he has at Arsenal at any other club, and why would he want to leave his years of hard work when there are so many good young players.|`|Maja0Gzdaa	He is building a very strong team and in a season or so, that team is going to be world beaters, maybe with a couple of extra signings.

We also saw that Arsenal missed out on a lot of trophies because of the lack of major signings made by Wenger.<br>  Playing good football but ending up empty handed isn't any better than playing bad football and ending up with the gold.|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	Wenger leaving Arsenal would be a travesty for the club.

They splash the cash but reap little reward and have been doing doggy paddle against the current supported by the fact that they are much better run than many clubs. This can't last forever and the next 2/3 seasons are going to be crucial to whether they can ever regain top 6 status or start to disappear. <br>  <br>  Ahn Jung-Hwan may be your fav, but he is old and highlights the big gap in class between most better Asian players and those from Europe , Africa and South America.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	yeh the players u recommended selling are swag so ur right there<br>  but wtf is ahn jung-hwan|`|2BWrVf4Raa	Redknapp's the best manager Spurs have had in years, what we need is stability as we've sacked too many managers.

IITnJjAjaa	Don't train hard everyday. That's the biggest mistake lots of people make. I would always have at least one rest day. <br>  <br>  Remember all these things: <br>  <br>  *  Circuit Training<br>  * Conditioning of legs<br>  * Conditioning Lower leg<br>  * Conditioning Upper Body<br>  * Plyometrics<br>  * Stretching Exercises<br>  * Warm up and cool down<br>  * Weight Training<br>  <br>  With long distance running, you are basically building up endurance so you need to gradually increase the mileage. At least once or twice a week, you should go out running for 60 minutes at whatever pace you like (but just make sure you can maintain it) and then add 5 minutes next time you run and keep doing this  until you are running 90 minutes and hey presto! You've built up your endurance!<br>  <br>  Follow the 10% rule, that is, make small increases in your distance or speed. Some people might only make 5% changes every week or two.<br>  <br>  Run heavy/light. That is, after a run that puts heavy stress on your body, do a run that puts light stress on your body. Light stress could come from running slower or runner a shorter distance, or both.<br>  <br>  Listen to your body and keep the intensity of your training within the capabilities of your body. That is, don't overdo your training.<br>  <br>  Don't go for a long distance until you have a good base of about 20-25 miles/week, using runs up to 6 or 7 miles in distance.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Building up your weekly mileage is really important in improving your fitness and rank.  In addition, mix in some speed workouts on the track.  Try about 8 400M repeats, while timing yourself with a stopwatch.  If you cramp up, its okay to walk.  The more you run, the less you will cramp up.  Good luck!|`|pkfZXcPCaa	I have run 25 marathons and when I started I could not even run 1 mile.  The real key is to slow down on the early runs to make sure you are at a conversational pace (can carry on a conversation without being winded).  Build your distance at that pace by adding no more then 10% of the total distance each week.  When you get to your desired distance then you can keep at that distance and slowly start adding speed.|`|1UID5JtNaa	Depends- some respond to higher intensity, low volume while others respond to more miles at a slow to moderate pace.  Generally you build your weekly mileage based to what you are comfortable with in the off season, then during season you introduce interval training once a week.  You can also add a long run (beyond 60 minutes- on the weekend)|`|Re0ivDOiaa	I used to do a lot of running about 4.2k everyday, the main thing is that i started at 3k as well and build my stamina to be able to run faster for longer, some thing i could suggest is to listen to music and don't stop, if u stop ur stamina wont improve<br>  <br>  hope that helps :}

eTAiP7OPaa	LeBron and Deron.. On offense, both are equally balance.. But speaking with the D, LeBron and Deron are bigger and better defender. And additionally on offense, Deron has an advantage on CP3 + equal passing with CP3.. =)|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Very close match up. Deron is bigger than paul yet paul is just a little quicker than deron plus hes a better slasher/scorer/shooter than deron. Although Lebron will just dominate the game because of his size and strength and attacking the rim ability. Kobe will just drain jumpshot after jumpshot but not as easily on Lebron. I say Lebron and Dwill by a point or so.|`|Vr4r5l8Raa	2 on 2, Lebron is just a monster, and I respect Kobe with his deadly shots, but dat s just nuts to guard him without help defense.|`|5FypDafWaa	Kobe and Chris|`|21J0IIZbaa	Good match-up<br>  Kobe and CP3 11-9|`|vFbzBo4eaa	LeBron and Wiliams|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Kobe +Paul<br>  <br>  <br>  The Factor in this Match R The PG's<br>  <br>  Paul is Better Than Williams in Stealing and defense<br>  <br>  Kobe Provides Offense to his team<br>  <br>  While LeBron Gives His Team Strength And Power|`|4DcvpQXfaa	LeBron and Deron|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Team 2 no challenge.|`|BntHQeWMaa	kobe paul
eTAiP7OPaa	DALLAS = no T-Mac.. =(|`|21J0IIZbaa	Dallas 94-79|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Dallas|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Dallas. Houston will be under a lot of pressure and wont know how to run an offense and score points when so much goes through Mcgrady, whos out for the season probs. Plus dirk's playing awesome. Although if Yoa can pick up the slack and the bench players as well as Louis Scola and rafer alston due their part they might have a good chance in the game.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Dallas Mavericks|`|5FypDafWaa	Dallas|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Houston by 4.
