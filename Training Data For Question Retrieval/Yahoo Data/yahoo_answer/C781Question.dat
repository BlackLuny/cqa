This is compared with counter service where service is provided at the counter.      Table service is the norm in most restaurants, while for some fast food restaurants counter service is the common form. For pubs and bars, table service is the norm in the United States whereas counter service is the norm in the United Kingdom, in addition to most of the western world.      With table service, the customer generally pays just before leaving rather on the delivery of the food or drink.      Various methods of table service can be provided. See, for instance, silver service.

Any ideas will be appreciated. I wouldn't mind spending good money on a nice party for them.

I want to start eating healthier but I have no idea what to try and I'm kind of stuck in a rut. Any ideas of healthy food I could try?    Again I am very picky: I don't like cooked veg(but I do love uncooked) I'm not a huge fan of fruits and I don't like them to be cooked or anything either. I love pasta but not the spagetti type. I love chicken breast and most chicken flavoured things, but I don't like any other part of the chicken and I'm not a huge fan of any other kinds of meat(well bacon is quite nice but too fatty). I love soups like tomato but I don't like anything with bits in it.

20090305074100AAJgNqI	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	As a veg*, do you eat things that have been processed in the same facility as animal products?	I don't. I personally try to just eat organic, natural, vegan food.
20090305073650AAFicIV	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Is it wrong to not want to be associated with certain vegans, vegetarians even though I'm a vegan myself?	I've been a strict vegetarian for three years and just turned vegan in December. Months prior to that, the only thing I ate from an animal was honey.      The reason I don't like being around some "moral" vegans, vegetarians, is due to the immense differences we have. I dislike the fact that many vegs I've encountered tend to "show off" their veg*ism and attack others for not being what they are. That and their hypocrisy as well as their naivete.       I dislike veg*s who eat things that taste and look exactly like the "real" thing; tofu chicken fingers. By doing so, you're stating that you actually miss the taste of animals, which isn't right if you're a veg for moral reasons. I'm not saying I wouldn't eat tofu, I do in fact, but adding dozens of ingredients to your vegeburger just so it can taste like the "real deal" is just asinine.       I dislike how most think it's merely a diet when in fact it's a lifestyle. I'm not the strictest vegan in the world, but I try to be if and when I can. Everything I own is vegan, soaps, toothpastes, shampoos, shoes, clothes etc. And owning pure vegan things when you're a vegan yourself seems extremely rare from what I encounter, even though it's not expensive nor difficult.      I might come off as one of those stereotypical "peta vegans" but that's not what I am. I'm pretty much against any person (vegan or not) that will break the law just to make a point,.         Sincerely,        The Continental Communist.
