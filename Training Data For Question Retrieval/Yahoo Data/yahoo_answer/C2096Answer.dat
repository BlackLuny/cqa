It takes two people to report an abuse, but if the violation is really bad then it will only take one person and the question is deleted. <br>  A question/answer must give an answer which is useful and adds knowledge to all members, not questions/answers that are only useful to yourself.

AA11252878	Here's the information you've asked about:<br>  <br>  Yahoo! Answers is a community-driven knowledge market website launched by Yahoo! on December 13, 2005 that allows users to both submit questions to be answered and answer questions asked by other users.
01d4fd76ed5b517f49a55ea0f996488faa	you'll never get the PW back if you don't have your e-mail. However, try every E-mail add you have. I suggest that you create a new account and announce that your former account was hacked and therefore should be ignored and erased.|`|44vgFcKcaa	It has been much too long for you to do anything about it now. <br>  Once it is gone, it is gone.<br>  Your only recourse is to make a new account with info you want to use now. However, I believe you can not use an ID name you previously used.<br>  I suggest you write down the info you use for the account and keep it in a secure place in case you need to refer to it again at a later time.<br>  Further suggestions to keep from being hacked again: Install a firewall on your computer, plus an anti-virus program. I also recommend a program for malware and adware. Then, please, make sure you never ever give out your personal information to anyone.
f7qVtYfaaa	it took mine two weeks to show as anything other than a red x , many people seem to be experiencing this problem and it seems to be a yahoo problem not something you can correct|`|7u77AiBjaa	There's no link to your 360 space in your question or your Yahoo! Answers profile, so I can't easily confirm that you have one. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized. There has been a delay lately re: the images appearing even if you follow procedure:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click the "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.|`|84441c4476dc5550adedd8b3634f6bdcaa	Since 5 days ... my avatar picture on my yahoo 360 wasn't working as well ...

However once your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.

zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.

e494eb1e544153fbeed8117f34b95807aa	It means that someone opened your account on another computer. If you did not give anyone permission to use your id then you will have to change your password.|`|AA10045620	Does someone else have your Yahoo password?  Sounds like someone has it and has logged on to your account via a different computer.  Or, if you have two accounts with Yahoo and both of them open on your computer, this might force one of them to be closed down.|`|jKfV6DoOaa	It means that someone else has signed into your Yahoo!Messenger from another computer with your user name and password. <br>  You need to log in again and change your password right away and I would also go to Yahoo!Help and report that incident to Yahoo!.<br>  It might not be intentionally that someone you know signed into your Yahoo!. You might have signed into your account on a friends computer and you may be forgot to uncheck the "remember my ID & Password " box and if your friend has also checked the "Sign in automatically" box then you will be signed in there every time he turns on his computer until he changes it and signs in with his name. So did you in the past sign in from a computer other then your own? Hope you get it solved soon. Good Luck!
9BL6LFJ9aa	Sorry but the problem is all the school  IT people are wise to this now. As we post them they block them. You have to find a site where you can join and they send you new ones. The trouble is you have to do that by someone you know. If you put it on here they join it and you send them the sites for them to block.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Actually all YA sites with English speaking communities have their Q&A set by default to "all English questions". On the front page, right underneath the list of categories, this might be changed to questions from your own country only. This lets you see what you want to see, but of course does not prevent it to be displayed on other English speaking YA sites. <br>  <br>  As to advantages and disadvantages of the national sites - the content on all those English speaking pages is the same, but Yahoo services may differ, so imho national offices with national staff would be enough. I could be wrong, but I see no advantages or disadvantages in using one site or the other, at least not for the users. But don't forget the industry which is paying for advertisements placed on the pages, it wouldn't make much sense to have ads from India run in the US...
467634e1e593fb57fdddd38ecc73d6e1aa	hard to say, question is a bit vague....the obivious answer would be that there is a device connected to yahoo messenger? i dont know what that means, but try disconnecting any usb devices, mayb could be a virus or something, run a spyware, antivirus program, log out of yahoo try again, reboot, without usb devices plugged in.
nErAWfHxaa	You can only delete questions that you asked or answers that you've given BEFORE the question is resolved or put into voting. If a "best answer" has been chosen or it's "in voting" then only Yahoo can delete them. To delete an answer before the question is in voting or resolved, people just click the "delete" word that appears in small type right under their answer.<br>  <br>  To delete a question, you click on the toolbar below the question on the pencil icon. However, you lost 5 pts. when you asked the question and you don't get the 5 pts. back.<br>  <br>  You delete on answers by clicking back on the question that you answered, scrolling down to your answer and clicking the “delete” link that shows under your answer with other options such as “Edit.”<br>  <br>  However, if you choose a "best answer" then you get 3 pts. back. And, sorry, I don't know a way to “clean up” your Q&A. You can add information, such as explaining what you meant if you had typos by adding a comment to a resolved question, but you can't delete. To add information, again, you click on the pencil icon (if it's not resolved) or click on the word comments under the answer if it's resolved.<br>  <br>  ONCE A QUESTION IS IN VOTING OR RESOLVED, only Yahoo can delete the question or answers and, generally, they only delete something for a violation of the rules. You're stuck with it in your profile. Unfortunately, Yahoo doesn't warn you about that (or that anyone can come read what you've said) when you sign up.<br>  <br>  It's possible to make your profile “private” by going to your profile, clicking “Edit My Info” then selecting the option that says nobody can see your questions and answers but, unfortunately, your contacts and fans can STILL see your profile that way.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	You can't.  Even if a question is deletd it remains in the asker's profile, but grayed out & inaccessible.<br>  <br>  You can only delete questions that you asked, and you can only do that while they are still 'open'. Once a question is in 'voting' or has been resolved via a Best Answer being chosen, the question belongs to Y!A and is in their database forever (or until they start archiving old Q&As anyway).<br>  <br>  To delete your question while it's still open, go to the question page, pass your mouse over the pencil icon in the toolbar below your question, and click Delete Question.<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/ask/ask-76322.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>

Even when in Polls & Surveys, all the same rules apply, so it's a tricky category to post in.  You'd have to remember EXACTLY what the questions in order for anyone to be able to tell you why they were deleted. You CAN NOT mention another user's name in a post.  But your question about your looks, was probably considered chatting.  It was of no interest or value to anyone but you.  Remember, a question doesn't have to be rude, offensive or contain anything sexual or contain profanity to be a violation.<br>  <br>   Again, to answer your question ONLY Yahoo deletes questions.  Other Yahoo members report them.|`|mDDUsNG9aa	90% of the time it is  yahoo answers police of course....they seem to forget we have freedom of speech in America maybe not so in other nations who participate on answers from other nations ...The other 10% are people on this site that are far to the right and far to the left with their ideologies, faith, political beliefs!!|`|gGZz2EGyaa	If your question has been deleted then it must have been reported for some reason.  Was your question more chatting then asking a question, were you impolite to someone!

I just answered a question earlier and then it popped up 'this question has been deleted', when I went to have a look later it had not been deleted and was still in the list and I was able to answer it.
gGZz2EGyaa	If it is just happening today then I would say it is down to Yahoo as they have problems all morning.

7u77AiBjaa	You are talking about getting music to autoplay on Yahoo! 360.<br>  <br>  If you mean when someone comes to your 360 Top Page, no.<br>  - Although, you can add a play button for your blast that the visitor would have to click on. See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=916">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=548">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for details on how to put music in your blast. You can use music that you upload to the web or music already uploaded to the web by other people (faster, easier method).<br>  <br>  The song file must be an MP3 file and the web address for that file must end in .mp3. Also, only certain services (music hosting sites, file hosting sites, or blogging services) will allow you to create or use a hotlink to an audio file. So, if you use a search engine to find links, you should definitely check to see if it's working on your page after saving your blast.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you mean when someone enters your 360 Blog area, yes.<br>  - You will have to use video and make adjustments to the embed code. With the MY360MI YouTube conversion tool (see details at <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1255">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> ), you can select options to hide the video part of the code and set autoplay, thereby getting background music in a 360 blog entry. When that blog entry leaves the front page of the blog area, then you would have to add background music again to a different entry on the front page.

I made the switch to Microsoft's Live Services and have been pretty happy. I got a @live.com email address with free pop forwarding (have to pay for it with yahoo), free online storage with SkyDrive.Live.com (25GB and grows as you need it free of charge!), Photos.live.com (Flickr), and Live Messenger (works with yahoo/aol contacts). Plus, they keep coming out with cool new and free stuff like Live Sync, which lets you share files between computers for free (unlike go2mypc $$$), Workspace from officeLive.com which comes in handy when it comes to organizing work and personal activities. It might sound like I'm a Microsoft insider, but trust me, I researched all the available options out there and haven't found one as robust as what Microsoft is offering.<br>  <br>  I basically got tired of having to log into different sites to do all my routine online follow-ups. Another great free site is PageOnce.com... for a quick overview of all your "online sites" including email, shopping and financials check them out. Just log in and see all your email accounts, your checking and savings account balances, 401k account, credit card balances, eBay and Amazon accounts, Netflix and cell phone mintues. minutes.|`|3wi55ztAaa	I agree with the other Live.com services guy. For as bad a rap as Microsoft once had for itself its starting to learn from its mistakes and competitors. This is going to be a great year for Microsoft and since I've been a beta-tester for Windows 7 (absolutely amazing) I can see how their free live.com services like SkyDrive and Workspace ties in to the new Windows 7 operating system. Apple commercials were clever, but I think Microsoft will recapture some of that lost market share with their free services and new Windows 7 platform.<br>  <br>  Oh, and in addition to live services and pageonce.com for anyone needing to tie in all their emails try fuser.com - it's free too!

suPD7c3gaa	I HIGHLY recommend both PayPal and eBay.  I've dealt with them both for years, and have never had a problem.  Sometimes it's the user who is the problem in that many people don't make the proper contacts, don't explain their problem properly, curse, 'yell', criticize, etc. instead of being courteous and explaining things simply and clearly, etc. If you were ripped off, it could be the Seller you need to deal with.  If the Seller doesn't communicate, then there is a step-by-step process that needs to be followed with eBay as well as with PayPal. If you check both business' ratings with the Better Business Bureau, you would see they concur.<br>  <br>  eBay:<br>  <a href="http://sanjose.bbb.org/BusinessReport.aspx?CompanyID=204015" rel="nofollow">http://sanjose.bbb.org/BusinessReport.as...</a><br>  <br>  PayPal:<br>  <a href="http://sanjose.bbb.org/BusinessReport.aspx?CompanyID=210387" rel="nofollow">http://sanjose.bbb.org/BusinessReport.as...</a><br>  <br>  No one is going to boycott either of them.  You don't have that power.  And basically... no one else does either.<br>  <br>  So... to answer your question "why dose pay pal and ebay suck ?" [very mature there]... they don't.

Bgzjbo4Xaa	Hello,    Here are the directions for configuring an Outlook Express POP3 account with your Yahoo Mail account.    http://www.emailquestions.com/yahoo-mail...
gpPRNPqYaa	It's dumb but people do it for the points. This site isn't only for finding information and having fun answering questions to help people, to some people its about getting to higher levels and all the points they can get. I've seen people answering questions by simply saying "2 points".... with no other answer. Honestly, I think it's a waste of time to answer a question you don't know... But that's the way the cookie crumbles. It's like myspace or facebook for some people.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Even worse then that are people who post dangerous & misleading info, particularly regarding health issues.All such answers are a waste of time IMO. If they just need quick points they should go to P&S where all the kids hang out.|`|Y4amfu33aa	Duh, to get points so they can ask their own questions.|`|suPD7c3gaa	I don't understand it either.  Your example is a tricky one.  The way it was worded could be interpreted as a Yes or No kind of question.  What REALLY bugs me is when people answer that they don't know.  It's a point gaming violation and it's not an answer.  But you see it all the time.  If I think the question has the potential to be a good question, I will try to guess what the is being asked and provide an answer, so I don't get a violation for not answering the question, but will ask for more information if the question isn't clear.|`|zILwtO22aa	A few people treat this site as a game, I do try to give all the help I can, even send them a link should my knowledge be lacking,   but when it comes to Jokes and Riddles, that's a different story :)
9IQBarkbaa	Please write something about a person. Animals are so boring! Write about a forbidden relationship those stories are always fun.     -Maybe a student and teacher that fall in love.  -Stepbrother and stepsister that fall in love  -A hostage that falls in love with her kidnapper.  -Poor boy and rich girl that fall in love or the other way around.    Hope that helped :)    Oh and title should be ''Forbidden Love''.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	That,s called cheating where i come from,but don,t worry too much as i have moved since.|`|K2bpyDVsaa	Write About a Beautiful Bunny that lives in Hawaii under the lush tropical  rain forests...    Name The Bunny Iolani Because all the bunny wants to do in life is soar above all the other bunnies..    Name It Iolani The Bunny....
EsHSVg9Faa	I'm not going to say it depends on if your a girl or boy. The guy avatars have less choices to pick from as in close wise,and that makes girls a little better. U should pick a girl if ur lookin for syle. U should pick a boy if your just trying to do something easy|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Didn't I answer this question already?  You should make a male avatar|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	The next time you go to the restroom, note what is says on the door and go with that...|`|KFlnnvTwaa	male|`|jprAxFILaa	It just depend of you. If you are male, you choose a male and if your a female you choose a female. Done.

7u77AiBjaa	More information about the problem would be helpful. It would be good to know exactly where in 360 that you can't see images, whether the problem is contained to your 360 or it's a problem for any 360 space you visit, what browser you are using, whether you are talking about individual images or photo slideshows in blogs, and etc.    Here are some things to try:  - Try refreshing a page (refresh or F5).  - Clear your browser's cookies and cache.  - Right click on any 360 image (blank placeholder or otherwise), make sure the "Block images from ..." is unchecked.  - Check your Internet Explorer settings. Go to Tool, Internet Options, click the advanced tab and under Multimedia make sure "Show Pictures" is checked. Do the same type of checking if you are using the Firefox browser.  - Click your Start menu, go to All Programs, click on Windows Update to make sure that your computer has been fully updated.  - Make sure that you have the latest Flash player installed for your browser. See http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ . Flash is what enables you to view avatars and videos. You can also download the Shockwave plug-in. See http://get.adobe.com/shockwave/ .  - See this web page for other tips: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283807    If these photos are in a flash slideshow, then you may be experiencing a new 360 glitch. There really isn't anything that you can do about it. If you click on the "Comment" or "Permanent Link" link of the blog entry, the object may appear correctly in that new view.

3M5JAEZ0aa	That's not always true, sometimes people don't find questions that they are interested in. Maybe try to mix it up a bit.    Also, maybe they don't see it. Out of my two question I got one that was a big hit. I guess it is hit or miss.     As you can see, I just answered your question. Again, don't feel bad...I know that someone will answer your question and you will feel great, just like I did, when my question got answered!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	The first answer is right, you must post your Q here in YA. Everyone is anonymous, so you don't need to be embarrassed.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Well you only asked one question so far and you wanted people to email you and you would tell them the question that you wanted answering.     Y!A doesn't work like that, you post the question you want the answer to in the category that applies, like "what is the best remedy for a sore throat?" post it in the "Health" section.|`|aZefRFiWaa	wow...

gpPRNPqYaa	Nope, this is another game where the points don't really matter. In some cases, it may affect your credibility and you may seem more intelligent if you're on a higher level but what about the people who just signed up or don't answer a lot of questions? In my opinion it lowers the credibility of the answers. Who's to say the answerer to my question didn't make it up to gain 2 points? IDK... The points are unrelated to anything yahoo! answers does. I've always thought the point of this was to find out things you were unsure about or to help others learn....|`|3M5JAEZ0aa	When you answer question you gain points. These points are used to ASK questions. When you get a "Best Answer" you will get more points. These points just allow you to ask questions. Also, the points will help you gain levels, and to be on a Leader Score-Board if you do get lots, and lots of points.                          When you do ask a question it is usually about 5 points to ask...then you can regain the points by answering questions.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	I learn loads,by just reading all of the answers even though most of them are way over my head.|`|AA10551195	Motivation? Welllllll - it would seem that some of us just genuinely like to answer questions, even questions like this. If you don't know the purpose of points, you really should read the Rules and Regulations and Community Guidelines. Points are a way of rewarding people for their efforts in providing information to other people. Nothing is for sale -nothing bought. It's all free. Is that mind-boggling, or what?!?
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Yahoo Mail does not have a delivery indication or the capability to request receipts. Some separate email programs can request a receipt but the person receiving the email must also have a compatible program and allow the receipt to be returned.    There are some web sites that give you a graphic to embed in your email and then they let you know if mail has been read. If someone blocks graphics from unknown people then it doesn't work.    ? ??l???q ?

JhvqUvlsaa	If you're meaning the taskbar, which is at the very bottom of your screen, you need to got to Control Panel in your Start Menu and double click Taskbar and Start Menu then click on Notifications. This will show you the options you have on your taskbar. If Clock is not checked, then check it and then click Apply and Ok.    Hope this helps    RW
