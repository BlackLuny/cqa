Straight people fall in love and sex is a by product of that love, however there is a double standard for homosexual couples.

20090202105300AA3nhOr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does it bother you that signs from god are always relative to the individual's interpretation?	Doesn't that make it less convincing that it's God who is talking to you, not more. How do you know that you're not just reading into things in order to confirm what you already or want to believe. If you look hard enough then you can pretty much construe any event as God talking to you, no matter how trivial that event may be. What use is a "sign" if it's so ambiguous that you have to force it to mean something, and can't be objectively confirmed. What if two genuine believers have contradictory interpretations of the same "sign", and both of their interpretations have good intentions that aren't at odds with the bible. How are you supposed to know which one is God's will if it's not a situation that's blatantly obvious like whether it's a sin to worship the devil.

Not long ago, I posted a question where I asked for a special prayer for my young niece who is awaiting admission into hospital for open heart surgery, but the Yahoo Team removed it as they said I was violating the service with my question.   So I will ask again in a different way.      Despite the hospital's saying her condition does not yet require urgent early admission, I can do nothing but watch her breathing condition and her chest pains getting worst each week, but pray and pray hard as I can that she will be o.k.      Each Sunday I pray hard in church, and whenever I find time alone, I pray so hard tears flow from my eyes, yet inside I often feel I am not praying in the right manner, therefore my prayers go unanswered.      Can anyone tell me how can I pray sincerely for my niece who I hold so close, and to lose her in any manner would totally destroy me

20090202110112AAaXGh9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, has the Gospel borrowed historical ?	accounts describing Jesus from previous Eastern scriptures which existed centuries before the Bible?      Krishna was depicted as if crucified. The Persian remembered only the atoning sufferings on the cross of Mithras the Mediator. Aztecs prayed for the return of their crucified saviour, Quexalcoatl, and were rewarded with Cortez. Caucasians chanted praises to their slain Divine Intercessor, Prometheus, for voluntarily offering himself upon the cross for the sins of a fallen race. Yet the Christian disciple hugs to his bosom the bloody cross of the murdered Jesus, confident that only one god ever died for the sins of man.      To retain their following, Christianity is based on unchangeable dogmas which disciples must accept to the exclusion of all knowledge adverse to their own creed. Whenever they are able they actually destroy contrary evidence for fear of rivalry. Then they magnify their own religion to a unique position above all others.

20090202110336AAP60mg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Nurse suspended for offering to pray for a patient?	In the UK a Christian nurse has been suspended after a patient complained when she offered to say a prayer.      I think this is overreacting - and I'm not a Christian, I'm agnostic. It's against a nurse's ethic to promote causes unconnected with healing, or for personal gain. However this was a genuine attempt to promote the welfare of the patient. There was no gain for the nurse involved. What about Christian orders (like the Poor Clares and the Sisters of Mercy) who are both carers and devotees?      Of course not everyone is a religious believer and if I were ill and a nurse offered to pray for me, I'd politely decline. But I wouldn't want to see the nurse disciplined just for that.

20090202111256AAftWUv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think that agnosticism is the only un-ignorant approach to God and the supernatural?	Atheism - Rejecting the existence of a God or creator - That's just arrogance, you have no evidence against it.      Theism - Ignorantly believing what people have said, through the bible and preachers. Most people who follow this religion are just afraid of hell which is obviously just a creation of priests.   Here is a fun fact, the bible was written in about 250-300AD.   It was written on rumours.   The fact that the original scriptures contained a "hell"   is debatable,   Hell and satan was what sold this religion in the first place.      agnosticism - You simply say, you don't know,   we have no knowledge of a God or that fact that it exists and we have no evidence against this. The could exist, we don't know.      To a certain degree there is agnostic theism - you believe in a creator but the properties or the facts of this supreme deity are unknown,   we don't know anything about it.      Ghosts, demons and spirits may exist, but we don't have any actually evidence for against them, we cannot say.   Being forced into a religion or belief because of fear of eternal damnation is being bullied.      I do not reject the fact that jesus existed because historians do have some records.

20090202112436AA65iA6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: could a religion exist that worships the gradualness of evolution?	Think about it for a second:      The Christian god supposedly does things "immediately" in his omnipotent state.      The bible says that "A day is as a thousand years" and vice versa; therefore, many Christians use this in an argument to say that a day in creation doesn't have to be 24 hours.  This is the same as acting gradually.      Acts of immediacy in the bible, such as god confounding the people's language at the Tower of Babel, aren't given much detail and are concluded rather "immediately".      Could there be some hidden mathematical codes in the bible that relate to evolution that Christians have actually, for all this time, been worshipping with one face and besmirching direct evolutionists with another?  Seems quite fitting that the act of being a pharisee is not something that would be done intentionally, but UNintentionally.

20090202111411AA0ApkA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, is the "Jesus" story original?	Check this out:   Osiris And Hours Pre 4,000 BC.      Osiris, the Egyptian Savior, was crucified in the heavens and was the "pattern" for all other crucified saviors which would follow; including his son Horus. To the Egyptian the cross was a symbol of immortality, an emblem of the Sun, and the god himself was crucified to the tree, which denoted his fructifying power.      Horus was also crucified in the heavens. He was represented, like Chrishna and Christ Jesus, with outstretched arms in the vault of heaven.      As a side note the principal Phenician deity, El, which says Parkhurst, in his Hebrew Lexicon, "was the very name the heathens gave to their god Sol, their Lord or Ruler of the Hosts of Heaven," was called "The Preserver (Savior) of the World," for the benefit of which he offered a mystical sacrifice. Notice again the connection between the Sun's (Sol's) sacrifice on behalf of mankind!
20090202111949AA2ze7F	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, is the Jesus story original?	Lets see:   Chrishna 1200 BC.      Chrishna, the crucified Savior of the Hindus, is a personification of the Sun crucified in the heavens.       One of the names of the Sun in the Vedic hymns is "Vishnu" and it is very important to know that in the Rig-Veda the god Vishnu is often named a manifestation of Solar Energy, or rather as a form of the Sun.      Chrishna is Vishnu is human form. Chrishna says: "I am Vishnu, Brahma, Indra, and the source as well as the destruction of things, the creator and the annihilator of the whole aggregate of existences.      In the hymns of the Rig-Veda the Sun is spoken of as "stretching out his arms," in the heavens, "to bless the world, and to rescue it from the terror of darkness." This reminds me of many of the examples of Isis with the Sun-disk on her head as she "stretches out her arms.
20090202112110AAaxiBl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, Is the JESUS story original?	Please read:   Attis of Phrygia 1170 BC.       Speaking of this crucified Messiah, the Anacalypsis informs us that several histories are given of him, but all concur in representing him as having been an atoning offering for sin. And the Latin phrase suspensus lingo, found in his history, indicates the manner of his death. He was suspended on a tree, crucified, buried and rose again.

Hay que tomar en cuenta que ellos vivian en el paraiso,en un lugar ideal, la caida vino porque ellos fueron desobedientes y comieron del fruto prohibido, por lo tanto arrojaron a toda su posteridad, osea nosotros al mundo en el cual nos encontramos, todas las cosas que nos ocurren son como consecuencia de la caida. Sin embargo Adan y Eva, no tenian un conocimiento entre el bien y el mal, ya que su conciencia  vino solo al participar de aquel fruto ?acaso puede una persona ser culpable si no conoce entre el bien y el mal?,no tenian conciencia de su desnudez, por lo tanto era como ni?os peque?os. sin una real conciencia de las cosas

You know, the deity that would send bears to attack a group of kids who had teased an old holy ogre...      A deity that would send angels to kill all the first-born in Egypt...      A deity that would have a tantrum and curse the earth...      Do you believe there ought to be that kind of god?

20070627033313AA1Mnya	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	PERCHE' credete in Dio e nella Chiesa?	I vangeli sono stati sicuramente manomessi nel corso dei secoli.. stato scritto ci che ci si voleva sentir dire - a parer mio -. Dio parla di Adamo ed Eva. Erano delle scimmie x caso? No, impossibile, in quanto loro, come noi, siamo a sua immagine e somiglianza.. Leggendo il vangelo con attenzione ci sono anche molte contraddizioni.. E le donne? Nel vangelo si predica anche la  loro inferiorit.. Chi Dio, che proclama l'uguaglianza, fa in modo che le donne siano inferiori e non possano avere ruoli rilevanti nella societ ecclesiale?

20070903184727AAEYVrF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mistranslations in the King James?	Yes.  For example, Easter, which is a pagan holiday / festival of fertility, appears one time in the KJV:      Acts 12:4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.      The manuscript say “Passover”, not “Easter”.  Does this matter?  Yes, because God hates man messing with His Word:      What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it. Deuteronomy 12:32      Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. Deuteronomy 4:2      Revelation 22:19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.      Any other mistranslations in the King James?

20081109144414AA37hAb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can I get atheists at school to stop making fun of me?	I'm christian, but I'm not anything really serious like catholic or anything. Sometimes when we're doing an assignment like a christmas one or at the begging of the year when we're supposed to bring something in to resemble what our life's about (I know that's a bad way of putting it but whatever) I always do something about Christianity. Well, the problem is, whenever atheists find this out, they'll accuse me of "forcing my dumba** religion and imaginary god down their throats' even though I never say a thing about it to them and I don't care if your religion is different.      When I was turning in my check for a yearbook, I ordered to put a cross on it (they have this program where you can put your name and symbols on the cover and stuff like that) Well, whenever one of them saw my form, they would steal it, laugh, and say "Aw, look, this kids STILL stuck in the 1800's. It's amazing you got accepted into biology honors when you won't see the true meaning of science you dumba**.'      I could give you plenty more examples, but this questions getting too long. So, my question is, how can I get these guys to shut up? Thanks.

O que eu criei foi:      Mouse anti-tendinite;      Um mouse que tem duas luzes,uma verde e uma vermelha,que teriam as seguintes fun??es:      A luz verde ficaria ligada durante o uso do mouse, após uma hora(mais ou menos) a luz verde se apagava,e acenderia a vermelha,informando a possibilidae de tendinite(pois mto tempo no mouse pode causar realmente tendinite).   Automaticamente já abriria uma janela com um softawe de um rápido exercício para as m?os,pra aliviar a tens?o das m?os,e poder voltar ao computador...      Quem n?o tem computador hoje em dia?   Quem usa muito o computador tem possibilidade de tendinite!   Seria uma forma de cuidado com a saúde.      O que vcs acham?      Aceito idéias em cima disso.   Obrigada!

20081012182943AATPqbT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has anyone experienced a similar attack of the demonic?	in short, in despair I prayed out loud to the Lord. It was refreshing and fruitful to give it all to him. Shortly after I went to bed. In my sleep I could sense danger from some type of presence in my room. Immediately I woke up and realized that there was something physically in my room. At the foot of my bed was some strange type of beast that resembled a huge werewolf but it wasn't that, that is the closest creature I can relate it too because I haven't seen anything like it before. This creature/demon was huge and dark brown and it was crouched down, on its hind legs. It has huge red eyes and really sharp teeth. It seemed like something from a hollywood b-rate horror movie but it wasn't completely physical in nature. when I saw it my body was not aloud to move, i was terrified but this was not the result from trembling. my arms and legs were pinned down and i could feel my neck sucked in to the point of my clavicle bone hurting and popping out. I couldn't breathe. the creature slowly started crawling from the foot of my bed to the left side of my bed my first instinct was to call out for my mom who was in the other room reading a book but as i tried to scream her name i was not aloud to speak..as the demon was halfway up the side of my bed it jumped up at me that is when cried out    "JESUS!" and as i screamed, this demon was right above me and was snarling viciously as he vanished right before he was almost on me-he turned into a black void. as soon as he was out of my presence i was able to sit up and as soon as I did i began praying to the Lord Jesus and recited all the scripture I knew. after a few minutes i was able to get up and turn the light on. I ran to my moms room and asked her if she heard me screaming in terror. She did not. I truly believe and know how powerful the name of my Lord Jesus is and that he does save. I was not able to call my mom but only to call his name. Has anyone experienced or seen any demonic manifestation similar to this. I don't even like werewolves or cheesy stuff like that and can't understand why  it appeared in this form. I know is was not the old hag syndrome. I have been prone to nightmares since I was five and can recall all of them in vivid detail. I know the difference between all stages of sleep and awareness to how this works.

20081012191636AAsnIxA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Confused about my beliefs?	Hi, I am kind of confused about my beliefs. I believe in God, but not so much in a religious aspect. I believe God is an entity we use to explain the unexplainable and is our psychological confidence booster. When times are tough, we look to God to take care of these problems and help us through them. I do not believe Jesus is my lord and savior. Was he a guy? Yes. Was he God's son? We will never know without Maurey. But I pray at night. Not so much to God, but to those who I love to have passed on. I have not been to church since I was 4 and I use to go every Sunday. My mom let all of her children choose their religion. My oldest brother is an athiest and my other is mainly a buddhist. I consider myself an agnostic due to my belief in a higher power but not in organized religion. The more I think about other religions though, the more I begin to question my own. I have really been thinking about what I believe and I very confused.       I know I don't believe in Christianity. I have been so turned off by it by those around me who try to shove it down my throat. It makes me sick sometimes. I just don't know what to believe anymore and was wondering if there is anything I can do to help figure this out. I am a scientist by the way. Through and through. Thanks!

Matthew 5:18-19    Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or tittle shall nowise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.       Luke 16:17    It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. 
20081017131722AA5muQa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What's so great about Satanism?	Here's something I don't understand.  Now, I can appreciate the general philosophies presented, as a religion, in Satanism.  Don't run when you can walk, etc...      And to clarify for those that don't know.  Satanist do not believe that Satan is an entity of any kind.  And that the idea of Satan as a being is a Christian idea.  Satanism is more of an idealism that focuses on doing things for yourself.      But what I don't understand is why it's called Satanism.  If you're going to live by a philosophy based on "me".  Then why concern yourself with "Satan".  It seems more like an opposition to Christianity than an independent philosophy.      What's up with that?  I have great appreciation for other religious ideas.  And I can generally see where they're coming from.  But I just don't get the motivation of Satanism.      And by the way, I am agnostic.  I am not trying to be preachy.  I would just like to understand.

20081023152811AAHCQ7Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian advice Please.?	Hi, As you can see from my other questions I'm a 16 year old born again christian. Now I have a completely legitimate question here. No joke. Now when I read the Book of Revelation the antichrist makes everyone take a mark of 666 or they cant buy or sell and are probably killed for not taking it. Now in my school I buy lunch everyday. My parents deposit all my money in a lunch account. Now I use to be able to just say my name and they would look it up on the computer. But now they are making everyone fingerprint there fingers and scan them every time they want to buy. Now I know this is not the same as the mark of the beast but sure sounds like a setup for it. Now when I bought lunch today they told me I would have to get fingerprinted or not be able to buy lunch anyone. What do you think? Am I making to much of this and should just get my finger scanned or is this a serious issue? Because I feel God is telling me not to get finger scanned. But what do you think? Any answers would be great.

Children today have every sort of medium barking at them from the day they're born until the day they become a high school statistic. The gentle intricacies of the mind were not meant to handle the barrage of information that already struggling children and teenagers are exposed to on a regular basis.

This person I know is not very nice and sometimes really rude and this comment ticked me off. I deleted the comment/pic. The next day I put up new pics and the same person commented me saying 'this lighting makes you look really hairy'. well its true i have a little extra facial hair but that was just really rude of her. I mean, she doesn't have to say it. Anyway, I'm feeling really mad/depressed and down.      What do I say to her if she comments something rude again?       How do I feel better?

20090202122117AAhA63B	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To all those who believe in god...?	what are u afraid of?  why is it that when u ask a question, and an atheist answers that u have the need to report an answer or block them from answering any more.      for example, consider the question - do u love jesus and why?  and it was answered with an honest no, and without any form of abuse or bad language, would u block that user?  the answer also stated that i am doomed if jesus was true, we are all doomed if another religion was true, is this abusive?  even at the end of the answer i specifically stated peace to everybody.  my answer was genuine, and i gave my reason that, as with all religions, what is said can be misconstrued, and contradictive and for these reason i dont believe in any religion.  not because i dislike anything, or that i dislke somebody who is religious.      if u block atheist answering ur questions, this this tells me that u have doubt about ur beliefs, and that what an atheist says may actually have some foundation.  u fear what may be the truth.  and it shows by blocking atheists. u dont want ur beliefs to be shaken a little.  and that is supposed to be the test of ur religion.      in my opinion, u are discriminating a person because he doesnt believe the same things as u.  and i thought in YA, this is a violation.      what are ur opinions?  why do police us like this?

Answer websites are a great way to share information and knowledge, however many times I find the questions and responses on Yahoo! Answers to be a bit disheartening.  The board is full of pregnant teenagers who don't even know the basics of sex education well enough to understand how they can or can't get pregnant or how to protect themselves, young kids who are sexually active, racism, people with eating disorders of various varieties or  horrible eating habits they aren't even aware of, hatred, vicious political and religious arguments in which people just hurl insults rather than provide any actual facts to back up what they are debating, people who can't use the english language even close to correctly, even if they were raised here their whole lives and had the benefit of schooling, etc.  Half the time I click on here I wind up reading a couple of questions and leaving the site completely and utterly disappointed in humanity, and more specifically the United States where almost everyone has access to at least a basic education.

20090202115101AAYCxIk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did giving all the builders of the tower of babel a different language stop the construction?	After all, they all knew how to build already and its not like it would be hard in that scenario to get one builder to understand what another builder needs even if their language is different. It's not necessarily easier but its still defiantly doable. I've worked with people that spoke german and we were able to work together. It's not like we stopped our jobs because God made it imposable for us to understand each other.      And even if this could be taken as half true, why would God stop the building of a simple tower that could only go so far and then allow NASA to start the space program? It seems to me rockets go much higher than a tower ever could and represent more pride in humanity than a tower as well.      Honestly I know the answer to this question already. I'm just showing how ridiculous the Bible is and why it can't be seen as literal truth from the word of God. A God would not be stupid enough to write something like that.

20090202114143AAMnFg8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it a sin to be Agnostic?	Is it a sin to be Agnostic? I used to be Christian, but I have been having doubts about the existence of God for some time now. I came to the conclusion that it is impossible to be 100% sure that God is or isn't real. Also, whether I stay Agnostic, go back to being Christian, or become Atheist, I decided that I will always be a good person and try my hardest to do good everyday.      So... If there is a God, will I burn in hell for all eternity for having doubts about his exsistence, even if I still try to live life like a good person?

Everything she has said is full of discrepencies - like the other day she was saying that if i were to meet up with him he would question me, threaten me and then be safe with me - ten minutes later she said he would probably stab me. She has been telling me he is after me for about 8 months. I had the idea to talk to him on MSN so she gave me his addy yesterday and i added him - but he remained offline. Today she said that he phoned her yesterday, she told him about me having his addy - and apparently he has said if i don't speak to him soon on MSN he will "come and get me" She says he knows where i live and apprentley he was asking for my phone number which is worrying. I told her that i will talk to him on MSN and tell him i dont wanna fiight him but she says he will ignore me and batter me regardless. Finally he is a year older than us according to her - apparently he satbbed someone a few weeks ago but he got away with it as the cops decided not to put him in a young offenders (which is hard to believe)      When i logged on to MSN to check if he had accepted me his name showed up as GARY (that is not the name of the guy who is after me) so unless he ahs changed the name on purpose this is yet another discrepncy in what she says.      SO AM I IN DANGER???      (dont tell me to go to the cops because if i do he WILL come and get me - if he is real)

Yet if you don't count the 1.1 billion Catholics (who they claim are not Christian) in there, they are a very minority religion.      So which is it?
20090202120526AAIXR8b	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Your thoughts on Christianity?	I have been going through alot of the threads posted on this forum and am noticing a very frightening trend.  Apparently, there are tons of "christians" who love to tell people to "go to hell," "stfu," etc.  This disturbs me.  On the other hand, atheists, muslims, and the like say the same to "christians."        I have always been taught, and have experienced, christianity as a very loving and profound relationship with Jesus Christ, whose central focus on this Earth was to love one another as yourself, regardless of differences.  Now, I expect to here non-christians bashing us at every chance they get, that will never surprise me, but to see people calling themselves Christians stooping to that level, displaying the same animosity towards others is disturbing.        You may agree or disagree with people, you can judge them, but never EVER condemn them by such remarks.  Now, to clarify, when I say judge, I mean to comment on your differences, and explain why you think a certain person is wrong in the way they are living, acting, etc. in an intelligent fasion, with clear and concise reasoning, never telling someone they will go to hell if they keep up their current lifestyle.  By doing that, you are effectively taking God's judgment into your own hands, and THAT is blasphemy.  I encourage all Christians to re-examine themselves to make sure that they are truly following Jesus's teachings; simultaneously, I would ask for patience from those who disagree with "Christians" for the many people who do not represent us believers and followers.  Just a bit of tolerance from either side would go a long way in clearing up a lot of the hate that is found all over the place.

Now I dont know about you, but many scientists get together to tell people what they want to hear about evolution, preist and bishops get together and tell people that half the stuff in the OT didn't happen when Paul specifically said that there was an acutally Adam and an actualy Eve and an actual serpent. And here he even authorized the Evangelical Church.       So isnt this proof of Christ.

20080911055620AAeNXEB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ela era da sua igreja?	Na década de 50, a Torre Eiffel passou por uma de suas reformas. Conta-nos um dos operários que trabalhava lá, que n?o haviam tantas preocupa??es e regulamenta??es para a prote??o de operários e de transeuntes, tanto é que a reforma era em cima do restaurante da Torre, e n?o havia tapume, nem cord?o de isolamento, nada.      Durante a reforma, um dos operários acidentalmente derrubou um balde de tinta, que atingiu uma linda mo?a que estava saindo do restaurante naquele exato momento. A mo?a, que, pelo modo de vestir, via-se que era americana, apenas olhou para o operário e sorriu um sorriso maravilhoso.      Toda vez que conta esta história, o operário diz "Deus aben?oe os americanos!" e olha para o céu, e suspira, talvez lembrando do sorriso da mo?a.      Você, o que faria? Deixaria um acidente estragar o seu dia? Ou daria o seu melhor sorriso? Iria destratar o operário que por acidente derrubou tinta no seu melhor penteado e na sua melhor roupa, ou daria um sorriso, como quem diz, "shits happens", ou "C'est la vie", ou "fazer o quê, acontece"? Você daria de ombros e com um sorriso seguiria adiante? Conseguiria? Ou trataria de estragar o teu dia e o de todo mundo que está perto?      -o=O=o-      Faz muito que a atitude do americano, principalmente do novaiorquino, é a pior possível. Ninguém cede nada, ninguém sorri, ninguém faz outra coisa sen?o reclamar, praguejar, buzinar, xingar, e descontar em quem n?o pode revidar. E isto n?o é só em Nova Iorque, estamos indo pelo mesmo caminho. é a evolu??o espiritual que a Nova Era e as novas igrejas (e as velhas também) est?o promovendo. O anonimato das grandes multid?es também colabora para isto. A tens?o e o stress se acumulam, e todos descarregam uns nos outros, em um círculo vicioso, que se transformou em uma espiral ascendente viciosa. As pessoas já acordam de mau humor pensando no que poderá acontecer para estragar o dia delas.      Só que algumas delas n?o v?o dormir. Algumas, sem saber, est?o acordando para o último dia da vida delas. Algumas sofrer?o acidentes fatais. Ou um ataque cardíaco fulminante. Ou um derrame. Ou v?o encontrar uma bala perdida. Ou v?o morrer de alguma das formas horríveis que se morre hoje em dia.      E v?o morrer sem ter sorrido naquele dia.

20080906103751AAVVwbW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Refletam nesta frase com base no meu estudo ?	"AS RELIGI?ES NASCEM DAS RESPOSTAS, E N?O DAS PERGUNTAS"   é interessante como encontramos nada mais nada menos que 74 referências a Jesus perguntando, indagando algo!      Que o homem pergunta por natureza, isto é inegável. Mas Deus justamente mostra que o importante é providenciar respostas às perguntas feitas:   Disse Moisés a Deus: Eis que, quando eu vier aos filhos de Israel e lhes disser: O Deus de vossos pais me enviou a vós outros; e eles me perguntarem: Qual é o seu nome? Que lhes direi?  Disse Deus a Moisés: EU SOU O QUE SOU. Disse mais: Assim dirás aos filhos de Israel: EU SOU me enviou a vós outros. (êxodo 3:13-14)       Quando vossos filhos vos perguntarem: Que rito é este?  Respondereis: é o sacrifício da Páscoa ao SENHOR, que passou por cima das casas dos filhos de Israel no Egito, quando feriu os egípcios e livrou as nossas casas. Ent?o, o povo se inclinou e adorou. (êxodo 12:26-27)      O livro de Jó mostra definitivamente que a religi?o está baseada nas respostas. Embora o livro esteja todo estruturado em cima das perguntas mais cruciais do ser humano, as perguntas nada s?o em compara??o com as perguntas feitas por Deus na longa se??o que vai do capítulo 38 ao 41.      Deus ent?o bombardeia Jó com perguntas: s?o setenta, ao todo! Mas o importante era que o homem adquirisse respostas n?o para Deus – Ele, na sua infinita sabedoria, nas as necessita! – mas sim para si próprio.      Cinge agora os lombos como homem; eu te perguntarei, e tu me responderás. (Jó 40:7)      Embora pare?a que as respostas devam ser dadas a Deus, estas respostas eram para o próprio Jó. Mediante as respostas dadas por ele próprio, Jó poderia entender a raz?o da vida.   Ent?o, respondeu Jó ao SENHOR:  Bem sei que tudo podes, e nenhum dos teus planos pode ser frustrado.  Quem é aquele.."(Jó 42:1-6)   Jesus também, várias vezes, utilizou este artifício para que mediante as respostas fornecidas pela própria pessoa pudessem servir de auto-instru??o.   E Jesus lhes respondeu: Eu também vos farei uma pergunta; se me responderdes, também eu vos direi com que autoridade fa?o estas coisas.  Donde era o batismo de Jo?o, (Mateus 21:24-27)      Por isso, lemos em Mateus 22:46 : “E ninguém lhe podia responder palavra, nem ousou alguém, a partir daquele dia, fazer-lhe perguntas”.      Opinem, por favor!
20080917051733AAr1267	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	é mais fácil acreditar naquilo que gostaríamos que fosse verdade?	Essa do FRANCIS BACON ilustra bem o fato em 1620:   "A compreens?o humana N?O é um exame DESINTERESSADO, mas recebe infus?es da VONTADE e dos AFETOS; disso se originam ciências que podem ser chamadas "CIêNCIAS CONFORME A NOSSA VONTADE". Pois um homem ACREDITA MAIS FACILMENTE NO QUE GOSTARIA QUE FOSSE VERDADE. Assim ele rejeita coisas DIFíCEIS pela impaciência de PESQUISAR; coisas SENSATAS porque DIMINUEM A ESPERAN?A; as coisas mais profundas da natureza, por SUPERSTI??O; a luz da EXPERIêNCIA por ARROG?NCIA E ORGULHO; coisas que n?o comumente aceitas, por deferência à OPINI?O DO VULGO. Em suma, inúmeras s?o as maneiras, e às vezes imperceptíveis, pelas quais os AFETOS COLOREM e CONTAMINAM o ENTENDIMENTO."

20080924092016AAGlAvY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ministério da Saúde confirma que gays n?o podem doar sangue  e agora?	22/9/2008 - 14:03   Em nota técnica na enviada na última sexta-feira, (19/09) o Ministério da Saúde confirmou que gays e homens que fazem sexo com outros homens (HSH) n?o podem ser doares de sangue. Segundo os representantes do Ministério, os grupos "mantêm conduta de risco de infec??o de doen?as como Hepatite B, C e AIDS".      A nota intitulada "Situa??o de risco acrescido para doa??o de sangue" é baseada em algumas pesquisas recentes e outras nem tanto, relacionadas à Aids. De acordo com os dados, no Brasil a Epidemia de Aids é menor que 1% na popula??o em geral, e maior que 5% em gays e HSH.      Além disso, estudos nos EUA e na Inglaterra também apontam diferen?as significantes no número de casos de Aids entre gays e entre heterossexuais. O mesmo é dito sobre a hepatite C, em uma pesquisa de 1991, "HSH pode ser considerado de risco acrescido para infec??o pelo vírus da hepatite C (VHC), apesar da via sexual n?o ser uma via efetiva de transmiss?o do vírus".      O Ministério da Saúde chega a conclus?o de que est?o inaptos para doa??o de sangue: homens e ou mulheres que tenham feito sexo em troca de dinheiro ou de drogas, e os parceiros sexuais destas pessoas; pessoas que tenham feito sexo com um ou mais parceiros ocasionais ou desconhecidos, sem uso do preservativo; pessoas que foram vitimas de estupro; homens que tiveram rela??es sexuais com outros homens e ou as parceiras sexuais destes; homens ou mulheres que tenham tido rela??o sexual com pessoa com exame reagente para anti-HIV, portador de hepatite B; pessoas que estiveram detidas por mais de 24h; pessoas que tenham colocado piercing ou feito tatuagem em lugares que n?o apresentavam condi??es de seguran?a; pessoas que tenham apresentado exposi??o a sangue ou outro material de risco biológico; pessoas que sejam parceiros sexuais de hemodialisados e de pacientes com historia de transfus?o sanguínea; pessoas que tiveram acidente com material biológico.      Antes de encerrar o comunicado, a entidade pede desculpas pela restri??o de doadores. "O objetivo n?o é a exclus?o do grupo de gays e HSH desta generosa prática; nem tampouco apoiar atitudes de constrangimentos e de discrimina??o desta natureza nos servi?os de hemoterapia".

20090202113745AAGdqHj	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Tarot interpretation?	I recently did a tarot reading for myself and asked what would become of my relationship with a friend (they are a best friend but I’m interested in them).  I did two cards, one for present relationship and the other was for the future.        For present I got the Death Card   For future I got the Chariot      I got them both reversed, which I’m not a huge believer in reversed cards, but could you tell me what this might mean?  (I’d love to hear what upright and reverse would mean in this instance).  Thanks!
20090202114020AAAWXQL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians I'm such an idiot?	First of all I didn't reach puberty until age 23 and didn't become sexually attracted to men since this last october.  There's a friend in my life who's the only guy in my life that's single.  We're both Christians and believe in saving it until marriage(he's 29 and still a virgin! proud of him!).      Anyway he knows about my problems and that I'm physically attracted to him and he's the first guy.  I got so frusterated with my battle last night that I told him in an email to end my misery because I'm still physically attracted to him and to tell me he has a girlfriend because that will surely turn me off.  I also told him it's not fair I feel this way because he's not my husband not even my boyfriend.      I just found out that telling a guy you're sexually attracted to him causes a physical response.      He's highly moral and stuff.      I'm such an idiot what response should I expect? I hope it doesn't ruin our friendship.   Now I probably got him lusting after me even though I'm not that hot like Angie Jolie.   I'm also single and a virgin.

Now my entire life I've been not overweight but also not in shape ive been unskilled, ugly, pale, and much more.  Ok my parents dont give two shits how i feel, and when ever i express any emotion they curse at me or yell at me.  Just lately i have been warned about my highblood pressure remember im only 15 and im not overweight i dont do drugs and i dont drink alcohal so i dont know how that happened.  I've never been good at anything such at basketball or baseball i mean im pretty decent at baseball but i practice hours a day and still am never anybetter then my teamates.  And this week in school where i also do poorly i have a day this week with noting but gym and sculp because of midterms so that is going to be an easy day but guess what!!!! Because of my blood pressure i have to go to the doctor and on the one day of the week that is worth living for.  Because im trying out for baseball this spring i needed to over come two of my greatest fears, putting contacts in my eyes and take pills.  Nothing in my life is right and ervytime i look foward to something right before it happenes it gets taken away like a game im looking foward to will be cancled or when i looked foward to presenting a presentation my teacher left because she was pregnent and we never got to present and even when i help people i still dont get good karma.  Like when i lended a girl homework she never gave it back and i got a zero and it almost ruined my b- which i worked crazy hard for so maybe my life isn't very good

20090204214446AAifaGw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe that your specific religion is the right one?	I believe that everyone should respect one's opinion, whether or not it is your own, but there are so many people who meaninglessly hurt one another due to differences. This is something that I don't understand about people who refuse to believe that the other person might be right, in which case I am talking about religion.      I'm, however, agnostic because I don't see any solid proof that God exists, but there isn't proof that he doesn't exist either.      Personally, I just like imagining all the possibilities, and not knowing what exactly will happen, you know?      And there is an infinite amount of possibilities that are impossible to disprove and prove, yet they could happen. Out of these possibilities lies the existence of God (or Gods) and everything is exactly like it was told through by religious “proof” like, for instance, the Bible(which was written by man). There also lies the possibility of an abrupt end for those who die and that no one or nothing is affecting or has been affecting our current lives.      I know this is a question on faith, but why the subject of a superior being? I mean, from what I experienced, God seems to have more effect on humans (although I could be wrong due to the fact that we are technically more knowledgeable than most animals). He/she/it could be an animal too! I also believe that religion might be too uncomprehendable/sane/insane for us due to being just human and since life and all of its science haven’t all been understood yet by us, then why would religion? We might not be mentally prepared for it yet or ever in this reality.      Is it fear that God will disapprove or is it because you feel that there is no other way for life to be like it is without a specific theory or “facts” in which proof is not needed?      I say this in the nicest way possible and thank you beforehand for your answers. :D

Nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's command you brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us."

20090205100545AAmCea2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The God / Parent Respect Anology Question?	I've read many postings in Yahoo! Answers that stated that God deserves the same (and even more) respect from us as do our parents, and yet I see an incredibly large number of truly horrendous parents. I know I am writing in generalizations, but life itself tends to be full of generalizations.  A large number, if not most, conceptions are for reasons of personal pleasure (sometimes forced rape) and not from people actively trying to concieve (though that too does occur). Once concieved parents often consider giving up or aborting, expecially when the pregnancy is unwanted. After birth, children are sometimes loved and provided good lives, but are on another hand sometimes severely abused and treated beyond imagining. Do the horrible parents deserve respect? I myself think, not, that instead parents are to earn the respect of their children by being good parents. This to me ties over to God (if you believe in God), allows or even places a child into the hands of such care, or makes it so a child is born alergic to their own skin, or horrible deformed and without real hope, well does such a God deserve any respect from such children (or from anyone opposed to any child being born to such crueless and then be judged for how they grow up given such unfair handicaps in life)? I again think not, but am willing to hear what others think.      Replies I've recieved on this include:      "Same? that's a kind of disbelieve in God if you respected him as your parents ,you shall respect him more ,he is Almighty"      "Earn the respect of the child... BS!! i dont have to earn the repsect of a pissy little one" ... "they need to respect me, b/c there is nothing besides the law of the land and my morals that says i HAVE to do this! please! i wish i would give my children this power over me!!!" ... "A child does not have the authority or should not have the audacity to demand anything from their parents,likewise ppl should do this for GOD, especially seeming as tho they wouldnt even be here in the first place without HIM . PERIOD!!!! IDK why some children have rough lives and some dont, and i dont go around trying to look for all the answers"      Some infants are born and immediately disposed alive in trash, or whacked on the head cause their parents have too many children, very young children are sometimes raped by their parents, or treated in very dispicable ways and everyone in society suffers as such things never quite go away.  I am glad I was never born to the self-rightious poster above.

20090205053754AAHE7Y0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why I feel that I'm going to hell; I cannot let go of my riches.?	I've been struggling with hell for many years now. I feel as if I'm a failure - condemned. I fear death for only one reason: being rejected from G-d due to my choices in life.      I feel that I'm a rich guy. I don't mean money rich, as I truly am broke most of the time (lol), but am referring to all I have in life: shelter, clothing, food, toys (computers, games, instruments), car. While I'm probably just considered the norm in the United States, I have so much more than most of the world. Yet, I sit here and put all my time into crap that really doesn't matter, e.g., upgrading my computer to play better games, working on my website to make more money, working out to physically look good.      I'm always praying, repenting, and talking to The Lord. However, I go back to doing the same crap...nothing. Sometimes I want to just give it all away. 'm engaged to be married; thus, I can't just pickup and go. What would I do? How would I survive? What would that do to my fiancee?      I was reading Matthew and was trying to absorb all the ways that Jesus wants us to live. The thing that bothered my most was something that Jesus said:      "Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter."      I feel that this partricular message is geared towards people like me; people who have much and cannot give it up.

I've asked on here before and I got a thousand different responses, and while I appreciated all of them very much, I need to know how to do this so that my Spanish teacher will accept it as the right answer. Some of the ones I was given was for way more advanced Spanish speakers, which obviously, my teacher would know that I don't know those words yet. I've used translators but can never seem to get this to come out right, and when I translated what other people told me it was, it came out being COMPLETELY way off.       Anyway, here's the sentence [yeah I know it seems simple, but it's been impossible to find the *perfect* translation] Thanks in advance!!      - I am going to fax you all the papers.

20090205101215AA5Gusd	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	S.S.I. Re-evaluation questions?	Hi everyone      I have been on S.S.I. for about 20 years now. For a number of those years, I have been doing some work from home (ie; self-employment) and have filed a tax return and faithfully sent this (and my bank statements) into Social Security each year.      This morning I received the standard "You have an appointment" letter where they want you to come into their office to re-determine your eligibility for S.S.I. and "interview" you. The letter also said that I was to bring my tax return and bank statements with me. This is pretty routine stuff and happens about every 4-5 years.      In the past, I have always called their office and spoken to an agent who was polite and friendly and just conducted the interview over the phone and that was that. I have NEVER had to actually visit their office to conduct an interview.      So I called this morning and was told that the agent I was supposed to be interviewed by was not in the office today. I told the agent I was speaking with that, as with previous years, I already had my tax return and bank statements finished and ready to be mailed in and asked if it would be possible to just conduct the "interview" over the phone as had always been the case in the past. I also told him that I had Tourette's Syndrome (which unfortunately, I do). He then replied "they want you to bring in your bank statements?" and "You'll need to come in for those". I told him I would but he didn't sound very friendly at all. Just very matter-of-fact and then hung up with so much as a "goodbye" or "have a nice day".      My question is this: Is there any way I can get out of going in for this interview?. I am extremely agoraphobic and terrified of public places. I also have Tourette's Syndrome and suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder. I have always done this over the phone and am totally unprepared and unused to this sort of thing and it frightens me. How would it be if I just mailed the materials they requested in (perhaps with a repeated request for a phone interview)?...would they STILL demand that I come in for an interview?. This is the government so certainly they must realize that some people will have special needs or certain things they are unable to do due to their disability, right?. I mean, this guy on the phone was as cold as ice. Is there some sort of formal procedure I can initiate to get this thing done over the phone?. Should I talk to a supervisor?. Write a letter?. I am really freaking out over this!.      Thanks so much for any help I can get!!      - Steve

Get your butts up early enough to make your boat, your bus, or your train and stop complaining that your ride is leaving "2mins early" as you're running to get on.  People are so damn spoiled nowadays - they expect door to door service - they want to get to work on time but w/o the work of getting up early, giving themselves ample time for traffic and/or sudden emergencies that may take up even more of a longer commute.      Why is it that people rant & rave about a certain public transportation not getting them to their jobs on time b/c of certain issues when they don't bother to do their part.. and I'm sick of hearing "well, I pay for this."  Yeah, they won't get up early for that but if there's a huge sale for merchandise you bet your life these same idiots will get up at the crack of dawn even though the stores won't open till 9AM.. and don't give me that bull, well why should I have to get up so early... well, then you shouldn't get pissed off if the train, bus, or whatever doesn't get you into work on time!      I, for one, drive my car 1mile every morning to my son's school from home, then 4 miles into work... I cannot have road rage b/c I'm stuck in traffic and I'm 30mins away from my job even though I've only 10mins to get there.. well whose fault is it?  MINE!  'cause I didn't get up earlier enough knowing that I may or may not have to anticipate for things such as these...      Sorry for ranting myself but my question is how do I politely explain to these people to just get up early....

Hello my name is Mark and I come from Israel and I want to put a lot of thought in my question    I have been asking a few similar questions here on Yahoo!-Answers but you haven't yet met the person which will reward me by granting the great "magical" words which will finally set me free from my inner mental chains as a bird which have been set free from her cage...    right now I define my religious beliefs as henotheistic and Hermetic and i see myself as a follower of the Hebrew God (I believe that the ancient Hebrews was henotheistic as well) I started converting into Judaism (or rather into becoming a Jew) I am converting to it from neo-paganism I love a lot both haShem (the God of Israel) and the Goddess in a similar way in which I love my parents as well as that I know that haShem will grant me great opportunity in my personal religious development and great blocks from it will be no more ones I will become a Jew (if of course I don't change my mind eventually in the question of - shall I become a Jew?) but yet haShem seems to be far too violent aggressive and tyranius for me (especially ones it comes to relationship with pagans which I personally see as my spiritual brothers and sisters) he completely forbids worship of any other deities beside him promising great punishments to all those both Jews and non-Jews which will disobey those words of his and have commanded to destroy with and anger any idol that we can fina along the way (don't forget that the Hebrews almost  made all the Canaanites extinct under the irrational tyranius and logical instructions of their God) but I don't want to hate him for that! there is no such thing as an evil man or God! only evil deeds! maybe I don't accept Jesus but there is one thing which he said which I liked a lot - "hate the sin which the man have done; not the man which have done the sin!" in this case the sin is jealousy as the God of the  Hebrews confessed that the only reason that he gave all those destructive instructions is only because he gave them out of jealousy! and as for me - it seems that my life would never be happy with the Goddess inside of it but yet haShem would never accept me remaining her in my life! maybe outside I act and look like a Jew but deep inside my heart I still feel pagan and it seems that it is my inner nature and i have failed to change this inner nature of mine  I see that the months past fast one passing after another together with the seasons here look - the summer have passes and the autumn and the winter is about to pass and still my flame of love towards the Goddess did not stopped yet burning... oh maybe in the spring I will find my so unreachable answer... oh great ancient Goddess of all that is true - you have blessed me with your peace intoxicated me with your love so that I no longer know what do I do or where do I turn nor do I know what is a dream and what is not! oh my memory of you have left an ever remaining mark in my soul...  there are two thing which keep me from leaving haShem - my love for him and my fear from him  sometimes when I am left all alone and I remind myself of the Gods and the Goddesses I suddenly starting dropping tears of hopelessness    I would like to bring up two simple examples for you to understand a little better how I feel    first let's look upon an example in which the motivator is fear     1 imagine yourself a random young woman not let's say she have met a man in which she felt love in with (metaphorically speaking - let's say that this woman is me and the man are the Gods) but then she find out that her parent's don't want her to marry him and instead bring her to a different reach and elder man to marry him but even though she was attracted to the man which her parent introduced to her she didn't like him as a person nor did she love him as a spouse (metaphorically speaking - let's say that this new man is haShem the parent's are personification of my love and fear towards haShem) she just continued thinking of the man that she have felt in love with but her new Husband did not let her to go to see him nor could she run away because she is afraid that her husband will find her and beat the hell out of her    now for the question - what shall that poor woman do? shall she continue living in this abusive relation ship? or shall she live all her life in fear but yet with happiness?    now let's look up into a different less violent example in which the motivator is not fear but love     2 imagine yourself a little child 7-10 years of age (metaphorically let's say that it is me) and he's parent divorced (metaphorically - the biological mother of the child is the Goddess and the biological father is haShem) the child was left to live with his father but the child loves both of his parents a lot and both of his parents love him a lot but his father as a result of hate towards his ex-wife keeps away the child from meeting his mother or even talking to her on the phone  oh sweet Lord! he e

20090205104019AA7KGgL	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Does being gay mean I have to change entirely?	I am twenty two and coming to terms with being gay.  For a long time I have been a skateboarder and avid music-listener and writer.  The first time I thought to myself that this may be who I am, I immediately considered quitting skateboarding, which I have been doing for ten years of my life.  My question is, is it wise for me to continue to be the person that I was?  I realize some things will change, especially when I move out of my hometown in the near future for college out west, but I'm terrified of being singled out as "the gay skater."  Skateboarding has meant the world to me and has assisted me through my tough adolescence, I do not want to give it up but I feel overwhelmed at the thought of only skating alone and not being able to make friends in the skateboard world because I am fundamentally different than everyone else.  Any help with this problem would be greatly appreciated.

20090205110006AA2ArZR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should airlines offer special award status to Christian airline passengers?	I propose Christian passengers have a special line for check-in, not unlike the First Class Red Carpet check-in lines at most airports.  Airlines could issue special identity cards to any Christian passenger who provides proof of membership (a letter from a pastor, priest, or reverend).  This will help the regular passengers check-in faster, making things run smoother for everyone.         I'd also be in favor of automatic seating upgrades (based on airline availability) for Christian passengers.  For example, any qualifying Christian who buys an economy class ticket would automatically be upgraded to business class if such a seat were available.  Airlines should also consider giving Christian passengers double reward miles for qualifying flights.       God bless,      Captain Art Griego

Indian Hindus, does it bother you when Westerners from the U.S. and other places become Hindus? Do you feel that Hinduism is intended only for your people? Or is it for everyone?      I ask this for a few reasons. One, I have heard someone, a Shaivite, say that when the people were made from Shiva's body, all future Hindus would descend from those people, so only Indians could really be Hindus.      Also, I am an American, but my parents named me Govinda. I have had Indians get angry with me because they insisted that this can't be my real name. This has only happened a few times, and is not what my experiences in general with Hindus have been like. But still, why are they mad?

20090205111247AAngO34	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do I leave my church?	I became involved in a close nit church about a year ago. They are a very traditional church and I have learned so much. I have been blessed to be a member of the ministry there. My issue is that we are only allowed to sing hymns. We can only play certain instruments, others are not "acceptable" to God. I started feeling the urge to move when the word was not what it use to be. The head of the church travels all over the world. He comes occasionally.  I feel that they try to tell you what to do and how to do it instead of give the word and allow it to help you in life. I always participate in church events, help with food etc. I have tried to talk to the head of our church about maybe singing some praises and speaking about some things more related to the New Testament as they base a lot of things off the Old Testament, but she always says the head says no those things are of the World, God does not recognize them. So.. I always thought different, I just maybe am a little more open minded I do not know. Anyone have advice??  I do feel I have to leave I do not agree with the strict rules that are "acceptable" to God. How do I do it without being offensive, they have done so much.  Thanks

20061102101310AAD1cMp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	DREAM interpretation?	Id like to share one of my dreams :)      What pop up in your mind if I say ***I talk to Jesus in my dream?***      1 year ago it was first time when I saw him in my dream (he was not alive back then) I SAW HIM ON CRUCIFIX ON THE ROOF OF ONE HOUSE IN MY HOME TOWN (that time I lived in abroad)      Now Im back in my country. This dream where I talked to him appeared in very morning couple of days ago so I remember all the details. Firstly, I was in forest.. Don’t know how I got there.. The story is not necessary but in that forest I suddenly saw a few people on crucifix and there were blood all over their bodies      Immediately then I relocated into my grandmums house (where I was born) and there I met HIM. He was talking straight to me we were standing in a hall and he was a bit of pushing me about something I havent done right or didn’t finish - I didn’t want to argue so I left him there and went to another bedroom. And then I woke up      Any ideas?      THANK U FOR ALL RESPONSES   Laura

20070120181017AAwsUJ5	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Should we create the "American race"?	According to the way people in the US think (80% of them, at least) if you're born in Latin America, than you're "latino race". It doesn't matter if you're 100% white by blood, or 100% black by blood. If you was born in Latin America you're "latino race". You can have blue eyes: "latino race", you can be as black as the night: "latino race". Manu Ginobili: "latino race", Sammy Sosa: "latino race", Fidel Castro: "latino race", Alexis Bledel: "latino race", Hugo Chávez: "latino race".      So as a revange I declare from now on that American is a race and that anyone that was born in the US belongs to the American race, it doesn't matter your ancestry. If you're black American and marries a black African: interracial relantionship. If you're a white American and marries a Russian: interracial relantionship. If you're a white American and marries a black American it's not an interracial relantionship.      What do you think?

Okay, like I was trekking through the hills near Istanbul with my hunky Norwegian boyfriend when all of the sudden I received a call from my pal from Barcelona who was stuck in an elevator in Amsterdam.  He was so like totally crying and stuff cuz his English is not so good and he was SO getting thirsty well anyway we flew out to AMS immediately and convinced the taxi driver to speed to the hotel, where we grabbed an ax and beat the elevator door to release Marco safely.  He looked very hot and sweat was dripping down his treasure trail like gentle mountain streams in the Cascade Mountains of Western Washington where I generally collect fresh spring blossoms for home decorations and other important stuff, well anyway we all sighed in relief and then hopped a quick 3 hour flight to Rome where we shopped for trinkets on Via Condotti and pigged out on free pastries.  Where can I get a Mohawk hair do in Rome?
