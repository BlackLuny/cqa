Respect the Germans' want of privacy and don't "invade" into their sphere unless invited; but on the other hand, if a German or German family invites you, you're expected to come and not only see that as a polite remark without meaning. Respect the Germans' sense of punctuality; being late for more than 1/4 hr (15 minutes) will be regarded as utterly inpolite, being 5 minutes early however is perfectly alright.<br>  <br>  Germans are haircut fetishists, so make sure to visit the local "Friseur" (haircutter) at least once a month. It's also a good place to pick up some local news and chatter.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Be polite.<br>  At least attempt to speak German.|`|qDWsAXxBaa	don't mention their past as in nazi and hitler and that stuff..<br>  be civilized and take a dictionary so you can learn the language.|`|6qwN9HCFaa	Good behaviour is good behaviour where ever you are.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Like most other places.
O8qdCBzLaa	According to the National Weather Service, there will be scattered showers possible through Saturday, with a high pressure ridge above the Rocky Mountains providing a slight off-shore flow out of the north for the beginning of next week. This will result in mostly sunny and dry conditions, but kind of breezy and a few degrees lower than seasonable temperatures (expect low to mid 60s during the day, low to mid 50s at night). Beyond Tuesday, it's hard to say. <br>  <br>  You might want to pack a couple pairs of shorts just because. But, you'll probably want to bring along stuff you can wear in layers (like a t-shirt with a sweatshirt over it). The coldest feeling time of day along the coast in San Diego is around sunset. The sun goes down, so you don't get that radiant warming anymore. And, there's usually a breeze that picks up right as the sun is going down that can chill you pretty good.<br>  <br>  NWS San Diego forecast discussion website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/getprod.php?wfo=sgx&sid=sgx&pil=afd" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/g...</a>|`|d65a620ecea4be6217df5949ea2966dcaa	Wow, Mission is beautiful right now.

So you can definitely wear shorts, but bring some jeans and light jacket or sweater for the afternoon.  It's not too chilly to wear flip flops or sandals in the evening though.  It hasn't been cold.

(There's usually only snow on sidewalks downtown immediately following a big snowfall.  It's typically gone within 24hrs.)<br>  <br>  I lived in Toronto for over 20 years, on and off.  I recently moved just outside the city, and it's the first time I bought proper winter boots.  Never needed 'em in Toronto.

9ef91f7e6a8d7b2bcd3d3cdd6269b4c6aa	One of the reasons that Bolongo Bay Resort is popular among visitors is that it's a mid-ranged priced hotel that offers an all-inclusive plan and is located right on the beach.  The only other all-inclusive resort in the USVI is the Wyndham Sugar Bay Beach Resort.  On a scale of lousy-excellent, Bolongo can easily rate a "fair".  It's reasonably priced and there's usually some kind of entertainment available every night.  It's a pretty good distance from the major nightlife spots.  Based on what you're looking for though, Bolongo might be just what you're looking for.  They've got a dive shop right there and lots of lounge chairs.  Shopping, not so much but you can easily catch a taxi to Havensight or Main Street where most of the shopping spots are.  Bolongo also offers massages according to their website. <br>  <br>  I think if you're looking for all those activities you're going to be hard pressed to find another spot like it at such a reasonable rate.  Still, check out the links below and you might find another interesting place to stay.

That's an awfully long drive through Mexico, probably more than a day's drive, so you'd need to stay in a hotel somewhere along the way.  When you add up the costs of gas and lodging, you have to ask yourself if you're saving it enough to make it worth the time and trouble.  You'd have more time to relax and enjoy your vacation if you fly.|`|qaAW9VN4aa	NO, never been that far myself but my  uncle used to go every year for a month or two, right now very dangerous to go to certain parts of mexico.Belize is supposed to be GREAT, have fun....
tJ0WNq9eaa	I would also suggest visiting the Sonoran Desert Museum, it is not that far from Tubac.  It is more of a zoo than a museum.  They have really cool desert animals there.  If possible try to go early in the day and on a weekend.  The animals are usually more lively before it heats up.  On the weekend they have docents that give you lots of information, plus they usually will have a snake or tarantula you could actually touch.|`|AS3y7kDAaa	Good suggestions above!<br>  <br>  I would also suggest the Titan Missile Museum at 1580 W Duval Mine Rd in Sahuarita, AZ. Sounds like that could be interesting. ;-)<br>  <br>  Have a great trip!|`|URZNtrxsaa	Tubac is a great artist's colony and twice a year, they have great weekend shows that pull people in from all over the West. Other then that time of year, there are a number of small shops that you can visit and spend time with the various artists.<br>  Depending on your age, there are several places to stay. I would however, do to recent border issues, not recommend staying in Nogales. Tucson is not that far away.

pmJ5wOilaa	I think it will - and it is - slowly resolving itself. While NI (or anywhere else) should never be pressganged into changing its status against the expressed wish of a majority of its people, the demographics are slowly starting to tilt against unionists.<br>  <br>  Over the last 30 years, the nationalist community has grown while, relatively speaking, the unionist population has shrunk. In more recent years, this process has been accelerated by the flight of many educated young unionists to England for better jobs and standard of living. (You might also speculate that they know what's coming down the line in the long-tern).<br>  <br>  The RoI certainly has enough on its plate at the moment with the recession to even give a moment's thought to reunification. It'll come, maybe in 20 year or maybe in 50, but it's coming and everyone knows it.|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	Im from the north n would consider myself a nationalist.I agree to a certain degree what you are saying but the fact is most unionists were born here to and they are entitled to their opinion as much as those who consider themselves Irish.I would love to see a united Ireland but I am prepared to consider it a long term goal.If Britain gave the north back to Ireland now I can guarantee you that many innocent people will be murdered.despite the peace process feelings here still run very deep and sectarianism is still a major problem.To unite Ireland now would result in almost definite civil war.something that the majority of both sides have had enough of.I do not agree that Irish americans are the only people that care about it.nationalism here is just as strong as it always was and the main goal is still a united Ireland.It is just that most people of this opinion are realistic enough to accept that this is a long term goal.I think that we must accommodate unionists and offer them an Ireland where they are treated equally to nationalists.An Ireland where they feel welcome and their concerns are treated like any other Citizen.There is still a lot of suspicion from unionists that will take a long time to change.You have to remember it has only been forty odd years since the civil rights movement at a time when unionists were running the show and nationalists were regarded a second class.We have had over thirty years of hatred and violence.In my opinion the biggest obstacle is segregation.I find that the most hardline are those people who have never talked to someone from the"other side" n even in this day and age some people in the north have never done that.A united Ireland at peace will only be achieved with the support of the unionist community and unfortunatly this could take generations to achieve.I do believe that one day this will happen,hopefully in my lifetime(Im26) and I look forward to seeing it,until then we have lot of obstecles to overcome|`|UkaBy2Hyaa	What 'I should be doing something else ^' said.  The UK does not own NI and it certainly can't be given to anyone.<br>  <br>  The majority of people in NI who consider themselves British are descended from people who've been living there a good 2 centuries before the Americas were conolised.   <br>  So if we're to follow your thinking all those descendants from Europe should really give America back to the original inhabitants and no longer be known as the US.<br>  <br>  As it stands today the majority of people in NI want to remain in the the UK.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  @ Anteck.

Given the Catholic/nationalist birthrates growth, at some point N. Ireland may vote to rejoin. For now, the republic does not want the financial burden, and I doubt the North wants to give up it's healthcare and social services.<br>  <br>  Northern Ireland is doing fine.

Once you have found your flights you purchase them online with a credit card and it will ask you for the travelers information. You must enter your fiance's information there, very important! You'll get a confirmation code which you can send to your fiance and they can either web check in or check in at the airport for the tickets. With a web check in up to 24 hours before the flight they can log in online and print their own boarding pass. If they go to the airport, they will need the confirmation code and they will check their luggage and get their boarding pass there.

AA10024451	Tough question. If you want to get a few souveniers for yourself or others back home, and if you plan in paying for your meals......I would say that bringing about $350 or so with you wouldn't be unrealistic. Maybe even consider an even $500 if you can manage it. Because between meals, snacks, and gifts......it's definitely not cheap there.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	I'd the cost of the park alone would bring you to 200.<br>  If you just mean food, i'd bring 150-175.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	Don't bring a lot of cash....Bring a Gold or Platinum Master Card.<br>  <br>         Loosing money really hurts the soul.......<br>  <br>         Enjoy .....|`|53e825bd7214ff8635097f3a354c0738aa	$500 should cover it, but I'd try and have another $100 in reserve just in case.

Remember you still have to plan for the evenings after the park closes.|`|NK0qVWtOaa	When I went on my class trip there, it was also for 5 days. I ended up spending about $500, but that's mostly because the meals and stuff were paid for ahead of time, only special restaurants, certain rides, snacks, and souvenirs cost anything. If you're paying for your own food, I'd bring a lot more (the food is WAY overpriced there).|`|vZaLptZWaa	I just went for 5 days as well a few mos ago. It depends on several things. <br>  <br>  Are any of your meals paid for? Think about breakfast as well. Are 2 of your days reserved for travel? Those days will cost less $. In the parks, I probably spent about $10 per meal for myself, and those were counter service burger and fries type meals.<br>  <br>  At a sit down restaurant, I spent about $20 for myself. <br>  <br>  A bottled water or soda runs about $3.50, I believe, but believe it or not, the Disney water fountains don't taste terrible. I got by on one bottle a day, refilling it from the water fountains. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, split your money accordingly. Don't be the kid who spends it all on one day with a ton of souveneirs and has no money for food the next four days! <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|XBxVoUTaaa	If you are planning on just a few souveniers, I would plan on about $20 per day. If you have to buy your meals, that is another story. Plan on $30 a day for meals if you want to just eat "counter service" (fast food style) meals. If you are going to a sit down restaurant, they usualy run around $25-35 a meal.|`|ZCt1OH6Faa	we going this summer  we already  plan   1. my husband he pay the plane tickets  and  my daughter and  I  we pay the tickets to disney world  that include park hopper  and dinner  with Characters  staying we already have place to stay and car to drive around which we were lucky there.|`|uihC5j6Laa	Being a teacher, I know how much food can cost on a trip.

PA0bGBtCaa	Well I've only flown Air Canada's "Jazz" regional carrier. It was total crap. FA's were old and stuffy and Air Canada is an old legacy airline.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	It is 70 miles by road - allow an hour and forty minutes.<br>  <br>  From Livingston, take the A71 towards Kilmarnock. On the outskirts of Kilmarnock, take the A77 towards Ayr. Be aware that there are average-speed cameras on the A77 and the courts take a harsh line with those speeding along the A77. Do not follow the signs into Ayr, but continue on the A77 towards Stranraer. <br>  <br>  There are series of roundabouts on the Ayr by-pass. Look out for the last one (junction with the A713).<br>  <br>  Continue on the A77. About a quarter of a mile from the roundabout you pass under a railway bridge on a sweeping left hand bend. Just beyond that, there is a junction coming in from the right. Ignore that one, but take the next right (100 yards ahead).<br>  <br>  This is Doonholm Road. At the next roundabout, take the first exit. At the end of that road, turn left. Immeadiately after going over the Alloway bridge, turn right. At the end is another roundabout.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	This is the million dollar question for everyone has a different opinion on it.<br>  <br>  My husband gets motion sick and the higher up you go the more you feel the ship sway.  His favorite room is oceanview or the lowest of the balconies.<br>  <br>  For those that get motion sick, the middle of the ship is the best location as you don't fee the sway as much as you do on the ends.  However in my opinion the aft is the best.  That's the dining room I always seem to be in, that's the pool I prefer to lay out at, so aft is closer to everything.<br>  <br>  I say distance to the elevator is important.  The best room is about 4 rooms away from the elevator since when I run back to my room to change or put down my souvenirs or whatever, it's easier to get to.  <br>  <br>  I know another frequent cruiser and good friend of my family judges his room based on the distance to the casino as that's where he is all the time.  But tons of people hate being near the casino as the noise is going all the time.<br>  <br>  Have you been on a cruise ship before?  Have you been on a balcony?  B/c honestly I spent no time on my balcony so I don't think it's worth the extra 86.  I drank coffee on it and after I got slightly sunburned, I sat out there for an hour or two so that I could still be outside without being in the sun.  Some people leisurely get up.  They order their room service every day and drink their coffee on their balcony, then begin to get dressed.  My husband and I want to go to the omelet station so we jump up and throw on bathing suits and get out of the cabin in about 20 minutes.  We never seemed to be on the sunset side either to watch the sunset from our balcony.<br>  <br>  So my verdict is not worth the extra $86 unless you already know you are a balcony lover.|`|94b8KImYaa	Obstructed view means you will be looking at the side of a life-boat  - and if you are lucky you are at the end or beginning of the life-boat you see a little bit of ocean. If you are unlucky you are looking at a white painted wall with the name of the ship on it. <br>  <br>  For 86 dollars I would go for the unobstructed. <br>  Maybe you want to ask how much a balcony would be - which is really nice to have. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your cruise|`|O8qdCBzLaa	As someone else said, an obstructed view can be anything from a support post to an entire lifeboat. If you want to know for sure, you can call the cruise line and ask them what the obstruction is. They may be able to tell you.<br>  <br>  If you can't find out for sure, you can check the deck plans. Usually, the lifeboats are on the 5th or 6th deck up (they call them different things on different cruise lines). If it's the 7th deck, it may be the top of a life boat. If it's the 8th or 9th, it's probably a post.<br>  <br>  If you're still concerned about it after all that, pay the extra money for the peace of mind.<br>  <br>  BTW - with the exception of things like owner's suites and other luxury penthouse suites, the best cabins on a ship are usually the ones on the back of the ship on the corner. These are usually pretty big rooms (like 350+ square feet) with huge (like 250+ square feet) wrap-around balconies. And, they cost as much as the larger suites on the sides of the ship. But, you get more of a panoramic view with the wrap-around balcony. Also, you don't get the wind like the side of the ship, because the ship itself blocks it.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	It depends on the obstruction. <br>  We book deck 9 on the radiance. It looks over the life boats, no we can't look straight down at the water but that's OK with me. <br>  We always try to be at least inside the water tight doors away from the main elevators and center of the ship. close to everything yet far enough away from the noise.|`|udBbXjHZaa	the higher levels are better ! hehe you are closer to the pool and all the main dining rooms and other attractions. I'd say it is worth the 86$ ...|`|X6rFPI2laa	Pay the $86!  It is worth all that and more!  You will NOT regret it!|`|SbU5nZFXaa	Ideally the level that has the least amount of traffic, with a room facing the ocean.  Each cruise ship is different so ask a travel agent or cruise line.<br>  <br>  Obstructed view means you won't be able to sea the ocean from you room.  It may have a post or half wall in front of it.  I'd pay the extra 86 bucks if that is in total, however if it's per night i;d wouldn't bother and just go sit outside.|`|XBulMn2zaa	Anja is correct if it were an oceanview, but obstructed in balcony is only obstructed by a wall on the side, not straight out.  When you get to the really highest levels, the ship gets smaller so then you feel more motion.  staying as close to the middle as you can is best.  Up and down as well as front to back|`|AA12023907	I suggest you go to the cruise line's website and look at the deck layouts for the ship you will be sailing on. <br>  I prefer a balcony cabin in the middle section of a ship and at least one deck above the main activity level.|`|SRIaRm08aa	I would personally choose the unobstructed view and pay extra.  You may be disappointed with the obstruction.  A great view is always the best. Decks really are not that important to me but If I am offered an upgrade I always take it.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	the higher the better.|`|bNrrTyrQaa	well all the activities on board cruise ships are pretty much on top.

2Ypig4jBaa	The dunes near Monterey are unique. They are large and there all year long.  Great for hang gliding.<br>  <br>  There may be some closer ones in Santa Cruz.  Just beware that these are seasonal.

If you get tired of the pools, beach, water activities, gym, and several bars, you can take a water taxi to town or the concierge can find dozens of day trips all across the area.  Take a taxi to the ferry at Red Hook for a trip to St Johns and the beaches there to take a trip to the top of the island for an unparalleled view.   Or, you can take a short flight to St. Croix on a sea plane and gamble at the casino.

blXHn3mIaa	Well lets see,Hmmm So you wanna go shopping in NYC there are so many store to choose from especially on fifth avenue as far as eating goes it depends on what kind of food you like if you like Italian i suggest that you go down to little Italy in lower Manhatten and walk down Mulberry street you will find many good Italian resturants to choose from although i myself being from NYC and being a Taxi Cab driver would strongly suggest Either La Mella (little Apple in Italian ) or Umberttos Clam House these are two of the best resturants around the food is great and the prices are very reasonable. It really doesn't matter what kind of cusine you perfer you can find it in NYC also my i suggest trying both one of the hot dogs from the push carts and try the arab food from the stand at 49st & 6th avenue its really good unless you like spicey get the yellow rice with the yogert sause ask for the combo its chicken and lamp really good|`|AoSwtrOyaa	eat a lot of food like pizza .|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Will this list help?<br>  <br>  Landmarks<br>  <br>  -Empire State Building<br>  -Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island<br>  -Rockefeller Center and the Top of the Rock Observation Deck<br>  -Times Square (no trip is complete without a visit to the"Crossroads of the World")<br>  -Lower Manhattan/Wall Street Area<br>  -United Nations<br>  -Central Park<br>  -Brooklyn Bridge (you can walk across it too)<br>  -Grand Central Terminal (largest railroad terminal in the country)<br>  -A Ride on the Staten Island Ferry (its free and you can see the Statue of Liberty as the ferry crosses the harbor)<br>  -Sightseeing tour on a Double Decker Bus<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Uk7JUrSwaa	Hi<br>  <br>  i would definitely say if you like shopping then go to the woodbury common factory outlet which is a 40 minute journey from the city.

9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, How lucky are you, i have been travelling to Cyprus for the past 20 years i love it, and even though i have visited other places i still have to make my yearly pilgrimage to Cyprus. I usually stay in Pernera it's right near Protaras, but i have to visit Larnaca the shopping in Larnaca is great you can get some real bargains, The church of St. Lazarus in Larnaca is well worth a visit, and if you walk round the church you will see a tiny graveyard that has British and Americans buried there, it is hot all year round in Cyprus The hottest months are June July August and September. The Cypriots love children and they are lovely people they make you very welcome, I have many Cypriot friends go and have a good time, i love watching the planes going into Larnaca airport. If you would like any more information on Cyprus you can email me.|`|zTOqKD9Baa	i got in at larnaca airport : ) went about may time, it was SO hot literally haha.

YPHaQ1asaa	Tourist buys a condo from a Thai owned company.  The condo is substandard with lots of problems.   The owner of the condo complains in the local newspaper and files a law suit against the builder.  The case is going to court the next day.  The condo own is killed in front of his house.  The killer is caught and states the builder's wife paid him to kill the condo owner.  The wife is caught at the Cambodia border trying to escape. <br>  <br>  Some of the facts here have been changed but the main story is true not just a scenario.<br>  <br>  p.s.  A tourist can not own land in Thailand.  But they can own a condo if the development is at least 51% Thai owned.  And the tourist can not own a condo on the ground floor.|`|AA10254694	Many times a foreigner who is married to a Thai has money to buy land and a local does not.  The local see a piece of land that may have been in the family at one time or is near the family land and begins saving to buy only to have a foreigner and his wife come in an snap it up.  This causes grief and resentment and can lead to feuds.  The foreigner doesn't always understand the communal situation and only considers the business deal.  This is not to blame the foreigner but I have seen Thais very angry over land issues.  <br>  <br>  The issue is also because foreigners see a piece of land maybe a rai (.5 acres) and it is priced at 170,000 baht ( the owner wishes he could get that but never expects to get it) Thais know he will sell for 100,000 to 120,000 and then this farang buys it for full price.  The Thai know the owner paid 80,000 and is only willing to pay 100,000 so when they see the Farangs paying 170,000 they are mad because it make them think the Farang are driving the price up and when you earn 6-7000 baht a month how will you ever be able to by a 100,000 piece never mind a 170,000 piece of land.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	Why would a conflict occur? Most Thais are very happy with foreigners owning a condo. Foreigners are happy to own a condo. Conflicts happen, as they do elsewhere. That's why we have laws to regulate them. <br>  <br>  There won't be a conflict over land, as foreigners cannot own land.|`|AA11390623	well, foreigners cannot buy land here - - also, the tourists tend to congregate in very small, pin prick on the map locations.

f9No4eRBaa	June should be good warm weather (may have some rain)<br>  July and August is the hottest time of year and the best time to visit.<br>  Shopping is everywhere, depends what you want and how much money you want to spend. If you're rich, they have the high end stores ie: Tiffanies, Hermes etc.  to good average price shopping.<br>  Downtown Robson Street (Off Burrard) has some unique stores and then you have the big box malls everywhere.<br>  - White Rock is neat to see and walk along the main drag which parallels the ocean. White Rock is situated along the US border on the Canadian side. It's a nice tourist spot, nice beach, tourist type souvenier shopping (similar to Gas town in Vancouver).<br>  <br>  The Best beach in all of Canada is called "Wreck Beach"  <a href="http://www.wreckbeach.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wreckbeach.org/</a><br>   This beach is situated below the University of British Columbia and is the only officially legal recognized nudist/clothing optional beach in Canada. You will not get arrested for being naked and the police are down there all the time checking for open liquor etc. You will find up to 10,000 people there on a hot weekend (Sunday) and there will be more people there than all the beaches put together. You will see families with children, couples, single (alone) girls and guys. You will see groups of young university students laying naked and studying (girls and guys).<br>  There are all types of clothing and unclothed people and I would estimate it be: 60% fully nude, 25% topless and 15% bathing suits.<br>  A single girl can be and feel safe on this beach. The locals keep an eye out for single girls and if anyone is bugging them. If a pervert or wierdo surfaced, it's community justice and they are run off the beach (and possibly assaulted and told never to come back).  YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS BEACH TO BELIEVE IT !!! and probably no different than in Southern France or Spain.<br>  <br>  Have fun in Vancouver this summer.|`|r7bmz65eaa	For shopping, the two main malls are City Centre, and Metrotown (Metrotwon has over 400 stores and is the second largest mall in Canada.

p7ZdohGTaa	One way to tell the areas that might be better is to look into the school systems. School systems are rated and usually better areas have better schools. Try using a realtor to help you. Then, if you find an area you are interested in, drive around at different times of the day. If you find a neighborhood you might like, go there and walk around during the late afternoon or early evening. If you don't like how you feel as you walk around, find another place to be. We live in Michigan, but not in that area. Realtors should be of some assistance.
QmfKV651aa	I live in Edmonds, right next to Lynnwood. I'm 18 and go to Meadowdale High school. <br>  <br>  Lynnwood is great for the most part but you want to avoid what we call "Gheto-dale" Its in the Meadowdale area by highway 99 and its a really trashy area. <br>  <br>  If you want a more homey feel I would recommend somewhere in Edmonds, not Lynnwood. There are really great neighborhoods in the Edmonds area. Try looking near Seaview Elm. Lynnwood is a lot busier with lots of stores and bigger roads. Edmonds is mainly neighborhoods and its a lot safer for kids to play outside. I live in a cul-de-sac and when i was a kid i would always be outside ridding my bike and playing with the neighbors. <br>  <br>  I went to Seaview Elementry which is a GREAT school. All the teachers are amazing, and the parents are really involved in the school. Edmonds Elementry is also really good and so is Meadowdale Elm. Beverly Elm. is also pretty good, but I think Edmonds and Seaview are the two best.<br>  <br>  <br>  Meadowdale Middle gets sorta a bad rap. I think that middle school is a hard time in general. The school is really old, and there are a few not so good teachers. College Place middle is also not so great. Between the two I would say that Meadowdale middle is better. But at least middle school only lasts two years.<br>  <br>  <br>  Meadowdale High is great. I really don't have any complaints and I like all the teachers. Edmonds-Woodway is also really good. <br>  <br>  Just please do not have your kids go to Lynnwood High. It's absolutely horrible. The school is literly falling apart. There are always huge fights and the drop out rate is high. When you see what Edmonds-Woodway looks like and then you see Lynnwood High, you'll see its like two completly different worlds.<br>  <br>  So anyway, try looking on the outskirts of Downtown Edmonds for that "clean homey area". By the way Downtown Edmonds is a really cute little town. I love going to the beach by the ferry. And there is this tiny little movie theater called the Edmonds Theater. If you do move here you have to go to the Edmonds Theater to see a movie and then go across the street to the Edmonds Bakery. And there is this awesome Mexican restraunt just down from the Theater. And I love going to the coffee down the street- its the best place to read. I could talk about downtown Edmonds forever.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy living here. And if you have any more questions you can email me- ferrrra@yahoo.com|`|MVVQrEasaa	The short answer is that it "all depends" - like many cities Lynnwood has nicer areas and not-so-nice areas.<br>  <br>  Lynwood is in Edmonds school district, including Edmonds, Lynnwood and Mountlake Terrace.  You can look up school statistics here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/schoolguide/" rel="nofollow">http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.c...</a><br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that a school is always more than the statistics - you can have a fantastic teacher at a "so-so" school, and can have a poor teacher at a "great" school.  Plus what may be "good" by my child may be a bad fit for your kids.  You get the idea!!<br>  <br>  The areas in Lynnwood east of I-5, the town of Briar, up by Mill Creek off of 164th benefit of being associated more with Mill Creek, Briar and Bothell which are generally considered "nicer" areas to live.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1c3a5b0a0832a2929d4405d20fc70602aa	i used to get my drugs from lynnwood........ back before i got clean and sober|`|EudQsAPdaa	i live in lynnwood and i like living here. Its a safe area because theres less crime than other cities like in everett. There's a mall thats called alderwood mall its pretty big it has alot of stores. its a clean area and almost all people are nice.
kgBPU4xxaa	Your best bet is the train. Personally, I would recommend the night train that leaves the Paris Bercy station at 6:52 pm and arrives in Florence at 7:13 the next morning. The travel time is a little longer, but you're using time you would normally be sleeping anyway. If you buy tickets early enough to get the discounted SMART price, you can get a berth in a 6 bed compartment for 35 euro (45 for a 4 bed compartment). Note that you will not have to pay for a hotel/hostel for the night if you take this train. I use this night train when going to Paris for the weekend from Bologna.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=3fdbe14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/i...</a>|`|dBRc4MX8aa	I adivse strongly against a bus or coach, I went from South East England to Northern Spain via the entire length of France and it took 24 and a half hours! Trains are far more efficient and have better facilities, the coach I was on was completely filled (49 people) and the air was stuffy, the seats were uncomfortable, the toilet flush was broken so there was a strong odour eminating from the toilet and for safety reasons we could have total darkness which made it hard to sleep.|`|5OII4iaUaa	oh stay away from buses. they are a nightmare. slow... traffic conjestion... way too hot.<br>  <br>  i advise the train... even even if it means that little bit of extra cash. plus ul be there in half the time...

wzM5WB8Xaa	Do you have a SIN card yet? If not, you will need to go to Service Canada and apply for one. I used to work for the HRSDC running a progam called Hire a Student during the summer. It starts in May. If you go down to your Service Canada location and ask to sign up for the Odd Job Squad, one of the people who runs the program will call you to do odd jobs around your neighbourhood. The only requirement to sign up is that you are either between 12 and 18 or you are a student (if you are older than 18). It's great experience for your resume.|`|NWopkX4baa	McDonalds.

The further you book in advance the cheaper the fares. www.eurostar.com<br>  They also do inclusive deals for train travel plus hotels|`|irljnVkAaa	The London Eye is an absolute must. The views across the city are superb. Taking a boat trip along the Thames is also worth doing, you can get a great view of some of the sights without much effort. I would definitely recommend going to the Tower of London, it is full of history and is really interesting, plus you get to see the crown jewels which are fantastic. The museums are good for when it rains, which it does quite a lot here, plus they are mostly free. Buckingham palace is very boring, its not worth doing. The open top bus tours are quite good for seeing a lot of the sights in a day. Getting to Paris takes two and a quarter hours by train, so you can do it in a day, but it is probably worth spending a night. I don't know the prices, search for Eurostar to find out.

Japantown seemed a little better.. use the link above, www.booking.com and then if you don't have a car, what I usually do is book through Hotwire.. you can get a 4 star for a good price if you let them choose it for you.. the downer is they have good 4 stars (on most trips it ended up being a Sheraton) and good ones, but the parking tab was steep.. what you can do is call the Sheratons around San Fran and ask what is the fee and you will get a good idea and then you can book in that area. If you go on Hotwire, choose a 4 star over a 3 star cause they need to get rid of more 4 stars (more available) and therefore, better deals for $10 more.. :) Good luck.|`|jGUkh1iAaa	I manage a small boutique hotel (ww.alpinemotorinn.com) in Daly City...right on the edge of San Francisco.

47eca288b7cf9a8664fc08a02872370eaa	You're likely going to Anchorage (Fort Richardson, Elmendorf AFB) or Fairbanks (Ft Wainwright, Elieson AFB).  They are both fair-sized cities with frequent jet service, supermarkets, Walmart, McDonalds, etc.<br>  <br>  Gasoline will be more expensive - currently about $2.35 and it generally as been running about $0.50-0.80 more than in the 48 states.<br>  <br>  Dry goods (flour, pants, electronics) aren't much more.  Maybe 10% more because it really doesn't cost much to transport things by ship/rail/truck.<br>  <br>  Fresh produce is older (less fresh) and more expensive than on the West Coast.  1-2 days older and $0.50-1.00 more per pound.<br>  <br>  Rentals all depend on where you're coming from.  It would seem cheap compared to SF or NYC, but expensive compared to Detroit or some other very depressed area.  It is important to note whether utilities are included.  At -20F, you will be paying a lot to heat any place and you should insist on seeing last year's utility bills as a basis for your budget.<br>  <br>  The one thing that is a huge bargain, you probably can't take advantage of.  Land - truly spectacular parcels with fabulous views - is much, much less than it would be anyway else.  Especially if you are willing to live a little bit out of town.  That was a big draw for us.<br>  <br>  Cars cost almost exactly the same.  A few car dealers are competitive in their prices.  Others aren't.  If you're trying to economize, I'd encourage you to consider a small compact car.  Anyone can pull you out of a snowbank if you're in a small car.  If you're in a F-350, you're screwed until someone really big comes along.  It sucks to hit a moose or a another car when you in a Corolla, but when it's happened to my family, everyone walked away.  More importantly, in a compact car, you don't roll-over like you do in a high-centered SUV.  When I compare the accident stats, the bigger risk is the roll-overs, not the collisions.<br>  <br>  The biggest variable will be boy toys.  Shotgun, rifle, snowmachine ("snow mobile" in the 48 states), fishing gear, boat, etc.  While the biggest attraction is all the recreation and sportman's opportunities, it is also a time and money suck.  The trick, IMO, is to be the best possibly buddie to come along.  Bring a cooler of beer and help hump that moose out to the road.  You'll come our far ahead if you come along on someone else's boat / truck / four-wheeler than if you buy your own toys.|`|F8Ac1pPNaa	This would be a good link for you to look at. Gas is currently $2.46 in Fairbanks. As the last person stated, it depends on where you're re-locating from. But overall, AK is average to below average cost wise in the big ticket items, compared to major cities in the Lower 48.<br>  <br>  Fuel and housing are the biggest costs. And since you're military, you probably have that paid, so rest easy!<br>  <br>  The whole sight would probably interest you since you'll be going there. Nice pics.<br>  <br>  Good luck

9iqIH8yXaa	It would have to be Bali. I had the most romantic time there with my first husband and hope to re-visit with my second husband. And no, I did not do anything dodgy to my first hubby (lol). He is alive and well when I last saw him. Back to the point, Bali is so spiritual, magical, traditional and peaceful. We took a sunset cruise out to the open seas, dined below decks and danced to live music on the open rooftop. Followed dancing dolphins along the bow and watched the sunset over the horizon. We travelled through terraced paddy fields to visit temples and shrines. The best one is the Tanah Lot Temple. In the day it sits on a mound when it's low tide and you can walk up to it. Once it gets to sunset, the tide comes in and floods the mound. What you then see is the temple 'floating' in the middle of the ocean. It is so beyond words to watch this whole transformation in slow motion.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I think it's Ireland, but then I am biased because I live in a lovely rural area and you should have seen the snow today, it was so pretty .... it's bloody MARCH!!!!

It is in Provence. It’s a medieval Village literally carved in to stone. It is the kind of place one imagines as a child while reading a fairytale. We couldn’t believe people actually live there, it is like they live in a 'storybook town.' Indescribable and a must visit if you are ever in that region. A friend told me that I must visit this place while in France, we always missed the chance, but, we were so glad when we finally made it there. I will never forget this place or the friend who suggested that I "MUST SEE."|`|qphLJRXAaa	As strange as this may sound I think that is Bulgaria, because its a small but beautiful country and a lot of potential to become a favourite tourist destination for loads of people all around the world.|`|icOhmcyraa	Italia probably =]<br>  <br>  Espcially Venice, Florence, or Rome =D

Fm5YsQnfaa	I agree other people's opinions are useful but I suggest that you take a close look at any area yourself before making a long term commitment to live there.<br>  <br>  A lot of areas are lively during the day but not at night, you may be happy to live there and take a taxi when you want to go out in the evening. Or you may find them too dull.<br>  <br>  Some places are quiet during the day but only a short bus ride away from the shops, in the evening and night they come alive. You may prefer this sort of life, or find it too noisy when you want to be quiet.<br>  <br>  Sadly, the contents of your bank account may also have to make the decision for you.|`|maVptaMZaa	Camden Town is a great area for socialising there is everything there.

I used to live there, it was pretty decent, and you're close to the center of town and Angel, an area with lots of pubs/shops/and movie theaters.

bNrrTyrQaa	Yes cafe promenade is included in ur cruise! But all of the specialty restraunts,  and bars r im afraid not included! <br>  <br>  But trust me between the buffet the dining room and cafe promenade u will be very stuffed :D!<br>  <br>  Have a great time! Voyager is one of the best out on the ocean!|`|b1w5FUGzaa	they have some specialy restaurants that you have to pay to eat at, but the promenade is free except ben and jerry's ice cream.  Johny Rockets is free !  room service is free too but you have to tip the server.  Trust me the dinning room serves great food and so does the lido deck, and there are free midnight buffets and snack times throughout the day, plus you will probably eat when you're offshore too (you have to pay for that though).  Have fun !
MPavjXO6aa	Hale'iwa has Matsumoto's Shave Ice, voted best in the Islands by the travel channel. Some good places to eat are there as well (Kua Aina Burger, Rosie's Cantina) as well as a few shrimp shacks and other places. You'll see bbq trucks near the courthouse on weekends, and there are lots of little shops in the area. If you go down Kam Highway a little to the other end of town, you can get to the beach and the marina. There is Hale'Iwa Joe's there to eat great seafood as well. Like posted before, Waialua is just a sleepy town. not much to see or do unless you want to visit a candle factory.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Haleiwa. It's a colorful little town (buildings) and encompasses old Hawaii. I've never been to Waialua. In fact I probably passed by it going up to that side and didn't even know haha!|`|Xoooc2K1aa	I would suggest you visit Haleiwa since there are more places to eat there and it has more of a historic feeling to it than Waialua does.  That said however, you can more than likely visit both places on the same day since they are relatively close to each other and there isn't really much to do in either town other than eating and looking at the waves.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you.......good luck and happy travels!|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	Hale'iwa is a small historic town with restaurants and nice beaches....Waialua is a small town west of Haleiwa, used to be a sugar cane town,,,nothing mouch to do there.   bypass that area and then youre in Mokul'iea,,,,where they filmed LOST.|`|MmgNDqOQaa	haleiwa it has the best shave ice
5L6z92Iqaa	Depends on the TA you go through. Alot of them merely make the reservations for you and you will need some sort of plastic to check yourself into the flight and hotel. <br>  <br>  In this business plastic is plastic and doesn't really make a difference to us. It will however make a difference to you since alot of times there are authorizational charges that will strip your debit account until the money had been released- which is why Credit Cards are usually better on you.<br>  <br>  If the TA is getting paid by you and then turning around and paying the hotel with their own money you should be aware that they are getting a MUCH better rate and then charging you alot more than what that rate is. In this case if you feel like paying them cash go for it but they might still request card information for security reasons.
hPdEZ4Ypaa	Yes, definately do that. <a href="http://cruisecritic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cruisecritic.com/</a> click on boards, joining is free, click on Carnival Roll Calls, then click on your ship, then go through the threads and find your sail date.

AA11786831	Times have changed. Nowadays there are an increasing number of women 'out of the kitchen' and in a managerial position.<br>  <br>  Here are some facts. Some prove that things are changing, others - not so fast. <br>  <br>  There has never been a female president.<br>  in the army, women are refered to by the masculine titles (Capitan, instead of Capitana)<br>  Last year Colombia had their first lady General - in history. <br>  When it comes to news broadcast, Women are favoured over men. in most channels.Check the La Noche link<br>  Women make less money than men by 22%<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember, it is COLOMBIA not Columbia. Thanks. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wJxtkqXiaa	In COLOMBIA men and women are treated equally, they both can have the same jobs and they both can vote and they can have as high position in their jobs (except probably in the army where only a few women have passed to be generals) Colombia has many different music (Others than Juanes and Shakira!) we have cumbia, vallenato and mapale (look for them in youtube to see how each is danced) And just if you didn't know, no, NOT every Colombian family consumes\produces drugs. Not everyone has familiars in the jungle! By the way.. it is a beautiful place (with its exceptions, just as any other place in the world )

For instance the RV63 is listed as closed between Geiranger and Langvatn on the statens vegvesen at the moment and the Rv15 as snow and ice covered around Stryn fjell.  These conditions might get better, but it could be May before all the roads are fully open and free from snow and Ice.
DnyyyGeEaa	Your going to have so much fun! I am 23 and I will be there in July with the same age group. So I am going to have to look at the ideas that you get. But anyways we have been there before and we think its fun to stay every night at a different hotel to see it all lol. There are SO many fun night clubs down there that you will find. I would recommend the night show at the Excalibur its about these hot guys that do a jausting contest and you eat food like in the olden days. Its only 60.00 for the show and it includes dinner. That was fun and at night alot of the hotels have parties at there pools in the summer those are fun. There is this show called Down Under and its like male dacers that looks good!|`|JV0i77uiaa	There is a lot casinos to play, wonderful shows (the best) I would recommend the best Bally Hotel the show''s name Jubilee is beautiful where you can see how the Titanic when it was sinking.  See the Bellagio Hotel is one of the beautiful one, Cesar Palace Hotel got a shopping mall inside that look as if you were in Italy.  Avoid places as downtown at night or isolated places.  You will get tire walking in the street and seeing so many casinos.|`|j7vfbwVUaa	There are lots to do in Vegas. It all depends on what you girls like.

All of the nightclubs at the Palms seem like what you are kind of looking for. Playboy Club, Rain, Ghostbar, and Moon are all really cool, hip, trendy places...without being over the top snooty. I actually came across a great pass where you can pay for one price and go to ALL of those clubs at one price! A general admission pass like this is only $48 bucks ahead of time and it is for the more popular nights of Friday and Saturday, which is great because you can get right in! TAO is another great option that you might like. It is a VERY popular nightclub frequented by celebrities, without being too "snooty" and over-the-top.<br>  <br>  The "beaches" and pools also have great pool parties that you all will want to head to. Rehab at the Hard Rock is a definite must for you all! It is one of the hottest pool parties on the Strip. Also, Wet Republic is one of the newer "nightclub pool" experiences that you will want to check out! TAO Beach is also a really cool experience!<br>  <br>  A fun during the day activity could be Stripper 101. It sounds sleezy...but it is a TON of fun! Especially with a group of your closest girl friends. It is a work out centered around pole dancing. It is girls only...so you all can go crazy and have a great time all together. I did it last time I was out in Vegas and it was a BLAST!|`|mPtzaWUpaa	There is one bar right on your doorstep if you are staying at New York New York - Coyote Ugly bar!! <br>  Other things I recommend are the Bellagio fountains, The Pirate show at TI, Grand Canyon and Skywalk, Go and see a show - there is a great ticket place along by the M&M shop that gives big discounts on shows the next few nights.

It is quite simple imo opinion, it is not worth the risk, sure maybe they can go and return safely but why risk it?<br>  ------------------------<br>  Article:<br>  March 2, 2009<br>  NUEVO PROGRESO, MEXICO - On a typical day last week, people crowded the walkway in front of the Ay Jalisco restaurant and packed the Red Panty bar while sipping margaritas and joking about drink specials along Nuevo Progreso’s main drag.<br>  <br>  machine-gunMeanwhile, about 30 feet south of the Mexican checkpoint, soldiers armed with assault rifles were ready to pull the trigger at a moment’s notice.

Have you not been paying attention? The Border towns from Tijuana to Matamoros are a free fire zone with drug cartels kidnapping and murdering with no restraint. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by claims that this town or that town is safe. None of them are safe. The police who claim that the the same ones who have been run out of the others. When the going gets tough, the cops get going (in the opposite direction).|`|wwB3csfYaa	No. My sisters best friend just left there a human duffle bag. <br>  She got up to use the restroom and never came back.

Do not let them go!<br>  Now the milatary staff is not allowed to go there, I have friends stationed in San Deigo who have wanted to go but are not being allowed.|`|gk0hS8THaa	NO WAY!!! My friends live in Tijauana, and they say the government told the residents that if they did not have to leave their homes, not to do so. It is very dangerous right now. DO NOT LET THEM GO!!!
1ViGcF3xaa	I think you will have a tough time finding someone to rent their private property and then throw a party there for 200 people without the owner having any control!<br>  <br>  So if you can't find one my suggestion is Steep Hill Beach which is part of the Crane Estate in Ipswich, MA.  These beautiful grounds or the great house can be rented for weddings and it's right on the ocean.  You can't choose your own caterer but they have a list of exclusive caterers to choose from.

pcHp7Dgkaa	I assume you're asking about a working holiday visa, but it depends on which one you're eligible for as to how much time you have available. Neither visa takes very long to be issued, so I'd suggest something like 6 weeks before your date of departure. If you get it too early, your circumstances can change and the validity dates can't be extended or deferred.<br>  <br>  The 417 Working Holiday visa for people from the UK, Canada, European countries etc gives you 12 months from the date of grant to enter the country.<br>  <br>  The 462 Work And Holiday visa for people from the USA, Malaysia etc gives you only 3 months from the date of grant to enter the country.<br>  <br>  In each case, the 12 months of the visa itself start from when you enter Australia|`|8cfvN5voaa	right, you got 12 months to enter the country from the date of issue.

fNwgiSFYaa	One word comes to mind when I hear Ritz Carlton Cancun and that word is OVERRATED!  Don't get me wrong as it is nice, but it's not as great as people rave about.  You have to look into other things than just a quality name, which people do and they base their reviews on that.  Most people just aren't experienced travelers.  If you are traveling to Mexico then you should experience a true Mayan style resort.  If you want a Ritz then you can go to any large city and stay in one.  As far as saying there is no comparison is sheer ignorance.  The Fiesta Americana Grand Coral is a 5+ star resort that has been featured on the Travel Channel's top ten resorts of the Mexican Caribbean for over 10 years (The Ritz did not even make the top 25).  You'll find a true Mayan style theme at the Fiesta Americana.  It's also a member of the Leading Hotels of the World and a AAA five diamond award winner.  It has 5 restaurants and 5 bars, in which 3 are swim-up bars.  A 600 ft. multi-level pool and not to mention it sits on a bigger section of beach.  As far as it being crowded well that just depends on the time of season you go.  ALL hotels in Cancun are crowded during peak travel season so you can't complain/base reviews on that.  If you want to capture the true essence of a Mexican vacation in Cancun the stay at the Fiesta Americana.  You won't be disappointed.|`|zx5zzf53aa	The Ritz Carlton...... there is really no comparison.... Trust me, I have been to Cancun many, many times and I can tell you that the Ritz is absolutely the nicest in Cancun with Le Blanc Spa Resort coming in a close second. The Fiesta Americana was just too BIG!!!! Don't get me wrong, it was nice, but there were so many people crowded everywhere it was hard to relax. By "the one that is by the riz" I assume you mean either the JW Marriot or The Le Meridian. Both of these are nice but the Ritz will always me my favorite in Cancun.<br>  <a href="http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d152886-Reviews-Ritz_Carlton_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html" rel="nofollow">http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hot...</a><br>  <a href="http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d154868-Reviews-Le_Blanc_Spa_Resort-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html" rel="nofollow">http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hot...</a><br>  <a href="http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d152681-Reviews-Fiesta_Americana_Grand_Coral_Beach_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html" rel="nofollow">http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hot...</a>
VxfyQZ2jaa	Things to do in New Orleans (meeting people is up to you, but we tend to be friendly):<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival are world famous events, but New Orleans hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year:  www.nola.com/festivals<br>  <br>  The Saint Charles Streetcar is the oldest continuously operating street railway in the world and is a "tourist attraction" in its own right.  It is part of the public transit system, as are the Canal Street and Riverfront streetcar lines:  www.norta.com<br>  <br>  There is always music, but the bands change: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music. <br>  <br>  Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.<br>  <br>  An incomplete guide to bars & clubs:   www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com<br>  <br>  About certain alcoholic beverages:  Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor.  They don’t necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.<br>  <br>  Wander around the French Quarter, enjoy the architecture, watch the street entertainers (do tip), and visit some of the historic buildings that have been turned into museums (go to www.frenchquarter.com and click on Historic Attractions).<br>  <br>  Assuming the weather is good, you can collect a sandwich lunch and eat in the riverfront park (watch the shipping) or in Jackson Square (a very nice park). <br>  <br>  The Riverwalk shopping center has an air-conditioned food court with dining overlooking the river (www.riverwalkmarketplace.com).  The Canal Place shopping center is in the French Quarter and has a cinema and higher-end shopping (Saks 5th Avenue, Brooks Brothers, etc.).  Magazine Street is a miles-long shopping district: www.magazinestreet.com<br>  <br>  Louisiana is the only US state that offers tax-free shopping for international visitors:  <a href="http://www.louisianataxfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisianataxfree.com/</a><br>  <br>  The lobby for the Westin Canal Place Hotel is on the 11th floor and overlooks the French Quarter. It is a great place for an afternoon drink/snack:(www.westin.com).<br>  <br>  Cafe du Monde is in the French Quarter and you shouldn't miss having cafe au lait & beignets (www.cafedumonde.com). Another great coffee shop is the Croissant d'Or (at 615 Ursulines Street), which is open from 7:00am to 2:00pm and has food in addition to pastry. <br>  <br>  The Palm Court restaurant is very nice, has moderate prices, and offers traditional live jazz starting at 8:00pm: 1204 Decatur Street, tel 504-525-0200 (reservations are important and they are not open every day). The Palm Court is closed from about July 25th to about September 25th each year.<br>  <br>  Maximo's Italian Grill has great food and atmosphere: 1117 Decatur Street in the French Quarter, (504) 586-8883.<br>  <br>  All of the famous restaurants (Antoine's, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Commander's Palace, etc.) have reopened. The Pelican Club (on Exchange Alley in the FQ) is not as well known but is the same type experience. Reservations are a good idea, and probably essential on weekends.  Tujaques Restaurant (823 Decatur Street) is very traditional and has moderate prices:  www.tujaguesrestaurant.com<br>  <br>  Cafe Degas is a very French restaurant near City Park at 3127 Esplanade - which is not within walking distance of downtown (5 to 10 minutes by taxi). They are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays (504-945-5635).<br>  <br>  The Napoleon House restaurant is at 500 Chartres Street in the FQ, and has a menu of great local dishes:  www.napoleonhouse.com<br>  <br>  Preservation Hall has traditional live Jazz, and doesn’t serve alcohol so all ages are welcome:  www.preservationhall.com<br>  <br>  New Orleans has ballet, opera, a symphony orchestra, and theatre: <br>  <br>  www.nobadance.com<br>  www.neworleansopera.org<br>  www.lpomusic.com<br>  www.lepetittheatre.com<br>  <br>  There is a free ferry across the Mississippi at the "foot" of Canal Street. It is a short trip but like a harbor cruise w/o a guide: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_street_ferry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_stree...</a><br>  <br>  The Aquarium, Audubon Zoo, and the new Insectarium are world-class attractions (www.auduboninstitute.org) and you should see them if you can. The Zoo is several miles from downtown. You can drive to the Zoo (which has free parking) or take public transit from the French Quarter.<br>  <br>  The Louisiana State Museum is in the French Quarter:  <a href="http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/" rel="nofollow">http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/</a>  New Orleans is also home to a number of other museums, such as the National World War II Museum (www.ddaymuseum.org) and the New Orleans Museum of Art (www.noma.org). Both can be reached by public transit: The WWII museum is in the central business district but a long walk from the French Quarter. NOMA is not within walking distance of downtown but has free parking.  Go to www.neworleansmuseums.com for info on more museums.<br>  <br>  Harrah’s Casino is in the Central Business District: www.harrahs.com  (age 21 required for entry)<br>  <br>  New Orleans City Park has a variety of attractions + free parking.  (www.neworleanscitypark.com).<br>  <br>  Check www.frenchquarter.com and <a href="http://www.nola.com/visitor/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nola.com/visitor/</a> for ideas about other things to do.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a great time!|`|EgfL2c86aa	well you just missed mardi gras.<br>  you can always go to the quarter.

fk2rCbdyaa	I work for a telecom company here in Wilmington, and alot of businesses are being hit pretty hard by the economy. I do know of one steel erection company that has recently had to go from running 4-5 crews down to 1 and sometimes 2. The owner said most of their business is from commercial, and that people just arent building as much as they were about 2-3 years ago. I would imagine most other companies in the industry are feeling the same way. As far as average apt. rent, I would say it would be around they $800 range for anything worth living in.

809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	I've travelled from the UK to Greece via interrail pass, so I could give you a bit of advice<br>  <br>  1) Interrail passes aren't good in the UK (or at least they weren't when I was there.) Though you can get discounts on the Eurostar to Paris or Brussels and I think on the ferrys to and from the continent as well.<br>  2) The three week passes are most useful if you're going to be doing a lot of traveling--you need to go around a lot to make them cost effective, as they're not cheap (about 350 Euros as I recall) and you still have to pay extra charges for trains in lots of places. It might be cheaper to fly to the UK or Ireland on Ryanair or easyjet.<br>  3) It takes a long time to get from Greece to the UK by train--it's probably at least two days each way, and possibly longer. You'll save a lot of time if you go by plane.<br>  4) Switzerland is certainly nice--I recommend the Interlaken area.|`|5d1054bb80d916b5ef2e0796e47c0172aa	A continuous global pass is a good idea if you intend of travelling a lot by train. You do not need reservations in advance, however you may sometimes ensure you get a seat on heavily travelled routes at peak times, especially on overnight trains.
fM7CwTwzaa	Corpus Christi is quite a nice, liveable place. It's got some of the nicest beaches on the Gulf of Mexico (especially Padre Island National Seashore), and is a great place for people who love warm weather, water sports, and a lively lifestyle. There's some very fun things to do in the city, and I personally love hanging out under the bridge at Whatburger Field on a warm spring or summer evening, cheering on the Corpus Christi Hooks (minor league baseball totally rocks!)<br>  <br>  Yeah, there is a large chicano population, but that translates to plenty of great Tex-Mex eateries and some kickass regional musical that's not just like all the plain vanilla pablum you hear in the rest of the country. Keeps things interesting, if you ask me.|`|q22ngVmkaa	Do you want to live in a town called "The Body of Christ"? I mean they'll be beds spinning and possessed girls and who thing. Spooky stuff.

After a while you have done pretty much their is to do and it can get very boring. If you like to get out and do things all the time, then Corpus is not for you. Don't get me wrong its ok but this is a tourist city and if you settle here then like I said before you will have done all their is to do and get bored with the same old thing. The closest bigger city is San Antonio and that takes close to 2 and a half hours to get to. This is an alright city to raise your kids in if you have them cause the crime is not that high at all, so is fairly safe. Their are 2 malls but 1 of them is DEAD DEAD DEAD. Downtown is alright, lots of night life on the weekend. If you move here the south side of Corpus is actually the best developed as far a houses and schools. It gets very very humid in the summer because of us being close to the water so please be ready to adjust. This is one of the easiest cities to get around in just remember SPID freeway and Crosstown expressway and I promise you will never ever get lost. Traffic is at it worst on SPID during rush hour. Other than that if you use the freeway, pretty much everywhere in Corpus will take 10-15 minutes at the most to get to, that's if you use the freeways and avoid 5:00 traffic. I know Corpus so well I could keep going and going but hopefully you will like it here and Good Luck :)|`|hk4e9svoaa	Corpus Christi, TX is a fun and safe place.  You have the Padre Island beach, downtown clubs, American Bank Center for concerts and Minor league sports.  Almost everyone speaks good English expect some fresh border jumpers.  Corpus Christi means body of Christ and the city does have a large Mexican vibe.  <br>  <br>  The economy is not so great.  Most jobs that pay well are blue collar jobs.  Most college grads from our two colleges have a hard time finding a decent job and leave.  Major brain drain that the city is trying to tackle but the good jobs are to few.|`|s05BJFkbaa	There are alot of chicanos there (mexicans that don't speak spanish lol).<br>  <br>  It is an Okay place to live, the only dangerous part of it would be the waters, they have lots of jellyfish.|`|6z4uLb9faa	poor economy, lovely gulf location.

pG345I0laa	YOU CAN CARRY YOUR MAKE-UP ON TO THE FLIGHT AS LONG AS IT ISN'T LIQUID. IF IT IS LIQUID YOU HAVE TO PLACE IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG (PROVIDED AT THE SECURITY POINT OR USE YOUR OWN) AND BE CERTAIN IT IS IN NO BIGGER THAN THE FOLLOWING SIZE:<br>  <br>      For all liquids, gels, aerosols, and pastes limit each container to a  maximum size of 3.0 oz/100ml. <br>  Place all such items in a single quart-size, clear plastic, zip-top bag. <br>  Remove your quart-size bag from your carry-on and place in the provided bin at the security checkpoint. <br>  <br>      HOPE THIS HELPS YOU. HAPPY TRAVELS : ) !!!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Yes, you can take makeup but any liquid makeup has to be 3oz or less and contained in a 1 quart ziplock bag.

rSq790ksaa	If you're going to sit down restaurant then bring about $20 for each sit down meal to include drinks, the food and tips for the waiter or waitress. $10 for every counter service meal. Also bring about an extra $5 per day for drinks and snacks throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Souveniers, that is up to you. How much do you think you're going to spend or can spend. <br>  <br>  Other than that, you'll be set if your room and park tickets are already paid for.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	My guess is that you are staying at a Disney hotel.  Therefore, you better plan on a minimum of $10 per meal.  If you will be doing any fancy meals, obviously it will be more.  Plus snacks/drinks during the day.  $50-$100 a day just for food would not be unreasonable.  Plus whatever you can spend on souvenirs.|`|4WdbOIa9aa	Since it is a class trip I am assuming you just need money for yourself. Fast food meals run average of 10 dollars a piece. So if all you eat is burgers and that kind of stuff 3 times a day, you need 150 dollars right there. If you go to a sit down restaurant it will cost between 30 and 50 dollars a meal on average. Snacks in the park such as sodas are 2.00 on up to about 6.00 for turkey legs. If you want to buy souviniers they are not cheap. If I was going for 5 days I would bring at least 500 dollars but would try to bring some more for all the stuff you will come across that you didnt expect, like arcades or speed boat rentals. Enjoy your trip.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	Over $100, that's for sure.<br>  You might fall in love with a souveneir, and that ranges in price. Then, there's the snacks and refreshments that you eat when you're in the parks. On top of this, the meals that you eat at the restaurants and at the hotel. And if you drive to the parks by car, you're gonna need gas money. Also, you may want to buy a picture a staff took for you. That's usually over $15. Have fun!! :) (Disney is the best, Lol.)|`|qO7nbSQVaa	As much as you can afford , it aint cheap.|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	i would say at least 500$ or less go for 250$<br>  if you like buying stuff and you need to eat|`|S2BpLHCVaa	It depends on how much your school is paying for. If they are paying for park admission or it has already been pre-purchased, there is no need to worry about that. However, if you are paying for that when you get there, you will need AT LEAST $222 for the most basic tickets (admission to one park per day). If you want Park Hoppers (where you can go between parks in a day), you need $272. There are other ad-ons, and you can look those up on disneyworld.com . After that, if you are paying for your own meals, you should probably assume that you will need an average of $15 for each counter service meal, at least $35 for each table service meal (depending on the restaurant) and a good $15 or more a day on snacks (snack foods-especially sodas and bottled water-are pretty expensive). This is just the basics. I would assume that you will spend about an average of $30 on souvenirs daily (including autograph books, disposable cameras, etc). I would also include $50 a day as a buffer. Also, if you are not staying at a Disney hotel, you have to account for transportation costs.<br>  <br>  The best way to figure out how much you need is to go through each day and figure out about how much you will spend. There are some pretty easy ways to save money too. For example, if you bring little boxes of cereal with you from home, you will save a lot of money. Also, bringing a water bottle which can be refilled at the various water fountains is a great cost cutters. One of the best ways to save money is to, depending on your flight times, designate the first or last day as a day to either unpack or pack and visit Downtown Disney. That way, you don't have to pay for park admission for that day.

RTst1UHwaa	Residence Visas are issued for 3 years. So, monitoring a 10 year tenure will be pretty tough. 3, 6 or 9 is easier. <br>  <br>  Education would become a problem. Personally, I welcome this decision because no longer how long expats stay here, we are visitors and we need to go back and settle in our countries or migrate to Canada/ Australia / New Zealand. With the residence Visa route (through Freehold property) closed to most expats, it may happen soon.<br>  <br>  I wonder what would happen to those Indian businessmen in Bur dubai who have been here for 6 decades. <br>  <br>  HAve not heard of this rumour though.

Even if they wanted to reduce dependence on foreign workers it would not be logical to direct it at long term residents, who have the experience , rather it would be reducing the numbers of new comers . Otherwise what is the point ...The UAE government views long term residents specially ones with expertise as an investment in the country's future not as a liability.

2dWlUEimaa	Yes it is censorship. <br>  <br>  Then again, Y!A is allowed to censor what they want, that's their right, after all. They set up a service as a private business, and we (the users of Y!A) have expressly accepted the conditions established for use of that service. In a way, by accepting the terms of service you have signed over whatever right you have to freedom of speech, if that's what the TOS detail.<br>  <br>  If Y!A deletes posts simply because Yahoo as a company disagrees with the opinion expressed, obviously that's the type of censorship that rubs people the wrong way. Most people, myself included, are whole-heartedly against this type of censorship.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if Y!A deletes posts because they are threatening, employ foul language, or what-have-you, this is the type of censorship that most people find acceptable. I find censorship acceptable when merited (like in the cases I just mentioned).<br>  <br>  Finally, I believe it's Yahoo's prerogative to censor as it wishes. If we were speaking on a civic/governmental level, however, that would be a different story...|`|c696f477a4d1a069e6273b7aae58b19daa	Yes. That's how it is.

RDgyb7W8aa	Celebrity is tops.  My wife and I have taken two cruses on the Galaxy. It was great. Food in the main dining room and buffet was out of this world.  They make their own homemade ice cream  (I could never get enough).  The entertainment was great in the lounges and at the stage show, If you are sailing from a cold climate the pool area is enclosed with a glass roof.  We have our reservations made to sail on the Mercury out of Baltimore on Jan 2nd next year.  I have sailed with Royal Caribbean and Holland America, but they don't compare with Celebrity.

Their food is to die for...I kept ordering med rare steaks every night then the last night I said I'll try something different and ordered the pork chops. Well they weren't bad but I just didnt love them as much as the steak..my waiter watched me take 2 bites and he came over with a med rare steak all prepared and said "I knew you would want this so I already ordered it for you" The staff is awesome like that! By the way, that was when I was 13 and had limited food tastes, but nowadays I order all the fish and different stuff.<br>  I don't know if you are looking at Eastern Caribbean, Western Caribbean, or Europe but I have done them all. My absolute favorite islands are St.Thomas- Meghan's Bay Beach & Barbados, you should go to those. If you are looking at Europe, I really enjoyed the one that went to Norway, Finland, Denmark, Russia, Sweden. My parents took one around the Greek/Turkey islands.<br>  I don't know how much money you have but I would give the tip that you should get an inside cabin, it won't have a window/porthole but it will be way cheaper and really I've had the window cabins and they weren't worth it. You are basically only in your room at night when it's too dark to see out.<br>  Feel free to email me if you want any more details|`|X6rFPI2laa	I was very disappointed with my one cruise with Celebrity, and it will be the last one with Celebrity!  First, our cabin was advertised and sold as a particular square footage, and shown as equal to all others on that deck in all published information.  However, it was in fact significantly smaller than all of the neighboring cabins and the veranda was less than half the size.  Cabins which were in fact the same square footage sold for significantly lower fares.  Second, our cabin's air conditioner did not work at all when we boarded, and only blew warm air.  The steward said it had been a problem for a while but the previous week's passengers thought it was OK and didn't seem to mind when the maintenance people didn't repair it even after he called.  Well, we did mind, and the steward immediatedly called for maintenance to come fix the air -- we heard the call since he called from our cabin.  Well, a couple of maintenance men came, banged around on the pipes, and said that was all they could do and left, and it still did not work.  My sister then went to the purser's desk about the air conditioning problem (it was 93 degrees and high humidity), and was told no call had ever been made and nobody had ever complained about the problem, but they would see if they could send someone to evaluate our complaint the next day.  She told them the steward called and that she had heard the call itself, so the purser's staff was misinformed, and that the men who had come to fix the problem did not in fact fix it.  Not knowing that she had already been at the purser's desk, about a half hour later I went down about the air conditioning myself, and was told they didn't have anybody who could fix it and no other cabin we could have, so they couldn't do anything but put it on a list of chores for the next time the ship was in dry dock!  At that point I told the lady that of course there were engineers capable of repairing anything that might go wrong on the ship, and it wasn't like they went home at night, so they were in fact on board, and I was certain that if this were the Captain's cabin or the cabin of any senior officer they would have it fixed immediately.  The lady then said the room steward was the one at fault for never reporting it, and I informed her that I personally had heard the phone call several hours earlier, and she shouldn't try to blame an innocent crew member who was actually doing his job.  She apologised, and some different maintenance men did arrive and fixed the air conditioning.  What a mess!   We are not chronic complainers and have in fact traveled a lot and with a lot of other cruise lines, and this was the only time we have ever been treated so shabbily.  The ship was the Century.  Beyond the mis-represented cabin (which I see that they have now listed in the proper catagory) and air conditioning, it was OK, but with the very poor start it just wasn't a great trip.  I have enjoyed cruises with Princess, Holland America, Costa, and my favorite, which is Cunard.  We will probably not choose Celebrity again, although I have many friends who think Celebrity is great.

At approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and with a population of around 900, it is the smallest country in the world by both population and area.<br>  <br>  The Vatican City is a city-state that came into existence in 1929 and is thus clearly distinct from the central authority of the Roman Catholic Church, known as the Holy See, which existed long before 1929. Ordinances of Vatican City are published in Italian. Official documents of the Holy See are issued mainly in Latin. The two entities even have distinct passports: the Holy See, not being a country, only issues diplomatic and service passports; the state of Vatican City issues normal passports. In both cases the passports issued are very few.<br>  <br>  The Lateran Treaty in 1929, which brought the city-state into existence, spoke of it as a new creation (Preamble and Article III), not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756-1870) that had previously encompassed central Italy. Most of this territory was absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, and the final portion, namely the city of Rome with a small area close to it, ten years later, in 1870.<br>  <br>  Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state, ruled by the Bishop of Rome — the Pope. The highest state functionaries are all clergymen of the Catholic Church. It is the sovereign territory of the Holy See (Sancta Sedes) and the location of the Pope's residence, referred to as the Apostolic Palace.<br>  <br>  The Popes have resided in the area that in 1929 became the Vatican City since the return from Avignon in 1377. Previously, they resided in the Lateran Palace on the Caelian Hill on the opposite side of Rome, which was out of repair in 1377. The signing of the agreements that established the new state took place in the latter building, giving rise to the name of Lateran Pacts, by which they are known.

Which town or city are you looking at? That will make a big difference.  I lived in Panama City for 8 months, no one speaks English much and they have their own type of music.  The locals are not that friendly with Americans in the city.  Outside yes but the city I found colder. It totally depends on so many variables that you haven't given. Whether you want to cater to locals or tourists. If you speak the language.  The town you want to be in. The city, in my opinion, needs a good club for Americans.  I never found one while there. If you provide more details maybe I can help a little.  I owned a club for 20 years. Good luck.

Buses arrive and depart every 30 minutes.  The cost is only $10 (I think).<br>  <br>  It's called the Washington Flyer Coach Service (link below).<br>  <br>  The Metro is the Wash DC subway system.  You will be getting on the Orange Line train at West Falls Church and it has a stop at Foggy Bottom.  Metro fare cards can be purchased at each station (vending machines).  I *think* it should only be about $5 for "round trip" fare from West Falls Church to Foggy Bottom.  Those vending machines do accept credit cards, but it is best to have some CASH with you too...as I once had a problem with the vending maching accepting my credit card (just a fluke I guess).<br>  <br>  The only issue would be how much luggage you are lugging with you.  If it's just two items or less (two hands), not a problem.  You can navigate the Metro/subway.

65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	The Canadian government recently put out an alert bulletin about concerns for safety in Mexico. The way it was phrased said that "...gun battles between police and rival gangs can erupt at any time...", with innocent people caught in the crossfire. <br>  <br>  Mexico is still supposed to be one of the safest vacation destinations, but even at resorts I have heard about room break-ins, and at least three Canadian tourists have been thrown off balconies in the last two years with unknown results in the police investigation.

But if you are like me who likes it lound the best place is ( Limossl or Ayan Napa) or if not then ( Larnaca )<br>  And the best time to go would be I think is - between June to sep As from oct they close for winter season's.<br>  Good luck
xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I now fly a lot with my three children. They have been flying transatlantically about twice a year since each was 4 months old. All three were breastfed at least a year. <br>  <br>  I will say that I had many, many breastfeeding mothers on my flights and on all the flights I did as a breastfeeding mother myself, I have NEVER had any problems with it. Actually, the only issue was when one mother tried to go up to business class, which had empty seats, to breastfeed her baby. The rule she was breaking was occupying a seat she didn't pay for. We actually convinced her that is was not a problem to breastfeed in economy. <br>  <br>  For discretion I used a sling. Since most people flying know that it's the healthiest way to feed a baby, there is no need to "hide". I just tried not to flash skin. <br>  <br>  The sling also helped to keep the baby in the right position without having to use a bulky pillow, etc. A good baby carrier is also useful for other aspects of flying. <br>  <br>  The only way to fly safely with a baby is to have her in a car seat, with her own ticket. Babies under age 2 are allowed for commercial reasons and because air travel is so safe, there is little chance of anything going wrong. But if it does, these children are not protected. This is also much more comfortable for you, her and all those around you. <br>  <br>  If you haven't booked a seat for her, call the airline and see if the flight is full. Then, at check in, ask nicely if you can have an empty seat next to you to place your carseat in. They often do this for families.<br>  <br>  Please note that it's a myth that children need to suck on something for take-off and landing. If you succeed in getting a free place, make sure she is securely strapped in for take-off and landing. There is no reason to remove her from the seat during these times to breastfeed. Mine stayed in their seats without any ear issues.<br>  <br>  If your baby does not have a seat and is in your lap, be sure that she is loose in your lap. It is dangerous to have her strapped to you or your seatbelt in any way. Remove any baby carriers. <br>  <br>  There is no reason to introduce a pacifier. None of mine ever took one. Please don't force her to drink when she doesn't want to nor wake her unnecessarily. Have her ears checked before leaving as healthy ears can handle pressurization changes. Experts recommend that the child simply be awake, not for landing but at intial descent, when the aircraft first leaves cruising altitude. Details and cititations in the article link below.<br>  <br>  Be sure that you get plenty to drink during the flight. Airplane air is drying and it's easy to get dehydrated, even when not breastfeeding. <br>  <br>  Bring about 1/3 more diapers, etc. than she usually uses in that time frame. Try to sit in the bulkhead, with the wall in front. On some aircraft, there are wall-mounted bassinets. These are convenient if you don't have a seat but are no replacement as far as safety is concerned. <br>  <br>  For more information, nine years ago I wrote an article on this subject. It's based on both my personal and professional experience of flying with kids. It's totally non-commercial and other parents from around the world have contributed;<br>  <a href="http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  An edited version appeared on the Expat Women website in December;<br>  <a href="http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying_with_children.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying...</a><br>  <br>  Have a good trip!|`|sBCUKi5Yaa	Airlines seat parents/moms traveling with infants in bulk head seats. These are the first rows in the cabin. All moms and parents will be in this area so you won't feel very uncomfortable. I have seen moms carry a small blanket to cover up when feeding their babies. Make sure it is long/wide enough for you. <br>  <br>  When cabin air pressure changes during landing/take off, it hurts their sensitive ears. You want to ask your pediatrician or look into options to relive the pain. If your baby is used to a pacifier, that is best to take along.<br>  <br>  Take along an extra set clothes for the baby in case there are throw up situations. Take along a favorite toy and a new toy. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Have a safe trip.|`|AA11535448	Cover up so others aren't exposed to your body when nursing or simply don't put yourself in a position where you expose yourself - don't travel on such a journey.|`|2Ety14sLaa	Sit in the back left or right corner of coach as far away from me as possible!!|`|5ET4mWkzaa	When I traveled with my son who is breastfed, I sat in a window seat and just covered up with my light jacket.|`|VmCncRmoaa	Try to book an extra leg room seat which is the front row of the seats  most airlines provide blankets so you could wrap a blanket round you and baby when you feed them.

Do not take it off completely.

You can usually see the signs if it is a high-crime area, so take a look (at least on a satellite map) to see if the place you were looking at seems good or bad.

And in every supermarket or even corner store I've been to they give you bags.<br>  The second person lived a terrible experience that leads her to have such an opinion, it is very bias.<br>  Ok, main differences I found with the States, not too much pedestrian culture, cars pass firsts :( still trying to get disabled parking spots respected uugghh, driving can be a tough one, one must be careful.<br>  Some people here do not respect the laws or the authorities.<br>  There are huge differences between poor and rich Mexicans, the gap is greater than in Europe, for example.<br>  On the other hand, Mexicans are friendly and like to talk for example outside the classrooms, churches, etc.<br>  Family bonds are important, and most families eat together even when the "kids" are married and have their own kids at least once a week.<br>  We like to eat food from street stands, and even though they it's not the cleanest, it's usually delicious and our stomachs are used to it.<br>  The main meal is lunch which is around 2 pm, and dinner is late around 9 or if one is meeting friends it can be around 11.<br>  Many people walk, it's common to see people walking everywhere in the city and use public transportation.<br>  There are markets in every city or town, one can find all sorts of food, clothing, house appliances, etc, etc. at low prices. This is an ancient custom from before the Spaniards came.<br>  The day of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Dec 12th is a national holiday whether one is catholic or not, factories have mass and closes for that day, millions go to the church where She is at walking, running or in bycicles from cities located miles and miles away.<br>  The most popular sport is soccer.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I live here  and I see that people here are no different than the united states. they study. they worked  and they go to college.

For the Previous Post...<br>  <br>  -"I noticed when I went there how you can't stop if there is a car wreck and you just watched someone die because you can't stop because you will be blamed." Thats totally untrue... how in the world are you going to be blamed for a car accident if your car has no evidence of an impact and you just stopped.. I will say you have a point if there was a shooting and you were the only person there alive in the middle of nowhere... But the Reaon why Not Stop if there is a car accident or someone in the street applies to Mexico and the US.. because of safety-- you don't know if that person is faking it and wants to rob you<br>  <br>  "I learned it's normal to get raped there." Oh yeah is an everyday ocurrance, just after taking a shower and before going to school, sometimes if lucky in the evening too ... It's not normal to get raped anywhwere... well except Spring Break in Rosarito... which apparently you went to and heard a lot of stories of "a friend of a friend" ... plus all those things happen at home go to DC, New Orleans, Memphis... or if you're in Spring Break go to Panama City or Miami.<br>  -" I learned that if you rent a condo you might not get the key or the correct info. where it is." Thats why you ask all this info before renting something ..common sense people!!!!

Then the back roads from Malpais to Tamarindo. <br>  Do you have access to a handheld garmin device? If you do then use this map at www.gisdatasystems.com . If you do not, then I HIGHLY recommend getting a Gamin hand held device then buying the Costa Rica map at www.gisdatasystems.com..for $19.99 it is a steal <br>  <br>  It is the only map that can show you how to route form Malpais to Tamarindo.

I would go Gold Coast if I had the choice between the two. Hope that helps..|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	I've lived in Brisbane for over 30 years and have raised my family here. It's a great city to live in. <br>  <br>  The climate is the best of the Australian cities IMO, the people are friendly, the lifestyle is relaxed and it's green and leafy all year around in most suburbs. <br>  <br>  Brisbane is situated on the beautiful Brisbane River inland from Moreton Bay so has no long, sandy beaches of its own, but only an hour's drive away to the north and south are some of the best beaches in the world.<br>  <br>  Shopping is good, though while we have plenty of well dressed people here and many excellent boutiques, you couldn't describe it as the fashion capital of Australia - that's Melbourne. The climate is too warm in winter for lovely winter clothes to get much of an outing and people tend to dress fairly casually all year around (though of course they dress up to go out on the town). <br>  <br>  The city is large enough to have everything you're likely to need with good hospitals, schools, several good universities and other facilities. Public transport is great in some areas and almost non existent in others and if you don't intend driving, you'll need to select your suburb carefully. The traffic is getting pretty terrible though many of the current problems are being caused by road, bridge and tunnel works that will hopefully get things flowing better in the future.<br>  <br>  For young people, there's plenty of nightlife. My kids are young adults and they have a great time in Brisbane with no shortage of places to go and things to do. For variety, we also have the Gold and Sunshine Coasts which are only an hour or so away with many more night spots and theme parks and other tourist attractions. Dining out is excellent with a wide variety of food styles and some very good restaurants. Again, we also have the restaurants on the two coasts to choose from.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Oh yes Queensland is a super State Parts of Brisbane like any city are a bit not so good but only 1 hour from the glorious Gold coast Beaches then a bit more to The sunshine coast.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	When the Severn Bridge first opened, and certainly up until 1978, toll booths were in operation in both directions. <br>  <br>  But there were three problems. First, at certain times of the day, the booths in one direction were busy whilst the other way were not. Secondly, it was becoming costly to collect the tolls. But third, and most important, if there was any delay at the toll booths, then east bound traffic was left standing on the bridge. This presented a danger in high winds. (In fact, as I recall, on at least one occasion, they had to suspend toll collection for eastbound traffic in order to clear traffic off the bridge!)<br>  <br>  So, the solution, which solved all three problems was to remove the eastbound booths and double the charge for westbound journeys.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Cheaper to only stop and charge the once.

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	If you live in or near a very large city you may find a truly bilingual school...otherwise not.  In the U.S. , schools do all kinds of things to accommodate Spanish speaking students, that is not the case in reverse in Mexico.  There are a few schools that use English a great deal...because they want their students to be confident in speaking English.  Most private schools that are bilingual, have classes speaking English, but do not teach everything in English...there are some, but rare.  In areas with tons of gringos, like Ajijiic, I believe they have schools that totally accommodate English speaking kids.  You really have to wait til you get there to do your school searching.  some schools have websites, many do not, and private schools start up and close down frequently.  Your kids are young and will learn quickly, which is great. they should be speaking adequate Spanish before they are ready for 1st grade, and that would be better for them.|`|E3tptvtraa	I am in the same situation, don't worry, i think if your kids are around spanish speakers, they will pick it up pretty fast, especially since they will have the summer to get used to it before school starts. I am moving to xalapa, veracruz in 2 weeks with my 3 year old & 5 year old. They don't speak much spanish yet but kids learn quickly. You may be able to find a bilingual school near a big city, or you could homeschool them if they don't do well in a spanish speaking school. Good luck!

n2ax5TqPaa	Hi!  That depends on which part of the wall you go to.  There are a few different "sections" of the wall that are open for tourists and locals to climb, and other sections are closed.  So you definately couldn't climb the whole wall.  It would take days to do that anyway.  One helpful resource is the Lonely Planet China guidebook.  It can tell you all about the different sections that are open to climb.  My favorite is "Simatai", it hasn't had a lot of work done on it...other sections have been updated and made more safe, etc.  Simatai is pretty rugged, but with any section of the wall you climb, be prepared for a good stair stepping workout!  As far as how long it takes to climb, it depends on how long the section is that you've chosen and how fast you are at climbing, and how much time you want to spend.  You could be there anywhere from just a couple hours to the full day.|`|0oPfnm7oaa	Yes, there are many sections. They don't connect to each other. Mostly, a section takes 1.5 to 4 hours. Except sections that are open to tourists, there are also wild Great Wall which remains in its original state with weeds growing.

Yes, the EWR-IAH leg can leave before the DUB-EWR leg arrives.  They're different planes, so they don't need to wait for one to be in and for all the customers to pass through customs/immigration before #2 leaves.  If you miss your connection, they'll put you on the next available route.<br>  <br>  2.  The propensity of losing your luggage is the same, whether you're on the same flight number, or different.  However, Continental is VERY good at not losing luggage, so you should be fine.  They may beat it up a bit, but they rarely lose it (at least in my experience).<br>  <br>  3.  Your check(s) would be in Newark since you're arriving there on an international flight, not in Houston.  Also, be careful: "pre-clearance" for customs in DUB isn't always open.  It's capacity controlled and only open certain hours, so you might or might-not have the customs in DUB.  You could have it in EWR, along with immigration.<br>  <br>  4. All of the 757-200's (used for EWR-DUB) are equipped with AVOD now!  If you're in the front 16 rows, you'll also have 110v power at the seats (2 outlets for every 3 seats in coach).  See the Seat Guru link below.<br>  <br>  Another note:  If you fly on #23 (the 1-stop flight from DUB-IAH), you'll only get the frequent flier miles from DUB-IAH direct (4557 miles).  If you do the DUB-EWR and a different flight number EWR-IAH, you'll get 4608 miles!  I know it's ridiculous, but that's how the airlines operate.<br>  <br>  Finally, see my link below for the UK/Ireland section of Flyertalk.com.  There is quite a bit of useful info for Ireland (both while there and info for getting there, etc).  I'm going there next week and found a ton of useful info there! <br>  <br>  Enjoy your trip!<br>  <br>  Also, it's worth noting that
aX8nee8gaa	Cabo is fine, I was there last week. To worry about the drug wars and Cabo, that would be like saying "The gang violence is terrible in LA, we better not go to Denver." Its that far removed. <br>  Couple of tips though: Make sure you take a credit card that will work with you on fraudulent charges. Most places do not take amex and they will double bill you. Also some of the restaurants do not like to bring you itemized receipts. So make sure you ask up front about amex and detailed receipts. If they take amex, you know you are fine. Also always ask for the exchange rate up front, right now its basically 15:1 but they will try to clip you at 12 or 13:1 if you let them. Ask everything up front with cab drivers too, ask how much before you get in. If you act naive, you will get fleeced a little bit.|`|7JU853bzaa	FLORIDA CITY, Fla. - Authorities say a man shot a woman he knew while she was working at a Wal-Mart in Florida City, then fatally shot himself. <br>  <br>  <br>  Miami-Dade Police Department spokeswoman Rebeca Perez says the shooting happened inside the store Wednesday morning after an argument between the two. <br>  <br>  <br>  The woman is in critical condition and the man was pronounced dead at a hospital. <br>  <br>  <br>  Their identities have not been released. <br>  <br>  <br>  No one else was hurt. <br>  <br>  <br>  Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Fogleman says the company is "deeply concerned" for the woman's well-being. <br>  <br>  <br>  On Monday, an Arizona couple was shot outside a Wal-Mart there. <br>  <br>  <br>  The woman died and her husband was critically injured. <br>  <br>  <br>  Authorities say the suspect in that shooting killed himself after being stopped by police in New Mexico. <br>  <br>  <br>  The motive wasn't known.|`|ydoIYwGTaa	I have been to Cabo and I have friends that live near border towns from Tijuana to Matamoros Mexico.

Everyone is very concerned, but truly it not happening in the resort towns such as Cabo or Cancun or anywhere else.  Most of the drug wars take place near the border.  Most of the political uprest is happening in a town called Oaxaca.  Cabo is safe.  Just don't solicit prostitutes or go looking for drugs or hang out in the sleezy bars.
ZyL1ZMKGaa	We are going the week of April 19th and renting a 4 bedroom/3 bath home in the Indian Creek Subdivision in Kissimee with a screened in pool from Martin and Lyndsie at www.villa.us -- we've rented from them before and the houses are spotless and immaculately furnished.  I looked on their website and they do have 3 bedroom condos for rent for under $700 per week.   I would highly recommend them to rent from -- no hidden fees or taxes; they tell you the price up front.<br>  <br>  Also, check out the seaworld website -- they're offering deals for hotels with passes for 5 nights for the price of 3 -- someone said it was the equivalent of $28 each per day for the passes/hotel rooms for a family of 4.<br>  <br>  If you can afford Discovery Cove, they are offering $50 off per ticket if you book 45 days in advance (which includes 14 days admission to SeaWorld or Busch Garden) for the last week of April.  We got the discount for the week of April 19th because the telephone rep made an error  on the week the discount was available.|`|XBxVoUTaaa	Check out www.vrbo.com you can take your pick on different areas. Most condos don't offer transportation. Unless you have a large group, I would suggest staying on Disney's property. You won't have to pay for parking and transportation around the parks is free.
gzaVGE4Qaa	Why?! Don't you love nice weather? I moved to Northern California from New England (specifically, Boston, MA) and I love it here! I was sick of snow and never seeing the sun during the winter.
ze1cOA3kaa	I just moved to Vancouver, WA (just across the Columbia River from Portland, OR), last year.  I grew up in the Sacramento, CA area, but just moved from Tucson, AZ.  (after 14 years in the desert!) I LOVE IT HERE!!  <br>  <br>  I actually appreciate the rain.  It's not that bad, really.  And I find it rains differently up here.  In Arizona when it rains (mostly during Monsoon in July & August) the raindrops are huge and it just pummels you.  Here for the most part, the raindrops are much smaller and it is more of a gentle rain.  Sometimes I really have to focus on someting other that the rain to actually see it!!<br>  <br>  You can get out and do things here.  If you like the outdoors, this place is paradise!  In the desert, it was so miserably hot, dusty and gritty, you didn't feel like doing anything until 10 at night!  Mid-May to October was pretty awful unless you like the sweaty look/feel.  Here there are the 4 seasons and now I look forward to summer!  And they have lawns here - actual grass that you can walk on instead of rocks in the yard! If I can enjoy/appreciate the change anyone can!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Where in Cali are you from?|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I was surprised to hear on the radio this morning that Business Week rated Portland, OR the #1 most unhappy city in America.  One of the criteria for unhappiness in their survey was bad weather, and I guess the clouds and rain can get pretty bad there for it to be ranked #1 in unhappiness.  Though sometimes surveys aren't very accurate!|`|99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	Without knowing specifically where in NorCal you are I can't say for certain but I doubt you will notice the difference much. Portland has wet winters but if I remember correctly receives less precipitation than most midwest/east coast cities. The west is called "The arid west" for a reason. Portland in my experience is similar to the SF bay weather wise. Cool, foggy & wet winters with hotter summers than SFO.|`|AA10456284	Very very bad. Walk around town and there are moving sale signs everywhere, that say " moving out of the rain!". But it is absolutely gorgeous there the 10 days a year that it DOESN'T rain! lol|`|IDjP94NHaa	the rain isnt bad at all. it's why were so green! the rain gives Portland such a mountainous, foresty place. I just love it! Your relocating would be one of the best things to do. You won't be sorry!|`|QmfKV651aa	The rains not bad once you get used to it. I've lived in Seattle since I was born and it feels so weird when it doesnt rain for like a week.|`|smcpSrd5aa	Actually, I think that the rain is over-exaggerated and have found that it is not as rainy as people say it is. Sure, wetter than the average city, but not overly so. I live in the Portland area and haven't really noticed a particularly rainy time period. Can get cloudy. Summers can become brutal and winters are normally mild (hardly ever snows). This last winter I saw more snow in the city than I have ever seen (not counting the mountains).<br>  <br>  The greatest thing about Portland is that there are so many natural recreation activities surrounding you. You can drive an hour to the coast, wander the city shops and farmer's markets downtown, head east to the mountains, stop by any numerous lakes, rivers or waterfalls, drive further east over the range to the high desert, or drive south further into the valley. I've lived here my entire life and have no desire to leave.|`|AyOH6UXsaa	It's bad. The yearly rainfall is 35 inches and I think it's getting worse. In winter some of the farms flood up to 10 or more feet! The summer is too hot, but to live in a great cit like this, it's worth it. It is a great city, so don't let the weather discourage you. It is rated the best bicycle, green, urban living, sprawl controlling major city on the planet. You will get used to the weather after a couple years though. 222 wet days a year and 143 hot days. there two seasons if you ask me!
s2IOyj8iaa	You will want an aisle seat as the 22 month old will probably want to wander around Make sure the airline knows you have the 2 babies as they may be able to give you a seat with a wall in front some of the bigger airlines have a baby cot to hang on the wall The 3 month old will probably  sleep a lot . Take some healthy nibbles for the 22 month old but no hard toys as could be dangerous if he or she starts throwing. A book or 2 would be good.  Make sure you have a change or 2 of clothes for the children and some wipes. I dont know if you have a pram for them for your layover if not ask airport staff if there is a possibility of borrowing one. Keep calm|`|os3dSpGZaa	I have 8 children so am experienced with young children, but never had enough money to fly. I suppose it's just like a long car journey, make sure you take plenty of toys and entertainment for them to do. If you are travelling with your husband, maybe have one child each.

NK3VJgiRaa	I sent an SUV last year from Philadelphia to Puerto Rico. I used Rosa del Monte, but any large mover that ships to PR can do it. It cost about $1000 to ship it. Then you need to pay an excise(import) tax. Its $750 for a car worth $5500 or less in PR. (Remember cars are worth a little more in PR). & the tax goes up from there. You can call (787) 774-1474 to find out what the tax on your car will be before you ship it.

KGUidL4daa	There is honestly no reason to take route 1 around Philadelphia unless you are trying to get to the northeast or the suburbs. He'd be best just taking I-95 the whole way up from NOVA to Philadelphia.<br>  For the Susquehanna Bank Center, <br>  SEPTA serves almost exclusively PA, so you should also look at New Jersey Transit and PATCO for public transit options:<br>  <a href="http://www,njtransit.com" rel="nofollow">http://www,njtransit.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ridepatco.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ridepatco.org</a><br>  PATCO trains run from around Camden to Center City Philadelphia across the Ben Franklin bridge and provide a great view of the city.<br>  New Jersey transit has a decent bus network, and two rail lines in the area. To get between Philadelphia and the Susquehanna Bank Center, use the River Line to connect with a PATCO train.<br>  <br>  But his car will NOT be safe for three nights in Camden. If he's then going to New York City after going to the Susquehanna Bank Center, I'd almost recommend only parking around the stadium for the concert, and afterwards driving 40 minutes up to Hamilton train station in Central New Jersey and parking there for the three days. It's inexpensive and in a nice area. I'm not quite sure what overnight parking is like on the River Line.|`|AA11633246	I would just go to 30th Street Station.  <br>  <br>  Take 95 North all the way into Philly to the exit for Callowhill Street and the Vine Street Expressway on the left hand side of 95, just as you're passing Center City.  You're close when you see the Ben Franklin Bridge (blue bridge [not green] that crosses into NJ).  Stay to the left to get onto the Vine Street Expressway (it shows up as Route 30...at the base of the Ben Franklin Bridge on Google Earth/Maps, and it's a sunken highway, lower than the rest of the city streets).  Go up the ramp on the left, merge with the rest of the highway and then you should be heading low.   <br>  <br>  You'll pass 2 exits on the Vine Street Expressway...one for Broad Street and one for the Art Museum Area.  At the 3rd one on the right, before the highway bends around to the right, you'll take the exit for 30th Street Station.  This exit is 2.25 miles away from where you got off of 95.  Stay right, exit, and go around the bend and get right so you can go up the next ramp and back to street level.  There's a parking garage right on your left hand side and I'd imagine that it's the safest place to leave a car for 3 days.<br>  <br>  This should be a Google Maps link showing you the route from I-95 to 30th Street Station:<br>  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Benjamin+Franklin+Bridge,+Philadelphia,+Philadelphia,+Pennsylvania+19106&daddr=30th+Street+Station,+Philadelphia&hl=en&geocode=&mra=pe&mrcr=0&sll=39.95252,-75.152998&sspn=0.04632,0.077248&ie=UTF8&ll=39.957978,-75.162106&spn=0.046317,0.077248&z=14" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s...</a><br>  <br>  From 30th Street, you can jump onto the Market Frankfort line, or the Blue Line Subway and take that East/North to 8th Street, where you can transfer to PATCO's high speed line.  This will cross over the Ben Franklin Bridge (the blue on you drove under while on 95) and I think it's the first stop in NJ that you can get off and walk to the concert.<br>  <br>  Subway Map: <a href="http://www.septa.com/maps/market_frankford.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.septa.com/maps/market_frankfo...</a><br>  <br>  You can take that all the way back to 30th Street just doing the same in reverse, and then of course, from there, you can take the R7 up to Trenton and transfer with a NJ Transit train and make the rest of the trip up to Penn Station in NYC.  It takes about 2.5 hours if you do it this way, AMTRAK is probably about 2 hours and I imagine that Accela is even faster, but obviously the $$$.  The standard trip should cost $30 or so?  (it's been awhile).  <br>  <br>  Regional Rail Map (SEPTA's R7): <a href="http://www.septa.com/maps/click_map.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.septa.com/maps/click_map.html</a><br>  <br>  There's also that Megabus service there.  Not sure if it's actually "Megabus" or one of the competitors, but they stop at 30th Street.  Not sure how you planned on getting up there and back, but both are great options.<br>  <br>  Heading home from 30th Street is a breeze to.  There are plenty of signs, and this time, you can take I-76 to the Airport.  This will eventually merge with 95 South, and the rest is up to you.  <br>  <br>  This should be a link to the whole trip from Baltimore, MD to 30th Street Station using the route I described:<br>  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Baltimore,+MD&daddr=I-95+N+to:39.91711,-75.146141+to:30th+Street+Station,+Philadelphia&hl=en&geocode=%3BFQCuYAId5oiE-w%3B%3B&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=2&sz=12&via=1,2&sll=39.923429,-75.220642&sspn=0.18536,0.30899&ie=UTF8&ll=39.797986,-75.441742&spn=0.371398,0.617981&z=11" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s...</a><br>  <br>  Skip I-76 heading into Philly if someone mentions it.

As far as where to park the car, you could always just park at the airport. I haven't parked there in a while so I'm not sure what the rates are, but it would probably be a lot cheaper and safer than most of the train stations. He can hop on the train from the airport and meet you in center city and then on to Camden.|`|YhjFiVGyaa	there are no septa lines that run to DC. i would have him hop a greyhound from DC to the filbert street greyhound terminal in center city. if u need a train the septa train station is in the galleria mall right across the street all the way downstairs. <br>  <br>  if u are then going to camden, you can stay at the greyhound station and hop a NJ Transit bus on its way to Atlantic City. Their first stop is the Camden bus terminal and hop a taxi to the Susquehanna Center from there.<br>  <br>  There isn't any overnight parking at the terminals, but there are parking garages at nearby streets. and u dont wanna park ur cars outside the garages in these areas anyway, this area in philly (chinatown area) and camden are pretty rough.<br>  <br>  u can also take the 15th/16th street entrance and catch a PATCO line to camden.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	The first SEPTA station you would hit would be Newark, DE (R2 Terminus), which is along 95.  Don't bother getting on 1.  Newark's pretty far out so service might only be hourly, and I have no idea how safe it would be to park there, but it's better than Philly or Camden.  Also note that most SEPTA lots charge for parking, usually very cheap, but it is by the day, so you might get ticketed for overnighting.<br>  <br>  Newark (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Newark,+Delaware&sll=39.678358,-75.752492&sspn=0.016283,0.038624&g=Newark,+Delaware&ie=UTF8&ll=39.675617,-75.743351&spn=0.065136,0.154495&t=h&z=13)" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s...</a><br>  Station on south side of town.<br>  <br>  You can then take this train into Philly, and at either 30th St, Suburban, or Market East stations you can transfer to the Market-Frankford Line, which you would then take to Market+2nd, if you wanted to take the Penns Landing ferry to Camden; or to Market+8th for transfer to PATCO, which also gets you to Camden, from which you would transfer to RiverLine at Walter Rand Stn. and take that to the venue.<br>  <br>  It's not the easiest place to get to, trust me driving there's just as confusing, but I hope this helps out.

If you buy them beforehand, then you have to pay for shipping.|`|UE1evlTlaa	I would definitely buy yours ahead of time online! There are tons of myths about online sites not being reliable or having expired tickets. This is NOT true. You just need to do your research.

I have used OrlandoFunTickets.com and DWTickets.com before and they were both wonderful resources for not only Disney but ALL the Orlando parks. They also will ship to your home, hotel, or allow you to pick them up in person right near Downtown Disney...so it is convenient to the parks.<br>  <br>  If you go on Google and type in "disney tickets" the top 5 sites that come up are your best bet for purchasing tickets online. Make sure you look into them first though for sure! Hope this helps and happy holiday!|`|AA12353364	If you are a member of the AAA or CAA you can purchase theme park tickets at a discount

Over christmas a few years ago I paid 200GBP for flights accommodation and transfers and half board for a week! <br>  <br>  Otherwise try another area.....in the off season|`|Uk7JUrSwaa	Hi <br>  <br>  If you want somewhere clubby i would stay away from menorca it is very quiet there with hardly any nightlife. If you choose majorca choose the areas of magalluf or palma nova for nightlife. Also try ibiza san antonio but be aware the clubs are expensive there. <br>  <br>  A good website would be www.globallatedeals.co.uk<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
AA10523012	Abu Simbel was moved to higher ground (1964–1966) to avoid flooding from the Aswan High Dam.<br>  <br>  <br>  But - this took place in Egypt and not in the UAE.|`|hMTL2AV7aa	I saw on TV they want to move it AGAIN due to ground salt damaging the columns (it gets absorbed up the base like a sponge does).<br>  I guess they did not think of that when they chose the new location in 1964.
AA12068233	1.) You should look forward to a huge, huge variety of dining and nightlife options. The cultural attractions are also strong, i.e., the Botanical Gardens, High Museum of Art,  Fernbank Museum, Georgia Aquarium, etc. You should be careful of the same things you are in all big cities. Watch your back, be vigilant, don’t engage in conversation with the many bums who may approach you, if you’re a young female, try to travel in a group. I’m not trying to make you paranoid, Atlanta is no better or worse than other large cities with respect to crime.<br>  <br>  2.) What in interesting? Other than the dining, nightlife and cultural attractions I mentioned above it’s always fun to check out a Braves, Thrashers, Falcons or Hawks game. If you’re not into that, you can  go hike Kennesaw and Stone Mountain, each about a 20 - 30 minute drive from the center of Atlanta. In the summer time, it’s fun to get a group of friends and raft down the Chattahoochee. <br>  <br>  If you have money, the shopping options are practically limitless. <br>  <br>  3.) Are people friendly? Sometimes. It’s not a really friendly city like New Orleans but it’s not as hostile as New York, Boston, Philly, Pittsburgh, Chicago and so on.<br>  <br>  4.) Is it boring? No! If you can find something to entertain yourself here that’s your problem!<br>  <br>  I’ve never seen the movie you mention but whether you like partying at bars and clubs, dining at fine or hole in the wall restaurants or  prefer the outdoors, you should enjoy yourself. Since you’re from Jamaica you should like the weather, too. It rarely gets too cold here.|`|KJ0P79n8aa	Oh my gosh, you are going to have so much fun. Atlanta has soooo many things to do. You can live there 5 years and never eat in the same restaurant. <br>  Yes, people here are very friendly. It's southern hospitality. People here are really nice drivers too! <br>  You are absolutely going to love it. and there are famous rappers at the clubs every night if you listen to the radio and hear where they are going to be.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	I live about an hour from Atlanta. Atlanta is a really fun town and there are plenty of things to do so you won't be bored! For the most part all southerners are friendly so that should not be a problem. Good luck and I hope you have fun.
4INE794zaa	Band is the same thing as tribe. Natives, like myself, prefer the word band over tribe, as tribe generally referred to tribes of native peoples in Africa, South America and Australia. Here in Canada, each different Nation of Natives, (ie. Ojibwe) is broken down into different bands. There are hundreds of different bands within each Nation, and many different Nations, within Canada. They still use the tribal system in the US......|`|AA12095483	Band, clan, tribe, etc - it means a group of people with a common heritage.|`|f9No4eRBaa	Each area has it's own unique Native Indians and the local society and culture.

I'm honestly not sure if the word is more accurate for some reason or if "tribe" was offensive to First Nations people.

tcEOO6fRaa	I think that you have a big problem "Keviv" if your hero is Hitler.<br>  There are so many great men in History to relate to.<br>  You picked the wrong one.<br>  Shalom!|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hitler is saying that Jewish people are moral.  The reason why there are so many antisemites out there and that Hitler was one of them is that they don't really hate Jewish people they hate that we are a symbol for morality.  The giving of the Torah was at Mt Sinai and the Hebrew root word sinah=hate=sinai.  They don't hate us they hate G-d's word on morality.  Hitler was the worst antisemite because he didn't believe in any of G-d's words of morality at all.<br>  <br>  I don't put Hitler off the hook so easy on the insanity plea.  It is perhaps he became afflicted because of his bad actions and his bad actions weren't a result of his afflictions.  I think he was just a truly evil man and calling him insane would assuage his guilt.<br>  <br>  As far as our resident hater saying that Zionism was birthed out of the Holocaust, I beg to differ on that.  It has always been the Jewish dream to return to our homeland and American Presidents also supported that dream long before the Holocaust.  Here is timeline of Zionism as expressed by American Presidencies, and also noting the acknowledgement of Jewish morality as expressed by the 2nd President, not that I have to validate G-d's words on morality by anyone though, by the way.<br>  <br>  John Adams, 2nd President of the United States<br>  I will insist that the Hebrews have done more to civilize man than any other nation. (Letter from John Adams to Thomas Jefferson)<br>  <br>  John Quincy Adams, 6th President of the United States<br>  [I believe in the] rebuilding of Judea as an independent nation. (Letter to Major Mordecai Manuel Noah) <br>  <br>  Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States<br>  Not long after the Emancipation Proclamation, President Abraham Lincoln met a Canadian Christian Zionist, Henry Wentworth Monk, who expressed hope that Jews who were suffering oppression in Russia and Turkey be emancipated “by restoring them to their national home in Palestine.” Lincoln said this was “a noble dream and one shared by many Americans.” The President said his chiropodist was a Jew who “has so many times ‘put me upon my feet’ that I would have no objection to giving his countrymen ‘a leg up.’  <br>  <br>  Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States<br>  The allied nations with the fullest concurrence of our government and people are agreed that in Palestine shall be laid the foundations of a Jewish Commonwealth. (Reaction to the Balfour Declaration)<br>  To think that I, the son of the manse, should be able to help restore the Holy Land to its people. <br>  <br>  Warren Harding, 29th President of the United States<br>  It is impossible for one who has studied at all the services of the Hebrew people to avoid the faith that they will one day be restored to their historic national home and there enter on a new and yet greater phase of their contribution to the advance of humanity. <br>  <br>  Calvin Coolidge, 30th President of the United States<br>  Coolidge expressed his “sympathy with the deep and intense longing which finds such fine expression in the Jewish National Homeland in Palestine.” The Jews themselves, of whom a considerable number were already scattered throughout the colonies, were true to the teachings of their prophets. The Jewish faith is predominantly the faith of liberty. <br>  <br>  John F.Kennedy, 35th President of the United States<br>  Israel was not created in order to disappear—Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom. <br>  <br>  Lyndon Johnson, 36th President of the United States<br>  The United States and Israel share many common objectives...chief of which is the building of a better world in which every nation can develop its resources and develop them in freedom and peace.<br>  <br>  Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States<br>  America has never flinched from its commitment to the State of Israel--a commitment which remains unshakable.<br>  <br>  George H W Bush, 41st President of the United States<br>  The friendship, the alliance between the United States and Israel is strong and solid, built upon a foundation of shared democratic values, of shared history and heritage, that sustains the life of our two countries. The emotional bond of our people transcends politics.<br>  <br>  Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States<br>  Our relationship would never vary from its allegiance to the shared values, the shared religious heritage, the shared democratic politics which have made the relationship between the United States and Israel a special—even on occasion a wonderful—relationship.<br>  <br>  George W Bush, 43rd President of the United States<br>  “The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet the source of our friendship runs deeper than any treaty. It is grounded in the shared spirit of our people, the bonds of the Book, the ties of the soul. <br>  <br>  Barack H Obama, 44th President of the United States<br>   "The United States' special relationship with Israel obligates us to be helpful to them in the search for credible partners with whom they can make peace, while also supporting Israel in defending itself against enemies sworn to its destruction."<br>  <br>  U.S. Presidents On Israel<br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/presquote.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a>|`|i00SbscLaa	Hitler was a man without a sole but he was the 1st leader in the West to say what most people in the west were saying and this why they elected him.<br>   <br>  <br>  The Zionist movement was born in the last stage of the colonial era in Europe.<br>   The Zionist movement was used by the colonial powers to do 2 things: To get the Jews out of Europe and end the Jewish question where Jews were hated by most Europeans for historical and religious and ethnic reasons. Hitler master plan for the Jews was move or be killed.<br>  <br>  Second, the West wanted to divide the Arab world into 2 regions forever and keep the Middle East a war zone forever.<br>  <br>  Look at your logic.Zionism is not a colonial movement because again...........there is no mother country or mother tongue.<br>  Most Jews who moved to Palestine have a mother country and a mother tongue. Most Jews did not speak Hebrow before they were moved to Palestine. A new Jew from Poland must learn Hebrow to live in the Israeli colony.<br>  <br>  You said it yourself only religious Jews spoke Hebrew. Are all Jews were religious? Please they have mother land and mother tongue and they all were nothing but a colonists and settlers and lived on settlement too.<br>  "A colony needs a mother country that controls them" what do you call the Israeli lobby?<br>  <br>  The Israeli lobby is made of American mother country Jews and none Jews too. It is clear for you. Your logic dose not hold any kind of native water.|`|wdyf1sueaa	Dr. Fritz Fredlich, a neurologist and psychiatrist, concludes that  Hitler exhibited many psychiatric symptoms, including extreme paranoia and defenses that ''could fill a psychiatry textbook,'' and was truly mentally ill. <br>  <br>  Dr. Fredlich, professor emeritus of psychiatry at both Yale University and the University of California at Los Angeles, began his research 10 years ago, Dr. Fredlich discovered that there were few substantive works on Hitler's medical condition, the psychiatrist says, he decided to go further, constructing what he calls a ''pathography,'' or ''study of the life and character of an individual, as influenced by disease.''<br>  <br>  The result is an exhaustive text that meticulously weighs and considers virtually every aspect of the dictator's psyche and every detail of his physical health. Dr. Fredlich based his conclusions in part on Hitler's own statements, but he also spent a decade examining medical records, including diaries kept by Dr. Morell, and conducting interviews with surviving sources.<br>  <br>  The litany of Hitler's physical ailments is long. He experienced severe abdominal spasms, as well as belching, bloating and constipation. Beginning in the 1930's, he complained of buzzing and ringing in his ears. He was afflicted with hypertension, headaches and heart trouble. And he had problems with his vision: After a mustard gas injury in World War I, he experienced two episodes of ''blindness,'' at least one of which Dr. Fredlich judges to have been hysterical, and in later years Hitler described eye pain and hazy vision, ''as if he was viewing objects through a thin veil.'' Toward the end of his life, the Nazi leader also suffered from Parkinson's syndrome.<br>  <br>  THAT MAN WAS INSANE, when one uses an insane persons quotes it puts him in a very specific square too.|`|PHQy22VUaa	look, dude, this happened almost 100 years ago. why don't you just give it a rest. we are all SO bored of the jew whining about this guy. Lets talk CURRENT events. why don't you google some info on the amount of kids the jew army just maimed and killed in gaza a couple weeks ago, against a civilian population with stones. how about googling some un edited YouTube videos on the jew army harassing 80 year old men and women lording over these frail individuals in IDF uniforms (sounds like SS ) with big welfared guns in the hot sun.... how about you dig deep into the jew 'moral' conscience and ask your self- is this MORAL?   is this right to blow up babies.. and just live off USA tax dollars.. and torture people in jew jails... and lie and steal land..because we are jew....

It's hard to deny they have seen all mankind can throw at them.<br>  We are still trying though.|`|UFJlZl4maa	Hitler is a monster!<br>  <br>  It's because of him that I never met any of my great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, ..etc!<br>  <br>  What a lifeless beast!|`|FTjNKYvmaa	Hitler didn't just want to conquer nations, he wanted to triumph over human nature to create amoral "supermen". Clearly he associated Jews and Judaism with the morality and humanity he wanted to expunge from the Deutsche Volk. <br>  <br>  In his view, morality was a weakness that had to be cut out. I've also read that the Nazi's viewed the wholesale slaughter of innocent and defenseless people as a way to harden the hearts of their own troops - a way to re-shape their own humanity. I can't imagine a more evil train of thought.|`|0StmErZBaa	What has separated the Jews from many other peoples of the world throughout their history is their humanity.  Don't get me wrong, we are a warring people from way back.  We were able to slaughter countless populations in order to reach the Holy Land in the first place according to the Torah because this was the land that G-d promised us and everyone else worshipped idols.  The Jews were the original terrorists. <br>  <br>  The acceptance of the top 10 and the rest of the Torah brought everyone to the spiritual promised land.  I mean, laws before their were laws.  Laws on how to treat each other.  Laws for a society to work in perfect harmony with each other worshipping the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, (Jesus and Mohammed also, but much, much later.)  <br>  <br>  Can you imagine the feeling of the people knowing that they have evolved so far past the idol worshippers that they have left them in the dust as far as accomplishments as a race in proportion to their numbers.  <br>  <br>  It was not our conscience and morality that Hitler was afraid of, it was our intelligence.  Intelligence controls mathematics, science, and art.  Which in turn manifests itself into economics, accounting, banking, physicians that span the spectrum, university professors, I can go on, but you get my point.  Hitler needed to control these resources (or get rid of them).  He had to rationalize it somehow in terms that the average German could understand in order to obtain power, keep it, and perpetrate the Holocaust.|`|5720a35acb05fbf04a17f74f66750115aa	Israel is committing crimes against Palestinians for more sixty years<br>  <br>  So it seems that the Holocaust is a political blackmail to influence and control the world|`|yRYZcYp7aa	Maybe he had a sense that zionist will take land from a country by force and kill its citizens,kill little children,bomb buildings and schools..well,it was true and it did really happened as everyone knows..|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	I would agree with the comments expressed by Red Apple--how could Nazis have a conscience when sending people to gas chambers, but Hitler felt that the Jewish conscience was ultra sensitive. Thus, according to his perverted logic, sending people with ultra sensitive consciences to gas chambers was good. There were German philosophers before Hitler who had similar ideas.

It consists of stunning landscapes, great buildings, monuments and museums, a rich arts and culture as well as great sports facilities. The many museums that you can visit include the History Museum, Natural Science Museum, Albany Museum Complex, National English Literary Museum, Observatory Museum where one of the only 2 Victorian Cameras Obscuras in the world is located.The arts and culture community of South African descend upon this historic town every year for the fantastic Grahamstown National Arts Festival. Rhodes University takes center stage as one of the best institutions in the country.  Some of the game reserves to see include the Bushman's River Conservancy at Amakhala Game Reserve, the Great Fish River Reserve, Kwantu Game Reserve and Pumba Private Game Reserve. Grahamstown also boasts the Makana Botanical Gardens which is linked to Rhodes University. It was founded on Gun Fire Hill in 1853 and provides a sanctuary for rare birds and a diverse plant life.|`|06a1831b0b8ffd82f1a1af8d01d8f301aa	<a href="http://www.grahamstown.co.za" rel="nofollow">http://www.grahamstown.co.za</a><br>  The tours section can give you some ideas.<br>  Buy an EYE WITNESS guide of wherever you visit. <br>  They really are the best guides going.

Most places that tourists go (Capitol Hill, Downtown, Georgetown, etc.) aren't that much of a risk.  Crime happens everywhere in America, but the main portions of DC aren't anything to be scared off.  A long time ago the crime rate in DC was horrible, but these days it's not bad at all.  Just stick to well travelled areas and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  I agree with the person above though - leaving your aunt and son in a car for many hours is a very bad idea.  Sitting in a parking car in 70 degree weather is not a good time at all.<br>  <br>  The museums on the National Mall are free to walk through.

8cfvN5voaa	ok here we go.<br>  <br>  sponsorship is a very hard thing to get. Reasons?<br>  Depending on the demand of the job you wanna do, employers find it very hard to do. Sometimes an immigration lawyer is involved too because of he rules and hardness of the sponsorship visa. For example: the emplyer must certify in one way or anothe rthat they have tried hard (i think its a minimum of 6 months) to find an AUSTRALIAN employee before employing an overseas person. They need to show actual proof such as ads on websites, newspapers, curriculum, interviews... etc etc.. somtimes an employee can't be bothered doig all that if its only a hotel receptionist job (as it was in my case). I've lived in Melbourne for 5 years now and ima  permanent resident. How did i get a permanent residency? i got married to theman of my dreams that was kind enough to do that for me.<br>  ven here, you dont get the esidency just by getting married. i had ot go through tons of papers, medicals, money.. and A LOT OF STRESS. Its not easy. just like in the US really.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	There are 4 kinds of sponsorship.<br>  <br>  Spnosorship as a partner is impossible if you don't have a genuine relationship unless you're prepared to go to an enormous amount of effort spreading over 3 or more years in collusion with the other party. Immigration make you produce so much proof and check so thoroughly that if you're not in a genuine and long standing relationship, you have virtually no chance. Just being married isn't nearly enough, so forget trying to find someone who is prepared to marry you to get you a visa. It's more difficult to get in here on a dodgy partner visa than it is to get into the US on one.<br>  <br>  The other sponsorships are employer, state government and relative skilled worker sponsorships. In all cases, you must have qualifications and experience in an occupation on the Skilled Occupations List (SOL). No sponsorship will get you around the skills requirement.

India lies to the north of the equator between 8°4' and 37°6' north latitude and 68°7' and 97°25' east longitude.[3] It is the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total land area of 3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq mi).[4] India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and 2,993 km (1,860 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,517 km (4,671 mi).[5]<br>  <br>  India is bounded to the southwest by the Arabian Sea, to the southeast by the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean to the south. Along its northeastern frontier are the Himalayas, which form India's geographic boundary with the People's Republic of China, Bhutan and Nepal. Cape Comorin constitutes the southern tip of the Indian peninsula, which narrows before ending in the Indian Ocean. The southernmost part of India is Indira Point in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[5] The Maldives, Sri Lanka and Indonesia are island nations to the south of India. Sri Lanka is separated from India by a narrow channel of sea formed by Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. The territorial waters of India extend into the sea to a distance of twelve nautical miles (22 km) measured from the appropriate baseline.[6]<br>  <br>  The Ganges is the longest river in India and forms the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Ganges-Brahmaputra system occupies most of northern, central and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of southern India. Along its western frontier is the Thar Desert, which is the seventh-largest in the world.<br>  <br>  India's highest points are K2 in the disputed region of Kashmir at 8,611 m (28,251 ft), followed by Kanchenjunga in Sikkim at 8,598 m (28,209 ft).

For the most part though everyone speaks english and the dollar is widely accepted, euros are accepted on the french side. Some of the other languages they speak are french, dutch and papiamentu. It depends on what side of the island you are on. I've been there multiple times and love it because everyone is so friendly and they have nice beaches. They have a few nude beaches on the french side. The cruise ship docks on the dutch side but try to visit the french side while there.

143bm6cnaa	Why don't you read the book and decide for yourself?
cPSuJ032aa	Depends what you are most comfortable with, but I think it is easier to just bring a backpack for your journey in Sydney and around Oz.  It is less to carry as you go all over the country. As you have a place to leave a suitcase while travelling Oz, pack that as well. That way, you'll have everything you need for a year.<br>  <br>  Before you go, why not pack a few boxes of things you'd like to have when you settle and leave them with friends or family back home? They can ship the boxes when you settle in Sydney or Melbourne (by the way, Melbourne is WAY cooler).  If you decide you don't need those boxes and have heaps of stuff already, then don't ask for them to be shipped.<br>  <br>  Assuming you're on the Euro, USD, or Pound, you'll have heaps of spending money while in Australia.  There are some great shops here, so you'll be able to pick up clothes and necessities for cheap!|`|xs2mpYjWaa	A travelling back pack, like you seen backpackers with will suffice. <br>  <br>  You can't just decide to settle down here. You need to apply for seperate residency for that, and 12months working holiday is not enough for anything.<br>  <br>  You do realise you need to work while you're here, not just bum around.<br>  <br>  If you want to be able to get a 2nd working holiday visa you need to do a certain percentage of work rurally, i.e. fruit picking.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Dont bring to much luggage you will be in very hot weather when you go North so little clothing is required you would be better not to chill out for the first month as the weather north in August is so much better than october when the humidity comes in before the wet season. but August in Sydney can be a bit cold so no good for the beach . Clothing is cheap here if you shop around
XXm2yCHiaa	1. Yes you can but it is not necessary.  You may end up being slower than everyone else.  FYI, it's normal to leave the luggage on board, just bring along your valuables<br>  2. The train will not move again until the singapore immigration has checked and verified that no one else is on board the train.  By the time they finish that, normally everyone has gone through the immigration clearance.  <br>  <br>  I believe the train does not leave until everyone is back on board.  However, please do not take your sweet time or delay everyone because you move slowly due to managing your kids AND the luggage.

S5H0NmEWaa	The journey from London Euston is about 1 hour 25 minutes. Prices vary wildly depending on the time of day that you wish to travel and any restrictions you can apply to your return ticket. The best website to use is the National Rail tickets website - www.nationalrail.co.uk - since it offers tickets from all rail companies. Try to book in advance if you can - advance tickets are always cheaper.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	about 1 hour half...not sure on how much it costs|`|UzPFTdUFaa	There are two main rail routes from London to Birmingham: From Euston Station Virgin Trains operate to Birmingham New Street every 20 minutes (less frequently on Sundays) and the journey takes 84 minutes. Virgin have some very cheap deals as long as you book in advance for specific trains at Euston Station or via www.virgintrains.co.uk<br>  From Marylebone Station Chiltern Railways operate to Birmingham Snow Hill/Moor Street every 30 minutes taking about 2 hours 10 minutes. They have advance purchase fares from ￡6 booked via your mobile phone and an off peak return that can be bought at the time of travel for ￡19.50 (Super off peak return available on departures after 11am) www.chilternrailways.co.uk|`|aiKLvwGTaa	I went to Euston from New Street yesterday (open return) and it cost me ￡28 with a young person's railcard... so about ￡42 without one.<br>  <br>  If you go from Snow Hill to Marlyebone, it's about ￡26.<br>  <br>  Look on www.thetrainline.com - that's how I worked out which route to take. I decided that, for an extra few pounds, it was worth the hour difference in travelling time!<br>  <br>  The Virgin line (New Street -> Euston) is every 20 mins, and takes 1h24m. The Chiltern line (Snow hill -> Marylebone) takes about 2h30 and is less frequent.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	On my map the length is about 2 inches.

Fm5YsQnfaa	Return fare and hotel from $1100 each Canadian. UK Hotels usually include a decent breakfast, it they say continental it will just be toast and jam.<br>  <br>  Heathrow is a long way from London so investigate an alternative transfers from a taxi.<br>  <br>  You can go to a lot of places like national museums for free and they are all together is the same street, huge places. Each one can take all day to visit.<br>  <br>  Eating out can be as cheap as a Macdonalds at home or what ever you want to pay in a restaurant. Pub lunches are usually worth looking into for good deals.<br>  <br>  Allow yourself a minimum of ￡100 ($250canadian) a day for food, and places you want to visit. Some attractions are very expensive. Even by our standards. That is why they are full of tourists, the locals never bother.<br>  <br>  This site may help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theoriginaltour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theoriginaltour.com/</a>|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Have a look online yourself for plane and hotel - the price will depend so much. Expedia is good. For food you can buy sandwiches and snacks from metro supermarkets like Tesco's and Sainsbury's for a couple of pounds. You can get nicer light lunches from cafes like Pret for under ￡5. Pubs and chain restaurants like Pizza Express and Zizzi are your best bet for decent value meals. <br>  For 3-4 days you should get an Oyster card and put on ￡10, which should be enough for transport using the buses and Tube.|`|poYGMfWcaa	Well if you are planning to spend little you should eat in a pub. The typical cost of a lunch in one of those is like 20 pounds per meal, and you might get a lower cost if you stay in a near village, like 45 pounds per nigh or stay in a hotel near the downtown and will cost like 70 pounds. The plane will cost like 400 pounds or a little bit more if you travel by British Airways. And if you are expecting to go to some museums are to Oxford street I think there are going to be like 900 pounds<br>  But if you are planning to travel as a queen there are going to be like 1500 pounds<br>  <br>  Hve a nice trip, I hope you enjoy it! London it's just beautiful.|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	It really depends on your budget.

kgBPU4xxaa	I like staying in the Piazza San Marco area - either in San Marco or in Castello close to San Marco. <a href="http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/" rel="nofollow">http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/</a> It's usually more expensive, but I live within a couple of hours of Venice and when I stay overnight, it's for an event like Carnevale, Il Redentore, or the Historical Regatta which are centered on Piazza San Marco. If it's not so crowded in Venice, you can easily walk the city or catch the vaporetto though. Hotels on the Lido island or at Lido di Jesolo on the mainland are cheaper, but you need to take the boats to get back and  forth to Venice.<br>  <br>  Places like the Selvadego <a href="http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/san_marco/hotel_selvadego.html," rel="nofollow">http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/san_m...</a> the San Moisé <a href="http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/san_marco/hotel_san_moise.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/san_m...</a> , or the All'Angelo <a href="http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/san_marco/hotel_all_angelo.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.venere.com/hotels_venice/san_m...</a>  are all good choices, but there are lots of other possibilities.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Cannaregio is a good area.|`|AA11185479	I suggest staying in Venice proper, not in the outlying areas.  Then you can easily walk anywhere you want to go, without having to wait for a ferry.<br>  <br>  The hotel depends on your tastes and budget.|`|WPM0bqyBaa	Unless you have a lot of money, staying in Venice is hectic.. first, there is no parking..you need to leave your car at a parking outside Venice $30 Euros + a day and then you need to take in th water taxi, 7 Euros a person.. The rooms in Venice below 150 Euros are a hole in the wall..<br>  <br>  I stayed at this hotel last summer, 65 Euros in June, cheaper too earlier or later, Hotel Style , Via Monte Grappa 2, 31021 Mogliano Veneto<br>  <br>  Hotel in the immediate vicinity of a small train station where approximately 50 trains per day provide direct service to the heart of Venice and Treviso in only 15 minutes, eliminating the problem of finding parking lots and dealing with traffic.<br>  <br>  Renovated in 2005, the Hotel Style comprises a total of 4 floors with 38 rooms of various types.<br>  Lift, air-conditioning, car park (free) and garage.<br>  <br>  Special arrangement and rate for the taxi transfer from and to Venice or Treviso International airports (call the hotel for more details). Around the hotel there are a super-market, typical restaurants, wine cellar, many shops, gardens and beautiful Venetian villas. <br>  <br>  Don;t book directly, use booking.com.. here is a sample:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/it/campiellohotelmoglianoveneto.html?sid=2f8dd78745f84b072854376c375036f2;checkin=2009-06-14;checkout=2009-06-15" rel="nofollow">http://www.booking.com/hotel/it/campiell...</a><br>  <br>  The hotel is clean and has parking. Some people complained about their credit card machine was out, that happens randomly everywhere in Italy and most gas stations also don;t take our credit cards. Anyway, when I went, the credit card at this hotel worked. The night staff is a little in the clouds but it's a good deal, you take the train to Venice and back 3 euros they are very often and available and return late too.. great deal! Good luck.|`|URZNtrxsaa	I recommend staying on Lido Island. I stay there every year. If you have a rental, there is a cheap ferry that you can take your car with and keep it with you on Lido, instead of one of the parking structures at the square. There are any number of great small hotels to stay at on the Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta.. This is one of the main drags on the island and run 5 city blocks long. At one end of the street is the Lido Beach.. and the end is the main island Vaporetto stop. Its two quick stops to St. Mark's Square or a 5-10 minute ride to Murano. That and the prices are 1/3 that of staying off St. Mark's square...|`|lgWVuSv8aa	Hi!

cXp9wAoEaa	In Fulton County (the county Atlanta is in), the school board has decided to lay off all part time teachers and most all assistants. That was their decision after considering firing all school nurses. It's unbelievable. <br>  You'll have much better luck in neighboring counties such as Forsyth, Gwinnett, Cherokee, and Cobb. They have a lower cost of living than North Fulton and are very safe as well. The schools there are of a very good quality, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the respect that the schools in those counties give.<br>  Clayton County has lost its accreditation in the past year, I wouldn't recommend that area to you. <br>  As a teacher, you have the biggest impact on kids' lives than anyone else. They spend more time at school with teachers than they do with parents. You're bringing up our future and I respect and admire you for that. It's not something to be taken lightly.<br>  But do check the schools in the other counties that I mentioned. They're sure to satisfy.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	That is true, the state is cutting back on the pay teachers currently get.  Fayette County has angered alot of teachers they are already making less than most of Atlanta and now the County & State have decided to cut their pay and their benefits.  They've been having job fairs for teacher, so there are probably openings, you will have to pass their testing, as well as have the appropriate teaching degree - so you might be able to get a job here in Atlanta, but it might be worth to stay where you currently are because you might be making alot less here in Georgia.  I know I've seen job fairs for Gwinnett County and for the Atlanta Public School System.  It might also be worth looking at Cobb County.<br>  <br>  Currently, Atlanta has a higher unemployment rate than the national average.  It is currently 8.4%, the national average is about 7.5%.  The economy is doing very badly here in Georgia, problems in the department of transportation, they are cutting back on everything government run, most only work 4 day work weeks, they've also cut back on how much police can work, they've closed several fire stations as well as furloughed some and crime is back on the rise.|`|AA11580836	Well, I live in TN and have been to GA alot and I love it there but I have heard that the unemployment rate there is climbing and above the national average.

If you use in the main dining rooms (Tsar's Palace or Azzura), there are no dining charges except for alcoholic beverages, soft drinks  and some juices at dinner time. The cost of your meal and coffee or tea is included in your cruise package. <br>  <br>  Should you choose to dine at a speciality restaurant (like Mama's Italian Kitchen or Teppanyaki), there will be a charge of $20 to $30 per person, alcohol extra. This will be charged to your on-board stateroom account.<br>  <br>  Room service is also free, but you should tip the room service attendant. I usually give $2. You may also dine in the Garden Cafe, a buffet-style restaurant, which is also included in your cost package.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that no matter where you order alcoholic beverages and soft drinks they are at extra cost, unless you buy a package deal at the beginning of your cruise.

Pr3QIlweaa	There are loads of British expat's where I live.  Canadians, as a group, are extremely tolerant of, if not welcoming towards, immigrants.  I do think Brits are barely viewed as immigrants, though.<br>  <br>  My family is British/Scottish heritage.  I have a brother-in-law who is Scottish, and another brother-in-law who is British. <br>  <br>  You'll be in good company.  :-)<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>  I think my family demonstrates how common immigrants are, in everyday life:<br>  <br>  There are 8 siblings in my family.<br>  <br>  #1 is single<br>  #2 is married to an American (in the U.S.)<br>  #3 is married to a Scottish immigrant <br>  #4 is married to a Canadian<br>  #5 is single, but in a relationship with an American<br>  #6 is married to a Canadian<br>  #7 is married to a British immigrant <br>  #8 is married to a Dutch immigrant<br>  <br>  So, four of the six married siblings chose non-Canadians.|`|CqoTqEu6aa	We need immigrants in Canada and should welcome them for many reasons<br>  1)our birthrate is so low we need them to sustain our population :)<br>  <br>  2) we need them to take jobs and work with us to boost our economy ( yup there aren't enough born and bred Canadians to fill all the jobs out there so for those complainers like Sandra do your research [there might be fewer jobs right now b/c of the economy but theoretically not enough of us are born to fill the positions out there] )<br>  <br>  3) We need immigrants to teach us about other countries, cultures, and ways of life and to help us develop a respect for human beings all over the world! <br>  <br>  immigration is essential in Canada, and i know at least the TVO and SCN watchers out there are mad in love with all your TV shows, heartbeat, masterpiece theater, midsumer murders! come and bring you TV shows with you!<br>  <br>  ....and also to Sandra... we are not "owned" by the British we gained legal and total independence in 1931 based on the statute of Westminster....(we just did it through diplomacy and without the big war and hub bub of a Revolution like the Americans) you should read a book or learn a little something about the country you are living in before you bash "immigrants" you find "undesirable".<br>  <br>  PS. to Old Lady it is also wrong to force people who immigrate to Canada to become "like us" people should be able to retain their culture and their language. We are the ones who need to learn more about them so we can respect our differences and learn to live together more harmoniously.

Free health care.<br>  <br>  Canada's health care is not free. It is funded by a heavy tax<br>  regime that takes hard earned money from even the working poor. If<br>  you make $C20,000 a year. You will be taxed. Make more? Like $C75,000<br>  and up? Oh, you can bet you will get hit with taxes. In some<br>  provinces like Alberta, you also get the additional privilege of<br>  paying health care "premiums" on top of your taxes.<br>  <br>  The big hospital unions like the Registered Nurses and various<br>  so-called "para-professionals" have taken over the health care<br>  system and destroyed it. This is what happens when you create a<br>  a monopoly, and worse, a government owned monopoly.<br>  <br>  2. High standard of living<br>  <br>  Huh? Since when? This country has one of North America's biggest<br>  drug ghettos. It's called Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Canadians<br>  have a lower per capita GDP than Americans. They also make less<br>  money than Americans, and ironically many other countries: Ireland,<br>  Germany, Switzerland to name just a few. And it's freking FREEEZZING!<br>  <br>  3. Peaceful<br>  <br>  Nope! There are just as many acts of violent crime, drug gangs,<br>  domestic murders in Canada as in the U.S. It's just never adjusted<br>  for per capita, ie. the actual population of the two countries<br>  and the size of the cities in each country. Canada has serial<br>  killers, drug shootings, pollution, gang violence. How come we don't<br>  hear much about this in the world's media, the way the U.S.'s<br>  problems are constantly brought up?<br>  <br>  4. Strong economy<br>  <br>  No! Canadians just piggyback off the U.S. economy and they still<br>  can't manage to get their unemployment rate down to anywhere near<br>  to the U.S. rate, which was hovering in the low 5's most recently.<br>  Canada's rate has varied over the last decade or more from 11% to<br>  a low of about 7%. The country just sells off its raw natural<br>  resources rather than having a productive economy through<br>  strong innovation or research. Yet the Canucks complain about<br>  selling those resources to the U.S. Huh?<br>  <br>  5. Canadians are polite self effacing and humble<br>  <br>  Whoa! Canadians are anything but polite and "European" as they<br>  like to tell the world. Most Canadians I've met are ignorant,<br>  boorish, self absorbed anti-American bigots. Go to a Canadian<br>  workplace: see how they treat you, especially if you are a brown<br>  or black person.<br>  <br>  Go to a restaurant or a store. The tone is very cold and "British"<br>  in nature. Look at how they drive. I have driven in Britain, the<br>  U.S. (San Diego, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, Seattle area).<br>  Nowhere have I seen such stupid backward drivers as I have seen<br>  in B.C. and Alberta.<br>  <br>  Basically Canada needs to have its huge pompous self absorbed ego<br>  deflated. Canadians are hypocrites and they love to be delusional,<br>  and self absorbed about how great they are. The U.S. incidentally is the<br>  country where a lot of Canadians, (about 600,000 at last count), go<br>  to live well, retire and of course, for employment. Hypocritical or<br>  what?|`|AA12095483	An immigrant is an immigrant and immigrants are welcome in Canada. No matter where they are from. They are not judged by their racial origin, but by how they behave in Canada. Whether they make any effort at all to adopt the Canadian life style, learn the language and become productive members of society. <br>  Those are the things that matter. <br>  I've known some real twits who came from England, and some very upstanding families who came from the middle East and Asia.

Depending on what hotel you book that is the section of beach you are dealt with.  The shape of Cancun (the number 7) is known as the hotel zone of Cancun and that is where all the hotels are situated on.  It's a 14 mile long section of beach.  Wherever your hotel sits is the beach you have.  Sure you can walk up and down the beach, but keep in mind each hotel has it's own section of beach. Whatever hotel you book is the part of beach you have... you can't go accessing other hotels beach property if you aren't staying at that hotel.  You should research Cancun a little more.

This question has cropped up many times and led to the "Italian architect of Taj Mahal" myth. Many scholars believe that an Italian architect, Geronimo Veroneo, designed the Taj Mahal. The first person to suggest the legend of the Italian Architect of Taj was Father Manrique, an Augustinian Friar. He met with Father Joseph de Castro, the executor of Veroneo, who told him about Veroneo. <br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, a goldsmith named Veroneo did come to India during the rule of Jehangir and died on his way to Lahore. However, beyond that, there is no evidence to prove that Geronimo Veroneo was indeed the architect of Taj Mahal. Another fact that goes against this legend is that Europeans who saw the Taj, under construction, never mentioned him. Also, it is difficult to accept that an artist trained in Italy, could build a tomb as per Indo-Persian architecture
