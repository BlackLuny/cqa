Just let them know that you need to sit down with them and have a heart to heart talk, and then tell them it isn't easy, but your Girlfriend is pregnant, and then listen.  You have to expect anger, and disappointment, but parents have a way of surprising you in stressful situations.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	How old are you?<br>  Just tell your mom. Then she will tell you dad.<br>  <br>  Actually tell the least strict parent first.|`|H90uflbFaa	mom.. dad. i f*cked up. my girlfriend is pregnant.|`|8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	both of you should tell them together. it wont be a pretty site but you have to get it over with. better now than later|`|AA11510145	WOW! well all you can do is be straight up and tell them you made a stupid mistake and you need thier help. The key is what you do after you tell them. Be humble do not get an attitude. Ask for thier help and take thier advice.|`|40Q4gpi6aa	Tell them straight out. If they get mad, make sure you are a few feet away from them, just in case they decide to try and become very violent... But, it's really not completely your parents to worry about, it's hers... Does her parents know yet?|`|JWp9PMyRaa	is that a question?? if not, then why did you put question marks??<br>  <br>  but any who..<br>  just tell them, Exactly what you just said..<br>  <br>  MY GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNANT!|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Mom!

Just come out at tell them. The longer you put it off the harder it is going to be on you and them.|`|sN8Lycx9aa	Just be honest. Or you can get someone you know and trust to help you.|`|zLoIkjoJaa	you and your girlfriend both tell them that what my brother did they were 16 or 17 and my parents took it really well
s1utniuvaa	That is gross. It is one thing to have sex with your husband or partner during pregnancy but to have sex with total strangers. Yuck! That poor baby. She could pick up all kinds of STDs that can be passed along to that child. I wonder if she knows who the daddy is? Oh one more question... do hookers get maternity leave? lol I doubt her pimp wants her out of action for 12 weeks! It takes all kinds to make the world go round.|`|4jW9rERFaa	Thats awful. I mean I am sure its a good way to make some cash and a good way to catch an STD even if you're being "safe" She'd be better off being a stripper than having sex with people she doesn't know because she would probably make more money anyways. Its disgusting and I think its wrong. She is putting the baby in danger and its almost abusive. I want to watch it if I haven't missed it. I love watching anything to do with pregnancy. Im obsessed. haha.|`|7j9MfenOaa	I think it's shameful that Tyra Banks would give such a slimey creature the fifteen minutes of fame that she wants, and that she doesn't deserve!  I'm growing rather tired of the fact that garbage like that is making a ton of money for having such low class...getting TV spots, book deals, etc.  when she should be in prison for endangering the life of her child.  Tyra should be ashamed of herself because she's just adding to the list of irresponsible media who find people like her worthy of reporting on.  Whatever happened to guests who have actually accomplished a something great?  Then everyone complains about the state of our country...when they should be complaining about television that celebrates ignorant, low class, scum bag human beings.  All it teaches kids is to act just as poorly, and they'll get their big break on TV, movies, and have books written about them.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Hmmm, If someone kills a woman who is 8 months pregnant they go to prison for a double homicide because they killed her and that child.<br>  So can CPS take her child away for neglect and sexual abuse? If they consider a fetus a person in one situation why not in all situations?|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I will be watching.  She is crazy!|`|hameOvsyaa	Im going to watch it now!|`|debe4e8481de65c0542c10667b630ae3aa	I will be watching that today, that is sad that she would belittle herself and dishonor her body like that and put her unborn child in danger, that' shows that she does not care about her baby but say's she's doing this to be able to take care of her baby and herself, WTF!?!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There are different contrasts used for different things.<br>  <br>  The ones that are swallowed are only useful for studying the digestive tract as they do not leave it.  (Although there are some that are digested, one was recently used to study breastmilk by having the mom drink it, I think it studied exactly how much baby was drinking as most studies can't figure it out because mom and baby "cheat" by feeding during sleep)<br>  <br>  There are contrasts injected into the blood which are used to track blood flow and blockages.<br>  <br>  For  Hydrocephalus it would have to be injected into the cerebral fluid directly or be able to cross the blood brain barrier.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/556172_3" rel="nofollow">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/5561...</a><br>  The MRI scan in patients with INPH reveals dilated ventricles with preserved cerebral parenchyma, which is in contrast to the ventricular dilation and significant loss of brain tissue seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease. An MRI scan is also useful in identifying the amount of white matter changes around the ventricles. Although MRI is the most accurate diagnostic imaging modality, non-contrast CT remains the diagnostic imaging technique of choice for rapid and accurate diagnosis of hydrocephalus. The brain CT scan in INPH reveals enlargement of two lateral and third ventricles and relative sparing of the fourth ventricle. There is no single test or imaging study that can be used to conclusively diagnose INPH. It must be diagnosed clinically, because the symptoms caused by INPH overlap many other conditions that affect older adults (Aho & Karis, 2003).An LP may be performed to measure opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and confirm that it is within the normal range (60–240 mm H2O; Relkin et al., 2005).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://oreilly.com/medical/hydrocephalus/news/getting_diagnosis9901.html" rel="nofollow">http://oreilly.com/medical/hydrocephalus...</a><br>  Preparing yourself or your child for CT or MRI scans<br>  <br>  CT and MRI scans are relatively painless procedures, unless your neurosurgeon orders the imagery to be contrast-enhanced-then you'll receive an injection or temporary IV, which allows the contrasting agent to flow into the bloodstream.<br>  <br>  On the day of the procedure, arrive at the imaging center 15 to 30 minutes prior to the time of the appointment. This will allow you time to complete the necessary paperwork and to meet with the technician to go over medical history. If the imaging series is to be contrast-enhanced, arriving early will give the technicians extra time to get an IV started.<br>  <br>  If your child is being tested and has any apprehension about the procedure, ask the technician to explain the test to her. If asked, most technicians will give children a tour of the imaging console and of the equipment in the scanner room before the test to help allay any fears.<br>  <br>  In order to perform the test, the patient will be asked to disrobe and change into a surgical gown, and to remove any type of metallic jewelry. Adults should refrain from wearing makeup or using hair spray, as these may interfere with the imaging device. Next, the patient will be asked to lie on the scanner table, which slides inside the circular drum that houses the imaging equipment, and asked to lie perfectly still while inside the CT or MRI machine so the images don't blur. Infants and small children may be given a mild sedative to help keep them still.<br>  <br>  CT and MRI scans take pictures of the complete cranial and intracranial anatomy, including the subarachnoid spaces and the structures of the posterior fossa. These pictures, called slices, are taken in sections laterally (side-to-side) and sagittally (front-to-back) at different intervals.

ki5hZbcTaa	abortion is not the cure for the situation! It is not birth control. A 12 year old should not be having sex, period. An 18 year old needs to be using birth control pills and condoms. Same for a college student. A 25 year old single mother of 3 should not be out just having sex, she should probably be paying attention to taking care of her children. At that age and with that many kids she could request a tubal ligation.|`|YR9h8p77aa	Condoms, birth control pills, birth control shot, abstinence.

dCewrtXaaa	No. What you are seeing now is colostrum, which the baby can nibble on till your real milk comes in about 3-4 days after s/he is born.<br>  <br>  As for what to pack, take along some soft warm socks because your feet may get cold during the later stages of labor. <br>  Some chapstick or lip balm because your lips may get dry.<br>  Music to relax you but also music to energize you if you get tired from a long labor. They won't let you eat during labor (for good reason, Wendy, it can give you nausea or make you defecate during labor!), so try to eat something light before you go and don't sneak in snacks. <br>  Toiletries like deodorant, tootbrush, toothpaste, comb, etc.<br>  Glasses if you need them, for reading anything you may be asked to sign.<br>  Cotton nursing bra, nursing pads, lanolin cream, etc.<br>  Journal for recording your postpartum thoughts.<br>  Loose-fitting outfit to wear home.<br>  For the baby: stretch suit, sweater or bunting, soft warm cap, undershirts, baby blanket, cloth diapers if you are going to use diaper service, infant car seat.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Nipple stimulation can cause hard and intense contractions. You should not start pumping early. Babies are designed to survive on colostrum right after birth.<br>  <br>  All your need for your baby at the hospital is a car seat and a going home outfit. Anything extra you bring will just be more laundry when you get home. The hospital provides diapers, wipes, a tshirt, blankets, pacifiers, formula if needed, etc. They have sample sizes of everything you could ever possibly need while there if you just ask.|`|cezWu0Wnaa	The hospital will give you enough formula, diaper and wipes to last for a few days. Take a blanket and maybe a swaddle for your baby and I am sure you have the car-seat ready for him/her. It might be a good idea to fix the base in your car. I nursed my son directly from my breasts so I have no idea about breast pumps, sorry! Take some music and reading materials for yourself. It gets pretty boring at times. Good luck.|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	In the UK I believe each hospital differs as to what they provide and what you are expected to bring along with you. I'd check with your midwife as to what's expected.<br>  <br>  The Mothercare website offers a list of what you'll need to take to hospital with you: <a href="http://www.mothercare.com/b/170017031/ref=sc_fe_c_1_0_169907031_4" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothercare.com/b/170017031/re...</a>|`|T0gv52CDaa	Do not start pumping early.  Nipple stimulation is sometimes used to induce labor, and you don't want your little one coming early.  The clear liquid is called colostrum, and that will be your baby's first food.  Your milk wont come in until 2-4 days after giving birth.  There is no need to bring formula with you to the hospital, especially if you plan to breast feed.  If for some reason you are unable or just decide you don't want to breast feed, the hospital will have formula for you to give the baby.  The hospital will also supply diapers, and a onesie for the baby to wear while in the hospital.  You just need to supply an outfit for him to wear home.<br>  <br>  You really don't need to bring much with you to the hospital at all.  Here are a few things you will need:<br>  Toiletries - toothbrush, comb, brush, lotion, etc.<br>  Insurance cards<br>  Outfit to wear home - both yours and babies<br>  Snowsuit or warm carseat cover if giving birth in cold climate<br>  Car seat - many hospitals wont release you & baby until you have one<br>  Nursing bra & top if you plan to breastfeed<br>  <br>  Here are extras you wont need, but will probably want:<br>  Pillow from home<br>  Slippers & Robe to wear around the hospital<br>  Cell phone to call everyone and list of names & numbers<br>  Camera<br>  Snacks to sneak in in case your hospital has the policy of not feeding you until after you deliver.<br>  Books or games - you will be bored for much of the time in the hospital<br>  <br>  That is all that I actually used while in the hospital.  I brought other completely unnecessary stuff (less the 2nd time than the first) but the list I gave you is all that I actually used.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I was just wondering when people pack up bags in advance in order to bring to the hospital for when the baby's born, what do they bring?<br>  <br>  I packed at 37 weeks. Bring a change of clothes for you (you'll most likely be how big you were at around 5 months pregnant), clothes for the baby to wear coming home, clothes for your hubby if he's staying up there with you, house shoes, if you don't want to wear a hospital gown then bring night clothes that you don't mind getting dirty because you will have post partum bleeding and it will most likely get on them (I would suggest just wearing the gown), oh and buy travel size every thing (shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, etc.) to put in your bag now so you won't be rushing around last minute trying to get that type of stuff packed, camera, camera charger, cell phone chargers and that's pretty much it. Everything else will be provided for you.<br>  <br>  I figured diapers, clothes... what else? they normally provide diapers for you<br>  <br>  Are you suposed to bring baby formula if you plan to breast feed just in case breast feeding doesnt want to work at first? <br>  <br>  They will provide you with formula if need be. Most drs want you to try bfing at least the first few days before giving up though so the baby can get the colustrum which helps build their immune system.<br>  <br>  And when can you start pumping breast milk? I know my breast are creating a clear liquid, sometimes it comes out white-ish, and i was just wondering : is that good breast milk or just pre-milk?<br>  <br>  Your real milk will not come in until about 3 days after you deliver. You produce colustrum up until that point. You really shouldn't pump until after the baby is born and your home. If you let your baby get used to a bottle, they normally won't want to BF because the bottle is easier to get milk out of.<br>  <br>   And is it possible to start getting bottles with breast milk ready before the baby is born and when to get it ready (to start pumping)?<br>  <br>  read previous answer
piCMW7ZCaa	Welcome to pregnancy!|`|U5CLIhYgaa	Your supposed to eat an addition 500-600 calories for a healthy baby.

I have heard you can start gaining/showing much earlier your second pregnancy and so on.  I am only 5 weeks and am already starting to gain. I can tell. <br>  As for the morning sickness, just because you don't throw up doesnt mean you don't have morning sickness. It includes the nausea, too.

c73QkZ2haa	If you have a house just open your own daycare. <br>  <br>  And most daycare facilities require a degree in early childhood education just so you know. And yes as someone else said they usually do make you pay you just get a reduced rate.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	So look in the newspaper and online for a nanny job in your area. Try craigslist. Or offer babysitting in your home. There are always people needing childcare.<br>  <br>  However, working in childcare usually pays less than an office job.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I actually found out recently, that most day-cares still make you pay if you bring your child along, which I think is ridiculous.  You would have to nanny or work at a private home daycare.|`|2f49jsLpaa	Most daycare centers will give you a discounted rate, but you will still have to pay for your child to come with you. Also, realize that unless you have experience working in a lisenced childcare facility, or degree in a child-related field, then you'll probably make close to minimum wage working there, minus your child's daycare fees.<br>  <br>  I have worked as a nanny for over 10 years and have children of my own too. While some families will allow you to bring your child with you, many will not, and in the current economy I can tell you that there is a lot of competition for good nanny jobs right now, especially where you can bring your children. If you don't have actual experience as a nanny (not just baby-sitting or caring fo your own child) you'll probably have a hard time finding a decent paying nanny position that meets your needs. Also, many families will offer you less in pay if you bring your child along, infact, several jobs that I interviewed for recently wanted to pay me half of what I normally make as a nanny if I brought my son along too.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider caring for children in your own home. You'll end up watching more children then if you were a nanny, but your child will be there for free, and you won't even need to leave the house.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Most accredited daycare providers will require you to have a degree or at least a certificate in childcare.  Generally, you will not be allowed to work in the same room as your child (favoritism), thus someone else will be caring for your child and that person needs to be paid.  Sometimes, arrangements can be made.  Most people who hire nannies, want someone to devote time to their children alone (which is why they don't use daycare).  Both a daycare center and a private employer will be paying you to watch other children, not your own.  Getting free daycare AND a paycheck is like getting paid twice.  If you find someone willing to give you such a deal, let me know . . . I'll sign up, too!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	When you work at a day care you get child care at a reduced price but it's not free. And honestly it's not as easy as it looks, depending on the age group you get. She probably won't be in the same room as you either. You have to take classes and get certifications which sometimes they pay for sometimes they don't. They might not hire you without them. I worked at a day care and honestly maybe it was just the one I was at but it was horrible, I wouldn't bring my daughter with me even being in the next room. Ok done trying to talk you out of that one lol. But a nanny job would probably work or even doing baby sitting in your house. There are website you can look up ads for people looking for a baby sitter/nanny and place your own saying that's what you do. It works I've gotten jobs that way. I'll try to find the website and add it on here.

Stanley Kubricks Film Lolita, grenzt zuweilen an Pornographie ( vorallem im unzensierten Directors Cut ) erfüllt aber jederzeit den Begriff Würdevoll und /oder Niveau.

b85f1b7ccd23446e1adaf9f0ebcb79b9aa	I know that there is some truth to the adage, "You are thinking about it too hard." Plan some fun activities in the next cycle. Do a lot of hiking, camping, water sliding, any of the kind of activities where you can have lots of fun together. Find something that takes your mind off getting pregnant and wanting that so bad. Sometimes when our minds are occupied nature kicks in and does for us what we were forcing it to do all along. <br>  While, yes there is no conception this month, and that means there is no baby in February, you have that opportunity again. Get a First Response Ovulation Kit, they are really good. But don't make love for the end result to conceive, have fun, get 'jiggy' with it. Love your spouse and don't let him view this as a chore. Neither should you. It will happen.

Good Luck!!|`|a345f04da4ee815dfa80235e3bf749fbaa	It took us 9 months to conceive our now 4-mo-old son.  I went through the same thing you are - I would cry every time my period started.

mf3OOagMaa	Age is not generally a factor in conceiving, unless you are over 38.<br>  <br>  Women are born with a specific amount of eggs - already in their ovaries at birth. Thorughout our life - we "lose" them when we ovulate...each month we lose a few more.<br>  <br>  If you have problems with your ovaries - you may have a lower volume of eggs. If you have problems with your fallopian tubes, your eggs may have a hard time reaching their destination. If you have issues with your uterus (the lining of your womb), your fetilized egg (embryo) may have a hard time attaching itself.<br>  <br>  Having said all of that, there are many factors (on a womans side of conception) that can contribute to a difficult conception - are you having sex during ovulation?  Has "He" had a sperm count - it might be an issue with him, and not with you....have him wear boxers instead of briefs and stay away from keeping his "soldier" in hot environments - including hot tubs (the heat kills sperm)....and stay away from alcohol and caffeine (both of you).<br>  <br>  Back to age, the older you get, the less amount of eggs you release during ovulation (less for the sperm to look for), eventually, when you run out...menopause. You no longer release eggs and you no longer menstruate.  Some women begin menopause around 45 yrs old (can be older, and in some cases, younger) - they go through a time called peri-menopause before the BIG M arrives....typically in their 50's<br>  <br>  If you are not in this age bracket - you might want to talk to a doctor to help determine your delay: it could just be performance jitters. Many want-to-be parents that are trying too hard don't achieve the results that they are looking for. Try relaxing - a little romance and spontineity can go a long way!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Cah6nfV5aa	20 I turned 21 when she was 6 weeks old.

It felt like little taps or pokes down in my pelvis.  They just happened once in a while.  But as the weeks progressed, they got stronger and more frequent.  This one's movements feel a lot different than with my first.  I would say that I started to feel actual kicks and strong movement around 18 weeks or so.  Now, he moves all the time, I get taps, pokes, kicks, and can feel him flipping around in there.  Sometimes the movements are strong enough I can see my whole stomach move.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything
7c8a04f11df091360dfb7062b357adc8aa	Completely normal. My baby has always been really active - ever since i could first feel movement. At 28wks my baby moved so much i was worried. For 5 straight hours i had kicks and jabs and even a few rolls. In one hour i counted 100 kicks! It was insane! But i went to my Ob and she said all was well and good and not to worry - i just had a hyper baby! lol. I thought maybe i was eating too much sugar or something so i cut that out... didn't make a difference. I'm 30wks now and i baby is still really active - wakes me up at night because baby is moving so much. My baby doesn't seem to have a sleeping cycle... its a bit scary... hope baby develops a sleeping cycle once born! lol.<br>  <br>  If you ARE worried though - talk to your Ob. Mine is wonderful - has always told me if i have any concerns, don't wait until my next appointment - call or drop in and ask.

(all good news)  This actually helps strengthen her muscles and bones.  I found that the periods of wakefulness were the same after they were born.  Caffeine consumption and sugar consumption can also increase the baby's activity.  The one thing I couldn't take while pregnant was sudafed.  Both my kids would go beserk after I took it so I stopped doing it and lived with the stuffy nose.

It might also depend on how long ago you had your first baby...Good luck
b064f6b781806d48f9425f682dca1418aa	They sometimes go through these stages, it may be that she wants mummy all to herself and by closing her eyes this is her way of imagining them away and if she refuses to talk to them they may even leave early, it sweet really.|`|59d1d1ac4153bd2b51e12dacf18e5139aa	Maybe.<br>  How many visitors are usually there at once? If there are 2-3 adults surrounding her mummy it might be overwhelming, especially if she is still feeling a little clingy after her cold.<br>  Children go through all sorts of strange and quirky little phases.<br>  A boy I look after when we was young (I think about 18 months - 2 yrs) if anyone so much as looked at him, never mind spoke to him he burst into tears and was incredibly clingy. He did this with strangers but also people he'd seen before, all be it not that often. He'd cry at other mums who were at the toddler groups we visted each week if they spoke to him lol.<br>  But once he got to around 3 he gained his confidence back and now he is 4 and talks to anyone fine. I think he was just a shy child, expecially as a baby.<br>  Perhaps dont make a big deal when this happens again. If she crys and closes her eyes, just sit her on your lap and say a couple of words of comfort - but carry on having a conversation with your visitors as normal. Dont put any pressure on your daughter to open her eyes, or talk to the visitors or even say hello if she doesnt want to.<br>  Let the visitors talk to your daughter too - if they say Hi, and your daughter doesnt respond maybe answer for her and you be the one to say Hello back. If she wants to talk she will - but dont put any emphasis on the shyness cos sometimes that makes it worse and harder for the child to regain their confidence.<br>  I'd say this is a perfectly normal phase - and to just let it flow by. I am sure she'll be gossiping away to the family friends in no time. (and you'll probably wish she'd leave them alone then!! lol)|`|Wa2hfwZGaa	Hi <br>  I am sorry to hear your daughter is becoming upset.<br>  It is possible that due to feeling unwell your daughter is acting in a way that is unlike her normal behavior. This is common in young children.<br>   It could also be a case of jealousy as she wants you to herself. <br>  Alternatively, has there been a change in her life? Are you having another baby? Have you made new friends? Perhaps she has stopped giving her a dummy etc. A big change or even a small change in routine could have upset her. I know a young girl who was very happy and would interact with everyone until she was potty trained, it took a couple of weeks for my friends to realise that their daughter was upset by people coming in because she was afraid of using the potty or having an accident around them. <br>  <br>  I hope this is in some way useful. All children are different, they all react to different situations in different ways. It may just pass or you may realise the trigger. She probably just needs a little time. As awful as it sounds ignoring her may help. None of us like to see our children upset, but if she knows she is getting to you she may carry on. Also she will feel any anxiety you feel so try to relax when visitors come around and do not expect your daughter to cry as this may also set her off.|`|fcd7e0ecb920038cde8abd30066b75ceaa	I don't know the situation, and I don't want to sound too alarming, but if it's specific people that are freaking her out, I would have to ask if they've had some sort of contact with them that you were unaware of. Is there any way she might be out of her comfort zone when you are with your friends? If there's a toy or some other object that comforts her, perhaps you could try using that to keep her calm.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3803837c51bdb11074455f04d2d9caa1aa	It sounds like she may be a little clingy since she was sick. Most parents give thier children a lot of attention when they are sick and she might miss some of it. Or she might be going through a phase when she doesn't want anyone around her Mommy. Hopefully she come out of it soon, but try giving her a comfort toy or something.|`|811e85ac0ec3c30f0a5df20da0063fe8aa	If she is closing her eyes, she is trying to remove herself from the situation.  It means for the moment, she is overwhelmed by the situation.  So don't rush it, don't force it, she'll come back around eventually.

d7d1ccf776323a9505b5b97b2ff42398aa	In order for your milk to come in that breast, you must utilize it to feed him. Breast pumps can be helpful for some people but when I was breastfeeding (and I never used a pump), I expressed the milk manually if my daughter missed a feed from one side or the other. To avoid it happening then you should switch frequently and your son may not like it at first but its the only way to get it to flow as it should. If he won't do it then I can't really think of many other options but I am sure your doctor may have some tips about how to do it.|`|11e02d8275e7dd52854d0a71d6b21aa7aa	If your breast is still producing milk, just keep offering the breast to baby, it'll eventually catch up.<br>  <br>  Check out kellymom.com for more help with breastfeeding problems :)|`|8rkxO69Maa	It's all supply and demand.  So you can pump or you can have him nurse on that side.  You'll be surprised how quickly it'll catch up.  Good luck to you!

nbTZK9sOaa	You are most likely pregnant. A positive is a positive. You may have gotten the negative later on in the day because by then the hcg hormone has been diluted from all that you have eaten and drank through the day. I would say that you are also probably early on in the pregnancy which would also explain why the positive was faint.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is VERY rare to get a false positive but is possible to get a false negative. It is easier to pick up the hormone with your first pee of the day and that was the positive one so I would believe that anyway. If you are not sure what to think then I would test again in the morning and I'm sure it will positive again. Good luck|`|UGBL3wREaa	actually...against what everyone else answered...a positive is not always a positive! It all depends on how faint the line is!

J9W2LXzCaa	I consider my baby's first real word to be elmo. Most baby's can say mama and dada but I don't think these really count because they are just sounds they say they don't actually know the meaning. I feel a baby's first word is one that they know what  the meaning is and they recognize it when it is around and  they use it all the time. My daughters both said momma and dada and made noises but my oldest3 said elmo and knew and recognized who elmo was. This I feel was her first words as many followed and my little one 12 months was bottle she knew what bottle meant and recognizes them when they are around.|`|Js09FbDnaa	My son had a first sentence lol. In your case I'd say mama was her first word, and baby her first 'real word' In my sons case he didn't talk at all until he was over 2 years old, and then one day I came home from work and he said "Mama, you're home from work" and I was shocked, my baby talked! I ran to my husband and said he talked, and my husband says he's been talking all day. I said OMG what was his first word? And husband says he doesn't know, he just woke up & started talking to him, he didn't think it was odd at all hahaha|`|H3BIj2Msaa	no. In alot of languages kids say 'mama' and 'dada' as some of the first basic sounds... even when in that language mommy and daddy are not words. Besides if a child was to say mama... why would they say that when you refer to yourself as mommy? That is nothing like mama. I am a single mom and my kids don't have a dad. And their first sounds were still mama and dada. Dada definitely does not mean dad. A first word, in my opinion is a purposeful sound to communicate a wish or desire.|`|mETvGEozaa	Mostly of what they hear from the adults|`|4b4a98402a82404565f301f93c4158f4aa	I don't really consider all the mama dada type things the first words.  They are generally more accidents the child makes that get a response so they repeat them.  The first word my son ever said that was actually him naming something intentionally that he saw was "ball", and I consider that his first word (he also said mama, dada, etc before that.)|`|IcFWhNRbaa	I think mama would be the first word.  It was the first thing all my children said.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	When my son was 11 months old he said his first word other than the mama, dada.  It was "light".  Not sure why, but that's what it was!|`|3dSCbIcEaa	My son was saying dada at 8 months and at 10 months he said ziggy, his cats name.  He refused to say mama till his sister was born for sum reason though.  After ziggy, he said cat, and bye bye then he just shot off from there. I consider ziggy his first word.
2wBfPVRAaa	You don't HAVE to get the flu shot while pregnant, but my doctor highly recommended it for myself and my husband (I'm 24 weeks pregnant).  Not only for me (yes, it would suck to have the flu while pregnant), but also for my newborn.  The flu can potentially be deadly for babies (and the elderly), so we didn't want to possibly pass it on to him when he arrives in February.<br>  <br>  Pregnant women must get a special "preservative- free" (no thimerosal) version of the shot.  <br>  <br>  Also, for those worried about being injected with a virus while pregnant, it is a dead virus.  It cannot cause the flu.  If you do get the flu shortly after obtaining the shot, it is because you had already contracted it, previous to getting the shot.|`|o2ehEqinaa	Okay, I've been doing so much research and asking around about this topic it's disgusting!  In the end, I've decided NOT to get the flu shot for a variety of reasons....<br>  1.  I've never had one before, why risk doing it now that my body is absolutely turned upside-down with hormones.<br>  2.  They don't offer No-Mercury flu shots in my area<br>  3.  People in Australia and other countries don't believe in injecting ANYTHING into a pregnant woman's body because the body is so unpredictable with all the hormones.<br>  4.  If I get the flu, I will make sure I will drink tons of fluids, take tylenol and use cold water to help keep my fevers down.<br>  5.  I plan to keep washing my hands and staying clear of people who are sick.<br>  <br>  That's just my personal opinion and plan for now.<br>  <br>  The reason's my doctor told me they recommend pregnant women getting the flu shot is obviously dehydration, high fevers and most importantly passing it onto your child if you deliver during flu season.  He suggested that since I'm due in April that it was my choice not to get the flu shot since my baby will be in the clear.  He did however mention that if I was due in the middle of flu season that he'd strongly recommend me get one since an infant needs to be 6 months before he/she can get a flu shot.  I dunno though.  Even if I was due in the flu season, not sure I'd get one.  I'm just not secure with the ingrediants of the flu shots these days....  lead, aluminum, mercury...etc.  Most infant shots like Hepetitus and others are No Mercury now.... but not the flu shot.  <br>  <br>  To be honest, it's all about comfort.  If you are comfortable not getting one, don't.  Just do your research as much as you can so that when you do make your decision, you will feel comfortable with it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|5OQLmECTaa	you are at risk to catch the flu easier than other people, your immune system is down b/c the baby is taking things away from your body that it needs. doctors recommend the flu shot if you are due during flu season.  infants cannot get a flu shot until they are 6 months of age.  they have proven studies that if a pregnant woman gets the flu shot they create the immunity to those virus's like normal and actually pass the immunity to their unborn children, helping them not get sick at a young age.  the flu is more dangerous than you may think, especially for infants whose immune system cannot handle it, and it can turn into ammonia quickly and they could possibly die, or have problems throughout their life.  I never liked the flu shot and never had one until a few weeks ago, I am 34 weeks pregnant and will do anything I can for my baby.  If you are due after flu season, you may not need one b/c your baby won't be exposed to it as much, but if not then I personally recommend it.|`|7YZiy9iWaa	No, it is not an absolute must. <br>  <br>  Don't go by what other people do. Just do what is right for YOU. If you feel like you need the flu shot, get it. If not, don't. There are plenty of people that don't get the flu shot (pregnant women included)  & they don't ever get the flu. <br>  <br>  My midwife asked if I wanted the flu shot, I declined. I'm turning 37 weeks on Wednesday and I see no need. I've never gotten a flu shot, & never will. <br>  <br>  Again, don't go by what everyone else does, just do what you think is best for you! <br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy & good luck! |`|tZU9k9zNaa	Im not sure but I was offered one at 30 weeks and I refused.I just didnt like the idea of being injected with a virus while pregnant.|`|neNfeluIaa	Yes!  It is a must.  See your family docotor or webmd.com for more details.  You need to not only protect yourself, but, your baby, too.|`|qicxk5GMaa	it's absolutely up to you.  it's highly recomended by doctors and health departments but if you're not comfortable getting it you don't have to.  I myself was offered it last week but decied to wait until my first trimester is up... even though they said it doesn't really matter.<br>  As for getting sick after getting the shot, that's not true.  A few years ago it was true since they were using a live virus but the vaccine now is not alive.  There is one that is offered for children called "flumist" that is live but it's not offered to pregnant women.  The only side effects from the flu shot (that I've heard of- I work in a doctors office) is a sore arm from the injection site and sometimes and a little fatigue.|`|yQWnMSc6aa	You do not have to get it. I did get it for several reasons.<br>  <br>  1. Pregnant women are on the priority list. Pregnant women are more susceptible to infections, it is harder for them to fight infections. High fever and dehydration are dangerous while pregnant.<br>  <br>  2. Some immunity to the flu from the shot is passed to the baby through the placenta. Babies born during flu season cannot get the flu shot and are at risk for getting the flu and complications from the flu.<br>  <br>  3. If I have the flu with a newborn I don't know WHAT I would do. It's awful.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a very personal decision. I never got it before. My OB suggested it but left the decision up to me - but those were my reasons.<br>  <br>  The shot is an inactive virus. That is what is given to pregnant women. The nasal mist is a live virus and is not given to pregnant women.|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	You don't HAVE to get it but it is recommended. It can be dangerous to get the flu while pregnant. I had the shot 3 weeks ago and the only side effect I had from it was a little soreness at the injection site. I think it is worth getting. I've gotten it while pregnant all 3 times.|`|MKg9tsWraa	i would say if ur not in an "at risk" category for flu eg asthmatic or elderly then u can do without it and have it next year, as i dont know whether it could affect an unborn baby but i wouldnt risk it.x |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They just recommend pregnant woman get the flu shot but it's not monitory. Why don't you want to get it.
ygVTtSNVaa	No smoking, drinking, drugs, etc. Take a prenatal and make your first OB appt. Otherwise you can eat like normal. Just stay away from fish (some have mercury in them) and undercooked foods. Best of luck and congratulations!!!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	You are growing a human being. And you need to think like you are. <br>  Prenatal vitamins are very important. Now you need to think like: Would you give a baby booze? So you don't drink. Would you give a baby a cigarette or drugs? So you don't smoke and don't do drugs. <br>  What you do, do is eat healthy. Drink a lot of water. Eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. Cut the caffeine as much as you can. I think you can have 2 cups of coffee a day. But energy drinks, pepsi, coke, all those kinds of things, AVOID.<br>  Don't eat too much fatty foods, like pizza, McDonalds...its going to be a huge pain in the a** to get that weight off after. So watch what you eat.<br>  Get plenty of rest. Don't lift huge heavy objects and be careful about what you do in a day. Being pregnant, you really have to start paying more attention to details.<br>  Being pregnant is hard work and you will feel that. There are a lot of emotions on a day to day basis. You may not want sex. You may want it all the time. You need to see your doctor every month up until 28 weeks, I think. Then every 2nd week until week 36. And then every week until you go into labour.<br>  Rememeber, your growing a baby. |`|J5ZfC1ILaa	prenatal vitamins aren't enough theres loads of things you can't eat and do. the obvious things like drinking smoking drugs and stuff. Also there is a huge list of foods you can't eat. No soft cheeses, limited tuna and other similar fish because of the mercury, etc but your midwife should tell you all that. Also there are random things that might be a problem like some araomatherpy oils can be harmful to pregnant women. Just check it out with your midwife, it should be cool.

c390235b35e55b698e2c1447384879d7aa	Plan B is effective but its job is to delay the release of a fertile egg. The effectiveness depends on the time it was consumed. I have taken plan B on more than one occassion at different hours after conception. It has worked for me, except there are still some risks. I had an ectopic pregnancy because the plan B slowed the egg's route to down the fallopian tubes, so the baby remained in my tubes. Luckily, since I was diagnosed early, I am okay. I just wanted to let you know that there is always a small chance of becoming pregnant even when you take plan B. Congrats on the baby. I hope everything goes well for you.|`|29789e33ca83bc63e9460a26d1b4e607aa	it should be still effective....from what i remember i heard it gives you a large dose of whatever medicine is in birth control which stops you from reproducing...i think you should wait for about a week then take a pregnancy test or go to the doctor and see if you are pregnant|`|U5RObaBGaa	it is most effective for the first 12 hours after the incident, but is effective for the 72 hours but the success rate goes down the longer you leave it|`|vygYFdsSaa	As far as I've heard its just as effective. Your cycle is still a bit whacked out after having a baby and Plan B does affect it so hopefully you are in the clear. How late are you love
TaTCbLSzaa	wow im due on june 12th and  im 7 wks and 4 days good luck to u|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Why would you want to skip the blood test?|`|yQWnMSc6aa	She cannot force you into having a blood test. She may be able to give you some suggestions on how to feel up to having a blood test or even prescribe you medication if your morning sickness is really bad. But, it is eventually something you will have to have done as it can and will tell you some valuable things about your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  One good thing to do would be to eat some crackers and drink some ginger ale to get your blood sugar up. It will not alleviate the morning sickness but could make you feel more up to snuff if she thinks it would be a good idea to have the blood test.<br>  <br>  She is going to want to take your blood in the first trimester - and many women don't feel better until the very end of the first trimester or beginning of the second trimester.
Nti8czLvaa	Well I already voted for McCain.  I agree with him on issues, and I don't think what our country needs is Obama, and he doesn't tell us what the change is.<br>  <br>  *A lot of people have no clue, and have just been persuaded by TV to vote for Obama, not saying you guys have.  But did anyone seen Howard Stern, they interviewed people in Harlem, and these people had no clue: Said they were voting for Obama but then said they agreed with Palin, and other things with the McCain/Palin campaign.  So I just feel a lot of people haven't done their research, and that people are just voting for him because TV says to.  <br>  <br>  Also some mentioned this but our congress is the reason our economy has fallen, and it has done this in the past 2 years since our congress has become democratic. You have to realize the President doesn't make all these decisions.  Also Obama's plan for health care for all children won't work, as they already had to do away with this in Hawaii as parents were taking their children off their health care. Obama to me just does not explain himself, he talks about change but what is it.  He also I remember from a debate that he says for every plan he has he has a plan to take one out, so it comes out equal. Well that does not help.  It takes money to  make money.  I just feel McCain is a realist and knows we need to help our country and even if that means spending money.  I also like Palin, and I think she is a lot more qualified to run than Obama.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	OBAMA!. <br>  <br>  Because he’ll help give those that work a tax break. Because he’ll help make college more affordable. Something that is KEY for my son because I’m STILL paying off my own student loans. Without loans, I wouldn’t have been able to go to college. My sister? She went for her Masters degree and won’t profit from it for at least a few years, maybe longer. <br>  <br>  Retirement/social security, S-C-A-R-Y! Right now, my mother doesn’t know what’ll happen to her with retirement. Nevermind ME, nevermind my son. <br>  <br>  Gay rights – You never know if your child may end up being gay. And if they are, do you want something stopping them from being treated like the rest of the human beings on this earth? Or do you want them to be treated differently because of their sexuality. Nobody said you have to LIKE their sexuality, but to ban something?<br>  <br>  Abortion – I disagree with abortion but I do NOT agree with people saying a woman shouldn’t have that choice. If my daughter gets raped and pregnant, she can’t have an abortion? If my daughter is pregnant and her health is at risk, she can’t get an abortion? Even if it means she could die? This is a biggie for me!<br>  <br>  Health insurance – What we currently pay is breaking us! My sister can’t get coverage since she’s self-employed because everything is viewed as a pre-existing condition. I have health insurance through my job. Not saying you need healthcare to be done by the government, but they sure as hell need to make it affordable. And McCains taking away the incentive will KILL it for small businesses. His $5000 per family? Not even remotely close to what health insurance costs us now. Try again buddy….<br>  <br>  And last but not least….Sarah Palin is an embarrassment to women and even worse, to mothers. It’s humiliating when she speaks for “women and mothers” because THAT lady hasn’t got a clue!<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  <br>  Hey Christina! I would be upset and go after anyone who attacks Muslim religion also. Want to know why? Because my family that I married into, my son, my in-laws, they are all Arab. My father in law prays 5 times a day. His wife wears a headscarf and covers up her hair. <br>  <br>  Just because a person is Muslim, doesn't make them a terrorist for crying out loud. Not all Muslims are extremists..<br>  <br>  Apparently there are more ignorant folks that share your views. Sad...very sad...hate Obama all you want, but to hate him and assume his comments are because he's a terrorist as some have insinuated is flat out pathetic.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Obama.  We need a change.  We don't need another Bush in office, look at where we've ended up by him leading us for the past two terms.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I don't vote but IF I did I would vote for Obama. He makes alot more sense to me than McCain. I was watching the debates and whenever Obama would speak, McCain would have this smirk on his face and I HATE people like that. I also do not agree with McCain's health insurance plan. Taxing benefits? Get the hell out of here, they're expensive enough. |`|QoenvlFuaa	McCain because I agree with him on the major issues (abortion, economy, foreign policy).|`|AA12080472	obama, we need  a change.  |`|RPnkxDBAaa	McCain.  I haven't read your other answers yet but everyone seems to have jumped on to the Obama band wagon and think he is so wonderful without really investigating the facts.  <br>  I feel McCain is the strongest to lead this country in keeping it safe from enemies.  In my opinion I feel he has the stronger moral character (Palin is a good representative of moral character) and conservative views.<br>  I believe he is looking to the future to stop wreck less needless spending that will help our children and I have 6 kids.  <br>  I feel he also is looking for independence from hostile countries on oil by beginning drilling now and other alternative methods of fuel- nuclear etc.<br>  Good luck in your decision.|`|NE51Tzi0aa	As a mother, I believe that Obama is going to be the right choice for me and my family. I am a registered Republican but I am voting for a Democrat because I believe that it is time that we took a step to move the country in a new direction. I am hopeful that Obama would be able to be a breath of fresh air in what has become a very stale and musty executive branch. <br>  <br>  Additionally, I am fearful of what we would become should McCain have a stroke, a heart attack or another bout of cancer and we find ourselves in a country being led by Palin. I do not wish that upon anyone. |`|pgJGqueMaa	Although I am not a mother I take care of my younger siblings. In my opinion Obama will make a better president for a number of reason. The main reason I say this is due to the fact it seems as if the republican party is completely and utterly out of control. I am in no way a sexist but, John McCain is very old a there a strong possibility Sarah Palin will take over during his term. With this said she seems to have no sort of control or authority over her on family and she is breaking the law simply because it suits her. Her 17 year old daughter is pregnant by an 18 year old man, which I believe is statutory rape yet no type of legal action has been taken and they are parading around. . I don't think its a positive message to send to the youth and specifically young women of this country. <br>  <br>  I also believe that Obama will really focus on education which will really help a country that has made college a privilege rather than a right.<br>  <br>  |`|83TkWic3aa	I am voting for Obama, as a mom-I feel that he makes it more a priority for health care for all children and making this world a little better for working moms and more fair.<br>  One major reason why McCain isn't getting my vote, Palin looks and gives the perception of an evil, vindictive woman whose already been investigated for misuse and abuse of power in Alaska-I don't want a woman like that running the country.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Already sent in my absentee for Obama. I feel like when I hear him speak he is not talking in circles. His ideas are more family friendly in my point of view. THe biggest reason is that he is about the only person that I have seen this term who has not given me the creeps in some way or another.|`|siDcjgJCaa	OBAMA! He is the better option for my daughters future. We need change and I agree with him on his policies. My husband and I  (our family) will benefit greater if Obama were in office based on his domestic policies.|`|LKHnjAcaaa	OBAMA 2008|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	McCain!!|`|RLoJ8rfmaa	McCain...Everyone keeps blaming the president for our issues but in reality it is the Congress which at the moment is a Democratic Congress...So what party ran us into the ground?? Plus anyone know what change Obama wants???  He has said He will go against anyone who attacks the Muslim religion.  <br>  <br>  
yrDqtazLaa	Do you take iron supplements? Black poop is usually a result of iron, usually when you're taking an iron prenatal vitamin or iron supplement. If it's not that, it could be what you're eating. I wasn't taking iron when I was pregnant, but my poop came out dark green/black at times too.<br>  <br>  Note: You should tell your doctor about it, though. Tell your doctor EVERYTHING you aren't sure of.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I think you are fine... :)  |`|H74F8jxuaa	That might be something that you should be concerned about.  I think you should try to call your doctor's nurse and see what they have to say.  I would rather be safe than sorry.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Probably normal.  Hard to say without knowing your diet.  Also...the darker color can result from iron in the prenatals.<br>  <br>  You can google "normal bm colors" and see the wide range of colors that are normal for humans.  Don't ask how I know, lol...|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I actually had the same thing. It is from your prenatal vitamins probably. Instead of taking prenatal vitamins you may take flinstone vitamins. They are the closest thing to a prenatal vitamin and they don't turn your poop green. |`|735KiHn2aa	Are you taking prenatal vitamins? This can happen quite often from the vitamins. Just to make sure though, mention it to your doctor at your 1st appt.|`|90z6GK0iaa	The nausea and being tired is normal, and if you are on prenatal vitamins, it could be affecting the color of your poo.  |`|8HxxisnDaa	It's probably the prenatal vitamins if you're taking them.|`|dju4Qq2gaa	I THINK YOU ARE JUST FINE. IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HURTING YOU ARE OKAY...... SO DON'T WORRY. BEING WORRIED IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU OR THE BABY.|`|b02e1515d704ef86ee681760e4319eb0aa	Could  be too much iron, are you taking supplements?<br>  <br>  |`|6ddbc93de92f4712b7e02f5dfe165973aa	are you taking folic acid, if so this can cause it. but i would suggest getting it checked out just to be on the safe side
ogYrGjYuaa	yes don't worry////|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Its normal!  Congrats|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I experienced all of that except for the burping pretty much from like 4 weeks to about 14 weeks I'd say. This is also my first pregnancy so I'm not a 100% but I'm pretty sure it's completely normal. Good luck and congrats!|`|Tm1Rpfq4aa	Yes, it's all normal and it's great you don't have "morning" sickness, although many woman don't get until 7 or 8 weeks but hopefully you will not:)|`|5Ppmmy4qaa	yes all of this is normal.. what u should do is go get the book called what to expect when expecting. it a really good book.. it tells u week by week.. goodluck |`|ETvV9aypaa	yup sounds normal... congrads|`|PmiZUblCaa	That is all normal. Sometimes you don't get morning sickness, but are really gassy and sleepy. <br>  <br>  The fatigue comes from hormones early on in pregnancy. Later on you get tired because of carrying all that weight. <br>  <br>  I'll post up a link you can use for a week by week guide. Helped me out my first baby.<br>  <br>  Congradulations and Good luck!!<br>  <br>  AA|`|pYjGlAKCaa	Ugh... completely normal. I had the same issues. I never did get morning sickness, but I was bloated until my 5th month. I am 1/2 a week away from my 7th month and the third trimester with my first. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck to you!<br>  <br>  Oh, and from my experience... all the books say how things get better in the second trimester... Lol~ They didn't for me. I think throughout this pregnancy, there were maybe three weeks total where I wasn't exhausted. Hope your experience is different!|`|SUnDwvEnaa	Welcome to pregnancy! It'll get more fun as time passes. ;) Those things are all normal. I felt the same way! My hair was disgustingly oily too.|`|azrKKNfTaa	Oh it is normal and get used to it the gas just gets worst, and stinker! sorry but it is true|`|VM2H3daBaa	Lots of stomach noises.|`|p78yK4xwaa	Yes that's all normal
LDiBjNf5aa	I don't get my period until the 4th inactive pill.<br>  <br>  Missing one pill doesn't affect getting pregnant; however, you didn't make up for it, so it adds a slight chance to the 1% that was already there. Not a huge increase, but an increase nonetheless.|`|WPI0Z47saa	You will have to wait until you take the test to know for sure. Yes you can get pregnant from missing one pill but the chances are still pretty low if it was just one. You may have yourself so worked up also and stressed out and that could stop your period from coming too.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They could be pms or pregnancy symptoms. Your body could just be messed up from missing that pill or it could have caused you to get pregnant. Take the test tomorrow and see what it says. You may be pregnant. Good luck!|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Very slight chance you could be...as nothing but abstinence is 100%....but given the fact that you doubled up like you were supposed to...I'd say your probably ok.|`|TIUOZ1Vdaa	your ego is prego.
vue9NOhYaa	If you've had positive at home tests, you are pregnant.  It would be a waste of time/money for the doctor to do a blood test, so most do not. <br>  <br>  (Many women don't have morning sickness/sore nipples or any other symptoms early on.  I had no syptoms until a couple of weeks after the missed period.)|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	Confirming your pregnancy is good. It will be positive.<br>  <br>  Congrats. |`|mBeGdFO2aa	I went to a clinic after my hpt and they did some tests to confirm I wasn't already a high risk pregnancy.  Urine test, checked my blood pressure and asked me some general questions.  My responses determined if I could wait for my OB appt or if I needed to see an OB sooner.<br>  <br>  I'd go see a doctor before the OB appt just to be sure.  :)|`|m0DgqEcjaa	Don't worry about morning sickness etc just yet, you might be lucky and not get it but then again you might get it in a couple of weeks! |`|qnxAN2t5aa	no the ob clinic will confirm your pregnancy. congrats! |`|cnMXJMFUaa	Nah!<br>  <br>  Your 1st appt. with the OB will confirm it when they do the u/s.|`|AA12064370	I have not heard of a doctors office not wanting you to come in rite away to get the blood work done to make complete sure and at least talk with you about the pregnancy. My suggestion is call around to a couple other OBGYN doctors and see what they say. I would go in to confirm as well as talk about the pregnancy if nothing else to get tips and make sure things are going ok. Congrats. |`|5HgFqU20aa	The OB clinic will probably confirm the pregnancy when you go to your first appointment. <br>  <br>  But if you feel like there may be a chance you aren't , make an appt with a family practice just for a pregnancy test. Home testing is not always accurate. There are all different things that can cause a false positive. <br>  |`|OuuYoSBeaa	your first doctors vistit with the doctor you will be seeing throught the pregnancy, should do a preg test on you...if you already set up the appointment, then wait, they should test you...<br>  in the mean time, take your vitimans, and enjoy your non morning sickness|`|f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	Two home tests are still only 99% accurate<br>  2 home tests 99% accurate there is still a margin of error.<br>  Might as well avoid the pseudosematicism of false pregnancy and get it done at a hospital for a 100% sure test.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	No you can wait until you go the the OB clinic. They will confirm it for you. If you had two positvie HPT's then you are fine. Congrats!!!|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	When you go to the clinic they will confirm the pregnancy then. Not everyone gets all the symptoms of pregnancy.|`|kAdgwDFqaa	That is what the appt. is for.  Not all women have pregnancy symptoms like morning sickness.|`|pa3ZYjocaa	Yes you should. |`|jz2U6wzKaa	If your not sure and you have no symptoms then you really should confirm it but then again there's a lot of people who don't feel anything 
AA11380378	Saltine crackers, pretzels... keep them in your purse! That's the only thing that has helped me. Have your prenats vits in the evening, not in the am.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Eat plain crackers before you even get out of bed in the morning.  Have stuff with ginger, especially like ginger tea.  Banana's are good for it, and apples are too if you can stomach the sour taste.  Otherwise, anything with a lot of Vitamin B6 and B12.  Best of luck, I had the same problem with my son's pregnancy! I also ate a lot of just plain white rice in the beginning.  And just plain grilled chicken.  |`|p0LsYvJTaa	I would keep some dry crackers and a can of Pepsi on my bedside table. When I woke up, before I even moved very much, I would nibble the crackers and take small sips of the Pepsi. After a few minutes, it was "safe" to get up.<br>  <br>  Crystallized ginger works for some people, as does Jamaican ginger beer (which is non-alcoholic, obviously, and contains real ginger, unlike most ginger ale).<br>  <br>  Some women report that smelling a fresh lemon helped get rid of their nausea. Never tried it.<br>  <br>  I also bought Sea Bands from the pharmacy. They are little cloth wrist bands with a plastic bump that you wear against the inside of your wrist, a pressure point for relieving nausea. I would wear them while I drove to work in the morning. They seemed to help a little.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can buy these hard candies or suckers that are called preggie pops and they are made to help with morning sickness. I used them and they are GREAT. THey really helped. I hope things get better.<br>  <br>  Here is a site:<br>  <a href="http://www.threelollies.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.threelollies.com/</a><br>  <br>  Or you could go to the store Motherhood. |`|GjuRYsITaa	i use to use ginger nut biscuits with my other pregnancy's haven't had any morning sickness or anything this time round yippee|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	Saltine crackers and peanut butter|`|ai0Xqg0faa	try going to walmart and and getting something called Sea Bands, i use them, and they work sooo great!! they are by the meds you use if you go on a air plane or boat.<br>  good luck,it will go away!!|`|6PLSInPnaa	If you take prenatals...ask your Dr to give you Premisis prenatals...they took my nausea away immediately.<br>  Ginger tablets.....or ginger ale and saltines.|`|md4p6okpaa	My wife's nausea was so bad they had to give her the stuff they give to kemo patients.  No home remedies worked for her.|`|ndSijDItaa	Try eating those ginger candies, and also room temperature ginger ale might help.|`|nJQr2oOcaa	those red and white peppermint candies, drink water slowly, saltine crackers, deep breaths
Xc02z608aa	hey if she can't quit i'd rather see her only smoke 3-5 a day than a whole pack.  Instead of coming down on her for smoking congratulate her for smoking so little.  give her a little encouragement, it will go farther than judgement.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Smoking is very hard to do and I would rather see your friend only smoking 3-5 cigarettes a day then the whole pack.  It sounds like she is trying to quit but it is hard for her.  My mom cut down from almost half a pack to 3 a day while pregnant with me and I turned out just fine.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	definatley not.<br>  <br>  her son may seem fine now but issues could develop later on.<br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxx|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	not always true, but like my doctor told me. it could be more harmfull on you and your |`|c5a13dc678634ab7d73438e3e7228640aa	no, its not true.  if she is smoking while pregnant, then the babies are "smoking" too. everything that she puts into her body goes straight to the babies.  im preg with twins too, and i dont smoke, and dont allow smoking in my house or vehicles.  twins are usually smaller than singles anyway, and adding smoking on top of that could make them even smaller.  think of it this way"  ask her, do you buy your son cigarettes?  she is pretty much buying them for her unborn babies.|`|xTlfOPu5aa	there is always an increased risk of miscarriage, stillborn or birth defects associated with smoking (i quit the day i found out - its not easy!) but doctors say that if you are a smoker and cannot quit, to limit your cigarette intake to 3-6 cigs per day. at least she is keeping it limited, and i hope things are ok this time around x|`|lf7puhYdaa	There is no way of telling until the babies are born.  My friend smoked during her pregnancy and her daughter (who is 2 now) has asthma and always has some sort of respitory infection (pnuemonia, etc.).  On the other hand, my mom smoked during all three of her pregnancies and me, my bro & sis are all ok.  You just never know.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you one thing...I certainly would not risk it.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everybody is different. So many people smoke throughout their entire pregnancy and their babies come out fine but that's not true for everyone so why would anyone take their chances. I smoked like a pack a day until the day I found out and I haven't smoked since. Why put her baby's health at risk?|`|iyRWN59Xaa	While smoking is not good for baby, at least she has reduced dramatically her intake.  Leave it up to her doctor and her.  Some doctors say, don't quit outright as it puts a strain on the body, thus a strain on the baby.  To ween yourself of cigs.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	My mom smoked with all of her kids...she has 5, but in those days, they didn't know the dangers of smoking while pregnant. I personally think its a selfish and stupid thing to do. I would never jeopardize my child's health for a little nicotine.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice benefited my children.<br>  |`|jiF56lRaaa	my mother smoked with my little brother threw her whole pregnancy and he had to stay in the hospital and get his lungs fully developed and he know has austhma <br>  |`|NjVnvBBeaa	The effects of smoking while pregnant are a little different than smoking around babies. Neither is good, but they are a little different. Smoking during pregnancy is most linked with low birth weight and early labor. Asthma and respiratory problems are more often due to mothers (and fathers) smoking around babies AFTER they are born. This also includes the higher sids risk. |`|6PLSInPnaa	No that is not true. Their are many different dangerous chemicals in tobacco. I smoked with my first daughter (who is now 19) and I went into premature labor(because of the smoking) they held the labor off for 4 weeks and she was still born 5 weeks early. We almost lost her. Her esophagus did not fully developed and caused the food she would consume through bottle to pour back into her lungs and it was drowning her. She stopped breathing and the ems had to take her to the hospital where she stayed with tubes in her nose and down her throat and iv's hooked to this 2 week old baby and atayed in icu for 2 weeks. ALL BECAUSE OF MY IGNORANCE!!!!! So smoking can cause great damage to the babies!!! Just because the first one turned out fine don't mean the same for these babies. Twins need all the nutrients and body weight they can get while in the uterus. The smoking will cause them to be low birth weight among lots of other things.|`|BmrCGdWyaa	im sorry but I see smoking and drinkin when pregnant abuse to your unborn child, they cannot help what their mother does and its not fair to burden a small child with the health implications!<br>  <br>  Totally disagree with drinking/smoking in pregnancy... makes me angry infact, sorry just my opinion, your friend is silly, she obviously isn't worried about hurting her baby and doesn't give a damn... thats my opinion..... |`|kKiDrGy3aa	smoking is bad everyone knows this..but if she stops at once it could raise her blood pressure cause her & babies stress etc...<br>  3-5 really isn't allot for a smoker   <br>   she should try to cut back twins REALLY are at HIGH risk anyway!!<br>  my aunt smoked when she was preg. w/twins & she did loose them!<br>  stopping cold turkey isn't quite the right solution though!!!<br>  Good Luck to her and those babies allot of women would love to be blessed with twins.....|`|S7Pc5iAMaa	She should cut down even more! Twins are at higher risk for everything so she is taking a way bigger chance. especially for being born early and that is not good! The tiny ones will struggle! She needs to quit or at least get down to one a day or something. |`|xV0APOtaaa	My mom smoked with me and I have asthma ( heredity through my father's side).<br>  <br>  She also smoked with my twin brothers and she was 38 when she was pregnant (not quite a pack/day) and they are absolutely fine!!!<br>  <br>  I see no harm in a couple cigarettes a day.|`|VlrHwb7Haa	I agree with Gemini. Twins are already at risk for low birth weight.  My mother smoked with me and I was premature, jaundiced and very little.|`|r4N3R0dtaa	She's technically taking her chances,  it's 50/50. If everything's fine for her and her baby, great! If something goes wrong she can only blame herself.|`|oRIWyTZxaa	No, your friend is lucky to survive but smoking injures health of baby too|`|cHLiOZdyaa	NO. I can't even answer this question how I want to because just the idea of this makes me so incredibly angry.|`|AykczQleaa	Not always...smokers take their chances.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Everything might turn out fine. <br>  Or it might not.<br>  <br>  Smoking is a risk factor for problems -- it increases the probability of problems, but doesn't guarantee them.  Her older child is fine because the gamble came up in her favor.  For her current children -- no one can say.<br>  <br>   (Since twins are already at increased risk for prematurity and low-birthweight, I'd think she'd want to do everything she can to improve the chance of a good outcome -- but it IS her life and her decision ... and I'm sure her doctor has talked to her about the risks.)
MgvYMfIWaa	i felt like that through most of my pregnancy. pregnancy can either increase your drive or decrease it. might try to act out your fantasies and see if that will help get your riled up to do the deed. foreplay makes it easier to me to get in the mood to actually do it instead of thinking about it.<br>  every pregnancy is different, so it probably is your hormones.  im sorry to say and i used to feel that way with my husband but we were also going through a rough time and after i got all my feelings out and got it settled we started having fun again. i hope you can get everything worked out.|`|9c8893607c79c3c2b3e1d6817da78217aa	I've felt like that my whole pregnancy. I just can't bring myself to do it. When I do, it's just to make my husband happy cause I know it will be a LONG time before we can have sex after the baby is born. During the second trimester, it's supposed to get better, so maybe you will snap out of it like everyone else says they do. Hopefully you won't be like me.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	my hubby, who is a man's man barely shows any emotions, cried to me about how he thinks i don't find him attractive. he was heartbroken. i had to explain to him my hormones and how it isn't him.... i do wild sex dreams, but i don't have any desire to act them out with my hubby. pregnancy has really pulled on the e-brakes on our sex life|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I get that way too. |`|Wkf0YTKtaa	It is completely normal.  Ive felt like that through most of this pregnancy.  Hopefully your boyfriend understands that, my husband does.|`|sYqoS8OOaa	Completely normal. I am 34 weeks pregnant and haven't had a sex drive since I found out I was pregnant.<br>  <br>  My fiance...poor guy!|`|1e48d16daaea7eb6fcaac1a90c2764d6aa	its normal....... your hormones that make you horny is down so its obvious that you will not have any sex drive at all|`|7lcHIjDwaa	I am 11wk no sex drive neither. i have been like this from day one of my pregnancy|`|jQDeTTVhaa	Its normal I also have no sex drive at all but I try and suck it up when my husband wants it|`|IVNM1O5naa	I was like that. I didnt want sex AT ALL. Then, when I got to about 24 weeks, I wanted it all the time. Then, when I got into my later stages of pregnancy, I didnt want it at all, because I was so big and miserable. Its your hormones. Its normal.
AA10296972	Every pregnancy is different.  With my 1st I leaked like crazy about halfway through my pregnancy...with my 2nd, I don't really remember...with this one I leak but some days it's more than others.  It's really weird!  But I'm positive it doesn't mean you won't be able to breastfeed.  Good luck!!!|`|R13ckTLoaa	congratulations for your second pregrant hope you get a healthy beautiful baby  and be sure that not everytime you will get pregnant will be like the other everything's differ and try to ask your doctor about it if you 're worried ,  with my best wishes for you.|`|UZMvF5o1aa	Keep in mind, all women and all pregnancies are different.  I know many women who didn't leak at all until their babies were born.<br>  <br>  I just started leaking this week, and I am 34 weeks.  Don't worry, it will come soon enough!|`|PtqweQVcaa	I'm not necessarily leaking but will get out some liquid if I apply pressure to the nipples.<br>  <br>  I never leaked with my first pregnancy.|`|LyGZYJVtaa	From what I heard, you'll start lactating when the baby gets here or close to it. Give yourself time, it will come.|`|wxelfC5saa	I'm only 9 wks.. No leaking for me yet.. I think you will start a few days after you give birth.. usually 3 days. 14 weeks was early! |`|GahMjygBaa	i have no clue.  im 33 weeks pregnant and im not leaking either. i guess it jus happens to sum earlier than others|`|7u37NvPqaa	i'm 37 weeks and I have not leaked.  It depends on the body.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	I had my daughter 4 days ago and my breasts just starting getting full this morning (ouch!). I hadn't even really leaked at all before now and started leaking around 7 months with my son so it's always different. <br>  <br>  I am not breastfeeding her as I did with my son, but I am sure if you are breastfeeding the stimulation of feeding will bring on the milk. Good luck and congrats!|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I've been leaking since around 14-16 weeks.  Most of the time it's not enough to wear nursing pads.  But then, if I go without a bra, it's enough to make nice round wet circles.  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I've always wondered when I would start leaking. I guess everyone is different. I'm almost 16 weeks and I haven't yet and this is my first pregnancy. Good luck!|`|XeJtUGoSaa	This is my first pregnancy and I am curious about this also. I'm 24 weeks & haven't leaked yet.|`|GeMenejZaa	i never leaked with my first daughter or this one. i dont think its something that always happens|`|fPX1lD8uaa	I never leaked... so I'm guessing that it doesn't happen to everyone.
jOBBlJnvaa	Sunday...7 day weeks. So Sunday would be 2 days after Friday. |`|m1oaS5Xpaa	Sorry...but i cant be nice. not today. FIVE PLUS TWO IS SEVEN!!!!! FREAKING DUHH! dont think too hard...your blonde hair might catch on fire! ROFLMFAO!!! i would imagine that since there are seven days in a week..and that you were 4 weeks and FIVE days on FRIDAY....and also seeing how seven minus five is two...it might possibly be concieved that two days from friday might possibly be SUNDAY!!!!! imk not sure tho cuz im an idiot like you!<br>  |`|Qd0sFMdHaa	5 weeks on Sunday. when you get to day 7, another week has passed... friday is day 5, saturday is day 6, sunday starts the new week. |`|dqSA7j7gaa	Sunday you will be 5 weeks.<br>  Friday is 4 weeks and 5 days<br>  Saturday is 4 weeks and 6 days<br>  Sunday is 4 weeks and 7 days or 5 weeks.|`|4WASY7QWaa	You are right. so if you were 4 weeks and 5 days on that friday, then you would be 5 weeks that sunday. dont second guess yourself! good luck!|`|qA9JtQBMaa	Sunday.|`|vek2OwQfaa	Sunday|`|mvyXZ39gaa	Julian is right.  Every Sunday you'll bump up a week, lol.  Congrats and good luck.  :)  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	The answer is Sunday. Congrats!|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Every 7th day you will be a new week
2fX0p9ZZaa	It's a positive.. <br>  It dosent matter how faint it is, if you can see it, its there YOUR PREGNANT..<br>  If Your still unsure just go to the doctors and get a blood test..<br>  <br>  Congratulations|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You're pregnant - how dark the line is really is irrelevant.  No, cysts do not make false positives.|`|ZY0GTtTRaa	Pregnant!!! :D|`|pWDYcBA7aa	YOUR PREGNANT!!<br>  Wow this is exactly how mine looked and i didn't even think it was a positive so i just left it alone but then I started getting all these symptoms and I went to the doctor and i found out I was 5 weeks pregnant!!<br>  Good luck and god bless you!!<br>  |`|Zy07f0Zwaa	It generally doesn't matter how dark of faint the line is and usually in the early stages of pregnancy the line will be faint and grow darker as HCG increases. <br>  <br>  From your photo you are definitely pregnant =]<br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS =]|`|SMkB2LKIaa	That's definately a positive! Any line, no matter how faint, means the hormone is present in your body and you are pregnant. Congradulations!|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	looks like a good positive to me! Congrats!!!|`|QPP1xMLxaa	This is a positive test result so yes you are pregnant. I had one that I thought was faint and I let it sit for a minute and it did indeed get darker so I am pregnant now. I am about 6 weeks now.<br>  Congrats!<br>  and no ur eyes are not playing tricks on you. even if it was a little fainter it would still be positive, and when you get more horomones in ur body it will be a lot darker. But yes it is positive.|`|d949d6371febf9695b8f8993df12ab4caa	Don't worry about it sweetie your pregnant. It may have come up light cause there was not enough hcg to make it dark. To make hubby feel better take another in the morning when you get up and im sure that one will be darker. Best of luck to you and congratulations|`|PoAiGIUDaa	It looks like a positive to me! Wait a few more days and test again if you want, you'll most likely get a darker line! Congrats!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Your eyes are not playing tricks on you. You're pregnant congratulations!!|`|dHpXASbPaa	go to the doc and get tested there an d that would be the best answer that line is very faint|`|4iXL4C6paa	pregnant, all four of mine looked like that, congrats|`|vMhsy241aa	that is a POSITIVE!!! <br>  <br>  congrats!!!! and stay safe!|`|58Y1I2zhaa	This is a positive test  - trust me  I have two kids and am on my fifth pregnangy  and all of my tests were lighter than that - i don't know about the cysts though|`|qsBJzUy1aa	Your pregnant. There is no false positive. Lots of false negatives.|`|SQDOt1kPaa	Hey I m not a doctor but that looks like a positive to me CONGRATS!!!<br>  <br>  Go and see your doctor to make sure but I would take that as yes yes yes!!|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	positive...you can test in a few days and it should be darker.|`|UBe8Pck9aa	CONGRATES MOMMA!!!!|`|4e833c08dc49ec15a3d74e52613cf7c2aa	congratulations :)...<br>  <br>  maybe get a blood test to test your HCG levels, but that is for sure a positive..|`|Umvco79Qaa	CONGRATS TO YOU!!!!! YOU'RE PREGNANT!!! =D<br>  |`|h5vY9y84aa	your pregnant no doubt.
9Qf4khqLaa	I don't believe in the values of the quiverfull movement. First of all, having 18 children is irresponsible. There is no way that each child can get the attention they need and deserve from their parents. While its good that the children take care of each other, it seems to be robbing them of a childhood. As soon as one is born, the next oldest takes care of them. They don't behave really like normal children. Have you ever seen them play? They can't dance, they can't watch tv, internet, movies, any of that is restricted from them. They don't have many friends outside of themselves. They are extremely sheltered. Do you want to have that many kids? Honestly? Because they (obviously) don't use protection. Luckily for the children they can afford so many.|`|AA11109728	I can't speak about every family that takes part in the Quiverfull movement, but I watch the Duggars and they seem like they have a perfectly good handle on things.  Some people are just meant to be in positions like that, being able to handle the care and upbringing and financial responsibility of such a large family - they are good at it, so why not?  I'm sure not all parents are cut out for it, but if they are I don't see a problem.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	You also have to hand it to their older children who provide a great deal of care for the younger children. <br>  <br>  My thoughts are that if that works for them more power to them and may God bless them richly.  As for me and my family two children will be plenty for us.|`|tXeqSv5Qaa	im sorry but they are brain washer the control every thing i find them sick how consertive they are  and there level of control over there kids minds really bothers me|`|cteyFJxhaa	OH GAWD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't even imagine......|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	My only problem with it is that it seems as though the older kids get stuck taking care of the younger ones alot, which isn't really their responsibilty, and that there is no possible way those kids are getting much one on one time with their parents, which I think all kids need.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I know it, all those children are well mannered and polite.  I do not know how that woman manages to fend for all those moral children.  God Bless her heart.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I think it's fine for those that can handle having that many kids.  Not everyone can.  The kids are very well behaved but they are being raised completely differently than most kids these days and that means it's a lifestyle choice not just a reproductive/family choice.  The Duggars have committed their entire way of life to this kind of thing.  If that sounds like it's for you then great.  Otherwise, I'd probably avoid the full on quiverfull idea.|`|A03NJA26aa	yes they do seem happy and perfect but everyone, no matter who you are, has flaws. There are many things that that family will not be able to do because of their size. Also, the older daughters are always taking care of the younger ones which provides no freedom for the older ones. They will probably end up at home for a long time and will find it hard to break free. I envy them sometimes but other times I am glad my family is not like that.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I very much respect the inner workings of their their family "unit" and could only hope that every family was as functional. That said, I don't agree w/some of their beliefs/restrictions and don't want to raise my children that way.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I think they are the perfect example of what I family should be like!  =]  Not saying the size in general, but their lifestyle.
AA10186411	Do not take her.  I wouldn't even be friends with her.  If it were her 1st one, maybe I would be ok with it.  But she obviously is too ignorant to learn her lesson.  You need to ditch that ho-bag.|`|OMDLu028aa	I could never in any way help an abortion from taking place. If driving her there makes you uncomfortable, don't go. I don't think that makes you a bad friend at all.|`|DrlDqVZeaa	I would tell her no, she didn't need your help opening her legs and having unprotected sex, make her go alone. Who knows if you can't bring her maybe she won't be able to have it at all! |`|HwujORd2aa	You don't have to drive her there or support her in her decision, but that's up to you.  If she has to walk home or take the bus because no one else will go with her, it could be dangerous for her medically. <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, after it's over, have a heart-to-heart with her.  Try to help her make sure the same thing doesn't happen yet again by encouraging smart choices about who she's with, and using birth control.  It's ok to let her know how you feel, as long as you frame it that you're concerned for her repeatedly getting pregnant and not learning to take care of herself and her life.  You will never agree on what's right or wrong about all the abortions.  But three times in one year - I mean, I support choice - but this girl needs more help than just a friend can give. Get her to figure out (maybe with a counselor) why she keeps doing this to herself. <br>  Good luck.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I was in the exact same situation once.  She already had two children and it was her second unwanted pregnancy in three months (miscarried the first one).  Not to mention the father was my brother-in-law.  I justified going to the consultation by telling myself that I was being a "good friend".  I was just being there be supportive and not judge, even though I was strongly against abortions.  To this day (almost 5 years later), it haunts me.  When she asked me to bring her back a few days later for the procedure, I just couldn't do it.  I told her that I loved her dearly and I respect the fact that it was her decision, but I just couldn't be a part of it.  That was my niece or nephew and I just couldn't assist her in terminating it.  She respected my opinion and that was that.  She found another ride.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Explain to her that you love her but you don't support murder and you just can't drive her there. I can't believe that she's had 2 already this year. What a horrible person she must be. She needs to go get her tubes tied or keep her legs closed if she is just going to keep killing babies. I wouldn't want to drive her either. I would ditch her. If she really wants to do it then she can find another way there.|`|GkE1J8kGaa	I don't think you should ditch her even though you think its wrong, you have to let your friend make her own decisions because she's the only person who has to live with it. she'll need your support try to support your friend in whatever decision she make even if you think its the wrong one. because you can tell her to have this baby but at the end of the day she's the one who have to take care of it. Not you. <br>  Good Luck<br>  |`|HKEywfRkaa	If you go with her then you are condoning her choice and going against what you believe in. You definitely have to stay home that day. Maybe if she doesn't have your support when she keeps killing her babies then she will start being a bit more careful and not have to put you in this situation.<br>  It's hard because she's a friend, but you have to do what's right for you.|`|8VJwoGXKaa	Well she is your friend but if you don't believe in what she's doing and your feelings are that strong then tell her that you wouldn't be comfortable bringing her there.  She can find someone else to do it.  That is a really sucky situation she's in.|`|gG8oyymiaa	Just tell her no I know that this is hard. But you gotta go with what you believe in also. If this is her third abortion in a year then i wouldn't go ethier. Sounds like she isn't learning her lesson and if people keep supporting her on it she isn't going to learn|`|YPuVx2Niaa	I personally wouldn't go.  She doesn't need to be having sex, getting pregnant, just to abort the child...and this is her 3rd this year?  Doesn't she know what birth control is?  That's insane.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Tell her to get the daddy to drive her. You don't have to help her do something that you disagree with.<br>  <br>  The question is, given how you seem to regard her, why are you her friend?|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Well, I had a Friend with a similar situation, and she asked me to drive her. I wouldn't. I don't believe in killing a child, and she had to learn to respect that. Its not your responsablilty to help her murder something, and if you don't want to, put your foot down and don't. If she can't respect that, she ain't a very good friend. She don't sound like a very good person getting 2 abortions already this year, not very responsible is she?|`|a6694dfd49fcd265ee4c7718ccff9a75aa	It is ultimately her decision, but she really needs to use something else as birth control because abortion is NOT birth control. If you do not support her decision, tell her you understand it's her choice, however, you cannot go with her to have it done, and that you hope she understands THIS is YOUR choice.<br>  <br>  There has to be someone else who can take her.<br>  <br>  And for an FYI to those saying for her to go alone, you HAVE to have someone there to drive you home afterwards...it's considered SURGERY.|`|eNMsX2A3aa	um...its her right to do it and her situation sounds pretty foul. She seems to have a problem with birth control so maybe go with her if she agrees to get birth control and be careful from now on.<br>  <br>  If you are a real friend you shouldnt judge. Be there for her. You dont have to agree in order to support her. x|`|6n1LpxhPaa	I would not go with her because that is supporting her.<br>  and to you should never have an abortion under any circumstances.  Abortion is murder and if for some reason you should not have that baby God will make you misscary.|`|9Guj407Caa	if you drive her, you will be supporting her decision.  That is a hard call to make.  If it were me, and you all may think i'm terrible for this, but I would tell her she is on her own.  Abortion is not birth control.|`|qeQNFsiRaa	Tell her, "no, I'm your friend and care about you a lot but I cannot support this decision.  Abortion is not birth control."|`|xD1LbRi4aa	i dont think just because you drive her means that you nessicarily support what shes doing.. she just needs a friend to be their for her.|`|KUQuL1jXaa	well i totally agree if you drive her there you are supporting her, so to avoid this its simple DONT TAKE HER|`|fb8cf1b6c2124ec3abca58d3c8ea4a2baa	so don't go.  |`|8RfmosODaa	If your comfortable with telling her the truth tell her. If you can't bring yourself to "ditch" her then tell her something else came up that you can't take her. I agree with you I wouldn't want to go either. |`|ZncV5gc0aa	Tell her you can't do it because you feel this way about it. She knows it's wrong, so she shouldn't get offended. 
HUQQzph2aa	Oh, I was very nervous about the "unknown". I would recommend buying a few books on pregnancy and even renting a few movies about child birth. <br>  Just remember your body will take over the when you go into labor, just go with the flow. <br>  It's the most beautiful thing in the world to look into your baby's eyes for the 1st time.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congratulations!|`|0zWJlNi1aa	To be told women have been through this for 1000s of years with no pain relief was no help to me at all.  It is the most painful thing in the world but there are drugs there to help.  I had gas and air and pethidine.  Still bloody hurt though - 22 hours of pain!!.  It is scary but just think it is only one day out of your whole life and the midwives are there to help you through it but remember that you are the only one who can get your little cheeky chops out and that is a big boost knowing that the baby is relying on you to get him or her out.<br>  <br>  You will cope because you will have to do it.  I was really scared too, but just take it as it comes and dont worry about it - you have 30 weeks to go yet, so enjoy the pregnancy - the first 6 months are the nicest!!  Then you get big and begin to waddle!!!<br>  <br>  I hope it goes well for you|`|SlyKumQmaa	Hey, I have two kids and I iwll honest with you. one of the reasons I dont want anymore if because of labour and delivery. It really hurts, and I hate pain. But, the epidural is great. Just keep in mind they turn it off on you (they did to me both times in NB Canada). Right before you are supposed to push so that you can feel it supposedly. I wont get into why I dont agree with that. <br>  <br>  The best thing I could advise you would be to make a birth plan, just google it until you find one you like, and educate yourself about your options for pain relief, positions, breathing and calming techniques, and that is all you can do. <br>  <br>  Good luck Im sure you will do just fine. |`|9fqdb4Pvaa	I'm 20 weeks and scared silly.  I've watched videos of births and some look relatively easy compared to others...I think it's luck lol<br>  <br>  I was also shocked at how undignified it is!!..I think I'm going to opt for a water birth, it's natural pain relief (apparantly) and hopefully I'll get to save some of my dignity.<br>  <br>  I do try to keep it in mind that women have been doing it forever and some go back multiple times so it must be worth it xx|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm 20 weeks and I'm kinda scared as well. I don't think it's really about if I'll cope or not but mainly what it will be like. I watch these delivery shows and I'm just nervous about it. I don't know it's really hard to explain how I feel. I just know that no matter what I experience I know that I'm going to have a beautiful baby girl and that's what matters. I'm really excited!|`|BARCjDhnaa	Its completely natural to be scared everyone is no matter what they say, try to find out as much as you can about labor and you will slowly come to terms with the fact that it is just something that has to happen, most mums forget very quickly what their labor was like as they are just overwhelmed with the joy of their baby.  Try checking out the site below for some info|`|Q6YboW9Daa	8 weeks pregnant and absolutely terrified already.  No advice, but just know that I feel the same way!|`|bHULLaAPaa	I was so scared of it I never had kids.  I tell you though, I heard epidurals are GREAT!@!!!|`|MejdEPF9aa	First of all, DON"T LISTEN TO SCARE STORIES!! Every woman is different and have different birth experiences. It is so common to be scared, but the fear is of the unknown. Arm yourself with as much knowledge as you can from reliable sources, and DO go to relaxation classes which you should be able to ask your midwife about. I only had pain relief for my first child because I was so sure it was going to be as awful as I had heard, but the confidence that my body could cope grew and i had all my other babies with no pain relief at all, including a few 9lb babies! Hope that helps, and enjoy your pregnancy, if you keep worrying your baby will pick up on it. <br>  <br>  And the bit about dignity..you leave it on the doorstep on your way into hospital and pick it up again on your way back out! :)|`|AHOZXa5waa	I felt the same when i 1st became pregnant and am now 2 days overdue and the fear still pops into my head! On one hand i desperately want labour to begin but on the other i am so frightened!!! My boyfriend even offered to have sex last night to try to bring on labour but i just couldnt i was too scared and now i'm so fed up waiting i wish i had!!!! U will have ups and downs about it throughout but try not to worry too much,resign urself that it just has to happen and it will most definitely b worth it in the end. I went to the antenatal classes.....this is purely my opinion i am by no means saying dnt go to them but i found knowing wot to expect even worse,it left me feeling that if ur thrown in at the deep end then u seem to accept a situation and just cope with it rather than thinking what if,this can happen that can happen etc. But the classes do give u vital info that all pregnant women shld know,i knew most of it already cos my sisters and lots of my friends have kids plus as a biology student i knew alot about the bodys involvement,hormones etc so for me they werent learning me anything new. U dnt sound stupid or soft its natural. Dnt ever b afraid to ask ur midwife q's regardless of how silly they may seem if theyre in ur head then theyre not silly to u. All the very best of luck x|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	Just try to remember that women have been doing this for thousands of years - without drugs!!  Yes, it's painful - but you will get through it.  If you decide to do an epidural, you won't feel anything (at least I didn't).  Trust me - by the time your due date arrives - you will be looking forward to going through labor to get it out of you!  I was 8 days late and by that time I had had it!  |`|5OQLmECTaa	i was afraid of the epidural b/c it goes into your spine, but now i realize it isn't so bad.. what has helped me cope with everything is the classes.  you can usually sign up at a free class at your local hospital or where ever you plan to have your baby, and they will walk you through labor and delivery and everything in between, they showed us the actual instruments used in the epidural and i am no longer afraid.  they can even give you a tour of the nursery and everything, which we get to take ours this thursday..  but you need to sign up now if you are interested, the classes fill up fast, i got the information for mine from my doctor when i found out i was pregnant.|`|U5RObaBGaa	It is understandable, everyone knows that labour is painful, but just remember take it as it comes because that is all you can do. There is plenty of pain relief available to you<br>  Epidural<br>  Gas and air<br>  Pethidin<br>  ect/ect<br>  Tell your midwife your worries she can reassure you.<br>  Just so you know if you have an epidural as much as it takes the pain away, you will find it more difficult to push, as you lose the urge<br>  Thought i would tell you as if i didn't i would get thumbs down lol<br>  Good luck|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	We are always afraid the first time, do not let anyone tell you they weren't. You have no idea what labor is going to feel like or what it will bring. I can assure you, that you will ge through it and will be more prepared if you decide to have more children. The second time around is much better!

prqrQcd1aa	Some people, no matter what you tell them, think that THEIR WAY is the best way and there is no other way to go. We all have our own ways of teaching our children. I will express my views on the subject, maybe offer some advice or some examples and move right along. I find that I tend to discipline my children somewhere in the middle as well. You aren't the only one!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Who knows.  It doesn't strike me as a difficult concept.<br>  <br>  I can argue with people who can acknowledge a world beyond black and white and come out landing on a different shade of gray than I do.  With other people, I have to just shrug and wonder where they got the idea the world is so binary.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	maybe for some people it's all they know. like for example say 'ben' grew up in a family environment where his parents spanked, yelled and so on as punishment, when he grew up and had his own kids he figured that's the way to do things. maybe he now has the mentality that 'i grew up fine so this must be the way' but really he never took the time to think of another way to do it. now 'ruth' who was never hit her whole life and got everything she wanted has grown up and has kids her way of thinking is 'well my parents bribed me to keep me quiet and never yelled at me when i was bad'  so now her mentality is 'well i grew up just fine so this must be the way' and again she doesn't take the time to think of different ways to discipline. <br>  im just saying that could be one reason. me personally i  try different things until i find what works best. when i grew up my mother never hit me and sometimes i think well maybe if she smacked me when i really deserved it i wouldn't have been such a mouthy brat who didn't give a care about 'authority'. so i have tried different parenting techniques. you are 100% right it's not just black and white there are ALWAYS shades of gray you just have to take the time to look|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	zealots who aren't comfortable enough in their own parenting techniques and then they feel the need to pass judgments onto others.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	You're right that there are so many parents who act like that.<br>  On the flip side, many non-spanking parents go to the extreme of saying that all spanking is abusive.<br>  I chalk all the bashing from both sides up to immaturity.  When people have  lived a few years and grownup a little and been a parent longer than 12 months, they know that there is this whole other world existing outside of their one-sided beliefs.<br>  ignore them and go on.....that's what i do.<br>  <br>  ***Next Day:<br>  Just read your added details and I  just wanted to make sure you know I don't think YOU have claimed spanking as abuse!!  I was referring to other people.  I actually didn't even know your stand on spanking until this question so I promise I didn't mean you  lol;-)|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Because people generally make assumptions based on their childhood, and how they were raised. Some people do really feel like that time their parents actually spanked them is the only thing that got through to them. And some people feel the complete opposite. <br>  <br>  We all try to raise are kids to the best of our abilities (mostly anyway), and people really shouldn't be so quick to judge. <br>  <br>  But, as a mother, I've learned that there are lots of situations where people will tell you it's one way or the other... breast feeding, potty training, diet, schooling, church, etc... I'll always listen an opinion, I'm a first time mom after all, and learning day by day, but that doesn't mean I'm going to agree. I'm not going to let other people tell me how to raise my kids, but it's always interesting to hear the opinions of other people.|`|axOJ2XUIaa	Because bad behavior in kids is frowned on by most people, and the parents want their approval.  I never cared what people thought.  I raised my girls the way I wanted to with no interference.  I knew someone once who started hitting her 1 yr. old because her mother-in-law told her to.  Just ignore it and go from there.  There is only one way to raise kids.  Positive and negative reinforcement.  Punishment should be last resort and should be time out.  Also I've found that if you talk to your kids a lot of things can be ironed out and they love the attention.  Also child development courses should be mandatory in high school.  Kids really just want to be loved.|`|ovxQ8HLuaa	omg these questions are getting old!!!<br>  <br>  There is a different in spanking and hitting. Although I think spanking should be a last resort, it is NOT abuse. It is teaching your child that you are the boss. I don't spank my children but I do tap their hands when they are doing something life threatening (like the outlet scenerio that I have talked about like 3 times now). I was actually spanked as a child when I did something bad and I turned out great. I have a friend who doesn't discipline her son and he is 4 yrs old now and does not listen to her. She actually dreads taking him in public.|`|AA12145826	I choose to spank my daughter, but not for every offense. In fact she's been spanked only a few times for very serious offenses. Most of the time we use time outs, loss of privileges, redirection of energy, etc. I also (as I mentioned yesterday) will bribe to ensure good behavior. Its not allowing her to walk all over me, but bringing attention and emphasis to GOOD behavior as opposed to only noticing BAD behavior.<br>  <br>  Some parents don't seem to understand that if the ONLY time you pay attention to your children is when they are misbehaving, then they are learning from the PARENT'S actions that only BAD behavior results in parent/child interaction. Naturally they will exhibit more negative behavior than good, no matter what form of discipline you use.|`|0QYIbn1saa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  TY!!!!!!!

Tl1SVsssaa	Sounds like it to me. I have had negative pregnancy tests and ended up pregnant. The signs say yes though. Everyone is different, but it sounds like you are pregnant to me. Congrats!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It sounds like you could be pregnant to me but it could also just be your body still changing from stopping the birth control in October. Good luck!|`|8dFT1z04aa	I think you're pregnant,<br>  signs are accurate.<br>  I am not 100% sure there is many accurate tests, and seek doctors help when needed. Good Luck!|`|AA10029300	when i was preggers it looked like some took a blue marker and scribbled all over my boobs . anyways it sounds like your peggers to me .<br>  good luck!!!!!!|`|Xr1O8zOUaa	Sounds like you are!<br>  <br>  Good luck...............x  Baby dust to you.x|`|EESjbWEPaa	well it sounds to me like u r. im 12 weeks and its  my first time but it sounds to me like u r. i have had all of the same symptoms. well good luck :)|`|258e111d9f41b74795cfc21f74849106aa	very good possibility|`|hHeSy1eWaa	unfortunately, or fortunately.<br>  Yes.

2wBfPVRAaa	I don't call.  My doc tells me that she'll call me if she sees a problem, but if everything comes back fine, we'll just discuss it at my next prenatal appointment.|`|AA11210211	assume everything is fine,you CAN call and ask but if something is wrong your dr will tell you.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	No news means nothing is wrong - if it were wrong they'd be calling to schedule an appointment soon.|`|lARcutEqaa	I'm generally one to call just because I hate waiting and I think it's shitty of the doc's office to make you sit around and wonder, however, I can understand why they don't call if there isn't anything wrong, they do get pretty busy. If your curious and you really want to know, just give them a ring and ask, they might make you come in to find out. |`|C0GeEv7kaa	If the hospital calls you about your test results then that means they have bad news, if they don't contact you that means everything is fine. |`|DrlDqVZeaa	the doctors i use tell me that if they don't call it was fine, they usually tell me at my next appointment too. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If your doctors found something wrong they usually will call and tell you so you don't have to call them. They do say though that if you are concerned then just to give them a call and they'll let you know. But honestly if you didn't receive a call then I'm sure everything is okay. |`|hjaxuYnLaa	they will call you if there is anything to talk about. no news is good news.
A2XYCdOYaa	Doing one now should be fine, they say around the time of your missed period.  But I did one a week after my missed period and it was negative then did another exactly a week later and it was positive!|`|qOBYfdlBaa	take it if you want to, i waited til i was 4 weeks late and took 4,all came out positive.  i was afraid to take one thinkin it wld be negative.|`|pTrHHw3Aaa	Your hormone levels are what makes the pregnancy sticks react.  Having a cold or being stressed out would not make a false positive or false negative.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can test now! Good luck!|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Take it as soon as you can get one :)<br>  Good luck!|`|rnL1IjaMaa	Take a home pregnancy test. Good luck.|`|AA10226047	You can take one now since you are a week late.  Some test will let you know as early as 5 days before your period starts.  If the test doesn't come back positive call your doctor and make an appointment and they will take lab work.  Some test come back as false but blood work tells it all.  |`|Pxni7zCBaa	take it now, if it shows negative, and your period is still late, take another one after couple more days....we have been trying 3 months before i got pregnant, now we have a special little girl which is 3 months old now! its amazing!! :) GOOD LUCK!!|`|rsEK17n1aa	take apregnancy test now.  Good Luck!<br>  |`|z1bAjI40aa	if your late then take one!! Good Luck!|`|sym8DzH0aa	i think you should be able to take one by now.
C0GeEv7kaa	Sorry if it's TMI, but my husband has always used saliva (if it was needed) and we got pregnant just fine. |`|dGdGfYTgaa	honestly, if saliva was that potent against sperm, less children would be born.  If you're trying to conceive and have had trouble before, use caution with everything.  Honestly, I think your morning cup of caffeinated coffee is more dangerous to your sperm than saliva ever could be.<br>  <br>  Best Regards.|`|etaf6nWQaa	If worried go all natural... try foreplay to become lubricated naturally.<br>  Not only does it take the routine part out of conceiving but makes it more pleasurable. And clearly cant be harmful to sperm.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't believe that saliva is bad to use but certain lubricant is bad to use. Speak to your doctor about what they suggest you use. |`|GxMSrrFLaa	we used ky and saliva. haha. Now Im 35 weeks. Try not to do to much research. Just relax and have a good time. It'll happen.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Sperm is very delicate and affected by everything.<br>  <br>  If you are a well-hydrated woman, there should be no need for you to use a lubricant. Have your husband seduce you, arouse you, and make sure to get plenty of water throughout the day. This will help you produce your own lubricant.

Coc593Ikaa	Early in pregancy, you are likely to be quite bloated. This often subsides in a few weeks. At that time, you should be able to put them back on until much later on in your pregnancy.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I know each mother and pregnancy is different, but to have enough swelling to make wearing your rings uncomfortable at this early stage doesn't sound normal to me.<br>  <br>  I am currently 24 weeks, going on 25, and still wear my rings...indeed, they are actually a bit loose.<br>  <br>  I've heard that most people don't remove their rings until closer to the third trimester (if they removed them at all).|`|4X6MwQJRaa	Well I am 35 weeks and I have still got my wedding and engagement ring on.  I am thinking that they may need to come off though in the next couple of weeks incase I cant get them off if need to in labour.  Personally if you need to take your rings off already I would have a word with your midwife, Im sure they shouldnt be swelling this early.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Around 3 weeks pregnant my feet started swelling but it was just once when I was walking on a tour and it went away by the next day. Now I'm 27 weeks and I've been experiencing swelling in my feet for a few days now but nothing in my hands. Good luck!|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i'm 29 weeks and 2 days and i still haven't taken off my rings, but they are kind of stuck on my fingers lol.|`|taduoyUHaa	You should not be swelling like that and I don't know if you have seen a doctor yet or not but you need to and be sure to tell him about the swelling.|`|VGX3cGbVaa	i am 33 weeks pregnant and still wearing my rings, have had no swelling problems so far|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	I'm 34 weeks and still have mine on. I actually should have taken them off back when I could because I don't think I can anymore! They're not uncomfortable, but hopefully nothing happens where I HAVE to take them off, because they won't budge. :)
Aan8b3AKaa	That's usually a good clue! Wait until you've missed and take an HPT!! Good luck!!|`|AA11067997	so, you ovulated on the 28th, today is only the 5th...that is only 8 days, even if you are pregnant, you would not be having symptoms this early.....  so, i am going to give you the rude answer you gave me a couple weeks ago.... i think you are going to start your period..... just incase you were wondering, i havent... so you were wrong.... dont be so neg. to people on here...<br>  you could be pregnant, but you have to wait at least 14 days for a hpt to work.. i think you can wait about 8 days and a blood test will tell....|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You are showing signs of pregnancy! Since you're not due until 11/12 it's still early to take a pregnancy test. If you get a first response, you can try to take one now, but you might not get accurate results. Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If it possible because when I found out I was pregnant I didn't really have breast tenderness but my nipples hurt like freaking crazy. I still have that problem now and I'm 19 weeks. If you miss your period I would take a test. Good luck!
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Even if the line is super faint it's still positive. I would still go buy maybe a different test and test again tomorrow morning and see what it says. Good luck|`|5X8FlAcvaa	buy another test.. and get a better one. dont go to the dollar store. <br>  <br>  the amount of money you'd spend getting multiple dollar store p tests will end up being more than it takes to get one good one. quality not quanity.<br>  <br>  every test has dif 'lines/colors' for the results read the box. |`|odMWon2Baa	Those are the test i used for both my little girls and that is exactly how they looked u could barley see the second line but it was still there and come to find out when i went to the doctor he had the same test in his office.....i laughed a little on the inside good luck |`|MBoCxL4Paa	wow That has happened to me the 5 times I have been pregnant IDK what it is with the DG baby test but they like to do this to us women Chances are your pregnant and instead of wasting even just another dollar I would go see a doctor. Good luck|`|uCUEZj3Jaa	i had the same thing happen to me. i took a test the next morning and it came out possitive. Good luck! Baby dust!!|`|7FaQa70gaa	some tests are actually like that and if you read the fine print it might actually tell you if that second line is there even faintly it's gonna be positive. Good luck girlie!|`|e1adb1e6bf7618d36ecfea10a335a315aa	I'd really invest in digital first response if you want a more accurate response instead of being uncertain. Good luck,.
97Fr4s6Waa	If they can't afford it there is always the Health Department. They give out condoms, you can walk in and ask for birth control. I have a friend who went there, she didn't want her parents to know about it, as if she went to the doctor they'd need consent. I've never been on birth control but always had hubby use condoms. It seems that teens, preteens are afraid to talk to their parents. Yes, there is the allergic to latex and hormone. There are other things latex free, etc. Birth control isn't obsolete. I think some people are not that educated on how to obtain it. When I was in high school we had sex ed, 10th grade, we were told about all this stuff. Pregnancy rate in our class in high school.... 2 girls out of 80 students. I live in a small town.... I think it's coming down to education, maybe some parenting, being afraid, not being aware, not caring, not knowing their options on how to obtain birth control.|`|OjHFN4imaa	I was wondering the same thing myself. I am married and managed to NOT get pregnant since the birth of my son 5 1/2 yrs ago. It wasn't for lack of trying on my husbands part either..LOL We had plenty of sex and no babies. This time it took me 4 mos to conceive..so it's not like I am infertile either.<br>  <br>  I think people are lazy and selfish and feel a sense of entitlement. This is my opinion, just because you are in a relationship or you think you are an adult, does not mean you should have sex. I know I made mistakes when I was younger and could have easily ended up pregnant, but times have changed and the information is ALL OVER THE PLACE! If you can come to yahoo answers..you can search out the proper kind of contraception for your situation.<br>  <br>  Don't even get me started on the STD's or STI's!!!!!! AHHHHHH!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's annoying. It's like these women are using abortions as a form of birth control and it's absolutely horrible. It's just disgusting. If you don't want a baby then you need to protect yourself. People don't want to use them because it takes away some pleasure. I just think people are becoming lazy and careless. It's just so wrong to keep killing these babies becaues people are sooo stupid.|`|AA11783622	1.  Our sex education programs are banned by the conservative right wing nut jobs from telling kids how to protect themselves.  So, almost all  states can only teach kids to  abstain (right.... it's gonna work.  Totally a failed policy).  The health classes do not, and usually cannot teach birth control, nor even how you get pregnant!!!!!!<br>  <br>  2.  We have as well, the total breakdown of the family structure.... 30% of white kids now are raised by just mom, and 62% of black ones are... so these kids receive little instructions from moms too busy working to parent kids they really never planned for in the first place.  Besides, then she gets preggo again, trying to trap some guy to support her, her first baby, and now a second...<br>  <br>  3.  Which then brings the entire thing full circle..... kids think it is normal to live with just mom, babies are toys, so "if I get pregnant, someone will love me.'<br>  <br>  4.  Then we have these idiotic programs on tv that make it look like having 17 kids is wunnerful.......<br>  <br>  5.  Add to this the fact that because our kids are out on the streets at 1:30 in the afternoon, because our educational system is broken, (no funding) they bond with other kids.  And some Latino boy or black boy will tell some needy girl, "we don't have families, let's you and me be a family.....have my baby." (commonest in those two cultures).<br>  <br>  Sad.<br>  <br>  Helpful???|`|uUn9zbBHaa	There is still bc but some females either can't afford it or just refuse to get it. Now with my ex/son's daddy we didnt use protection and I got pregnant at 15. I had my son at 16 and now he is almost 4yrs old. With my current bf we use protection but not religiously so if it happens i can't blame it on anyone but us. ALSO bc should not be just a female thing young guys should insist that they wear condoms and refuse to have sex w/o one BUT most guys think with thier dick and not their head until the girl says she's pregnant.|`|fb8cf1b6c2124ec3abca58d3c8ea4a2baa	all I can say - <br>  <br>  AMEN SISTA!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	They are children having sex without thinking about consequences, and they are the protect of the sex "education" that only preaches abstinence (in the US).   In essence, they aren't getting good information about what birth control products do, how to use them, and where to get them.   Really, they are naive innocents who should not be having sex - part of the education should be that you're not ready until you are prepared to prevent pregnancy and STD infection, or you are prepared for pregnancy or other consequences.   I don't think you can really hold a child responsible for their actions, that's why they are under the protection of being a child.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	I totally agree with you! If you're not ready to be a parent that why do people have sex and take the chance of getting pregnant??? "Oooo, feel sorry for me! I had unprotected sex and I might be pregnant!" or "HELP I had unprotected sex and I'm pregnant!" WELL WHAT DO YOU GUYS EXPECT?
AA11984336	Yep. It just feels like you are motion sick, or have a case of the stomach flu. Just a general nausea, with or without vomiting.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think I really felt any different then just being puke sick. I don't really know how to explain it. It could feel like that. Good luck and I hope you feel better.|`|NdUF4nrsaa	Morning sickness for me felt like I was about to throw up all of the time, but not necessarily having to throw up.  I couldn't eat and certain smells would make it worse.  Kinda like having the flu, I felt terrible.  Hopefully you don't have it for too long.|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	yeah its a horrible feeling, you will generally feel like you need to be sick but you wont very often actually be sick
tZfkPQF6aa	We're not finding out until baby comes. My husband wants a girl, and I want a boy. (I'm not a pink girly girl either.) We're buying all gender neutral clothing and decorated the nursery with light green and tan and used a bear theme. It can go either way. I know that once baby gets here, I won't care what it is, as long as it's healthy.<br>  <br>  I hope that you get a boy!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I wanted a boy so bad! We are having a girl though. I was a little sad because my husband already has a girl & I wanted him to have a little boy. I don't care as long as she is healthy. And there is nothing I can do about it now. It will be so much fun having a girl. Dressing her up & playing Barbies with her. I cant wait for her to get here!|`|4cehW3S9aa	I see where you are coming from but just be happy and hope for  a healthy baby.  You are more fortunate than many people since they can't even have children.  Whether you are a girly girl or not, that is irrelevant to the precious child you are bringing into the world.|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	For years I used to say to my partner "I only want a girl is we have a baby".  I could only see clothes, toys etc for girls that would interest me.  Well, we are in our 24th week with a baby boy and I could not be happier.  Once you get pregnant you only care that the baby is healthy, gender simply doesn't matter.  I can't wait to meet my little man!! x|`|kqnaqakLaa	i won't lie.... i wanted a boy. but ultimately all i wanted was a healthy child. my son was born 9lbs.9oz. nice and healthy. if  i had a girl i might be singing a different tune though..|`|AA10478146	I'm with you and really wanted a boy.  We found out at 20 weeks it's a girl.  I wasn't "sad" about having a girl but, I worry about how I'm going to deal with the teenage years.  I know it sounds funny, she's still in the womb and I'm worried about her being a teenager but, it weighs on my mind.  Plus, I hate all that pink, princess crap. <br>  <br>  On the positive side, I fell in love with her the minute I saw her on the u/s and I can't wait for her to arrive.  Whether she's a boy or a girl she's still my baby and I love her to death already. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you will feel the same way.  Congrats and let us know when you find out.  Either way, it will be OK.<br>  <br>  P.S. I decorated her room with light green and just a hint of pink.|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	My husband and I both really wanted a girl.  When we found out we were having a boy the first words out of my mouth were, "Crap!  Are you sure?"  I was very disappointed.  <br>  <br>  However, that disappointment only lasted about a week.  It is a loss of the dream we make up in our heads of how our family is going to be.  For that week, I was sad I wasn't going to be buying little dresses and Barbie dolls and Tinkerbell stuff.  Then, I just got over it.  We started looking at the little boy outfits, and I started doing crafts for his room (since we wanted Superman for a boy and it's almost impossible to find Superman stuff anymore). <br>  <br>  Now, I'm at 28 weeks and can't imagine having any other baby than the one I'm having.  I just had to realize that I wasn't meant to have a girl (we are only having one child as well).  I know that this is the baby I'm meant to have...a little boy.  And, honestly, I'm not one bit disappointed anymore.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone make you feel bad for how you are feeling!  Just know, that in the end, you will be happy with what you have.|`|fHgbL046aa	I was young when I got pregnant the first time. I thought I wanted a boy, and I think I only did because my boyfriend wanted a boy. I had a girl and was SHOCKED! I was like were is the penis? Once they put her in my arms I was in love,and yes so was my boyfriend. We were not upset at all.<br>  What ever you get its consider a blessing no matter what. I understand you want a boy,but being healthy is the most important. I'm 13 weeks pregnant and I have a feeling I'm having a boy. Sure I would like a girl,but if its a boy, then it is and I want him to be healthy.<br>  Some people have these feeling and dreams on what the sex of there child is. I never had that with my daughter,but with this pregnancy I'm experiencing these feelings that is why I believe I'm having a boy.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Well I know you feel that way now but no matter what the child's gender is your heart will melt when you see him/her. Instead of dreading about pink and purple and girl crap think about the beautiful little person you are going to have. Not all girls like girly stuff, actually many girls do not.|`|qAkLi8oQaa	i wasnt upset that it is a girl we both were wanting a boy and found out on his birthday that it was a girl (happy birthday to him right lol) he was a little upset but now he is excited it is a girl and he is trying to buy all this pink stuff just as long as your baby is healthy thats all that should matter|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I am the same way, but I want a girl. I find out next week also! Good luck... I know that if I find out I am going to have a boy, I will be sooo upset!|`|loT2xeeJaa	i cant say that i was. i said a girl would be fine but i prefer a boy. i am having a boy, and it will be my only child also so i really got what i wanted. good luck.|`|9PKq01sAaa	you said it yourself ''I wont care what he/she is as long as they are healthy I am happy''<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|fQGzk5izaa	Even if a boy is your preference, trust me, you will take one look at your little girl and fall so in love you be like boy shmoy.  She will steal your heart and you will never want it back!|`|AA12356515	We found out months ago that we were having our 4th boy!  I secretly wanted a girl, just a little bit, as this is our last baby too.  But, after finding out it was another boy, by the end of the day I was still very happy!  Trust me, even if it's not the gender you thought or hoped for, a healthy baby that is a reflection of the love between you & your husband is & will be a blessing!  You will fall in love with this baby even before it's born, no matter what.  You don't have to be "girly" to have or want a girl, just know that either way you are blessed!|`|NuQzgohgaa	I wanted a boy...BAD!  So when I found out that it was a girl, I was pretty upset.  Like you, I'm not into pink/purple/ruffles, etc.  So I forced myself to go out and find cute girl clothes that I actually liked.  And I was surprised to see how many adorable things are out there for girls!  <br>  <br>  But at 25 weeks, we had several problems with the pregnancy, and our premature daughter only lived two days.  I am so angry at myself for cursing the idea of a daughter.  I would give anything just to have my baby here with me, boy or girl.  <br>  <br>  So please just be thankful with whatever nature decides to give you.  I'm sure you'll warm up to the idea eventually :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I wanted a girl and my husband wanted a boy. I kept thinking about it too. But the morning of the ultrasound I just had a feeling that I would be happy either way. Plus, once you see your baby you're just so happy that you don't really care as long as it's healthy. Even if you are having a girl you don't have to put her in a bunch of pink and purples. There are neutral colors. I am having a girl and my husband and I are both extremely happy with the way it turned out. Good luck!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I am happy about the genders of my kids I have one son and am pregnant with son #2!  I am so happy to have boys cause my sis in law has a girl and I wouldn't want there to be any competing! and She would I could care less but I just find that it will be much easier with me and my boys!  I would have been grateful with a girl but I really had my heart set on boys I am thrilled I know how you feel!|`|q7HvkRpyaa	Yes. I was extremely upset when I found out my first one was a boy. I had my heart set on having a little girl. I almost went into a major depressive state. It didn't last long. I went out baby clothes shopping about a week later and that cured it. He's 18 months old now, and I'm 31.5 weeks pregnant with the little girl I wanted. This will be my last one too as she has caused a lot of problems and the doctors don't think my body could handle another one. <br>  Good luck on getting your little boy.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I know where you are coming from. We have a scan on the 3rd Feb to find out and I will be happy as long as they are healthy but I am convinced they are both boys and I'd love to have one of each or 2 girls as I won't have a clue what to do with a boy and I'd love a little girl to dress up lol|`|kcGFK36Waa	No. But everyone else in my family was. And i wanted a girl just because everyone else wanted a boy. I'm really girlie so it worked out fine for me. And I'm just glad I got pregnant when doctors told me I wouldn't be able to have kids. Boy where they wrong.|`|62vCoDPjaa	i was hoping for a boy myself, my husband was going to be happy about either...we found out we were having a girl...he was extremely happy, but i was disappointed.  everyone i knew knew i wanted a boy, so some people apologized...but then i realized, my baby is doing well, shes healthy, and truely thats all that matters...i got over being disappointed.  i'm like you, i grew up an only child that spent most of my younger days with my male cousins so i didnt care much for girly stuff, and still don't.  but you'll realize that even though most of the stuff is pink, there are still some cool stuff you can get for little girls|`|vpL67nETaa	That'll change. Trust me.<br>  <br>  <br>  I thought I wanted a little girl.<br>  I went out and bought pink clothes, dellusionally in my own little world, thinking that if I wanted a little girl enough, I'd have one.<br>  <br>  Little boy!<br>  I thought I'd be disappointed at the ultrasound, but I wasn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  Throughout my pregnancy though I thought "gosh I hope the next one is a girl, so I can have one of each and be done"<br>  I was even thinking maybe I'd adopt a girl to ensure that I don't end up with 2 boys.<br>  <br>  My little boy is here, and I cannot tell you how happy I am that he's a boy.<br>  All I can think about is how crazy I was to want a girl.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm hoping my second child is a boy.<br>  They're so much fun.<br>  <br>  Now, I know you're in the opposite boat, but the same logic applies.<br>  You'll be so incredibly happy with what you've got.<br>  I promise.

ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	This always confusing me too but as far as I know it goes by 4 week intervals. So you would still have two weeks to go before you are 3 months. I am 14 weeks so I still have two weeks until I'm 4 months|`|brwXmfZsaa	if you are 10 weeks pregnant you are only 2 and a half weeks. an easy way to tell is there are 4 weeks in a month so just divide your number of weeks by 4 and thats how many months you are. i am 14 weeks so therefore i am 3 and a half months pregnant|`|qb2fZiyyaa	that would make you 2 1/2 months. easy way to do it is to devide the number by 4. congrats and good luck.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	you are in your 3rd month. there are 4wks to a month. so <br>  1-4 is the first month<br>  5-8 2nd month<br>  9-12 3rd month<br>  and so on there are 10 months in a pregnancy really not 9|`|5rUjoEX5aa	Pregnancy is 40 weeks. Some people assume (incorrectly) that this means that gestation lasts 10 months, not 9. However, since there are about 4 and a half weeks per month, it works out to about 9 months and 1 week. <br>  <br>  If you get really gritty, the end of the 13th week marks 3 months, not 12 weeks. At 10 weeks, you are about 2 and a half months (approx).<br>  <br>  The best way to figure this out is to find out the "first day" of your pregnancy. (if this was the first day of your last period, lucky for you, this will be really easy. If not, you have to count the weeks backward from where you are now to come up with a first day).<br>  <br>  Once you have this date, it will be easy to find out how many months you are. For example, if the first day of your pregnancy was July 1st, you will be one month preggo on Aug 1st, 2 months on Sept 1st, 3 months on october 1st, and so on. <br>  <br>  It's totally confusing, but I'm one of those people who really wanted to know, so I figured it out for myself. Now when people who don't know anything about pregnancy ask me "How far along are you?" I can give it to them in months, since if I give them an answer like, 17 weeks, they just look really confused.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA10811784	13 weeks marks your 3rd month<br>  <br>  |`|kj1md6t0aa	12 weeks is three months.
AA11879371	If his father does not stand up for you then you don't have much of a choice.  If he does not believe you are being truthful about what his son is saying about you, maybe you can buy a voice recorder and record what he says, then present the father with what you have recorded.  Maybe then he will punish his son for disrespecting you.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I'm sorry, but the title of this question made me laugh...
Bw1h5xAcaa	Of course you can refuse the test. <br>  <br>  However, the test done earlier in the pregnancy is not going to be as accurate. Most of the time gestational diabetes will not start to fully manifest itself until around 26-28 weeks. <br>  <br>  Your last test was not inaccurate because of what you ate the night before. That has no impact on anything - I don't know who told you that it would. And just because you have no history of it doesn't mean you can't get it. Each pregnancy is independent and you can develop conditions you never had before, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.<br>  <br>  I can understand your being upset if your doctor had an attitude or was condescending, but honestly, I think you should take the test. Undiagnosed gestational diabetes can lead to some significant risks to your baby's health, including risk for preterm labor and stillbirth. <br>  <br>  If you had an elevated 1 hr test there is some reason to be concerned, even though you previously passed the 3 hr. I hope you will just make the decision that is best for you and your baby's health. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, lets put it this way.<br>  Google gestational diabetes, and the consequences it will have on you and your baby.<br>  Then decide if its worth not doing a little test.<br>  <br>  Legally you can refuse whatever you want.  Sadly people can screw up their kids any way they want to|`|tu7aqUoxaa	GD is tested during every pregnancy because it develops throughout your pregnancy. I have a history of diabetes but I never had gestational diabetes. My advice to you, get the test done, don't refuse it|`|AA10458750	The GD test is extremly important! It's not like the amnio test trying to see if oyur baby is "normal" or not. This is a test your Dr. should do! I think it's just your hormones thats making you so frustrated. We all have to go through it, as well as retests for our baby's sake.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	yes, you can refuse the test, but why? sure, it's a pain in the butt and you passed the last one with flying colors... but why would you put your child at risk for something so simple, that you could catch now and prevent complications? every pregnant woman feels the same damn way... i don't want to sit here, starving, for three plus hours being stuck over and over again just to find out everything is fine. but what if it isn't fine this time and something happened to your baby? you would feel awful and blame yourself forever. refuse is you feel you must, but surely you don't want to regret something later on... good luck!|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Anyone can get gestational diabetes at any time during pregnancy, regardless of whether it runs in your family or if you've had it in previous pregnancies.  It's a routine test, meant to be taken for the safety of both you and your baby.  Yes, it might be a hassle to have to take the test several times, but better safe than sorry.|`|Yo2Wn8wUaa	You have every right to refuse the test.  They will just make a note in your file.  On a side note, if anything goes wrong during or after the delivery that could be linked to GD - they will make you take the test in the hospital.  )But again, I'm pretty sure you can refuse that.)  So yeah!  If you don't want to or don't feel comfortable with it, then just refuse.  They can't MAKE you do anything.  Good luck.|`|Khs7HBYmaa	I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD REALLY NOT BE THAT MAD. I WISH I HAD A DOCTOR THAT WOULD TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT ME AND MY BABY ARE OK. IT JUST BOILS DOWN TO ITS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can develop GD at any point in your pregnancy. Why would you say no? What if you had it? I would take the test just to be on the safe side. It doesn't matter what you had the day before the test. You're not suppose to have anything to eat or drink (except water) for 12-14 hours prior to the 3 hour test. Just take it...\<br>  <br>  Also, it doesn't run in my family and I'm not a person who would be at risk for it but guess what I have it. It doesn't matter if you are at risk or not.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You can refuse it, but I wouldn't if I were you. I had a friend who had no history of GD or family history of diabetes either and she still got GD. How horrible would you feel if you ended up with GD and didn't know it, and your baby suffered complications because of it? Its only a test, just do it and get it over with.
w6F89TuDaa	Kimiko is 100% right.  Even though she is very early, an HCG level of 7 is extremely low.  Mine was a 23 at about 4 weeks and the Dr said there was a 50-50 chance it could end as a chemical pregnancy...it ended 3 days later and my HCG dropped back down to a 3.  It stinks because it was my first pregnancy so never again will I be free to feel the kind of excitement I felt at that moment and chances are it will be the same for your sister.  <br>  I hope it is different for her and she just has low hormone levels, but the Dr should definitely be concerned about testing the levels again and if she/he is not, tell your sister to find a new Dr!!|`|50413e6060a85c241ba6435845a4cc2aaa	I had gastric bypass surg and I take medicine for depression and no, neither of those things affect your HCG. ANything below a 5 is not pregnant. THe doctor should not have told her she was pregnant but should have ordered a series of followup tests to check that the levels were doubling like they should. 7 is too borderline. 7 is almost not pregnant. Mine were 21 when I started miscarrying.|`|Nn4mfpGCaa	She is def. pregnant. Now if that level don't double everyday then there is a problem with the pregnancy. She just found out very early  that's all. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If the doctor told her she is pregnant then chances are that she is pregnant. He wouldn't tell her that if chances were at 7 that she wasn't pregnant. Why does it really matter?|`|AA10063059	no,she is pregnant|`|4Pwr7mzAaa	SHe is telling people a little early but she is pregnant.  Normally people would like to get out of the first trimester then make the announcement.  I was under the impression that your level needed to be at least a 5 or either a 10 I can't remember.  If it's 5, then her level is a little low and if it's a 10, then the Dr wouldn't have told her that she was pregnant.  Well I don't know.  Good luck and I hope everything goes well|`|NcBRlRK0aa	She is pregnant, but she definitely shouldn't be telling people yet. There is a very good chance that she may be having a miscarriage. 50 to 75% of all pregnancies end in miscarriages. Women just don't realize it because it happens at the time of their next period. She needs a repeat BHCG in 48 hours (it usually doubles in a normal pregnancy) and a pelvic ultrasound in about 2 to 3 weeks. No none of the things you mentioned have an effect on the HCG level. |`|MmbEk1bTaa	If it is over 5 miu then that is considered a +, did they say how far along? Thaats realllly early, at 3-4 weeks i was at a 76 and they were i was misscarying again.

He must like to feel like he has some kind of power over woman or something. I'd say he must have had some type of trauma happen to him early in life if this turns him on. He needs some therapy.

Some men (and some women) get off on nasty type sex like pushing/spitting/disrespecting (including calling nasty names like w*hore or sl*ut) but yeh, it should only happen if the other person has consented to it and it is truly just a game.

He's a loser. |`|LMc23g9Maa	Between the sheets, everything is "normal" as long as both parties agree to it !  So if you said no, he shouldn't have done it anyway.|`|91x3trOnaa	Degrading sexual behavior is not a normal part of a healthy relationship.|`|bIyBUC88aa	i agree some people are into those kind of things but dont do it if you dont want to he should respect that and if he cant he dosent deserve you!|`|tsu4XlHiaa	Yeah, that's not cool to do that if you're not cool with it.|`|mkveZfqOaa	he's a loser!!!  |`|P7FL5AgPaa	It's hard to determine what behavior is "normal" during sex- after all, some people may be aroused by things that other people may think is not normal.  The most important thing is that both parties are aware of the behavior and have consented to it. If you are uncomfortable with these actions and have expressed this to your partner and they continue, then it's probably for the best that you discontinue a sexual relationship with him if he can't show he is mature enough to respect your wishes and boundaries. |`|U834rTscaa	well first of all he sounds like an asshole but i mean some people like that kind of stuff but if you didnt like it he should have stopped|`|JxHy7MWLaa	i guess it could be normal but if you don't like it, he shouldn't do it to you.. he is acting pretty inmature about this..|`|ZIq6OGbdaa	That stuff is for nasty pornos. |`|0h2AtBmLaa	There are odd fetishes...

diEZW57caa	The "What to Expect......" Books are ok, but I didn't really like them all that much.  I like Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care, it's an older one, but it makes sense.  It's more of a child rearing book then a pregnancy book, but it's the only book that I actually keep in my living room, I refer to it all the time.<br>  For pregnancy I loved "Husband-Coached Childbirth" by Dr. Robert Bradley.  I was planning on using the Bradley Method for childbirth.  <br>  I also LOVED "From The Hips" by Rebecca Odes and Ceridwen Morris.  It gave real life advice and stories, uses simple language and things that I could easily envision.  For example, I can't visualize that the baby is " about 30 centimeters" but I can visualize that the baby is "about the size of a bottle of shampoo".  It speaks frankly about the birth and pain relief (including c-sections) and gives real life advice for recovery.  That was by far my favorite pregnancy book.|`|i7TSNcvfaa	what to expect when youre expecting thats a pregnancy bible seriously it has everything as you go month by month and after too i toally recommend that for u|`|4CMQuJgOaa	What to expect the 1st year is good. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I always recommend What to Expect When You Are Expecting.

It described her experience with pregnancy, birth, and bringing the baby home.  I loved it.  It made me even more excited to go through this experience.  I HIGHLY recommend it.<br>  <br>  |`|dOHuMMrfaa	Not sure if it is available in the library, however I got the "Pregnancy Bible" from Barnes and Nobles.

AA12352418	Go get him now!  According to babycenter.com  some doctors still believe that there is a small chance for conception 12-24 hours after ovulation (ie. shortly before the egg dies).  <br>  <br>  Hurry hurry hurry! LOL  <br>  <br>  If you did ovulate, the chances are definately slimmer. However, depending on the last time you had sex, you could get pregnant by residual sperm.....Or you might just be getting a cold which may have caused your body temp to rise due to fighting off an infection.  Maybe it's not early ovulation...<br>  <br>  What's your cervical mucus doing today?  If it's gone from egg white to sticky already, then you've missed your chance. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	I agree with the poster who said to see a doctor. I would seek out a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  This type of doctor knows the most about getting women pregnant and you stand the greatest chance of success by seeing this type of specialist.<br>  <br>  |`|l8Ntr0ERaa	No I don't think it's to late, just try tonight and tomorrow and see if it works. Hopefully it will, good luck.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If I were you I would try another method in determining if you are ovulating just to be safe. I would buy test strips or the monitor because they are little more accurate in my opinion. I'm sorry it's been so long for you. I ttc for 2 1/2 years and it finally happened for us so I know what you're going through. Have you spoken to your doctor about Clomid? It worked for us along with the monitor. <br>  <br>  I think you still have a chance. If you had sex the day before or even two days before then his sperm can live inside for you 3 days so even if you had your peak day today then you still have a chance. Is he going to b|`|lOFbABTtaa	Have you been to see a dr. at all during the 2 years that you have been trying? If not, I would recommend that you go and see one. The rule of thumb is that you should seek medical advise if you have not been able to conceive after a year of trying. The fact that you know when you ovulate and you have not been able to fall pregnant in 2 years might mean that there is something wrong. I was diagnosed with with PCOS after not being able to conceive. The whole time I was thinking that our timing was just wrong. You never know...Good luck! |`|lKIxMkC9aa	Yes there is a chance just because you missed on day You are fertile for days and ovulate only one day!Sperm can live up to 7 days but that is a stretch so go with 3 to days..Good luck|`|BTCNVgk2aa	Hang in there honey!!! My husband is in the Army and was called out the field on my ovulation day for 2 days and we missed 2 whole days, however the girls on here and all the reading i've done have made me feel more confident that our BD on the day before he left and the day he returned might have really helped us. <br>  <br>  We are currently in our 2 week wait, my AF is not due until the 19th however I'm having cramping and sore boobs so i'm holding out too.<br>  <br>  Just hang tight thsoe lil boogers can live for 3 days so you should be covered! Best of luck and baby dust!|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I dealt with this same thing yesterday.  I think I had the flu (I was pretty nauseas and everyone around me is ill) though because this morning my temp was back down to where it was supposed to be.  I thought I ovulated 4 days early, luckily we had BDed but from everything I read online O-ing on CD10 could be too early becasue the egg isn't mature.  So I was glad to see my temp back down this morning.  I also got a +opk this morning.  So hopefully you are just ill like I was and if not sperm can live for a few days so the Sunday BD could have been enough.  :)|`|bAkYn7ySaa	I think we are sailing the same boat with u, dont get upset with only i day sperms can swim in u 2 to 5 days in ur body worry not.

wUooHVU3aa	I'm not sure to what degree a parent and a teacher have a "relationship" but definitely believe it's important for them to communicate. Consistency is the key with many kids. If a parent can work on things at home, the child struggles with during the school day, it has a stronger impact and working together the teacher and parent might find creative ways to help the child achieve goals.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	of course it is. Id like to know what is going on in my childs education... if she is struggling in something i would like to know now and not only at report card time.... if she seems distant or sad or something id like the teacher to be able to talk to be about it and her concerns if any. If i have concerns or questions i want to know, its nice to be able to have a friendly converstation with the teacher. They are the other person in your childs life who spends a majority of time with them throught the years so having a relationship with that person, should be a must.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Kids normally hate there teachers so there is nothing worse than the feeling that mom may be talking to the teacher about you.<br>  <br>  I feel its important if there is a problem that the teacher contact the parent but honestly teachers have a lot of students and they try but can't have a relationship with every parent.<br>  <br>  I mean Parent Teacher conferences are for this purpose.   If my child is stuggling I would want to know and If I have questions for the teacher I would expect answers|`|ec05c67a0aa214a128170583a71301ccaa	yes, If a child gets a lousy pair of parents, now adays, one parent home, he or she will be able to talk to someone,  there is at least someone for the children and teachers are one of the very important roles.  <br>  To me there are no pros and cons,  it either is or isnt.  lol|`|xApAWlshaa	No because alot of teachers have problems and some take their anger out on the children.there are bad kids and good kids and instead of discipling the bad kids she takes it out on all the kids.also alot of teachers have attitudes.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Yes, I think that it's important to have a mutually respectful, trusting and understanding relationship between students & teachers.  A child learns better when they feel they are emotionally safe to experiment and make mistakes.  A teacher will better be able to reach her student if s/he takes the time to get to know that student & understand how s/he learns.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA: I misread the question :-) <br>  <br>  Mutually respectful parent/teacher relationships are important, too.  Student will have more respect for their teachers if they know that their parents respect and trust the teacher with their education.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I think parent/teacher communication is very important.  My children's teachers appreciate we are so active in their school, sports, and scholastic life. It makes life easier and more organized for all of us.  Teachers spend a majority of the day with your child it is only common sense to be on the same page.
ddee4fdfcea9ecef7ac3cad0bf86b332aa	My question would be, was there a surgical proceedure done to repair the hernia? If I were you, I would personally ask your doctor about that one. No, you're not too old. Also, another question would be...are you positive you want another baby? Sometimes, we as women DO get that urge to want another child after the other children are a bit older. BUT, the urge does pass. especially after all your kids are doing their own thing & you now have a chance to relax in life. I had 4 children. ..ages 30 - 25 - 22 & 18. I enjoy my peace & I enjoy my grandkids. There was one time a couple years back that I was thinking about another child but the notion past. Did I get lazy?

But, are you certain you are 4 days past ov? Maybe this is it.  Implant bleeding is very scant, a lot of people don't even have it.  It is pink or brownish and doesn't last long.  There is a chance.  Could you be having mulitples, like, did you do any injections to ov more eggs...
ygVTtSNVaa	I agree but I think even 1 abortion is wrong. Abortion is not on the list of birth controls. If you get raped I totally understand and agree an abortion should be done but other than that you are responsible for your actions. If you are having sex then you are at risk for pregnancy. High risk. I dont care whether you use a condom, a pill, a patch, etc nothing except abstenence is 100%. So I'm sorry but even if the condom breaks, or the pilll is ineffective that day I still think their is fault. Because if you aren't ready to be a mother or a father then you shouldn't be having sex. Especially at 14 or 15. I dont care if you wrap it up with 3 condoms, theres always that chance. And I agree. If you want to have sex that young, or have sex before you are ready to be a parent, then they should know their cycle, ovulations, etc. I think an ovulation test is a lot cheaper than a kid or an abortion at any rate. Sorry I don't mean to sound rude but seriously.. No one is innocent when it comes to making a baby.. either party is just as responsible.. and if you are going to have sex at a young age and you use a condom, I still don't think abortion should be aloud cause as I said nothing is 100% when it comes to bc products so if you are having sex you are taking that chance!<br>  <br>  ADD: wow Cari.. smoooooth. how is abortion NOT murder? are you kidding me? you open your legs and dont use protection, then kill the kid because its their fault right not yours? imagine if you had been a mistake, and instead of manning up to it, your parents aborted you.. you wouldnt be here so wait you couldn't imagine that or have such an INSANE opinion. I think everyone has the right to their opinion but anyone who says abortion isn't murder obviously doesn't know what abortion really is..|`|AA10929080	Theres also always the case when the birth control doesn't work. Maybe she wasn't able to take it one day or I know I, if I were on the pill, would forget all the time. Also, condoms break. No birth control except abstinence is 100 percent effective. Implantations can fall out without the girl knowing and such. Not all of it is her fault. Some things just cant be prevented. |`|AlPF1EiNaa	oh girl we are on the same page, i used to have a friend like that and she just made me so mad! its like these girls just don't care enough about themselves, they are stupid to think "it won't happen to me" whether it be pregnancy or stds. and they have to deal with repercussions so lets just keep doing right for ourselves that's all we can do.|`|GFjI6OJEaa	I agree I do not believe in abortion unless medical necessary but even when raped you can put it up for adoption or a grandparent. But if girls want to have unprotected sex there going to no matter what you try!|`|Oc8e7wAXaa	I'm not lazy, just no insureance to have birth control, and I'm allergic to latex, and dont have money for expensive non latex condoms..... but it didnt matter to us anyways we actually wanted to have one with eachother|`|KeaFIWEeaa	i completely agree. some girls are so oblivious and completely forget about the fact that they ARE women and can get pregnant they're so irresponsible. |`|WAls73rvaa	its just because abortions are legal that women look at them as a form of birth control... some women so ive learned don't have compassion or love programed into their emotions and think "what the hell, why not" and because its widely available take advantage of it... <br>  <br>  the only way i think an abortion should be legal is if the pregnancy is the result of rape and/or incest, or diagnosed by a doctor as a " high health risk" to the mother... other wise it is just used as another form of birthcontrol...<br>  <br>  * i hate it how people want to say "well i am on the pill i just wasnt able to take it one day" bull ****... unless someone stole it or you lost it you are "able" to take it... u just arnt responsible enough to... and even if you do forget or lose you BC, DONT HAVE SEX till you are in the clear and have gotten back on some kind of contraceptive.!! if you dont have sex for a little while i promise it wont kill you!<br>  <br>  oh yeah... and if your having sex obviously you know where babies come from... so when you get pregnant dont be like "how did this happen??" WELL DUH! you had sex thats how! no form of birth controll is 100% accurate except not having sex at all!! educate yourself... someone being dumb and uneducated is no reason to kill an innocent child!*<br>  <br>  ...Cari- are you ******* serious about rape???? rape may be caused by some girls leading on..  but dont ever jump to conclude that everone who is raped is "asking" for it!!|`|g1XCdFeGaa	I agree 100%. The ignorance is SO frustrating!!! If one is not responsible enough to have sex safely, he or she certainly should not be having sex at all! The ridiculous argument that "it feels better" or "we didn't have time to think about it" makes one both immature and irresponsible. Using a condom is what....a 2-second procedure? And once one KNOWS she is going to be sexually active...how difficult is it to go on the pill? If a girl is embarrassed and doesn't want to tell her parents--she doesn't have to! The doctor or clinic is required by law to protect that information if they are asked to do so. Furthermore, the pill is not so much of a hassle. One swig of water when you wake up. It truly infuriates me that people slack off like this, and are shocked when they are met with the consequences. I'm just glad to see I'm not the only one who feels this way.|`|ioZeveazaa	I agree with you except on the abortion..no abortions. I hate when ladies on here say things like "I'm 15 and pregnant, help!!!". Are you serious? Those type of questions kill me. I would be bodyslammed (not literally) by my mother if I had sex or even got pregnant at that age.Women just need to take the responsibility necessary. Oh and on the abortion thing, if you were raped, then I suppose an abortion would be an option. =/ That is my say but I agree with you.|`|AykczQleaa	I think a lot of these girls are either:<br>  1. embarrassed to carry condoms.<br>  or <br>  2. they want to get pregnant because they think its going to keep him around longer!|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	I agree for the most part, I mean, abortion is a choice I don't care if other people make, but why not just prevent the situation in the first place? I know BC isn't 100%, but it doesn't fail very often.|`|CJqK40uFaa	why are other women so judgemental and worried about other people's lives? thats certain women always get killed in scary movies..so damn nosy....|`|B5MDTdtPaa	i agree very true thas all i can say|`|Yn2n26zXaa	You are so quick to jump on the "It's all her fault" thing. It's confusing. You don't tell any guys to keep it in their pants. Just women to keep their legs shut. Remember, it was only very recently that women have been “allowed” to enjoy sex, and a lot of people are still suspicious of women who are free in their sexuality, a leftover from the joyless Puritans who founded this country. Quite frankly, I prefer it if the anti-choicers would just come out and say, “Since our religion or upbringing tells us that enjoying sex is a sin and we’re so sexually repressed we squeak, we think that any woman who has sex for any reason other than to conceive is a whore". "And that includes rape, which wouldn’t happen if you didn’t lead that guy on by looking in his direction for two seconds or wearing that short little skirt or owning a vagina.” Also, I consider the “why didn’t you keep your legs closed” thing pretty funny anyway, considering that many of the abortions performed in America are on married women who already have kids. If we listen to the antis I guess that means that once you get done having kids or go through menopause you shouldn’t have sex anymore.<br>  <br>  <br>   On the abortion note: Some women have always known that they did not want to be mothers, but because doctors refused their requests for sterilization ("But you're so young! You've never had children! What if you change your mind?"), they take their chances with birth control failure, and sometimes they lose. And some of us know what we're going to do long before the specter of pregnancy is raised. <br>  Accidents do happen, and mistakes are made. Having children should not be used as “punishment” for a birth control failure or an error in judgment. Women who have had mental illnesses or problems with drugs or alcohol are often confronted with unwanted pregnancies, but we would much rather hear about a drug addict that had four abortions than a drug addict who had four children she neglected. But you know what would really reduce abortion rates? If parents taught their children to love themselves first and not depend on another person for their happiness<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree that condoms should always be used. But again, mistakes do happen. Who are you to judge? Abortion isn't murder. Well, at least our government doesn't think so.<br>  <br>  <br>  Umm Jordyns Mommy...Did you actually read what I wrote about rape? It was in "  ". I was saying that's what I have heard some "pro-lifers" say about rape. That I not what I think at all. Considering I was raped at 17, that would be quite inappropriate and completely WRONG for me to say. Just to clarify.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Abortions have been performed for a LONG LONG time. Do you actually do research to back up your blatant LIES?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I see my over sight. How about this one? <a href="http://www.studyworld.com/newsite/ReportEssay/SocialIssues/Abortion%5CAbortion_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.studyworld.com/newsite/Report...</a><br>   Can you admit when your wrong too?<br>  <br>  <br>  Thank you KP Due... you have proven my point. "You can open your legs....blah blah blah.....". So if I got pregnant, it's entirely my fault? Riiiiiggghhhttt. Keep living in that fantasy world of yours. If abortion is murder, why aren't women in jail for it? Or the doctors? Thats right....Cause it's a civil LIBERTY. Gosh, I guess since the government isn't throwing women away for murder, it isn't. Just a thought.<br>  <br>   <br>  What does it matter if the abortions being performed were on prostitutes? Are they not people too? Jump off your high horse and realize that not woman who gets pregnant wants a baby. And nothing is wrong with that. Sex isn't just for married women trying to get pregnant. Sex is for pleasure. And even when protection is used, it isn't fail proof. I got pregnant while on birth control and a condom being used. I CHOSE to have my son. But that's the beauty of it. I chose. And at the end of the day all that matters is how I feel about my choice. I'm the one who deals with it. Stop judging women who don't believe the things you do. I'm stepping out of this now. You will never be accepting of those that are different from you and frankly I feel sorry for you. I don't want to deal with a bigot.  Peace.|`|ml76J5F7aa	Its true, more women should use protection and get educated about not only pregnancy but STDs as well. However, even the most educated woman who uses 2 kinds of birth control properly can get pregnant too. The most effective way is abstinence..... and I dont know about you guys but that would be super difficult for me and my husband! These are the consequences we live with though.<br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Honestly it makes me sick when a woman just has one abortion. That is one too many for me. If you don't want a baby then don't have sex especially unprotected sex. People are just so stupid. But you're right there are several woman who just have tons of abortions instead of just using protection. It is just horrible. |`|iyRWN59Xaa	Not necessarily laziness...she's naive when the guy says, "oh honey, we don't have to use a condom.  I don't like them.  I'll pull out."<br>  <br>  In other words, it's both of their fault.  It takes two to make a baby.|`|rJ6NoQsLaa	I say BOTH sides should be responsible not just one!

v3LnJycKaa	expecting a baby is so different for  man they dont get to feel the baby growing inside of them, or all of the chnages your body gets to go through, so their connection tends to be much different... he may be cautious right now.. it isnt really real tohim until he sees the protruding belly... |`|ByUS0k8waa	He is just be careful. He doesn't want to tell everyone and something happen or they look at him differently. Also you have to understand he is excited but men get really nervous about these things. He is just worried and don't want to worry you about it so he keeps it in. Just talk to him about it and make him understand he can be worried and excited at the same time. It will happen just give him so time and talk to him about it. That is all you can do. Congrats!|`|jQDeTTVhaa	that's how my husband was with this baby he didn't want to tell anyone before I hit 12wks because we had a miscarriage before at 8wks.When I hit 12wks he wanted to wait until we find out what we are having.We found out and then he said we can tell everybody but they already knew cause I secretly told them.lol I think its just a guy thing not all are like that.|`|TaTCbLSzaa	men are just so complicated when it comes to emotions and feelings but he also prolly has a lot on his mind to clear out i mean bills necessities and  a new baby so id give him a little bit of time to get use to it |`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	fearit might not happen|`|50nbSv2Kaa	I totally understand what you are saying. My husband was also the same way. I am 19 weeks pregnant and he just told his family and mine has known for 7 weeks now. I felt very alone with all the excitement, but he is slowly coming around and getting excited. I really do believe that this is just a man thing....Sorry.|`|dgPJWwtOaa	he's probably thinking with a guy perspective, costs, changes and complications.  i think u need to talk it over with him and see what's really bothering him.  <br>  there may be something deep inside that he isn't mentioning or perhaps he figures he has 9 months to spread the news....plenty of time to tell others!<br>  Congrats, by the way!|`|rjVALevtaa	I wouldn't call this a guy thing. It sounds to me like he's just scared. Just give him some time, he'll come around. He'll probably feel more at ease after you have your ultrasound and you begin to show. |`|9cu82009aa	I wouldn't say a guy thing really, my husband gets more excited than me when I'm pregnant, he tells everyone. It's probably just his way of dealing with things, ask him, he can tell you better than we can.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Maybe it isn't real to him just yet, or perhaps he doesn't want to "jinx" it by telling everyone so soon.  Give him time...he will get there.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Maybe he feels like it is too soon. |`|4p9sBdyTaa	He may be afraid to say it and jinx it. Just let him deal with it in his way. You know he is excited so what else matters?|`|zjwXLXKHaa	You are pregnant not him so do not say we're.<br>  <br>  Now men and women are different. Women are more emotional and are also the communicators out of the species. So most women like to talk and express themselves openly. Most men do not.<br>  <br>  This does not mean that he has not told anyone. It may be that the people he told just don't bring it up. I know my friends that I told were mostly men and men just don't bring it up. Plus you may not even talk to many of his friends that much.<br>  <br>  I had buddies tell me that their wives were expecting. I never mentioned it back to the wife. What for? Most are my friends by association. I know the husband so there is not that much one on one conversations with the wives to ever know if I knew or not.<br>  <br>  Now my friends that are women, told me and not their husbands so again a perception issue as I am their husbands friends by association and don't have much one on one  conversations with them either.<br>  <br>  So stop worrying about stupid things and live your live and be happy.|`|DKccY0poaa	well he is a guy and maybe he wants to wait a little bit longer and maybe you should ask him i mean that really could help idk i mean thats how my sis bf was till she got really big|`|IQZa25I1aa	Well My husband is the same way. Im 16 wks prego with our 2nd baby and he still hasnt told his work or anyone of his friends that we are having another baby. I think its just a man thing. Good luck. and congrats!|`|d8ef13dda8477042c0c7ce7360c2c9a0aa	Im glad you asked the question because I too went through this and could not figure out why he would not tell anyone!  I assumed it was because he was not excited or proud...but he assured me he was.  I agree with the guy, he may be telling people but guys dont usually make a big deal when they hear their buddy is having a baby. <br>  <br>  Also, it may be a little surreal, you are feeling all of the emotions, sicknes, dr appts, etc, so I think its just hard for guys to really feel the way we do. <br>  <br>  I would bet,that the further along we will become more involved. Congratd|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	my husband did the same exact thing with our second child. I asked him if he was embarassed or something! I am sorry that I cannot explain, but I wanted to let you know that I have went through it too, and it just doesn't make sense.
f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	Yes, especially if it's not for his wife.  I would suggest not having unprotected sex with this guy again unless you're married to him.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm sure it is. Mine wasn't but maybe he is just uncomfortable shopping for that kind of stuff. I'm sure he isn't the only guy out there with that problem.|`|p4wW3Dpnaa	Normal? sure.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's probably just scared of the whole situation in general. Maybe if people will look at him funny..?<br>  <br>  I was a little afraid to buy a test by myself....and I am a woman, lol.|`|yfGc1UdNaa	Guys don't want to buy anything from the womens section by them self. It is normal.|`|6V8ohTC8aa	Haha.. when I took my test and showed it to him he left right away to go to the store to buy more just so we'd be sure haha. We didnt want to get too excited right away. |`|AA10407807	He's probably embarrassed, not afraid.|`|hswTS1jVaa	It's probably just that he's embarrased, like he would be if you sent him to buy tampons.|`|AA10565336	Some of us have problems, some don't.  I have picked up everything and anything you could imagine for my wife.  It just doesn't bother me.  You seem to have the other side of the coin.  Either he will grow out of it or you will grow accustomed to it.  Either way the 'problem' will correct itself.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They say certain positions help in determining the sex but I don't think there is anyway to chose the sex. I think because your cycle is so irregular and long the only way to really be sure when you ovulate is to go an buy a fertility monitor or ovulating test sticks each month. Good luck. If you go with the fertility monitor I suggest going on ebay. It's a lot cheaper. |`|WfJ5ad0oaa	It's crazy...here you are, trying your hardest to get pregnant..and then on Yahoo answers, you see 13 year olds posting  questions about how they became pregnant, whether they should or should not have the baby, and how they're so scared because their parents are going to find out and the kicker is...they weren't even trying to get pregnant in the first place! <br>  <br>  It's almost a joke, really. <br>  <br>  Just as a little story, My husband and I tried to conceive for a while year. Last year around Thanksgiving time, it finally happened. I think it wasn't happening for a whole year because I was stressing so much over it. I kept thinking about the baby. I kept counting days, researching my ovulation charts, reading about all kinds of crazy methods to conceive a child. I had baby on the brain. Finally in November last year, I gave up. I had a move to think about. I had to pack things, clothes, furniture...had to get an apartment, start paying new bills with my husband, make a road trip to our new state..things were hectic and I forgot about baby-making, and somewhere around that time, it happened. I think when you are anticipating a child, your body isn't going to respond only because of how the stress hormones are high even though you don't know it. And this can even put your cycle off. It sucks, really. I have some really helpful sites for you though..you should check them out:<br>  <br>  *Find out when you are ovulating:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/227230/trying_to_conceive_find_out_when_youre.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  *Side effects of personal lubricants when TTC:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/227220/trying_to_conceive_side_effects_of.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  *Tips for Conceiving:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/162109/trying_to_conceive_when_you_want_a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  *Increasing chances of getting pregnant:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/227218/tricks_for_trying_to_conceive_how_to.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck..I know it's so frustrating...but it will happen. Like I said, we tried for a year..now I am a mom to a beautiful baby who was born in August 2008.|`|nMsKgxfZaa	I found the best website OF ALL TIME! Go to www.babycenter.com, set up your own account and make your own calander it tells you when your most fertile, and when you can take a pregnancy test. Try it out i love it ive been using it for about 2 months but with the interfernce of mine and my hubbys jobs we dont have alot of baby making time, but i think i may have concieved, just waiting for that late period.

5rqVTOzmaa	If the faint line showed up within the time that the test is still good, then it's a positive. (I think it's within 5-10 minutes, you should be able to read the box and find out) If you read the test after that, it could possibly be an evaporation line.<br>  <br>  Alright, I just read your update. If the faint line showed up after only 2 minutes, then it sounds like a positive to me. From personal experience, a faint line is definitely a line. I'd retest just to be sure, but false positives are rare.|`|AykczQleaa	How long did it take for the line to show up?  If its within the time frame indicated on the package, it is most likely a positive.  Take another test in a day or two.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	Even if it's faint, then it's positive. Get another one and see.<br>  <br>  Good luck. |`|gTun7ZoHaa	When i took a clearblue test i got a negative, 3 days later i took the clearblue digital it came back positive.<br>  I still didnt believe it so took another clearblue digital the following morning.<br>  <br>  When i went to the doctors to get in confirmed she said it came up with a faint line, she said a faint line still stands for a positive pregnancy test.<br>  Im now 17w+6w #2<br>  <br>  Either test again in a couple of days or go to the doctors to find out for sure.<br>  Good Luck|`|f5ZdHKvyaa	if you can still see a line after the time it says to wait the its usually a positive but i found to save myself all the is it or isn't its easier to buy the digital test|`|pa3ZYjocaa	Wait a day and do another test or go for bloodwork today. <br>  <br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If it's faint then it is still positive. If you think that there is a chance it's a evaporation line then I would go get another test. But as far as I know the test would have to be sitting there a long while to show an evaporation line. I'm sure your pregnant so Congrats!|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	As long as the line showed up in the correct time limit then it counts. If it wasn't there and you checked an hour later and it had shown up then it doesn't count.|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	It means the levels aren't showing up good on there.  Probably because you aren't very far along yet.  You could always go get a blood test at a clinic to know for sure.|`|WiS5Z7ilaa	Faint line is positive..<br>  congrates
hrnDGIKxaa	I had this same problem and it was freaking me out until the doctor said the fluttering was coming from stress over the cramping and lack of period...the cramping is most likely caused by your body trying to return to normal after having the shot....if you are not pregnant and this continues for a while go to your doctor and get everything checked out just to relieve your mind|`|pqqDS4sfaa	you have tested and your not pregnant? sounds like your pregnant lol, cramping fluttering...|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You may be pregnant. I would take a test. 
AA11830777	Between 2 and 3 weeks.

R9BXgGXhaa	Yes it is possible, I was 14 weeks and found out I was having a girl and it is still a girl and now I am 36 weeks.  GOOD luck|`|GEK2GHcIaa	You probably will not be able to tell, because at 16 weeks, it's still sometimes hard for the sex to be found, they normally wait til 18-22 weeks to tell you the sex. Usually, you are supposed to have more then 2 ultrasounds. They have to see the organs of the baby and how things are growing and what not. I'm sure you will have another chance, and if not... it isn't the end of the world. You will love that baby no matter what gender, and it might be annoying but a surprise is never a bad thing!!|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	I just had an ultrasound last friday at 13 weeks and I couldn't tell what sex my baby is.  Your best bet would be to wait atleast another month and ask your doctor.  If you don't have a doctor, which it doesn't seem like you do - try applying for Medical Assistance through welfare.  Welfare will not turn you down if you are pregnant.  If you're not taking your prenatals yet and you haven't gone to your first prenatal check-up, you definately need to take advantage of this for your baby's sake and yours.  For both of your health.|`|MjwLs9Foaa	it might be a little early. but my OB said you can tell early if the baby is in a good position. so keep telling it to spread its legs the day before. <br>  <br>  but really, you can usually find out the sex around 15-20 weeks. <br>  thats around the time women make their apt. <br>  <br>  i'm 16weeks and i have to wait until im 18. so 2 weeks to go!<br>  <br>  But GOOD LUCK!|`|pjnnTTJsaa	I found out at 15 weeks. It is easier to tell if it is a boy though. And its more like a guess!<br>  <br>  Why would it be your only sonogram? They do more later on to check the development of the baby! Im curious to the reason why you think that.|`|06f6c5c3997ca2da780cd3fa88cbf38daa	They might be able to tell you, but it won't be a definate answer. They can usually tell by 18 wks, and even then sometimes mistakes are made. If they do tell you at 14 wks, I don't think you should 100% believe them, because they will not be 100% sure. Sorry.|`|lm2j8g4oaa	i had a scan at 14 weeks and doc said it was too early to see baby's gender. good luck surely you should get another scan further along..?20/21 weeks?|`|T8BrBFgKaa	 a very very very slight possibility--it would be better if you were a few weeks further along.. i doubt they will be able to tell you at this point..im sorry|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I found out at 15 weeks 4 days.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	maybe i have heard at 16 weeks being able to tell|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's possible because my best friend found out what she was having at 12 weeks with her second baby. I think it all depends on the baby. But don't you have to have an ultrasound between 20-22 weeks for something because I know I do to check for certain things and I'll be finding out then. (hopefully)|`|dqSA7j7gaa	my friend is pregnant with twins and found out at 14 weeks, but for a def. they need to be 18-20 weeks.<br>  They aren't going to do the 18-20 week ultrasound? that is when they check all the baby's parts and stuff, and tell you the gender if you chose to know.|`|AA10943329	No, it is too early. There are very few real surprises in life and this is the best one. Just buy unisex clothing for the baby and enjoy the surprise|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	It may be too early...But your doc is suppose to do a u/s at 20 weeks and again at 30 something for positioning. <br>  <br>  
Fh4B88ZGaa	Tell her to get "Taking Charge of Your Fertility"- it's a book that will tell her everything she needs to know about how to pinpoint her fertile times. It's very likely that she is just missing her window each month- once per week is probably not going to cut it.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Of course that's the reason they haven't gotten pregnant.  They only have sex once a week.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If she doesn't know when she is ovulating then I recommend if she can afford it that she goes and buys a Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor. They are cheaper on ebay. I bought one of them and it worked on the first cycle. My husband and I had been trying to conceive for 2 1/2 years and we had been to fertility doctors and nothing was wrong with either of us. Good luck for her and her husband. I know how tough it is and how much it hurts. |`|mB7PGGDPaa	Like the other user said that she has to start tracking her body. Every single detail, when she got her period, when it ended, her cycle length, and well the part about them not seeing each other that often isn't going to help them out, but those days that they are together they definitely need to take advantage :) In this situation that's the only thing she can do. Good luck to her :)|`|RQPqbpxVaa	There are many options.  She really needs to start tracking her body so they can get the best timing possible.  If she isn't ovulating, there are other options.  She should call her docter and see what they can do to increase their chances.  |`|H3I7kVwPaa	Try to use the ovulation calendar like<br>  <a href="http://www.softorbits.com/awc" rel="nofollow">http://www.softorbits.com/awc</a><br>  to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation - the day when you are most fertile.
EaDkj1JJaa	Yes I do like it. It's not as common in the younger kids as it is adults. And I actually love this spelling!
DyDqKVdtaa	Abortion is murder,<br>  your child has a heartbeat 24 days after conception,<br>  and it can feel everything.|`|plyoUI8qaa	I think it is a very personal decision, it is so so easy to be judgmental on many issues- especially when it is not something we have been through ourselves.<br>  Please dont be influenced by abuse on here.|`|riVBWinHaa	it really depends on how old you are.<br>  and if you can afford a baby and if you have done mostley all of the things you want to do in your life.|`|zQWNb6neaa	My personal opinion is that unless carrying the child to term is going to kill the woman abortion is not morally justifiable. It is still a human life, even in the early stages of gestation. A life that is vulnerable and innocent and should be protected.|`|DjTGPnkOaa	Its murder.<br>  |`|wQGb5NCRaa	MURDER WRONG once the sperm hits the ovum it's a new soul and human being abortion is like MURDER exept the baby is sadly murdered with no self defense  |`|ncswKikdaa	Depends on the circumstances,dont agree with it myself,but people have their reasons.You should have a pregnancy test to find out for definite.|`|8b9e5894f70e3364d0f2490295d49b82aa	I think it is a very personal choice.  I would not personally ever have one, but I am not going to tell another woman what she should do with her body. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Abortion is MURDER! I'm glad you arent going to murder your baby.
iEEcWPA1aa	Autumn. That's a beautiful name. It makes you think of colours. Red. Orange. Yellow. Auburn. And all shades of those colours. Those colours make me think of the bubbly, fun personality.

RXAK6iTfaa	Reading your question really made me mad, i dont understand why some men can act this way.<br>  <br>  Fair enough he is out working all day but im sure if you could you would be aswell, being pregnant you need all the rest and help you can get huni and looking after a 4 year old can be enough for anyone to handle.<br>  <br>  I would tell him how you are feeling and i would be concerned what he is going to be like when your baby arrives, will you still be doing everything??<br>  <br>  He should help you around the house sometimes and maybe even let you put your feet up and cook you a lovely meal.<br>  <br>  Hope everything turns out the way you want it, but NO i wouldnt put up with that. xxxx|`|7yADGE3laa	In simple terms, No.<br>  <br>  Hell no.<br>  <br>  You're raising 2 kids right now.. you realize that?|`|3OuX672Qaa	hes very lucky he dosent live with me!! you are doin far to much at this time in pregnancy if he wont even put your son to bed.looks like he certainly dosent love or respect you the way you do him??(sorry if that sounds harsh) i have 2daughters and i am 18 wks pregnant there dad lives about 10 minute walk away,works 6 till 6 and often comes down to bath and put the girls bed no matter how hard he has worked and when he did live here would still help out with odd jobs,maybe a dose of wife swap would teach your man a lesson!!! x|`|6srkL0giaa	YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG<br>  <br>  In fact you have just done too many things.  There isn't enough hours in the day for all the things you have to do.  I read your question with sheer disbelief.  I cannot believe how your partner 'allows' you to do so much whilst pregnant.  <br>  <br>  He should be alot more considerate and help you when he gets home.  He is also being very childish reacting the way he did last night about his socks.  I would have just put them in the bin if I had to lift them. Try to talk to him and tell how you are feeling and ask if he could help out a little more.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't help out you could try other ways of minimising the work you have to do each day.  Starting for example, with all housework you do.  Ask your son and your partner to take their shoes off before coming into the house so the floors stay cleaner for longer, make up dinner for everyone at the same time, so you should could reheat whenever needed, you don't need to bathe your son every night, every other night or three times a week is fine.  Also, you could stop making the packed lunches, your son could have school dinners and make your man buy his own lunch.  I hope your situation gets better soon.<br>  <br>  |`|AZKbXXrvaa	Oh boy..your poor partner..he works so hard doesnt he...excuse the sarcasm, but he really needs to wake up to himself. How on earth does he think you are going to run around him when the baby comes?<br>  Right now there should be 2 priorities in your life..your son and yourself and baby. Do all that you need to for you child (cooking, washing, playing etc) and for yourself, including studying because you have to, and leave the rest of it. Your partner can get his own packed lunch or buy a sandwhich (he's obviously worked this out already). he can also mop the floors at the weekend, and put the washing on when he gets in. he is also able to make himself a cup of tea and one for you at the same time. In fact he is capable of looking after you and your son as well as himself, but he doesnt think he has to because you do it all for him.<br>  if you think he can be reasonable, try talking to him about this. Perhaps ask a good friend to be there as support if it helps. he may not realsie just how hard it is being pregnant and doing everythig else too (or he may just be spoilt and selfish, only you will know the truth here). Failing that, go on strike, doing the bare minimum for your son and yourself and just what is absolutely necessary in the house. ie any clothes not in the laundry basket dont get washed, plates not taken to the sink get left where they are, cups of tea are not made on demand....you get the idea, or better still if you can, go and stay with a friend for a few days and leave him to it. Either way, you need to start putting yourself higher up the list..at the top in fact, or you are going to be exhausted by the time baby arrives. Take care and take it easy. Oh, and remind him you are his partner NOT his mother!!|`|Utyy0b6Paa	You need to have a good long chat with him over one of those fabled cups of tea because although he works hard and pays his way he isn't offering you the emotional and physical support that you need. At this point in your pregnancy the last thing you want is to be completely stressed out over this. You have to tell him how you feel, you need his help more now than ever. I myself found it very hard during my partners pregnancy because most of the time it didn't really seem as real for me as it did for her. I worked my *** off all the time and I admit that sometimes it got on my wick when I felt like I was doing the work of two people, VERY selfish i admit. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you should tell him how you feel but try to understand that your partner will be feeling the pressures in a different way to you. He needs to help you more. Good luck and all the best for the future.|`|a7U9RUSvaa	OMG, i really take my hat off to you!! he is so lucky to have you! i personally think you should start slowing down as your nearing your due date and he should also help you out. You doing everything is such a no no. You work too, being a stay at home mom WHILE 31 WEEKS PREGNANT is a hectic job, never mind the studying in between. You should talk to him and ask him to help you, you CANT do everything for him, your not a slave but a life partner, a mother to his two children now. If he doesn't want to listen, go on strike and only tend to you and your son. When he gets home, you take a relaxing bath, read a book and let him fend for himself. the way he is acting is so damn childish in my books, and if he wants to play childish games, treat him like a child! |`|uyq3OJIBaa	Woah..no affence but he sounds like a  bit of a dick to me...i mean fair enough he works long hours but ur pregnant and u need the support at the moment..i say u should make him do his own **** and YOU refuse to do the washing up, cleaning etc....make him do it....its about time he did something for you and the family.....|`|yLjNn7yDaa	You've done nothing wrong,hun! Both of you are tired, I think that's the main prob. I think both of you guys have sit and talk. I think he will finally understand,remember it's his baby you are expecting?<br>  You cant do everything on your own, we're not the wonderwomen kinda wives, are we? My suggestion is, hire a helper if you can afford it. Or let a relative live with you to help you around.<br>  |`|Cg4fWi3Baa	I see where you are coming from and although it's no excuse, I truely believe it's a male thing. Instead of attacking him (although you have every right lol) catch him at a moment where you can talk to him about how tired you are feeling and that you would really appreciate some extra help around the place when he can. I had to talk to my man about this late in my pregnancy because he was much the same. He would do things like throw the socks on the floor, leave wet towels on the bathroom floor because he would enjoy stirring me to get a reaction. We are usually a couple who like to have fun and joke around but he didn't understand how I felt at that stage. You should probably start trying to cut down your housework and stuff now that you are in your 3rd trimester and try to rest more. It doesn't matter if the house isn't perfect. I think your normal for feeling this way. Remember to that you are probably all emotional from all the buzzing pregnancy hormones which cause you to react to things differently. I say talk to your hubby, it's the best thing to do. Communicate with each other so that you are ot trying to read minds. He probably doesn't even know how you are feeling. Best wishes. Hope I helped.|`|18PnBZaEaa	CINDERELLA eat you heart out.. totally unfair.. you got the short straw i think.. you are going to cause you re self an injury.. you really need to talk to him now before baby comes or its going to be ten times worse.. seems like your life is a big chore.. get him to do the little things his own paclunch etc all these little things will help you.. and if you need to rest REST make sure your son is sorted but to hell with the cleaning etc it will still be there once you have rested for a while.. take time for yourself or you will get ill not just physically but mentally.. good luck |`|mL6ycTAhaa	wow. you both seem to be working hard. Good luck. I think you try very hard, and he should see that, you should also see his side also.|`|AA11349925	Don't pander to his tantrums, if my husband put me through that I would physically kick his ars!e. Leave his washing and his dinner to himself you are not his mum. You both work hard but you both have to chip in once the day is over whether he likes it or not. I wouldn't put up with it and my husband knows I wouldn't. Ignore his childish behaviour and just look after yourself and your son, if he wants his stuff he'll have to do it himself.|`|T6QeWeehaa	wow that sounds bad. You should sit hi down and talk to him. He is being unreasonable. Maybe your doing too much for him. There might be something on his mind tht he isnt telling you about. hope this helps x|`|kfCVRyVjaa	The problem here is that you're both tired and not being very understanding of each other's needs.<br>  <br>  Yes - you're pregnant and are tired and could do with a bit more help around the house maybe but you can't expect him to change his habits overnight without properly explaining why.<br>  <br>  He's clearly exhausted from work and as much as you feel he probably doesn't understand how tired you are, he is probably thinking the same thing.  Trust me, as a full time working mother who also does all household chores, I can tell you, each job is as exhausting as the other.  Driving and working for him will make him feel as tired as washing and looking after the kids does for you.<br>  <br>  Talk to him calmly about this.  Tell him that you understand hat he's tired after working long hours but that physically you're also getting exhausted and you could do with a bit more help.  You're not suggesting he becomes Mr Domestic man but that if he could try to remember to put dishes in the dishwasher and dirty clothes in the laundry, that would be great.<br>  <br>  Don't be confrontational or act as if he's being unreasonable.  At the end of the day, you set the parameters of what you were willing to do domestically at some stage in your relationship and you can't expect him to change his habits just like that.|`|5uqRdBjnaa	You have got so much on your plate and I don't really know how you are coping. You son sounds like a great kid and you are doing all the right things with him, but maybe you need to slow up on some stuff. <br>  <br>  Like uni can that be put on hold for six months or so, I mean you're about to have a baby and as for your partner, i think he is being really selfish and unhelpful. <br>  <br>  For someone who runs the house you also do a lot of work for extra cash, if your man is working so hard and for so long surely he can help out a little bit more and give you a bit more time to be the domestic goddess.<br>  <br>  I really hope you get the rest and help you need, good luck|`|EoYPnGIuaa	Try explaining over a nice take-away dinner how you feel... if that fails then just go on strike...have a girls night out with your mates... and let him sleep on the sofa next time!!!|`|H0fXySX9aa	I feel for you hun he does work hard but so do you and yes hes tired but i would buy him one of those belly things that you can buy and ask him to wear it and try and work,<br>  does he not understand you are exhausted and to be honest he could try a bit harder,<br>  i don't work i do everything my husband does 12 hour shifts but if i ask him to do something he will .<br>  i would talk to your husband he is being unreasonable and you are under so much stress,this could affect your health and good luck|`|Rc08VYFtaa	Tell him to grow up and wash his own feet, plate, socks etc etc, If I was you I would not cook dinner tonight, get a big box of dairy milk and sit down with my feet up read some trashy magazines and just relax, when he comes in empty two packets of crisps in a bowl and tell him "dinner is served"!! <br>  <br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You need to sit him down and tell him how you're feeling. Nothing will change unless he knows how you feel. Things may not get better but who knows they may. He sounds like he may just be tired since he works such long hours but that is no reason to be an jerk to you. I hope things get better. Good luck |`|jiTKnCKpaa	Hi I think he is being totally unfair, you also work all day mabyes not out of the home but by the sounds of it you never stop, you should tell him you are gonna need more help, what are you gonna do when your baby comes you cant be expected to look after 2 children, him and do all the house work, and by the sound of it you pay alot more to the house then he does, You are going to have to tell him how unfair he is being if you don't slow down and get help you could end up very stressed out which wouldn't be good for you or the baby.|`|p3ZQffuLaa	Well he is deffinately taking the p*ss but really he is just acting like a tipical man! I know but they sometimes don't see it!<br>  Talk to him nicley about it and see what happens!<br>  He will realise how much you really do when you are in hospital having your baby!<br>  Good luck hun!|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	wow after reading your novel all i can say is... <br>  <br>  i know your tired and its hard to moves around trust me i gave birth to my son last month (he was 5 weeks early) during my preg i had placenta previa, gestational diabetes, migraine aura's and fianlly was induced due to pre eclampsia all of this while doing pretty much the same as you but with my 5 year old. my hubby is and was a complete slob not to mention he was very hormonal himself. but he works 6 days a week 12 hrs a day and im a stay at home mom with a part time gig on the side sooo i feel he needs a break to. but please there is still no excuse for him to be acting this way that makes me mad. so you have every right to be pissed off. dont take it to much to heart some men are just lazy and you have the choice to not deal with it
XzbRZCPUaa	don't listen to these dumb a$$es who don't know what they are talking about they eat ice cream , chips, and ring dings and gain 80 pounds and think it's normal ! i only gained 5 pounds and i'm 21 weeks i am overweight to begin with and they say 15 -20 pounds total is normal if you are overweight , i eat when i'm hungry and eat what i want so it's not like i  am not trying to not gain. if the dr. doesn't have any problems with it don't worry .|`|yQWnMSc6aa	NO! I gained 5 pounds in ONE week. Yes. ONE week.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about your figure. Worry about how your nutrition affects your baby.|`|rsEK17n1aa	I'm 33 weeks and so far I gain 40 lbs.  |`|MtC3CWZraa	If I understand right, you’ve gained 10 pounds, correct? You lost five over your pre-pregnancy weight and are now 5 over your pp weight. <br>  <br>  That’s close to the low end of the recommended gain for someone who started at a normal weight. Per What to Expect When You’re Expecting, you should gain <br>  2-4 pounds in the 1st trimester (if any)<br>  1-1.5 lbs/week in the 2nd <br>  1 lb/week in the 3rd<br>  |`|gzjWQo1eaa	I gained 6lbs in 4 weeks, several times during my pregnancy, totaling over 55lbs. don't worry your doing great.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Ummm your fine. If your overweight then your perfect if you were underweight or of normal weight before pregnancy you could gained a little more at 23 weeks. You are going to see a just from 1st trimester to 2nd trimester and sometimes that is 5lbs in 2 weeks the it tappers off. I have gained 27lbs at 29 weeks, perfectly normal. Don't focus on losing weight just eat healthy. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well I think that if there were any concern your doctor would say something. I know that I'm 19 weeks and I've already gained 17 pounds and most of it was in the first 9 weeks. I eat a lot and honestly I still have a small frame just bigger boobs and a belly. I'm sure you are fine. |`|E6m6H4g2aa	you have gained 5 pounds thats sick... normal people should gain 10-15 pounds by 23 weeks...your not angelina jolie dummy!<br>  <br>  you dont need more exercise. nourish your baby and get over your weight...you can loose it once the baby is born|`|F9AiIcVfaa	lol girl you are so far away from gaining to much weight. i am 16 weeks and have gained 15 pounds. its normal to gain 1-2 punds a week after your first trimester. we all wish we were one of those girls lol
44126a34b9fb10fc16ff09b0c6653ba6aa	i would wait if you can do that. wating is very hard to do but u can do it. good luck to you whatever the outcome is! sounds like u have all the symptoms though  :)*|`|h8NacUyWaa	wait and see whats going to happen. You may be starting your period or be stressing out to much about being pregnant.<br>  You can also go to your health department, they will do a preggo test for free. goodluck.|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	I would wait to see if you get your next period and go from there.|`|fKhjdqCGaa	I would go get a blood test. Very accurate and with most health insurance costs next to nothing:) Hope all goes well. Best wishes.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah I would probably wait until then and see what happens.
YqL67IWzaa	There is not much that will help with your morning sickness. Just gotta deal with it. :(<br>  <br>  Until you have a doc appointment..yes taking pre natal vitamins helps.  Not sure what brands they have... but in grocery stores or pharmacy store.. they have some. Dont stay on them though.. get the prenatals from your doc.. the ones you can buy at any ol store do not have enough folic acid in them. You need a prescription from your doc. But yes I would take them until you see a doc.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah you should. Doctors recommend that you start taking them even before you get pregnant so if you aren't that it won't do any harm. |`|44uorNhOaa	there is nothing going to curb the sickness i had carckers with me all the time in hopes that would help me but the pre natal vitamins start them now your baby needs the flic acid in them for healthy growth. i have been trying to concieve for a month and already starting taken them. good luck!|`|CQjCCcuGaa	Once you find out that you are pregnant, depending on the advice of your doctor, you should definitely start a prenatal vitamin regime.  Your best bet at this point would be to make a doctor's appointment and get a pregnancy test and talk to him about a prenatal vitamin regime.   <br>  <br>  The baby's neural tube will begin to close within the first month of pregnancy, during a time when few women even realize they are pregnant! For that reason, it is very important that you start taking prenatal vitamins 2-3 months before you begin trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  Followup with this website for more information...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/article.cfm/prenatal_vitamins" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...</a>|`|kRYF33j9aa	It is pretty safe to start prenatal vitamins before you are expecting and you should definitely take them throughout your whole pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Ginger relives morning sickness naturally as well as bananas. Saltines will take any queasiness away.   Make sure you eat on a regular basis.  <br>  <br>  Mine was especially bad when I was hungry and staying on schedule made it a lot better.<br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|BEP4GRORaa	as for the morning sickness, try chewing spearmint gum. I had all day sickness and the gum helped me. It went away, months ago, but now I have been feeling it creeping back.<br>  Lovely|`|YegaWxxMaa	sure u could take them especial if ur trying to get pregnant its good to start now
AA10805358	wait until your period is late a week that way you can get an accurate result...would you really want to test this early and get a false-negative? Also, if it comes up negative wait a week and then test again.|`|6ecEi58Eaa	all females body are diferent. It dosen't sound to me like your pregnant, normally( for me atleast) you don't start to feel any symptoms untiill about 3 months in your pregnancy. I think you should go and get your self checked out just to make sure your healthy and possibly pregnant.<br>   Good luck!|`|EpfVsCa2aa	yes those are signs, i would test since u were suppose to have ur period a few days ago, good luck|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah those can be signs. I would take a test since your period was due two days ago. Good luck!
3CG3rby0aa	I was in the same boat as you are when i was pregnant with my first and now look i am working on having my 4th!  You will be fine!  Don't stress out about it because if the Lord wants you to have this baby then you will and he has a plan for the child.  Stress can hurt you and the baby too so do not worry about it.  your blood pressure can go up and that can hurt both of you.  you will have discomfort with this pregnancy because it is your first and you body has to adjust to taking care of 2 of you now instead of one.  just lay down and rest.  take care of yourself and if you have cramping, (which i did in my 1st 1 too) sit down prop your feet up and rest.  plus you can sleep now too because that also helps you body to function better too.  miscarriage rate drops after 12 weeks, you are right there.  no there is really not a way to predict if you will have a miscarriage.  as long as everything is going ok don't worry about it.  Your sex drive will probably return around the 4 month mark.  If you are real worried about it you can call the doctor and talk to the nurse on call and see if she can help you with your questions.  I wish you the best of luck!  God Bless you and your little one!|`|wBWc4b5naa	the risk does drop a large percent after 12-14 weeks, but you'll have a whole new set of concerns then.  i thougt i'd feel better after 12 weeks, now i walk around freaked out that he's got his umbilical cord aroudn his neck.  it's the most nerv wracking experience ever this whole being pregnant thing!  and i hear it doesn't get better after they are born!!!   <br>  <br>  don't worry if you have cramping.... i thought iw as ganna have a period any minute for the first two trimesters and only recently started to feel like there isn't as much cramping!  it can just be your uterous growing.  if you are bleeding AND cramping, it is not good, but still can be okay.  the likelihood of having a misscarriage without blood is seriously so low it's not worth worrying about.  that doesn't happen till after the first trimester (told you there is a whole new list of worries then!!!!)  <br>  <br>  the only thing i found to help calm the nerves is  to walk into a crowded place and remember all these people were born!  your chances are good!  <br>  <br>  best luck sweetie.  its' a rollercoaster ride from here! <br>  <br>  |`|AA12089586	I would say after the first trimester, but i don't think you are ever in the clear.<br>  You could always have a late miscarriage or have a still born.<br>  But you chances are significantly lower.<br>  Not to scare you, but thats why we are told if we experiences cramps along with bleeding, or not feeling the baby move as often as they should to call your doctor.<br>  Things can still go wrong, unfortunately, but after 12-13 weeks your risk of early miscarriage is lower!|`|2B2fgmw9aa	It drops after your first trimester is over at 13 weeks, and no there is no way to tell unless the doctor does a sonogram and does not find a heartbeat or you have bleeding and cramping.<br>  <br>  They are all totally normal symptoms!!! You will have vaginal discharge, and slight discomfort in the uterus...I actually thought I was gonna get my period for the first 6 weeks I was pregnant!!! Oh and no sex drive at that time!<br>  <br>  My best advice is to get What to Expect when you are Expecting...It answers a lot of questions and helps ease your mind!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was told that it usually goes down when you start your 2nd trimester. I have also heard that once you hear the heartbeat it goes down a little bit but not a lot.|`|3f45a25Haa	Ive always heard after the first trimester. |`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	It lowers quite a bit before 12 weeks if you can hear the heartbeat or see it on ultrasound. |`|tivpa7Vlaa	actually the risk of miscarriage drops after 20wks of gestation. no one can predict if u r going to have one. remember its nature's way and yes u r gonna have some cramping and definitely bleeding when u miscarry. all u can do is pray to have a healthy pregnancy and baby cause there is also another hump to get over even after delivery like still birth(deadbaby) and SIDS.
yZFbGyKFaa	Hey Hun<br>  You would of actually conceived on Tuesday 9th September or maybe a couple days before or a couple days after!<br>  Congrats!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	<a href="http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Conception_Date" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Con...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe that site will help you out a little bit.

6UEihTtCaa	It is possible but not necessarily something to worry about. I sometimes get those symptoms before a period and don't know why. I've had it happen about 5 times over the last few years so I wouldn't worry yourself just yet. |`|MtC3CWZraa	Yes, it is possible.  |`|fUtLCFt0aa	WHAT GAVE IT OUT FOR ME IS  THE BREAST THE TENDERNESS THAT IS THE ONLY WAY BUT EVERY ONE IS DIFFENT BECUASE YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT SYMPTOMS YOU TEND TO GET BEFORE YOUR PERIOD AND IF THEY ARE WEIRD THEN THEY ARE DEFFIENTLY PREGNANT RELATED|`|PYhTmnKWaa	Yes. I think as soon as my egg was fertilized I was puking!! With both of my kids I knew I was about a week before my period was due. Remember though your symptoms could also be a sign of your period. Take a test and see.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Yes, absolutely!  Take an early test to find out, using your first morning urine, and good luck with whichever way you're hoping it will go.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I started to feel sick like a week before my period would have been due. |`|5puE2Qfpaa	Yes, mine did 5 days before my cycle was due I knew I was pregnant.
MOsStEbqaa	I herd that you show faster with each baby. Its bcuz your boday has been through it before and knows what to do. |`|EpfVsCa2aa	With every pregancy you do get bigger, with my 3rd child i was 4 months an showed like i was 6 months|`|jDmAyPTyaa	<br>  More then likely yes you will show earlier.<br>  All of your abdominal muscles have been stretched from your previous baby's. With each pregnancy those muscles become more relaxed!!!!<br>  This is perfectly normal.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	With each pregnancy you show earlier and earlier. So you may be. It seems a bit early though|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	I think you feel really bloated about now.  That is why you feel like you are showing.  I went through the same thing.
uDPmazlxaa	nope doesnt work I tried everything! nothing worked.  and I mixed it in oj, it was like drinking curdled milk, orange juice flavored.  |`|JT4OSUPeaa	I'm not sure if it really works or not but PLEASE dont try it. Its a VERY very strong laxative that can work on the baby as well which can be very dangerous. Try walking, sex, spicy food, those have been known to bring on labor. Good Luck :)|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	No!!<br>  It's awful awful awful stuff.<br>  It gives you the runs, can make you throw up and it is not safe for the baby. Bubs can poop inside and swallow/inhale it. <br>  It tastes like hot moldy fish. It's really that bad.<br>  <br>  There are more enjoyable ways to help bring labor on. Eat pineapple, spicy foods, sex sex and more sex (by yourself or with a partner :)) Walk, do squats.  Raspberry tea |`|kj1md6t0aa	There were like, ten questions just like this today. Anyway, no, I hear it doesn't. Also I hear that it isn't that safe.

Don't drink castor oil. It will make you sick (vomiting and diarrhea) and can cause baby to have a bowel movement (meconium). During delivery the baby can inhale this which can cause a lot of respiratory problems. Don't take the risk.

If this is the case, or if you were unprotected, there is a very real chance you could become pregnant.  How many days ago was it.  You should go to the pharmacist and ask them for the morning after pill.  It's called Plan B.  This will eliminate any unwanted risk of pregnancy.  But in the future, be careful.  If you don't want a baby, be safe and protect yourself, either get on birth control or use a condom.  Better yet of course is to not have sex at all until you are ready to take that risk.  Wearing a condom isn't only to protect you from getting pregnant but to keep you safe from STD's as well.  I'm sure you don't want herpes, clap, or worse HIV.  Just be smart.|`|iR7OX1Ayaa	Was it unprotected sex? You should have given more detain. Even if he did not ejaculate in you there is still precm that can still get you pregnant.

qA9JtQBMaa	Not necessarily - I got a positive 6 days before I was even due!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	i got a pos before my missed period, I don't think you are further along but they can confirm you pregnant...try another doc...|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	yes, it's possible. i don't understand why the doc's office says they can't confirm until 35 days--a simple HCG quantitative blood test is all they would have to do for sure confirmation. but don't worry about the dates--the first few ultrasounds will be where they can determine just how far along you really are. though not foolproof, it's the best indicator of when you actually conceived as opposed to using the dates of your last menstrual period.|`|7xit1ogxaa	You probably aren't farther along. A pregnancy test can detect pregnancy up to 5 days before your period is due. The closer you are to the expected date of your period, the higher chance of receiving an accurate result. There have been times where I found out four days before my period was due, and times where I didn't get a positive until a couple days after it was due. You are a little under four weeks pregnant right now.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I tested about 5 days before I missed mine and I wasn't farther along. My last LMP was 4-13-08 and I tested positive on 5-8-08. I'm now 25 weeks. |`|dqSA7j7gaa	You will be able to know when they do your first sonogram and measure the baby.<br>  |`|AFdD8ut6aa	Most pregnancy tests can detect the pregnancy hormone 4-5 days before you miss your period, although the level of hormone is lower so sometimes too early you'll get a neg when you're really preg. Pregnancy officially "starts" counting from the first day of your last period so you would be considered 4 weeks. Unless your last period was particularly light or short then I would say the 4 weeks is prob right, because like I said the pregnancy tests can detect it a days before your missed period. Whenever you have your first ultrasound (depending on doc could be as early as 6 weeks or as late as 12 from my experience and my friends) they will tell you by how big the baby is if it's due in 8 months or 7. They gave me my due date based off of when my last period was and then the u/s only measured a few days earlier than that so they didn't change the due date. And when I went in for my "official" pregnancy test I wasn't yet 35 days past my last period either (I was 30 days) but they still confirmed it as a positive. If your docs are like mine and count how far along you are based off your last period then you should make sure you give them the right number next time you go in. I don't think a few days would make a huge difference but they base their care of you on how far along you are so the more accurate, the better.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|upGw4hS8aa	It is possible since some women menstruate during pregnancy.  You will not know for sure how far along you are until you have an ultrasound.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Ultrasound and or quanitavie HCG can be done. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They can tell you when you have your first ultrasound.

You shouldn't be the reason why someone else can't have an abortion. If you're against abortion then don't have one but you CANNOT take other people's right to have an abortion.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* To Crazy Girl (way down there) be realistic.

Then, When the child goes to college, the rapist has to pay for that, too.|`|ULx2vAB1aa	i think it should be legal, because even if they made it illegal, people would still find ways to do it. it's the womans choice|`|nwZ1ZtRbaa	Honestly, although, I don't agree with abortion myself, I still think it should be legal until the end of the first trimester. Sorry, but I can't support it when the baby is more developed and can feel pain, even if it does have a birth defect. And I think rape cases would be hard to prove. A woman could just say she was raped and get her boyfriend or husband in jail just so she can have an abortion. Some people will do anything to get what they want, plus if you think about it rape babies are no different from other babies, it doesn't matter how they were conceived. I used to think that way but I'm different now. Now I think thinking rape babies can be aborted but not other babies is worse than thinking anyone can be. It's like babies conceived by two consenting people are so innocent but rape babies are pieces of junk from a rapist and can be aborted.|`|0sFyYrVGaa	It should be legal.  If it were illegal, there would be just as many abortions performed, only they would be more painful, bloodier, and possibly fatal.  Sound like a good thing to you? Nah.  Until 8 weeks, the 'baby' is just an embryo, and after that it is only a fetus.  A fetus cannot feel pain until about 24 weeks, and by then abortion is no longer legal unless it is of dire importance for the mother's health. People will argue this subject til the death, no one is right or wrong.  But I'll have to say, I can't stand when pro-lifers call pro-choicers 'baby killers'.  Does every pro choice person get knocked up and have an abortion? No.  And abortion isn't murder to begin with, and it's never easy on someone to go through with so why make them feel worse about it?<br>  <br>  Or how about if you knew that your kid would more than likely have a terrible disorder and would live off of machines in the hospital for the rest of his/her life? Or the child would die at a young age? What would be more painful for you and the child?  While having an abortion, the fetus does not feel anything.  If your child were to die after being born, there would be a lot of pain and suffering for the kid and for the mother. I think it's dumb for people who are financially stable and married to get abortions though, unless it's a necessity(the mother could die, etc etc.) Or if they already have kids..I mean, why can't you raise another one? It's your own fault you got pregnant. And what if you simply can't support the baby? Or you can't pay for all of those hospital visits?  Your baby will wind up with problems any way.  I would never have a child if I knew they would go without.  A child should be able to have all of the necessities for a good life.<br>  <br>  I'm very pro choice and I can't stand the pro lifers skewed views of abortion.  "It's murder. that's all there is to it." -bullshit.  It is so much more then what they apparently think it is.  Most pro lifers I have talked to had a completely wrong idea of how abortions are performed nowadays(yes even on here.), so maybe some of these pro lifers should do their research.<br>  <br>  Oh and this is kind of irrelevant, but I read the first answer and I thought 'wtf?'. If you're going to be pro-life, BE PRO LIFE. Not under 'some circumstances' where as abortion in cases of rape or incest is okay.  What makes a baby that was conceived by rape or incest any different than one that wasn't?  It's still a baby.|`|ZPPLvHDaaa	Well I dont think it's right, but I don't think it's wrong either.<br>  <br>  <br>  YES. People, of course it is killing a life. Im not justifing anything with that. But if you can not be a mother, and it's the absolute worst time, maybe abortion is one way to look, but there's also adoption. So abortion is okay, but there's always a second option.  You can't always go with adoption. So some people get an abortion. Most people are teenagers, whom cannot support the baby, so why bring the suffering thing to life?<br>  <br>  <br>  Im not saying it's right, and im not saying it's wrong.<br>  <br>  But INDEED it is killing a life. NO matter what.<br>  <br>  |`|isokr9cfaa	how is the subject of abortion fun? It's never a fun subject! I vote illegal.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Legal.

Every women should have the right to decide what she wants to do with her body.|`|Rwd3cZP0aa	I think abortion should be legal.<br>  Yes, I am aware that it kills a baby, which is very important, and people should be responsible when having sex, but it shouldn't be taken out on the baby's life when it grows up. When an unwanted baby is born, it can have a troubled life. Maybe it's given to an orphanage or foster home where it isn't happy. Or, even worse, maybe the parents will be hostile toward it, since it made them change their life plan. <br>  Having no baby is better than having a child that ends up having mental or self esteem problems because they had a troubled childhood.<br>  Also, what about young girls that have been raped and get pregnant from it? Should they have to live with a painful memory? If I were ever raped, I would abort it and try to get the rape out of my head.<br>  I don't think women should be robbed of a very fortunate right. With kids having sex younger and younger, and our country quickly becoming overcrowded, we need to keep abortion in our country. Although I don't think I myself would ever do it, it shouldn't be completely illegal.|`|UDIC8MLjaa	If its a health issue its necessary.If you were raped I guse its ok but I don't see why a fetus conceived by rape has more of a right to live,I guse the mother will just go crazy knowing that the baby wasn't by someone she cares for,but its only 9 months and thers only adoption.Avoiding pregnancy is very easy.Believe it or not iv been having sex without a single contraption.Anal and oral are just as good as regular intercourse.I could not see myself getting an abortion for any reason except for serious illness,death,or if the child was going to be a vegetable the rest of its life.I have a firm belief in children are the future so even if its hard on me I would give it a chance and hope it dose something good with its life and has a positive impact on someone elses.|`|TcaWW4OBaa	Legal. definitely.  <br>  <br>  and im gonna get so many thumbs down for this next bit, buuut..<br>  <br>  for those pepople who say its murder, well maybe, but its not reaaaallllly a baby quite if its under 3 months, its a feotus, with no memories, no personality, no mind, nothing. its not as though its going to feel anything, or to know its going to die, to know its going to miss anything. but abortion say later than 3 or 4 months, im not so sure about. i think i need to know more about it to comment further.|`|TjXU0VV0aa	When debating this .. pare it right down to the nitty gritty !  What are the two most polar opposite scenarios .. For me it is as follows: <br>  <br>  Fetus feels pain / Fetus has a soul from the moment of conception. These are the questionable issues which drive many people on the pro-life side (as i see it.)   VS.   Mom's life is in danger through the process / Forcing and arguably punishing an already traumatized mom to go through this process (such as in the case of rape or incest/molestation.) And in my opinion the pro-choice side struggles heaviest with these issues. <br>  Both example issues could go either way.  Maybe a mom who was forced to have baby she didnt want treats baby poorly, doesnt care for them well emotionally or physically?  This child could either A. persevere through it, make something of herself and be happy for the opportunity just to have been born.  Or B. Child never finds a healthy way to tread through these brutal years and end up miserable .. wishing mom could have had the choice so he/she didnt have to suffer for their parent's mistake.    You never can tell how its going to come out .. so thats why this issue is perpetually debatable ! <br>  <br>  Personally .. i stand pro-choice.   I would not have an abortion. I am ready for and would love to have a child.    But i do not want to stand judgment over someone elses circumstances.   If a rape or incest victim wished not to be punished further by being forced to endure daily reminders of their trauma .. i could understand that.  And .. if i was baby fetus and i had the ability to contemplate this and be part of my mom's decision .. i would give up my life understanding that this could make mom's life unbearable.       <br>  I ask of pro-lifers:   If mom is not aloud to have abortion and is forced to care for child (not every person does right by or bonds to baby) and mom physically and emotionally abuses child through her own ignorance and frustration .. are you all willing to take in these children? <br>  Maybe the child perseveres through horrific years .. but maybe they dont. And why should this child suffer for your ideals ?  Maybe a small percentage turn out to be wonder and success stories .. but many/most of them will just end up loose in society living in that vicious circle.     <br>  EDIT****  Some on the board said that abortion is ok if pregnancy stems from bad situation like rape etc and is only ok in situations like this .. people will bend the system .. what is stopping mom from simply saying "i was raped" .. there is no way to prove or disprove this anyway.  I think this is just another example showing that you HAVE to argue this issue using the most severe of situations because these are the people who will be the ones unfairly punished by the changes in the existing law.<br>  **Crazy Grl .. cessation of pregnancy could also be:  One beating avoided, one lifetime of abuse avoided, One hungry neglected child situation avoided.     Abortion as a form of birth control is morally wrong .. but that should not be judged by others but should be between you and your god or if you dont believe .. between you and your own soul.   Not everyone has the tools to be a good or even fair mother / father.  Id rather someone accepted that than give birth to a child they cant provide for and help guide in the way every child deserves to be.|`|WJf05jDFaa	Legal is: The mother could die from giving birth, the baby would be born with a serious defect (Missing lung, twin at the brain, second heart,  etc.)<br>  <br>  Illegal to woman who: Don't want to have stretch marks, don't want to take care of the baby, dislike kids, just want to have more sex, etc.|`|7GBodOdOaa	Mommy <br>  I am only 4 inches long <br>  but I have all my organs. <br>  I love the sound of your voice. <br>  The sound of your heart beat <br>  is my favorite lullaby. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Month Two <br>  <br>  Mommy <br>  today I learned how to svck my thumb. <br>  If you could see me <br>  you could definitely tell that I am a baby. <br>  I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though. <br>  It is so nice and warm in here. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Month Three <br>  <br>  You know what Mommy <br>  I'm a girl!! <br>  I hope that makes you happy. <br>  I always want you to be happy. <br>  I don't like it when you cry. <br>  You sound so sad. <br>  It makes me sad too <br>  and I cry with you even though <br>  you can't hear me. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Month Four <br>  <br>  Mommy <br>  my hair is starting to grow. <br>  It is very short and fine <br>  but I will have a lot of it. <br>  I spend a lot of my time exercising. <br>  I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes <br>  and stretch my arms and legs. <br>  I am becoming quite good at it too. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Month Five <br>  <br>  You went to the doctor today. <br>  Mommy, he lied to you. <br>  He said that I'm not a baby. <br>  I am a baby Mommy, your baby. <br>  I think and feel. <br>  Mommy, what's abortion? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Month Six <br>  <br>  <br>  I can hear that doctor again. <br>  I don't like him. <br>  He seems cold and heartless. <br>  Something is intruding my home. <br>  The doctor called it a needle. <br>  Mommy what is it?

The way I see it, is it depends on 1) the situation the women was up against, having a night of fun and rape are totally different situations, 2) the mother should have to take a coarse or have counseling or at least an information program about everything about what is happening, so she is making the right choice and 3) what the father of the baby wants, he has a say. <br>  <br>  It's such a difficult situation, that I hope never happens to me. I'm young and against it, but I know there are those reasons that I can go level with and understand, so I'm totally against and don't want to hear it. It always is different and depends. |`|hstwNjNaaa	Legal.<br>  <br>  If abortion is illegal then women get unsafe terminations and risk their life's. If someone wants to end a pregnancy then it's their own choice, there are many many reasons why someone might have an abortion. It should never be used as a form of contraception, but if you don't want to have a baby then you should be able to get rid of it safely.
jQDeTTVhaa	I tested positive 5 days befor my missed period.Yes it was accurate for me try to test around saturday or sunday.yes I had pregnancy symptoms before I knew for sure I was pregnant.Good luck|`|IWinNj2saa	If he pulled out, sounds like he doesn't want you to be pregnant. If you would be so happy if you were, maybe you should talk to your partner about trying to conceive, I don't think the pull out method is the best method for conception. Anyhow, they say the pull out method can still get you pregnant, but I haven't seen the case where it has yet. Good Luck to you though|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be pregnant! I think you could probably test this week if you wanted to. Your period may have been weird last time because you were pregnant but I don't know. I would take the test and if it is negative wait and see if you get your period and if you don't take another one after that. You can always request a blood test as well. Good luck!|`|4WASY7QWaa	I would try and wait until you miss your period. Or you can try and do it now and if its negative then take another test in about a week, week and a half. good luck!|`|jyGyZMbTaa	Its possible but tender breasts and eating habits are different when your gettting ready to start your period. Good luck to you!|`|rDPADat1aa	Okay, first of all, you CAN get pregnant with the pull-out method.  I got preggo with my last baby that way (ended in miscarriage though).<br>  <br>  As for the testing early, I really think you should just wait because it's too likely that you'll get a negative whether it's right or wrong.  If you miss your period, then test.  Not before.<br>  <br>  You said you're never late, but I have to say, there is a first time for everything.  I've said so many phrases like that and wound up not being pregnant.  "I've never had an LP longer than 15 days."  That month, I had one that was 17 days and then got my AF.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with this.  If you really want to have another, I think you should talk to your DH about trying actively to have another.  Pulling out takes a long time and sometimes you never get pregnant doing that.|`|yqlzH5wjaa	If you had sex, you could be pregnant, no matter what your age, cycle and history...
wBpennsMaa	Get weighed, vitals taken, ask about your symptoms, listen for the heartbeat, if they cant hear it, do an ultrasound.|`|AA10167940	You will get your vitals taken, be asked to give a urine sample, ask you about any symptoms or new ones, and yes they will check for babys heart beat.  Your OB or mid-wife will use a doppler instrument to listen for it.  <br>  <br>  I doubt they will do anything vaginally, but I don't know your situation or history, so hard to say.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Congratulations and all the best-|`|jQDeTTVhaa	yes they will check heart beat ,your weight,BP |`|kyvpycAOaa	Normally, they will check your BP and weight.  You will not have another ultrasound until you are around 20 weeks unless the doctor feels there is something wrong.  The general break down of appts. from here on out will be to pee in a cup, get your weight and BP, and express any concerns you have to the doctor.  When you get to be about 30 weeks, you will go every 2 weeks and then around 36 weeks you will go every week until you deliver.  |`|kAdgwDFqaa	No, it will not be a vaginal ultrasound. But they will do one.  Blood pressure and weight mostly. They really don't do much until your further along.|`|AA10747002	I just had an 11 week appointment this past monday. They did a vaginal ultrasound, the baby was very visible, you could see on the screen the little baby was just wiggling all around, it was really moving alot, it was amazing! Could see its gigantic head and tiny arms and legs. You could see the heartbeat, but at this point I don't think hearing the hearbeat is necessary since you will be able to see it moving and grooving in there. Can even see the heartbeat beating. They will measure the baby at this time. Mine was 4 centimeters at 11 weeks. At weeks 11-13 they do the down syndrome and trisiotomy tests, so they will probably talk to you about that.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	He will use this lil machine that has a mic look to it and you can here it that way. He don't have to do a sono for that. They will do your B.P, weight and listen to baby heart beat at this appt and any after this. As you get further they will do test and other exams |`|uiJazxvhaa	I dont think they will do it vaginaly, they have something ( i can not remember it's given name) that they use just like a regular ultrasound machine...they lube up your belly and he puts it on there and you should be able to here the heart beat...and congrats im having my 3rd at the end of may.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	All they checked for me was my weight, blood pressure, and the baby's heartbeat. If you have any questions they'll go over that but it's a  pretty fast appointment. They told me that that's all they'll do until 21 weeks or something. |`|xEh1pOsNaa	You should buy "What to Expect When You're Expecting"<br>  <br>  It takes you through each visit and gives you an idea of what to expect for the days and weeks ahead.|`|1557866d22112c5c71c048ca6dd77616aa	I think they will try to hear the heartbeat using a Dopplar which is done on the outside of your tummy.  Sometimes it can take a while to find the heartbeat.  Probably will also do a urine sample, BP and take your weight.  Answer any questions that you may have for your doctor.<br>  <br>  I am around the same as you, my 10 week appt is in two weeks, can't wait!  I didn't hear the heartbeat either at my appt at 6 weeks but we did see it blinking.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure when you hear the heart beating it will make it all that much more real for you!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|WtTUNC8Naa	This is what you can expect from every doc visit :<br>  (depending on how far along you are)<br>  <br>  0-4 WEEKS <br>  On your first prenatal visit plan to have: <br>  Pregnancy confirmed <br>  A general medical history <br>  A general physical exam, including an internal exam <br>  Blood tests: hemoglobin and hematocrit, blood typing, rubella titer, hepatitis B screen <br>  Pap smear <br>  Possible blood test for genetic diseases if your history warrants <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Weight and blood pressure checks <br>  Counseling on proper nutrition and avoiding environmental hazards <br>  Your first prenatal visit will also allow you a chance to discuss your concerns <br>  5-9 WEEKS <br>  Examination of your abdomen <br>  Examination of the size and height of uterus <br>  Anemia check <br>  Nutritional counseling <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns<br>  10-14 WEEKS <br>  Examination of your abdomen to feel the top of the uterus <br>  Measure the size and height of uterus <br>  Anemia check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Possibly hearing baby's heartbeat <br>  Discussion of tests if needed <br>  Exam for swelling of hands and legs or fluid retention <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns <br>  15-19 WEEKS <br>  Examination of uterus <br>  Examination for swelling varicose veins, and rashes <br>  Hear baby's heartbeat <br>  Ultrasound shows baby's movement and developed organs <br>  A triple screen test for possible prenatal genetic defects <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns <br>  20-24 WEEKS <br>  Examination of uterus <br>  Abdominal exam <br>  Examination of your breasts and skin <br>  Examination for swelling of hands, legs, and enlargement of veins <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Hear baby's heartbeat <br>  Ultrasound, if indicated <br>  An assessment of fetal activity -- how often your baby moves and what it feels like <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns<br>  24-28 WEEKS <br>  Examination of uterus <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test, screening for gestational glucose intolerance, if indicated <br>  Vaginal culture, screening test for beta strep infection, if indicated <br>  Hear your baby's heart beat <br>  Ultrasound, if indicated <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns <br>  28-32 WEEKS <br>  Examination of uterus <br>  Examination of your skin for rashes, enlarging veins, and swelling <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Hemoglobin and hematocrit, if indicated <br>  Review of your diet, an opportunity to discuss your weight, if necessary <br>  Hear baby's heartbeat <br>  See ultrasound of how baby has grown (if indicated) <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns<br>  32-36 WEEKS <br>  Examination of uterus <br>  Examination of skin for rashes, enlarging veins, and swelling <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Urinalysis <br>  Hemoglobin and hematocrit, if indicated <br>  Review of your diet, an opportunity to discuss your weight, if necessary <br>  Hear baby's heartbeat <br>  See how baby has grown on ultrasound, if indicated <br>  Another opportunity to discuss your concerns<br>  36-40 WEEKS <br>  Uterus exam <br>  Determination of position of baby <br>  An internal exam, if indicated <br>  Weight and blood pressure check <br>  Possible ultrasound <br>  Urinalysis <br>  An opportunity to discuss when to call your practitioner if labor begins <br>  An chance to discuss the difference between Braxton-Hicks contractions and the "real" ones <br>  An opportunity to discuss your birth plan <br>  An opportunity to discuss other concerns <br>  <a href="http://www.babytobee.com/articles/Prenatal-Visits-What-to-Expect.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.babytobee.com/articles/Prenat...</a>|`|wXtqKFf8aa	The usual. Urine, height, weight, and the to see if you can hear the baby's heartbeat. & of course any questions you have for him/her. <br>  For the heartbeat, they use a doppler which is like a microphone used for only this purpose. They put ultrasound gel on you tummy and put the microphone down low on your abdomen, and hopefully they hear that sweet little sound. They don't need to do a vaginal exam, if they didn't do it the first time they might do it this time. But other that that's it. GL.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I experienced a lot of gas pains early on as well. Mine kind of felt like period cramps but they kind of traveled and would go away after a few seconds. |`|ddee4fdfcea9ecef7ac3cad0bf86b332aa	You will have many pains when you are pregnant. Your uterus is stretching. If you're really worried, I would contact your doctor.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	The most benign and probably causes would either be gas pains, or rearrangement of your intestinal tract as your uterus enlarges.<br>  <br>  Less likely but more serious is the possibility of appendicitis.  Talk to your doctor.|`|TzWkvyctaa	I would call your doctor, just to rule out ectopic pregnancy.<br>  good luck sweetie x

Brown spotting could be the ovum implanting into your uterus.  The urination issue could be an infection.<br>  I would get tested for pregnancy.

AA12133563	I've had my son there during a pelvic. I'd recommend you still go. They had a nurse come in the room with the examiner- and she played with my son while the doctor did the exam. (Without me even asking).<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could go, just hear the heartbeat & do basics. Have a pelvic later, but they should be able to work with you. STILL GO. good luck~|`|jhBRNvIxaa	take your son. My 15 month old comes to EVERY appointment with me and he has a blast seeing everything. If they have a problem don't just cancel the appointment. find a new doctor. I mean you are going to an OB the last thing they should do is get pissed over a sibling coming. What do you think a SAHM does. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I wouldn't cancel. It is important. Bring him along with and if they have a problem then I would reschedule but I don't think they will. |`|GVcudkVoaa	Bring your son - a lot of people do it. They will totally understand.
tOWqXCdtaa	Is it your first period? If so, maybe your mom has some pads or tampons stashed somewhere that you could use.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	same thing happened to me i took my mom pads |`|ZfoU2lNJaa	This must be your first time... trust me, be GLAD you're at home lol. I was in an airport in MEXICO where you had to BUY toilet paper from a man standing outside of the restroom. I was like, "MOM!" <br>  <br>  Go dig in your mom's bathroom and see if you can't find a pad, if not (sorry kind of disgusting, but better than the alternative) stuff some toilet paper, maybe paper towels in there since their thicker. Then if you don't have a store near by, or a neighbor you're comfortable with, then you need to call your mom. I'm sure she'll rush home or at least tell you what to do. Good luck sweetie!|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Find some pads around the house. If u cant find any call your mother. If she cant bring u some i know this is gross but use toilet paper until u can get some pads |`|3135ab19db583d6656692a4eb559d3e9aa	Try to find some pads, or fold some napkins to make a pad.  Don't use tampons your first time.  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Is this your first time? If so then you probably need to call someone to get you some tampons.|`|QbEhdETdaa	Everyone else as said it better except one..... (get a quarter and go to a gas station restroom?)  Try to find a pad or use toilet paper to fold up in your underwear. Call your mom. Also talk to your mom about what type of Pad or Tampon you could use. I've never liked pads myself. There should be tampons for young girls in the store somewhere, that's what I started with when i first used a tampon. |`|vauozgLgaa	It's okay.  Do you have a pad to put on?  If not fold up a wash rag or alot of toilet paper and put in your underwear.  Call your mom and tell her so she can get you pads if you don't have any.  |`|yly8LjEmaa	ummmmmmm wheres your mom? you could use some of your mom she has periods to but if you dont see it call your mom she wont be mad|`|sym8DzH0aa	take a quarter and go to the gas station and buy a tampon.
fPX1lD8uaa	You have some symptoms of pregnancy... sore breasts, missed/late period and being moody.  Either call your doctor to confirm or deny your pregnancy or buy a test and take it first thing in the morning for best results.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|K89qctNWaa	You can not just depend on what you are presently feeling now and missing your period even if you have a regular one coz sometimes our hormone could make a big difference.  I hate to say this to you but if you really wanted to be sure and if you says that your period is over a week now, why not take the test?  No one could actually tell but you.|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	Could be pregnant, could be pms......you wont know till you take a test, even though for some reason you dont want to hear that.  It's the only way to be sure.  You're late, so you should be fine to take one first thing in the morning.|`|O5WberWnaa	thats the only way you are going to know for sure is if you take a test or go to family planning<br>  |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be pregnant. There is no way for us to know. If you had sex then there is always a chance that you are pregnant.

We can't tell over the internet.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You cannot have a definitive answer from any of us without a HPT.  Sure, lots of us had those symptoms, but the symptoms in and of themselves don't prove anything.<br>  <br>  TX Mom<br>  
KozVaTvVaa	 I would say in that amount of time something would have showed up, the test they gave you should have been accurate. The best time to concieve is aprox. 14 days after your last period, give or take. Anytime around days 10- about 16 would be the best time to try. Also, a good idea would be to pick up an ovulation predicter test kit, they can tell you exactly when you are about to ovulate. It took me a whole year to get pregnant with my son, 1st child, I thought there was something wrong with me, until I got the test kit, it was one month after that, so easy to miss that short time. Your pains do not sound like pregnancy syptoms, however, every woman is different. I don't think you would be sick to your stomach yet, anyway, I wasn't until about 3 months into my pregnancies....3 of them, hang in there, I bet it won't be long.....Hope these tips helped....God Bless, and good luck....Isabella :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If they did a blood test and it was negative then chances are you are not pregnant. Sorry|`|ZOIcy74waa	The report does confirm you are not pregnant. Dont lose heart. Hope next month is your month. all the best...you are not alone |`|KlJHZRSiaa	The only way to know for sure would be to have a blood test done. |`|rNYF4pBAaa	have a blood test done and if your not keep trying you will be soon

3YJH0ikfaa	Im not sure in the beginning but I know your last trimester its about a pound a week they say. It really depends on your body too. If your a small person you might gain more than someone with extra weight. Best of luck no worries just enjoy it no matter what your going to have to work it off once the little one gets here.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Everyone gains weight differently, and they all lose it differently too. I wouldn't be concerned as long as your baby is healthy. I gained 60lbs throughout my entire pregnancy and lost 70lbs within two months of having my baby. I wouldn't worry too much about it, just eat healthy and stay active and you'll be fine.|`|MtC3CWZraa	This is the guideline from What to Expect When You’re Expecting:<br>  <br>  2-4 pounds in the first trimester (if any at all)<br>  12-14 pounds in the second (works out to about 1-1.5 pounds/week)<br>  1 pound/week in the 3rd|`|AA10889282	You WILL gain a lot at the end. It'll be baby, placenta, water, etc. The weight youre gaining now is mostly fat. That said if you are eating the foods they want you to and not changing the rest of your diet you will gain weight. I gained a lot at the beginning because having food in my stomach helped with morning sickness. Its hard to keep doctors happy with your weight while pregnant. I gained 40 lbs with my first and 50 with my second and the docs werent very pleased but I had wonderful heathy babies and lost all the weight and then some.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Most of the weight comes in the second and third trimester.  If you're gaining weight now, you might just be eating too much.  Sometimes psychologically, people think pregnancy is an excuse to indulge.  Dont do it.  Eat healthy and try not to put on weight because it will be very hard to take off in the end.|`|mBeGdFO2aa	That's is not too much, she shouldn't be unhappy about that weight gain.  30lbs is an estimate, up to 50lbs is still normal.<br>  <br>  At 25 weeks I had gained 22 lbs, my doctor didn't mention anything about it at all.<br>  Just eat healthy and you'll gain what you need. :)|`|AA11356898	>??|`|JPdTTzXRaa	I'm confused on this topic as well.<br>  <br>  I had no sickness during my first trimester but I lost 17lbs!! My doctor lectured me and lectured me but said it wouldn't matter until my third trimester when you should gain about 3lbs a week.<br>  <br>  I'm 8 months pregnant and have only gained 7 lbs my entire pregnancy. I have lost a total of 23lbs and yet, the baby and I are totally healthy.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry or feel guilty about it, your weight might flux and as long as baby is healthy there shouldn't be an issue.|`|stjT95CEaa	With my first pregnancy I gain 16bls in 7 1/2 months, but from then to the time I gave birth every morning when I got up it felt like I had gain 5bls over night. The last month and a half I put on the weight 25bls. The baby is just growing in length and will gain weight the last 8 weeks of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  At 6 months I still wasn't showing and wearing my regular clothes, I couldn't believe my jeans still fit and then one morning BAM!! There was the belly.<br>  <br>  I have a friend that only gained 12bls the hole pregnancy and had a 7bl baby. Then left the hospital in her old jeans form before her pregnancy. EW WW! lol<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the weight as long as your baby is healthy your okay that is the most important thing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats on the new bundle of joy.|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	You shouldn't gain anything the first trimester really. A few pounds total at the most. But you should shoot for zero.  The bulk of the weight should be in the third trimester. If you keep gaining like that you'll be upset cause you'll have alot more to lose post pregnancy.<br>  <br>  But try and not get upset about it. It happens. Just try and be conscience of what you eat and try and not over do it too much. If you aren't and you are gaining like that it'll slow down. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Hmm. I wonder the same thing about weight. I am 17 weeks and a few weeks ago I was weighed and I had gained 15 lbs. and they wanted me to gain more. But I was also underweight pregnancy.

T0gv52CDaa	I would go with what it said, not what you saw when you pulled it apart, as it isn't meant to work that way.  If you prefer a test with lines, then get one that is intended to be read that way for accurate results.  Personally, I like the digital ones better.|`|ZusC87WBaa	The lines on a digital test are not the same as the lines on a non-digital test.  Pulling it apart and looking at will tell you absolutely nothing.  I think if you read the insert carefully, you will find this stated in there somewhere.|`|kDftsHXjaa	hmm thats weird take another test and use your morning urine! maybe another line test. cvs brand worked for me|`|xTbailtvaa	Those tests aren't made for the human eye.  The digital ones go by color that only like special microscopes can see...something in the test that can read it but not by our eye.  So most of the time it will have two lines but that isn't a positive.

It could also be not showing up because you took the test too soon.  Wait a couple days and repeat it.  |`|29ZL58Xjaa	If there are different results between the two, the only other thing that could do is to take a pregnancy test via a blood test which will show the HCG levels or the human chorionic gonadotrophin levels)|`|xJkYM6V5aa	With a digital test there will always be two lines no matter what.|`|vZjU9Vanaa	When I took a digital test, it came out negative, but the Walmart brand pregnancy test I took had a very faint line on it.  I waited 2 days and took a first response pregnancy test and the second line started filling in right away before I even put the test on the counter for the "waiting period" and I had not used first morning urine. I'm now 34 weeks.  I think you should wait 2 to 3 days and take another test.  I found First Response worked well.  |`|joPJtKemaa	I always used the Clear Blue Digital or the EPT digital never a false response. Always an accurate answer.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would take another test. Even try another brand. If that comes out weird then I would go see your doctor and order a blood test so you know 100%. Good luck!|`|MoogPQExaa	Get a regular old fashion first response pregnancy test. do it first thing in the morning for the best results.|`|QhzwTj4xaa	Get another test, make it one with just the lines and try again!<br>  <br>  Best Wishes

You need to see your OBGYN and if he cannot help then talk to a reproductive endocrinologist. <br>  TTC for a year + indicates some form of infertility. <br>  <br>  It amazes me how people say that they are willing to do anything to have a baby, yet they aren't willing to speak with their doctor.|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Boosting Your Fertility Naturally<br>  <br>  Reproductive Exhaustion: If you have experienced years of hormonal birth control or have never had consistent cycles, you will need to boost your body’s mineral storage in order to regulate or help start your periods again naturally. Start taking a high quality prenatal vitamin and mineral, most often found at a health food store, that contains an abundance of minerals in the formula for the best value for your money and your body. If you are dealing with reproductive exhaustion it can take six months or longer before your fertility returns to normal. Although drugs are available to force your ovulation and periods, if you have not created the platform of health required it will be difficult for your body to avoid miscarriage. Replacing your lost minerals now will help to boost your ability to conceive and carry your baby to full term.<br>  <br>  You can begin to take high quality prenatal vitamins and minerals for 3 to 6 months before conception to boost your fertility naturally. This will help you to avoid birth defects and prevent miscarriage. Your partner can also take high quality prenatal vitamin and minerals to assist in boosting his fertility along with yours. ... more on site below|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I tried to conceive for 2 1/2 years with no luck at all. In June I bought a Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor and found out I was three weeks pregnant on July 16th. If you can afford it I would recommend buying and trying one of them. I did also see a fertility doctor and nothing was wrong with me. Everyone else is right. If you are that concerned it may benefit you if you go see a doctor. However, they will probably tell you not to be concerned until you have been trying for over a year. Good luck|`|eP729T0Qaa	I do agree, you need to go see your OBGYN. They are there to help you! You may have something going on that you would never know was there. Another problem could be your boyfriend. If you were able to already have a child and he has not, he may be the problem. It would be best to have him checked as well!|`|92857a267884473c92ce9f69db690689aa	I feel for you.  ((hugs))  Don't feel alone though, I am in the exact boat you are in.

Ejemplo si vas al kinder y haces tu tarea el fin de semana te llevo al parque ( a algun lugar que le guste o comprale algo peque?o) Tu tienes que esplicarle que el kinder es como un trabajo al igual quel tuyo. Ahora con el problema de comer...se que es dificil pero acostumbrala que tome un jugo antes de irse oh cereal con leche.( se que hay veces que es muy temprano y bueno a nadie se le antoja comer a las 6am) hablale y hasle enterender..si tu no haces esto pues esto pasara...ahora si tu me haces caso pues te premiare. la comunicacion es muy importante.|`|6SkMrrIYaa	aunque ya había estado en la guardería, muchas veces sin importar que sean inquietos o no (tengo dos en casa) al entrar a la escuela tratan de alguna manera llamar tu atención pues si pudieran diría **POR FAVOR ,NO ME DEJES,PUES CADA MA?ANA SE ABRE LA HERIDA DE LA SEPARACIóN** tenle paciencia y comprencion y dejala que disfrute su ni?es(claro todo debe ser reglamentado) hablale con amor y sobre todo abrazala todos los dias,veras que funciona.|`|xmOurF03aa	Hiperactiva<br>  rebelde<br>  asi esta la mia <br>  solo necesitamos paciencia|`|wyCsg3Oeaa	eso es completamente normal amigo<br>  tu no te preocupes or eso<br>  ella es asi porq paso a una nueva etapa<br>  y talvez tu hija es muy imperactiva<br>  no te preocupes<br>  y si tienes razon en no acostumbrarla a ser floja|`|319e2b81fd4f413519a65b931048a603aa	Eso depende de cuanto tu has expuesto a la ni?a a tener mas especialización antes que la pusiese en el kinder? si la respuesta a esta pregunta es si entonces tiene que ver con problemas de que el ni?o esta todavía muy pegada a ti y tienes que alludar la poco a poco a depender menos de ti.|`|Y2wI1Yitaa	Absolutamente normal, ni ni?o aún no va a preescolar, hasta este a?o que entra, pero es el mismo show para llevarlo a la guardería, no quiere desayunar, no quiere siquiera que lo vista, cuando despierta, lo primero que dice es no voy escuela, y al igual que tú batallo mucho para que se duerma, no desesperes, son etapas que finalmente terminan pasando, cada ni?o pasa por diversos procesos adaptativos, y no nos queda sino sufrirlos, ánimo, y tranquila, no le muestres que te irrita porque entonces lo hace con más ganas.

You are suffering from bloat, gas and constipation- try eating more fibre and drinking at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day.  Tingling pain- uterus growing and placenta growing. Dribbling- onset of excessive salvia which can last all pregnancy long and gets worse during the day.  If you can swallow during the day good! Due to hormones and change in digestion. Sore nipples- very very normal.  Breats are growing to allow for milk production.<br>  Good luck |`|Swtvqg8jaa	I don't really know what to say about all that stuff other then most of it is normal....mostly I just wanted to say CONGRATULATIONS!!|`|sbfm5rCAaa	Ahh teh joys of being pregnant. Well congrats on confirming it!!!<br>  <br>  I had pretty much all the same symptoms in my first trimester. I was falling asleep everywhere and no matter how early I went to bed I did not want to wake up!<br>  <br>  The constipation is also a problem. I drank a lot of mango juice and it seemed to help so you could try that? Sore nipples, tender breasts, mild cramping sensations in the uterus, farting, excesss gass and bloating are all good things you get to do while pregnant and no one even blinks at you (ha ha).<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope you don't get any morning sickness. I was lucky there!<br>  <br>  Ask if you have any other questions!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yup I pretty much went through all of that as well. Well except I was sick and my boobs and nipples pain were probably the first things I experienced when I found out I was pregnant. I had really bad gas pain up until I was probably 13 weeksish.

Good luck and congrats!|`|OMTSqrSFaa	i would wait .xx |`|et6tmKakaa	if she didnt say she sa 3 legs your good to go|`|yAVKWvDMaa	If it's a boy on the ultrasound, it's more definite than if it's a girl.  For girls, "it's" so tiny in the beginning, that it could get bigger & show up as a boy.  That's why when my ultra. tech said it's a girl, she gave me a 90% certainty.  I bought alot of neutral colors just in case.  I guess if you can't wait, you could do 4-D ultrasound to see?|`|dC41HNmIaa	I personally think you should wait, I didn't buy any pink or blue until I around 8 months pregnant only after the doctor confirmed my baby was indeed a girl.  I know it's hard but it might save you a lot of money in the end.  <br>  <br>  If you just can't help yourself, make sure to keep your receipts and READ the stores return policies.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes<br>  Stormy|`|XgVSRMl0aa	i would wait but to be on the safe side too, get unisex clothing. just in case they are wrong, my friend had that, they told her that she was having a wee boy and when she gave birth it was a girl so she had to go and take the boys clothes back and get girls clothes! hope this helps.|`|2kVdGc8kaa	No harm buying a cute pink outfit, just save the receipt!

qLkMSEBwaa	Wishing you luck and sharying my story before you make the wrong decsion....Sorry I know it's long<br>  <br>  Many single women, including me raise their kids just fine without a man.  I am a mother of a 15 year old son.  My ex bf, whom I lived with stole EVERYTHING from me!!!!!!!  Depression almost took my sanity the last 6 months, I was a very thin 20 yr old when I met him and doubled my weight in less than the 1st 6 months, nearly tripling it within the first year.  He was king of manipulation...Still is for some people.  He sold the home I paid for out from under my feet...leaving me homeless.  He had been manipulating/brainwashing me since day one.  He actually told me he done me a favor by getting his mom to let me live in their shed, a small shed.  I had to clean her house for that and to shower.  He raped me through out the relationship, but honestly, I was so brainwashed, I just could not hate him.  I was crying myself to sleep and praying for God to kill me in my sleep...I was so miserable.  He raped me even after the brake up, more than once...Just as I was finally moving on with college and a part time job that paid full time and got a place to live...the woman I worked for seen that I was constantly sick..she kept saying, I was pregnant and I said no way because I was told I could not have kids...finally, I agreed to her getting me a pregnancy test.  It was positive...I was certain it was wrong, but called my ex to let hen know..I even still stupidly cared about him and told him not to panic, I'm sure the test is wrong,  I let him know I would be checked the next day.  My sorry ex bf said," let me know when you find out for sure, so I can kill myself!!!!  I was almost 3 months along..my ex and his family done their best to get me to abort my baby.  Even to the point of him threatening to kill himself if I didn't and his sister in law to be trying to get me to fight her and cause me to miscarry...My ex even ripped me off when I was pregnant....my credit is ruined over him.  NEVER ONCE would I have thought for a second to kill the baby I always wanted...I didn't care how it happened!!!!! My pregnancy was very high risk...2 times a week, <br>  I had to do bloodwork, quit college and my job to go on bedrest the last 3 months.  My pregnancy was so high risk my son could have went into shock and died within minutes after he was born...Plus, my ex has a brittle bone disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta...genetic and complications with that as well.  I did exactly what I had to do to save my baby  I have been told by a few Dr.'s, I got lucky because I still can't conceive.  I don't ovulate...I was with my ex 2 yrs and never used protection...But, almost 16 years and NO REGRETS!!!!!! My son is my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's not for me to tell you to get divorced, but I will say, don't punish the baby for the father's sins.  Even if you can get past this and move on...if he wants to be in his other child's life...You can't resent the child...It's not the other baby's fault.  I do wish you luck!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  let me add...if you get back with him, you can not afford him cheating on you...it's not just your heart, there are stds and aids...you can die over his mistakes!!!!!!!!!  Be careful with what you choose to do...|`|v3LnJycKaa	Oh good lord, honey if I were you I would continue with my divorce, and keep my baby... file for child support and custody and leave him.. cheating is one thing continuing to lie for nearly 1 1/2 years (as the baby is 8 months and 10 months of pregnancy) is just unforgivabel to me... |`|8V39PymEaa	You should just let him choose the woman he wants to be with and that was wrong of him and you should either stay with him and take care of both babies with him or tell him how you feel about what he has done and it was wrong of him and put it all on him he made the two kids and you should just make him take care of both of the babies and that would be his punishent and so he knows hat he did was just wronf and not exceptable.|`|8w0786yeaa	What would I do were I in your situation?  I would continue to file for divorce, child custody and child support.  I would never be able to trust him again...despite promises of never cheating again, there would always be a doubt.  I couldn't have a happy marriage living in such doubt.  <br>  <br>  But, that's just me.  I think cheating is the biggest lie someone can commit.  Some people are more trusting, even of cheaters.|`|hswTS1jVaa	I would leave the loser and keep that baby. |`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	Have the baby, dump the cheating hubby.|`|fG7LmB7Kaa	My opinion is that if you loved him enough to marry him that it still may be somewhere in there to forgive and forget. I don't think infidelity is  a good reason to divorce someone (though i would be heartbroken as well if my husband did it to me). I would try my damnedest to make it work. Counseling therapy and maybe this baby is a god send to help you both through this hard time. There are some books that I found that are so amazing you should look into they could help you both. Best of Luck|`|3gEJOhhEaa	I would keep the baby, but i would still divorce the husband. If he cheated once whose to say he won't do it again, do you really want the stress of an unfaithful husband. I know it's easier said than done, but i would say you deserve much much better. <br>  <br>  But do what feels right in your heart, if you believe you can forgive him then it's up to you. |`|Q0xm1Kodaa	First off I would have the baby. Its not its fault that its dad cheated. I would love the baby with all my heart and divorce my husband. Its one thing to cheat but than another to tell you he doesnt want a baby and he has a 8 month year old with someone else. It would be hard for me to trust him again. That what I would do. <br>  <br>  Sorry for this, no one should have to go through it.|`|3C3Mev6maa	I would find out how his visiting arrangements would go with his outside child and lay down the ground rules, you know what those are. Since I love him and if I can trust him again I would take him back letting him know that things would never really be the same cause they won't. But I believe that a kid should grow up with both parents especially so early in life.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	I would go to couple's counseling with him and see if there is a chance of working it out.  I would give it some time to see, not make a rash decision.  <br>  <br>  I would, however, no matter what, expect that he financially helps me with the baby.<br>  |`|rQWMpcTTaa	if i were you i would continue with the divorce. keep the baby lose the husband. marriage is about trust and honesty. not lying and deceiving|`|LeNeinDUaa	it's hard to say what I would do because I am not in that situation, so I don't have all the emotions playing into my decision.<br>  <br>  But, I am going to tell you honestly how I feel at this moment. <br>  I would feel betrayed by my husband. I don't like to be lied to.  But marriage/relationships are hard work. People make mistakes. Try to work things out with him, that is, IF other than one time going astray things have been great. If your relationship is strong and communication is good and you both still love eachother, there is no reason you couldn't work it out with counseling and a lot of effort from BOTH of you. If he is not 100% on board and his eyes are still wandering then it is time to call it quits. Most people that cheat do regret it. Talk rationally to your husband. Ask him to be open and honest about how he feels and if he wants to truly work it out. Set up counseling and see what happens. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, If things have been rough in the relationship overall for the past 4 years, then maybe it is time to call it quits.|`|f579b0f08e2165cfd0555eb0a6a73897aa	This is a very hard question to answer, only you know what's truely in your heart follow it. You can raise a baby on your own, trust me I know I am raising 4. Most times "once a cheater always a cheater". So honestly only you know the right answer to this question. I do believe that quote but there is also this one "people make mistakes". You just have to realize if you stay you will have 2 babies to take care of at times and you cant treat they other baby different because it isnt yours or because your husband cheated on you and the baby is the result.. Its alot to live with either way so good luck on your decision and I wish you well no matter what.|`|et6tmKakaa	I can say i'd do this or do that,but sweetie I can't say .I know your hurt and mad and HAPPY because your finally going to be a mother. Sweetie I feel really bad for you you will be in my prayers.|`|HawrTat3aa	Keep the baby, lose the husband.|`|19408b829bbcdb739358304d6cc5abd1aa	Um. Wow. Tough one. I'm not married. So I can't give you a "been there, done that" answer, just what comes to mind.<br>  He cheated on you. To me, that means "we're done". Seriously. I cannot stand people who think infidelity is no big deal. If he was gonna be unfaithful,he shouldn't have gotten married.<br>  But you're pregnant. And as to what's best for the baby... yes he (?) needs a dad. But does a child really need a father that doesn't want him? <br>  You need to ask yourself some important questions.<br>  Can you ever trust your husband again? Do you want him in your child's life, only a part of it, or not at all (which, honestly is also an option I would not blame you for taking)? Do you love him enough to forgive him? (and bear in mind "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice....")<br>  And what about that second woman? And, most importantly, her daughter. Is he just going to abandon them? His child? What's to say he won't do the same to you? And if he won't abandon them, what's to say his relationship with this woman won't continue behind your back (While he's taking the honorable road, caring for the child and all that.)?<br>  If he'd just cheated on you, even if you were pregnant, it would really be up to how you feel about this, about him. He could have cheated for a thousand reasons.<br>  But it's not that simple, is it? He has a child with another woman. And that, for me, would be the deal breaker. Can you keep him around? Honestly. He not only cheated on you, he had A CHILD. Wasn't even careful enough to prevent that. It just... doesn't seems like he cares much. I know this is only one side of the story, but... He doesn't seem like a good guy. And I, for one, wouldn't want my child growing up with that kind of role model.<br>  Sometimes, love isn't enough. What if in ten years you're still with him and he hasn't changed? Is it what you want your life to be? <br>  I know you asked a question and that I answered by even more questions. I just tried to present them coldly, to help you think, because I don't think you can have a lot of perspective in moments like these.<br>  Good luck, in any case, and I hope you'll make the choice that is right for you.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	If I was in your situation, I would just leave. He obviously didnt care about you before, and just because you both have a baby on the way, that doesnt mean he is going to change. I had an ex who cheated on me for over a year, and i had to decide when enough was enough. Its the hardest thing to finally decide to move on, but just know that this isnt the dark ages. Just because your a single mom does not mean that you are destined to be alone. <br>  <br>  do not get suckered in by your husband. he made a CONSCIOUS decision to cheat on you. hes only sad that he didnt get away with it. <br>  <br>  i hope everything turns out okay and i wish you the best in this difficult situation.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	im sorry but this is what id do ...you really want the baby rite ...if he cheeted on you then im sorry but i say once a cheat always a cheat ..<br>  if you did get back with him then even tho you love him you will never trust him again and then the ralationship will get harder and end up braking down ...just have a think about it he must have cheated on you around 17 monthes ago and no one nos for how long im so sorry but its the truth ....good luck with the baby hope every thing turns out ok for you xxxxx|`|OqtcNg3baa	That's hard because you wont every be sure that he really loves you. But as your pregnant you need help and support from a lot of people and a boyfriend/husband can make it a whole lot easier. But in the long run if it doesn't work out you'll be worse off. I think that I would give him the benefit of the doubt because 4 years is a long time but make sure that your family and friends are supporting you as well. But cheating is really bad and you've got to make sure if you do stay with him to make him understand that he is lucky and what he did is overly bad. xxx|`|XXTalSoFaa	I found out that my bf cheated on me 2 weeks before i found out i was pregnant, so i kinda understand your situation. Although he didn't have a child with the "other woman" it still hurt. We managed to work threw our problems and now we have a 8month old baby girl and are happy as ever. I still think about it, but i also think that if he didn't really love me and want to be with me he would leave. I think people do stupid things sometimes and they don't know how to fix them so they choose not to discus it with the people they love. Good luck with everything!|`|aGLXpKsgaa	I am so sorry. Congrats on your pregnancy though. The question you asked is very difficult. I would be devastated if in the same situation. The only thing I could recommend is counseling. I would try counseling first but I would not retract the divorce papers. You and your husband need to see a marriage/family counselor. You need to see the counselor by yourself and with your husband.  If your husband does not agree to counseling or misses sessions you have your answer. <br>  If he does attend counseling through working out the issues of trust, betrayal, infidelity etc. you will ultimately have to decide if you want to continue being married. Again I would not retract the divorce papers since you usually have to wait 6 months before you can actually get a divorce. Also personally I would not see a church counselor because most preach do not divorce and I believe you need someone who can help you work on both options staying married or divorcing.<br>  Also keep in mind with your hormones changing because of pregnancy at times you will be really emotional. Make sure you are eating well do to the additional stress. Try meditating. I would also  do some journal writing to help you deal with everything.<br>  Good Luck. |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Omg that is horrible. I'm so sorry you have to go through that. Honestly I don't know what I would do. Was your husband the one who confessed to you that he cheated and had a baby or was it the mother of his child? I think that would make a big difference. If my husband did that I think I would be more likely to forgive him if he was the one who felt bad enough to tell me. But if I had to find out from someone else then it would be worse because I would have to wonder if he was ever going to tell me. I think it's really a decision that you have to make yourself. We can tell you what we would do but in the end you are the one stuck with the decision you made. Good luck!|`|jCpcQnmVaa	if i was pregnant and my husband had been cheating on me but wanted to give it a shoot. i would only be willing to if he somehow managed to earn my trust and prove that he did care about me. and even then i would watch my back but being that i'm pregnant i would probably still divorce and start again maybe date him and start again with the promise that he wont do it again. not sure i make sense but there is so much to consider how is your relationship with him and do you trust him cause trust is the most important thing in a relationship
UCRuHz57aa	It sounds as if you are in a really difficult period in your life.  If I were you, I would be scared and confused, too.  Personally, I would not have the abortion, because it is against my values, but I understand that you are scared to have two kids, if you are struggling in your relationship and financially.<br>  <br>  Is there anyone else in your life who would be able to offer advice and support?  If you don't have family, what about friends, or even a women's clinic?  You could probably find community resources to help with your relationship difficulties, being a single mom (if it came to that), and even to help you make ends meet through budgeting or discounts or what have you.<br>  <br>  If you do decide that you cannot bring this child into your family, I would encourage you to let that child be loved by another family.  Contact an adoption or open-adoption office near you.  Having an abortion will not be a magic fix to all your problems.|`|AA12174734	adoption adoption adoption you can find an agencey that has the adoptee pay for the medical bills and pays you money for doing it it will help you get money  also some time the adoptee will let you stay in that babys life<br>  <br>  <br>  money you can use to leave that guy he cheated on you your relationship is sour its time to move on and dont worry about being a single mother there are lots of guys who will take you and treat you and your daughter right <br>  <br>  but dont get an abortion you might feel bad about it after you have it done so try adoption <br>  <br>  there is an agency that will help you get child support they will keep putting him in jail untill he gets a job and starts paying my dad used it to get child support from my mom but i cant remember the name because i could sure use it too  <br>  <br>  i hope i help you|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Don't have an abortion. It is not your baby's fault that you are in this situation. If you can't raise the child then give it to a family who can care for it. There are thousands of couples who can't have children and would love to adopt your child. Please don't murder your baby because of a mistake you made. It isn't right and you will regret it for the rest of your life. |`|T9hKxmGPaa	Honey, do what you think is best for you.. You are going to get biased opinions in this section because over 90% of people want children or are already pregnant. My opinion is do what you think is best for you in this particular situation. Only you know whether you can handle another child or not in the situation you are in now.<br>  <br>  But whatever you choose, be sure that you can live with your decision.<br>  I am sorry that you are going through a rough time, but it will get better.. <br>  <br>  BTW, kick your cheating boyfriend to the curve. Find someone who loves you and wants to be there for you and your daughter.. He is not worth it. You just answered your own question. You cannot trust him, then why stay with him? My personal opinion would be to rid yourself of him, and keep your baby, but that is your decision.. You just need to better yourself for you and the child you already have here.. So that the next time when a situation comes up like this, you will not have to doubt yourself to whether you can raise another child or not. Good Luck honey!|`|dNkDUPsHaa	i am not an advocate for abortion. BUT I am not going try to make you do something you aren't willing to do. The best thing I can tell you is to go through the pregnancy and at the end, decide to adopt the baby out to a loving family that has a good financial support system, or you may even want to keep the baby. Talk to your family about this, maybe they will be a good support system. You never know, just don't kill an innocent life!|`|aItVm3xfaa	I really feel it's up to you. My husband and I where in debt further than we could see, broke as broke could be one child already with no insurance. We ended up pregnant do to some meds I was taking. I told my husband I would abort the baby. He didn't want that though and we moved to another state where he now makes decent money and we are now pregnant with our 3rd baby. So I'm not against abortion and if you choose to do it read up about the side affects like having trouble getting pregnant later when you decide you can handle another baby. Adoption is good and yes you can find people willing to pay all the medical bills, but it might be hard explaining to your daughter where the baby went? My cousin adopted a baby and everyone loves him and we don't think any different of him not being blood related. |`|Wkf0YTKtaa	No abortion.  If you really feel like you cant do it right now, give the baby up for adoption.  Or maybe this pregnancy will bring your relationship closer and things will get better with your boyfriend.  As far as not having a big enough place, there are government programs that will help you.  You need to contact your Health and Human Resources Department or the library if they have an Information and Referral Department.  Good luck.|`|4wKFatHlaa	I don't really believe in abortion, but sweetie, you don't want to be left alone with 2 kids. Also, you will not want it if you can't take care of it. Have an abortion and wait until you are properly ready for a second child.|`|p8UAKfQlaa	why not adoption? there are plenty of women who cant have a child of their own, and here you are having a baby and cant take care of it and want to kill it, give your little one a chance and give the baby to a good home. by the way are you on b/c or anything??|`|16BnjXmkaa	That is a question that only you can answer.  Remember there are a lot of people on here that don't believe in abortions and will tell you not to do it.  This is why it is your choice alone.  What ever your decision is, I wish you the best!|`|sN4jsEouaa	Adoption is a better thing to do. And you never know what could happen in the next 9 months maybe things will change for the better, and you would feel horrible if you killed that baby and then in the end was able to take care of it.|`|H0fXySX9aa	work this out for your self we are all going to say keep the  baby or get the baby adopted,<br>  in my opinion you should keep the baby and just because youdon'tt want to be a single mom does the fetus have to be aborted |`|3Jc9lehTaa	NOOOOO dont have an abortion if the relationship isnt well get you and your daughter your own place and take care of the baby dont get an abortion cause of relationship |`|6PLSInPnaa	Abortion is never the answer....if nothing else..have the baby and give it up for an adoption. The baby is so innocent in all of this. |`|7rcZfi78aa	how about adoption?|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I don't think abortion is ever the answer... in any circumstance. You should really look into adoption.<br>  <br>  And then you should probably stop having sex with a man that you can't trust, especially if you aren't financially ready to accept gift you may be given. <br>  <br>  Please, don't get an abortion. Look at your daughter, who you love.... imagine if you had been selfish enough to kill her when you got pregnant. I would hope that you love her enough not to do that. So please don't do this to your second child. So many women want a child so badly and would give anything to give them a loving home. Good luck in the upcoming weeks, I know this must be emotionally hard... |`|f0q5wgQXaa	No, I don't believe that abortion is the answer. You should either have the baby and keep it or give it up for adoption. It's not fair to your baby that you would abort it. Good luck with this decision.|`|uCUEZj3Jaa	Dont get an Abortion! thats like killing your child now. If you dont want to keep the child then give it up for adoption.|`|4u8ZAXImaa	I pretty much think you are old enough and this shouldn't be an option for you. I am for abortion, as I had one myself, but I was young (16) and dumb, in school, and in an abusive relationship. I am now 23. You have one daughter already, so either woman up and keep this kid, get a real job, and seek government help with your 2nd or put the baby up for adoption. You should know better. For real. I honestly think you need to be mature and responsible about this, and how about get your tubes tied if you don't want any more children? |`|AA11114441	Abortion is definitely not the solution in this situation. Yes, it's a womans right to choose...however that choice needs to be made BEFORE getting pregnant. Getting pregnant isn't an accident or like catching a cold. You knew it was a possiblity before having sex and you chose to have sex with what sounds like a jerk of a guy. That was your choice.<br>  <br>  The real question is what should you do now that you've made your choice. In any case, it's now the childs right to live and you should do everything within your power to ensure that child lives and has a good chance at life. Whether you decide to keep the baby or if you feel the better option is adoption, that's a choice you make as a MOTHER. Doing what is best for your baby and based on what you describe, that may be adoption. In general, if a family adopts, it's because they really want a baby and you can rest assured that they will do what it takes to give the baby a good life.<br>  <br>  That being said, don't give up on yourself either. I know raising 2 kids as a single mom isn't easy, but my mom did it for over 6 years. My father passed away when I was 8 and my sister was 2 (notice the 6 year gap in age...similar to you). To top all that off, my grandfather went off the deep end when my father passed away and blamed my mom. It was not her fault that he went drinking with his buddies and had too much...he died of accute alcohol intoxication (too much alcohol in the body at once). My mom had no family to help take care of us. She worked days while I was in school and paid a babysitter to watch my sister and hired a babysitter to watch us in the evening a couple of nights a week while she went to vo-tech and to become an administrative assistant after finishing that program. She bought us a new home, ensured we had everything we needed such as food and clothing, took us to church and stayed involved in our lives. As a result of her hard work, I'm now a college graduate (the first in either side of my family) and have a great job for a major tech company supporting my wife and son on my income.<br>  <br>  Don't give up. I have faith that you can do it! Start by leaving the jerk and get involved with some type of community organization (church, single mom support group, etc) so that they can give you the support you need as you work through this chapter of your life.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|hR1cZhJBaa	Its your choice... and I know its hard... <br>  It sounds like you really dont need this right now... Pregnant with a guy who cheats and poor... <br>  at the end of the day, its up to you, but think about your existing child as well... how will you cope?   <br>  To be alone with 2 children, and no money or father figure... <br>  If you do abort, leave the man that cheated on you... Please.<br>  Think about your daughter in all this, put her first and the choice will come to you|`|8V39PymEaa	No, don'tt do that put your daughter in a daycare if she's not already in it so you guys can both work some overtime and try to save up money to move out and buy a house with maybe two or three rooms doesnt have to be alot of money and when you do have enough just go for it and dont get an abortion dont kill your baby your baby wants to have a life and if you dont want it put it up for adoption but just dont kil it ok.|`|kxnwKTCLaa	In my oppinion, I wouldn't have an abortion. I would wait. Maybe youo might change your mind after time or maybe you won't. If it turns out you don't want the baby give them up for adoption. There are ALOT of couples out there who cannot have their own children and are looking to adopt. If you find someone early enough to adopt they even might pay for all the expenses. But no one can make up your mind for you, but you. Do what would be best, foryou.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	honestly i hate abortion but in your case i think it's the best thing to do, why you didn't have protected sex? make sure you not far in your pregnancy, please try to call as soon as possible, abortion is not good and you probably will feel really bad after however it's better for your situation! good luck.|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	This is your choice and I really don't think that they people on here, will be supportive. Know one really knows your situation but you. This is a decision that you will have to make....do what is best for you and your family. This is no ones business but your own...good luck to you.|`|KYvlD9o9aa	ok... you need to do some serious self evaluation before you make any serious decisions. it not the baby's fault you had unprotected sex. you could give it up for adoption if you feel you can not provide.|`|e4SflIigaa	I guess you should have thought about that before you opened your legs...<br>  People who aren't ready to have kids should wear a condom or go on birth control, Don't kill an innocent child for your mistakes. You're 27 for pit sakes, why are you still with this idiot who cheated on you,let alone get pregnant by him.?|`|HqVoLzjcaa	At the end of the day it's your decision. I don't beleive in abortions, so I think that if there's a will there's a way. He will never put more on you than you can handle. (Those words motivate me everyday!) So with or without the fathers you can do it. Plus if it's not meant for you to have that baby, you won't. But that's not your decision. Let Him decide. Prayer really works. |`|8w0786yeaa	This is really not the place to ask this.  Women here WANT to have kids.  You are going to get very biased views and you will be as confused, if not more before coming here.  I suggest you think long and hard about what you want to do.  In the end, legally, it's your decision.|`|dq04utMoaa	what the heck is wrong with you?? you should have been on the pill or wrapping it up hello..... have the child and deal with it... from a mother who lost her child at 20 weeks <br>  there are programs that can help you out and about the deat beats it will all come back on them... my ex is one and he is finally doing better after 8 yrs....|`|8s8c3Ptuaa	IM almost lost my baby yesterday and your on her asking should you get an abortion my answer is No !!!<br>  <br>  IM sure you can find a better solution that can suit you and the baby. Adoption seems better or give to family. I would take the baby.|`|9op65iQVaa	God doesn't give you situations he feels you cant handle.  This baby might change your life for the better.  It's your baby and do right by your baby.  Together you guys will make it.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	It's ultimately your decision to make, but i think things always have a way of working out... I'm sure even without your current boyfriend you  will be fine.|`|O5WberWnaa	its not the babys fault!
AA11752996	The best way to get pregnant, once you know your approximate day of ovulation, is to start having intercouse about four days before.  You should do this every other day to give the sperm count time to replensh to full capacity.  In a 28 day cycle with ovulation on the 14th day, that would be Day 11, Day 13, and Day 15.|`|SEcUbBD8aa	it depends on your ovulation schedule.  they have tests you can buy to track your ovulation.|`|J1h955D3aa	You will need to get an ovulation kit and thermometer if that is the case.  Body temperature is key.  Everyone is different with their days.|`|BcEuNor6aa	you are going to have to track your cycles to determine what day(s) are best.  Try tracking on www.fertilityfriend.com<br>  <br>  Karrie|`|OWB0cvXpaa	i would get an ovulation prediciton kit. it measure the LH surge in your urine when you ovulate or right before you ovulate.  it will help you predict which days to do the big baby dance! On average they say around day 14 in your cycle.  But everyone is different so just give it a try.  www.mymonthlycycles.com has a wonderful site to help you and if you go to the products section they have OPK's and Preggo tests for super cheap on there. they are a great site to go through! GL!!|`|3fk6bTMxaa	If you are wishing to conceive, it is important to locate the 8 days that you are fertile during the month. This can easily be done with information that allows you to locate your personal ovulation pattern. <br>  <br>  When your cycle varies it is best to use different methods together to locate your personal ovulation pattern. Your body temperature, first thing in the morning before your feet hit the floor, and using a calendar or chart to track your daily body temperature is one method. You will be looking for a temperature dip and then an immediate rise in body temperature to signal the beginning of your ovulation. Digital basal body thermometers are available for less than $20.00 at your local pharmacy in the family planning section. Free charts are available online at Ovusoft or Cycle Savvy or you can use your monthly calendar. Always mark in the first day of your last period as all methods will use this day to track your ovulation.<br>  <br>  Looking for body signals is one method, during ovulation you may find that you may experience heightened sexual desire, you will have increased discharge and your discharge will be clear instead of cloudy and sticky. Putting the discharge between two fingers will cause it to stretch. You may feel a slight pinching or slight cramping on and off as your egg is released and begins to travel. These changes signal the beginning of your ovulation.<br>  <br>  It is possible to feel the ever changing positioning of your cervix to determine the exact days that your ovulation will be occurring. Your cervix moves up and down like a gate through your cycle. When the position is straight up and open you are ovulating. Diagrams for this at the Justisse Online Guidebook. You can also purchase an ovulation kit to assist in determining your ovulation pattern for the first month or two. Ovulation kits are expensive and are not always sensitive to pick up ovulation. Your body will give you signs of ovulation and fertility as you move through your cycle. Using a few of the methods together  every day will help you to quickly track down your own personal ovulation pattern so that you can have control over your fertility for your entire reproductive life to either create or avoid pregnancy.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You need to have sex two days before you ovulate until the day you ovulate. Buy a fertility monitor. They tell you exactly when you are fertile and when to have sex. They are a little pricey but they work. I only used mine one cycle and it happened. Good luck

7lcHIjDwaa	so u are due around may 25-30th 2009 we are on the same wk11|`|AHOZXa5waa	A midwife will give u a date based on when u tell her the 1st day of ur last period was. A scan will give a date based on the dimensions of the baby such as head circumference and length frm bum to head (dnt include leg length). I have bn given the 9th of Nov as my due date which wld mean i conceived on feb 2nd but i'm pretty sure i conceived on 10th feb but this doesnt change the due date i have bn given. So for me the 1st day of my last period was the 2nd of feb,i know i didnt conceive on that day cos i know i wldnt have sex while on my period so i know the dates are not exact,its in my file as estimated due date....god i hope this makes sense!!! Also i am very small my boyfriend is very tall but the size of baby is determined by my size and body frame for birth so thats not to say he'll always b little like me but i swear he has got long legs like his daddy with the amount of kicking he does!! Just enjoy ur pregnancy,i hate being pregnant but now its nearly over i think i'll miss it cos its such a special experience. Good luck x|`|b10aMPdOaa	Your scan date is approximate, that's why they call it EDD, Estimated Date of Delivery.  On your 20 week scan they will be able to tell more clearly.  As for the dad being tall, ignore that.  My husband is 5ft 11ins, I am 4ft 11ins and I was told I would have a 8 - 9 pound baby. I was also told that I wouldn't go full term, probably 37 - 38 weeks.  Well, 15 days ago I gave birth to a healthy 6 pound 6 ounces baby boy and I was 40+2, so I wouldn't take what they say for granted. Good Luck with your pregnancy|`|Ulkdaardaa	they can always be off by a couple of weeks but usually they go by the last day of your last menstrual cycle  and they also do a measurement with an ultrasound,  I don't think that the father being tall has anything to do with the size of the fetus just yet lol.|`|O5WberWnaa	thats why you go for a scan to determine the babys age.<br>  i went and i was 7wks 3days and my date was 17th april 09 and i went back again when i was 9wks 1day and they changed my date to 20th april 09.<br>  they measure the baby and go by that.<br>  good luck x|`|XHeiEgF1aa	I concieved August 28th, about... and I am 11 weeks and 4 days today.'<br>  <br>  If you had sex on the 22nd... then yes, you could be 11 weeks and 4 days... cause you could have concieved 1-4 days after sex. You have to remember that.|`|kykmpr0Caa	scans go by dates of 40 weeks which in theory is 10 months, as your pregnant for 9 months it is often the case that the parent and doctor will always differ in date . |`|I4q2imT7aa	They go by the LMP and size of the baby because even if you know when you had sex to conceive you don't know when the egg was fertilized and implanted. I know the exact day I "conceived" but I don't know when I ovulated so I don't know when I actually because pregnant because its not an instantaneous thing. That's why the use the LMP and the size of the baby. |`|4267b03363d41760fddf75decfb09e9baa	a scan will tell you the size of the baby, and check the heart is working and that all is fine, the nurse who did your scan will give you an approx date of delivery, some people have smaller babies so the nurse will think you havent gone as far as you think you are, and other babies are bigger so she thinks it is older, they go on an approx birth weight of 8lbs.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Usually they do go by the size of the baby. When you are further along probabaly around 20 weeks they'll do another one and if they were wrong the first time they should get the right date the second time. Your due date can change a few times before you have the baby.

Doctors and counselors and even teachers at school are mandatory reporters, (which means they have no choice, they have to report it.) <br>  <br>  Thats just my opinion though.

You might have to also if your partner is well endowed. |`|gzjWQo1eaa	Completely safe.|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Yes it's fine to have sex during pregnancy!<br>  Unless your doctor tells you not to then its fine!|`|1HTRWrawaa	No problem, go ahead.|`|AjgZhYR8aa	Yes, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. |`|30PegycQaa	You can have sex throughout your whole pregnancy....as long as your doctor hasn't restricted you.|`|oxUYiLKPaa	Heck yeah! My husband and  I never have given up sex. Although now that I am huge I am not into it but he doesn't seem to care!|`|aXESNuBKaa	yes unless you doctor tells you otherwise|`|LPgYKc3Kaa	Make up sex is great, you should be good.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is safe as long as you aren't being rough.|`|Lh5Fzqr2aa	can have intercourse the entire time you are pregnant|`|LeNeinDUaa	yup. safe
qicxk5GMaa	well... I was 10 wks at my first appt.  They couldn't hear the heart beat but they got a few great pictures when they did the vaginal ultrasound.  They also did a pap smear, checked for STD's and did some blood work.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	they will give you a scan and you can see him or her|`|T48smu01aa	i was 8 weeks 2 days at my first appt they asked a bunch of questions then did like a Pap smear then did a vaginal ultra sound I didn't hear the babies heart beat but I saw it sometimes they can't hear it until your about  12 weeks but you can see the baby it looks like a peanut and you can see the legs and arms there nubs but you can see them haha...its soo exciting!! <br>  O and at my first appt I was suppose to be 9 weeks but measured 8 weeks 2 days, but if you have gone already and they told you how far you were then cool, if not you might measure a little later or earlier, just letting you know so you don't get discouraged! <br>  But congrats!!!!!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I had my first visit at 11weeks and they did not listen for the heartbeat.<br>  <br>  I spent about an hour filling out forms and answering questions.  Then I spent another hour repeating everything I had written and spoken with the nurse about to the doctor.  They drew 12 tubes of blood, made me give a urine sample, and did a pap.  Then they did an u/s (probably to see how far along I really was...because we had no clue.)  <br>  <br>  Every doctor and insurance company does things differently.  There really is no telling how yours will go.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Not at the first prenatal visit I didn't hear it. They just mainly asked a lot of family history questions. They may though. I told them that I didn't know when my last period was so that I could get an ultrasound and I heard the heartbeat then and I was 7 weeks 2 days. Good luck|`|sLERr3aAaa	They can detect a heart beat around 10-11 weeks along so it all depends on how far along you are if your able to hear it|`|0ae94159aebb0543d95ea52595c8db2caa	you will be able to hear the heartbeat. I just had my first exam on Monday (I'm 7 weeks) and I heard the heartbeat and it was very moving. |`|7BFnNABfaa	Yes they will measure how far along you are..take blood and check for a heartbeat.
tgsJUSs0aa	No it could mean many things.  If your test comes back neg you need to check with your doc to make sure there is not anything else going on. |`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	No.  Symptoms of pregnancy include a missed period, nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue, sore/sensitive nipples, and having to pee a lot. <br>  <br>  You could have bad gas or at worst an infected appendix.|`|90zcKChJaa	no, it doesn't mean that you are pregnant.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be but I wouldn't just go off of abdominal pain. I didn't start having abdominal pain until about 14 weeks or so. 
WiS5Z7ilaa	My doctor told me that a blood test can give you accurate result 3 days before you miss your periods means 7-8 days after conception.<br>  All the best!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	A blood test confirmed I was pregnant at 3 weeks.|`|jJuJFuK6aa	blood test is 8-10 dpo<br>  <br>  sounds hopeful, hope we both get our bfp|`|IllWKAUGaa	14 DAYS AFTER OVULATION. 19 DAYS AFTER SEX....<br>  <br>  WWW.PEEONASTICK.COM<br>  <br>  sorry bout the caps, it got stuck on!<br>  good luck!!! baby dust!!|`|nTuFIKUAaa	I would assume immediately after a missed period, same as a home PT.

(Presumably you're not putting all your weight on her anyway.  Support your weight with your knees/elbows, and have fun.)|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Yep alll the way up til your water breaks!<br>  <br>  Have fun...|`|tivpa7Vlaa	yes its ok. sex positions depends on the female comforts. if she feel ok doing it that way then y not. u cant squish the baby unless u r laying on her tummy and believe if u squish the baby most likely u will be hurting the mummy also. she will feel pain b4 the baby does|`|zyYv4N7iaa	just don't put your weight on her. Most preg women find it more comfortable on top.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I"m 7mths and I do when ever  we do it|`|GjuRYsITaa	if she can do it then go for it|`|XHeiEgF1aa	It's fine. It might be better if you do girl on top, but its not going to hurt anything. If it ever gets uncomfortable though, just stop and change positions. <br>  <br>  |`|rgujmsMRaa	haha shes heavily padded there... if it is comfy.. have fun while you can =] it is nice not having to worry! plus you won't have much time when the lil one gets here! |`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think as long as you hold yourself up and not putting all of your weight on top of her then you will be fine. 
4ead5dde649b8ca448598942dc4779b4aa	omg! im going through the same thing! i think im havin all kinds of symptoms and i remember with my son i had so many negatives. when i found out i was already almost  2 months. i thought i was having a period but it was implantation. so everything was kinda strange for my whole pregnancy. they thought i was only like 4 weeks. (i had irregular cycles though) so he couldn't go by that. so when i got my first ultrasound because of sack separation they estimated how far along i was. well im getting off subject now, lol <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck sweetie. i wish the best for you. |`|AA11820380	your hgc level could be too low to detect a pregnancy with a home preg. test. go to the dr. and take a blood test.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It may be too early or you may just not be pregnant. I would wait another week and take another early response test. Good luck.|`|87b5VgaOaa	When are you due for your period? If the bleeding was early I say could been implantation just take another test when period is due

Take a test.|`|BARCjDhnaa	You won't have pregnancy symptoms from a week ago so if you are pregnant its from earlier, below are the early signs but the best way to know is still to take a test once you miss a period.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  |`|J8jwhSlLaa	it depends when your last period was? it usually takes 14 days before you egg comes out..but who knows. you might be further along than you think.. take a test|`|3rG4BFN8aa	wait till ur miss period to take a test|`|lIKTD7Rzaa	hate to break it to ya but it only takes one time to get pregnant but i really dont no i think u should go see a doctor or take a preg. test
qygYwdRpaa	Hi yes some cramping is very normal in early pregnancy i cramped like a period pain until i was 13 weeks, try not to worry everything sounds normal <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|EmYNUZcXaa	if they are mild menstrual like cramps, its normal. if they are really painful and last a while, i'd seek your doctor.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	yes as long as they are not bad cramps and they usually feel like slight period cramps.|`|k1cDEnLPaa	If they are low, around where your ovaries are, it is likely ligament stretching pain which is totally normal. It just means your uterus is growing and I had it all through the first trimester. If the pains are severe though, and are sharp and/or last for long periods of time it may be cause for concern.<br>  <br>  Call the doctor to be sure. He/she will know best.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4ztXoIDKaa	Very normal, I had menstral like cramp all through the first trimester.   It's just everything stretching and getting ready for the baby to grow|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	As long as your not experiencing bleeding with them then they should be fine. That's what my doctor told me. |`|p4YX2gc0aa	I had cramps throughout my entire first trimester. It is just your uterus stretching and growing to make room for baby. No worries. Unless you are bleeding, or the cramping is very intense, I wouldnt worry.|`|lm2j8g4oaa	I had the same doc said not to worry unless there was bleeding<br>   and not lift heavy weight.

EmYNUZcXaa	deff don't drink liquor. gingerale, saltine crackers, and any kind of ginger is easy on your stomach and your senses. the ginger is known for relieving nausea. you can get it candied, raw, dried, etc. it worked wonders for me. g'luck, soon it will be all over.|`|faa49a1082ae030ed5d0898cedf76862aa	crackers helped me try those I kept them around my bedside!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I used preggie pops from MOTHERHOOD.

I forget what its called but its pink and it has a pregnant woman on it.

jipqICzVaa	Two of my friends swam every day (one of them in the sea) until the week before they were due. They had quick, relatively pain free births.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Yes you can. You can continue swimming all the way through your pregnancy. But not after your waters break.<br>  <br>  Swimming is great when you are pregnant as it takes a lot of the weight of you and helps relax your body!<br>  <br>  Good luck! xx|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	You can go swimming at any stage, provided you dont drink the chlorinated water... I'm 20 weeks pregnant with twin boys, and i regularly do aqua aerobics and go swimming. Once i conqurered the irrational fear my huge belly would mean me sinking to the bottom, i rather got into it because its about the only place i feel weightless..|`|hdzlWALdaa	yes definately.. u will find it a relief towards the end!<br>  <br>  i tried to keep active throughout my pregnancy and walked every single day but when i got to 7/8 months i felt to heavy duh. plus i had to take it easy cos of blood clots. so i tried the swimming and it helped me so much, especially to take the load off my back. i stayed afloat hehe.<br>  <br>  i didnt race or anything, i just swam slowly. just take it easy and no diving :) other than that ur fine!<br>  n no drinking..<br>  <br>  another thing -- avoid the sun (i used an indoor pool) and no jacuzzi/saunas etc..<br>  <br>  goodluck n congrats :)|`|b10aMPdOaa	Yes, you can go swimming at 8 weeks pregnant.  Just be careful of other people knocking into you.|`|ZQ8GvmZwaa	Of course!!!|`|TrBoPj92aa	yer its really good to swim whilst pregnant<br>  helps the baby <br>  and helps you stay lookin and feeling as good as possible<br>  dont do loads and loads though :)<br>  hope you enjoy your pregnancy :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	As far as I know you can go swimming throughout the entire pregnancy unless your doctor tells you not to.|`|Yx5LTlDwaa	sure u can swim.....<br>  in the pool, ocean, at normal water temperature is fine.<br>  except spa, hot tub, sauna, they're not safe.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	Your pregnant not cripple honey......fine to swim the whole pregnancy I would avoid dive bombing into the water an things as such|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Yes you can but, don't pee in the pool!|`|AA11308841	yes just avoid rough movements in the water|`|awRNr2VMaa	yes just dont drink the water|`|qplUUqf9aa	most definitely It is good exercise.  I swam up to my ninth month and keeping fit makes delivery much much easier.|`|cfa96832d4bc6849f245fc1b2328aa42aa	of course you can why would you think you couldnt your not ill!? <br>  <br>  Swimming is great exercise when pregnant as the water takes the weight of the baby it is very relaxing too. <br>  <br>  good luck with the baby|`|EPpJgMSvaa	yes, whyy not i went swimming at 8 months. the docs don't want you to get in a hot tub when your pegnant though|`|CoXE3uVVaa	sure you can go swimming some people dont even know there pregnant at 8 weeks|`|33b14b7e99d6f8aaa409f58b9bf4fc61aa	yes of course you can|`|iyRWN59Xaa	Yeah, why can't you go swimming?|`|315115b1cbb94858d4295295a077fa7aaa	Yes and only if you know how to swim !|`|79q0EPf1aa	It depends on you if u r fit enough to swim u can swim<br>  |`|XLkTd3iYaa	yes, just take it easy.
3O03pk6kaa	It could be just you stressing out about it. Stress will play a very important role in your periods.|`|t5xnbgKkaa	The rhythm method of birth control, which is only to have intercourse at those times of month when you know that you are not ovulating..just before and just after periods..has given the world many large families. It works for a few lucky women but for most of us it is a case of optimism over experience and anyone trusting in it had better start buying baby clothes! You can get pregnant any time, even if your hormones and cycle are spot on every month..sperm can spend two or even three days getting to the end of their journey, so that has to be figured it; and a thousand other things.stress, a cold, died,and so on,can affect your cycle to some degree or other..you may not even know about it.<br>  You have just about enough time left to take the morning after pill, it is good for about 72 hours after sex, and if you do not want to be pregnant then get yourself to your pharamcist or doctor not and sort out this pill at once.<br>  |`|TeLlekpdaa	"Is it possible?" Of course!<br>  Wait a few more days and take a test.|`|zTaSPXRjaa	having unprotected sex definitely means that there is a high chance of pregnancy. u need to take a test.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think it is too soon to have any type of symptoms. But I'm not sure. I guess it is possible. |`|zcEpnjlRaa	you could be pregnant..... i would do a test .... but wait till your period becomes late, as this sound very early <br>  <br>  xxx|`|5OQLmECTaa	if you had unprotected sex at any point in time....you could be pregnant!!!!!!!!|`|oVTLiucpaa	Of course you could be pregnant.  There is always a chance to get pregnant even when using protection, so being unprotected two times definitely makes your chances higher.  Go to planned parenthood or buy a home pregnancy test to find out.  Good luck!|`|bxkcItKlaa	I wouldnt think you were pregnant. Maybe your period is just late because you think something is wrong. I would go see the doctor.
ubkt5RQiaa	Maybe you ovulated at an off time and that is why your dates are off.  The first time I was pregnant, I had my LMP July 4th and my conception date based on ultrasound turned out to be at the end of August!  I wouldn't worry about it, and Dec 15th will come up in no time.  Congrats and good luck!|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Yep totally normal, you might have ovulated later.|`|15UZwW2laa	Well in the beginning for me the doctors told me I was 6 weeks along and then later I was told that I was only 4 weeks.  I go for my ultrasound on Dec. 10th!  That's when they are going to give me my accurate due date.  So you probably just ovulated later, they can't always go by your LMP.  They go by the size of the baby.|`|5OuDKVKJaa	Awesome and congrats!! Now u really need to calm down,the stressing out is not good for the baby or u!! So just relax,enjoy the pregnancy u have been trying for and stock up on diapers!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm sure it is. Everything will be fine. You just might not be as far as you though. All that matters is that you're going to be a mommy! YAY. Congrats!
g8AYh6YCaa	i had very very very sore boobs that lasted alot longer than usuall, i also felt very crampy that lasted for a few days...i believe i the symptoms started for me about a week before my period..<br>  <br>  i remember sobbing to my partner saying that i think im pregnant,he told me i wasnt and not to worry, low and behold!!!!<br>  im due in 5 weeks time lol<br>  <br>  good luck i took a clear blue digital test 5 days before i was due and it told me "pregnant" lol i nearly fell off the toilet seat lol<br>  |`|7uuEU5HFaa	about a week after conception for me my nipples would tingle &; itch. I also experienced light headachs &; increased saliva.<br>  i also got a positive preggo test 4 days before my missed period from a doctor.|`|tSZFmmnXaa	Was 2 weeks after for me.|`|AA11461992	I had sore breasts almost immediately after conception, and was VERY tired as well. Of course I didn't realize why yet, but they started a few days after I got pregnant. <br>  <br>  Every woman is different, but you know your body best. Some of the new tests are VERY sensitive, and can be taken before a missed period. Go to the store and read the boxes, because they are all different as to when you should test. Obviously the safest is to wait till a missed period, but trust me, I understand how you want to know NOW!! :)<br>  <br>   If you think you might be pregnant you may want to take some folic acid starting now, and no drinking/smoking until you find out for sure! Good luck to you and (maybe) congrats! |`|MtC3CWZraa	No one can really know when conception happens because it's not reliably the day you were intimate. I had a sense that I was pregnant 28 days after my last period, and got a positive test result that day, two days before my AF was due. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say I had any symptoms though. I felt normal. I just had a feeling I was pregnant. |`|eVTsGsCWaa	Buy a test with two in the box take one a few days after your missed period then another a week or so after.
yrDqtazLaa	No, you can't drink alcohol when you're pregnant, have you ever heard of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome? Your child can come out deformed and have mental disabilities.|`|vpL67nETaa	They have not determined how much alcohol is tolerable while pregnant, so they advise you to avoid it all together.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's only 9 months.<br>  You'll live without it.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	They do say you shouldn't have any at all but I'm sure you already know this. It's your personal choice but I'd say a glass rather than a bottle if you really do want some wine but don't make it a regular thing. I know someone who drank like a fish when she was pregnant and although her baby was fine I wouldn't say it was a smart thing to do and apart from that it looks dreadful if you're out in a bar with a pint in your hand whilst obviously pregnant.|`|sIQzny5Taa	Umm, most doctors recommend against drinking any alcohol but red wine is actually good for you and some doctors will say it's ok to have a very small amount during pregnancy. I think a small glass is the limit. But ONLY red wine. To be safe I probably would just not drink any, but I know red wine is ok in a very small amount, but they still recommend against it just to be safe, because nothing is certain and everything affects babies differently. Fetal alcohol syndrome is only from drinking a lot and you won't get it from one glass, but that one glass could affect something else, so to be safe I would pass until after the birth. Good luck.<br>  <br>  FYI I've asked my doctor about this and my grandmother asked her doctor as well for a different reason and both said the same thing but you should ask your own doctor for the best advice.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	That's for you to discuss with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Personally, I wouldn't risk putting ANY alcohol in my body while I have a fragile baby developing.<br>  <br>  And maybe you should chill out on the drinking..."allowed."|`|AA11787590	Alot of Dr. recommend no drinking period while pregnant. If you want to have a little wine then i suggest calling your Dr. so you can get the answer straight from them. Good luck.|`|hHODbj3maa	NO! stay away from any alcohol beverages, even if its a little sip can put your baby at risk for problems,Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause a number of birth defects, ranging from mild to severe. These include mental retardation; learning, emotional and behavioral problems; and defects involving the heart, face and other organs. The term "fetal alcohol spectrum disorder" is used to describe the many problems associated with exposure to alcohol before birth. The most severe of these is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a combination of physical and mental birth defects.Consuming alcohol during pregnancy also increases the risk of miscarriage, low birthweight (less than 5 1/2 pounds) and stillbirth. its worse and has more of an effect in the first trimester (first 3 months of pregnancy). i would suggest no alcohol or caffiene beverages during your pregnancy. put the wine on hold. im sure it can wait a full 40 weeks for the health of your child.|`|DWzPKmHBaa	You can drink when you are pregnant when i was pregnant i had about 3 glass a week and my baby was fine. if your worried about it just talk to you doctor or midwife about it.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I've been told to not even have medicine with alcohol in it because they are unsure about how much alcohol can harm your baby. Why risk it? Wait until the baby is born and then have a glass of wine. |`|eTxh2So7aa	are you saying you're loud when you're pregnant or when you're drunk?
J2dAHzACaa	Stress can cause your period to be late so the more you stress the longer it will be before it returns.  Try a pregnancy test just to be sure and if you are still worried then see your doctor.  It doesnt sound like you are pregnant but better to be safe than sorry.  Dont stress :)|`|kG6VWsGvaa	There is no form of birth control that is 100%, so there is a very slim chance that you could be pregnant. There might have been a hole in the condom that wasn't detectable by the human eye. Things like that happen, but they are very rare. I'm sure your period is being delayed because of your stress. Just calm down and it'll come. However, if time goes on without one, simply take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  No, having sex for the first time itself does not delay your period.|`|sYsfI856aa	Many girls I know didn't get their period for a few months after having sex for the first time. It can be a "shock" to the body to have something new like that. My sister and my mother both had that happen after their first times. Also stressing out about it can also cause you to be late or miss.  You should be safe with using the condoms and him not finishing, BUT you should get yourself on some birth control now that you are sexually active. Be careful, be safe, and if you are comfortable with it, talk to you mom a bit about sex. I spoke to mine at your age, and she helped me learn the safest things I needed to know.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	First of all just because he didn't *** and the condom didn't break doesn't mean that you can't get pregnant. There is such thing as precum and you can get pregnant from it. I'm sure that you're not pregnant because the chances are slim but just know that the only way to prevent pregnancy 100% is to not have sex until you're ready for it. |`|AtVRWrwCaa	If you are stressed out your period may become late. Just try to relax and not worry about it. If you are still concerned in a few days, take a test. No harm in checking right?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1qnbvUYPaa	Your not pregnant, you 16 so your periods may still be irregular...your also stressed out, relax it'll come.|`|fojjX1X7aa	For the record, stress may only delay ovulation... not keep a period from starting after ovulation has occurred.  However, if ovulation is late, then the next period will be late too, since the luteal phase (the time between ovulation and the start of the next period) is roughly the same month to month.  <br>  <br>  So stress before ovulation = possible late period due to stress.  Stress after ovulation = has no effect.  Just wanted to clear that up. ;)<br>  <br>  That said, I seriously doubt you are pregnant.  You know, it seems to me I was late the first month I started having sex.  I think a lot of girls are, and I don't think it's stress.  I think it's a hormonal reaction, but that's just my non-professional opinion, lol. <br>  <br>  If you are very worried, take a test.  It would show positive by now if you are pregnant.  And if it's negative, you can relax.  :)<br>  |`|ba45b75aff55765f7d4f58c6296acd7aaa	Dont even worry about it. Srsly i just had sex for the second time today and yea. Really dont worry about it. If the condom didnt break there is no reason to worry. And if you are late its mostly because you where stressed. Dont worry you'll be ok.<br>  <br>  P.s i just got off my period yesterday and i was late. I thought i was preggers but i am not so WOOT.  <br>  <br>  Just be carefull.<br>  HAVE FUn,<br>  Be safe |`|gqk70AfGaa	Well you shouldn't worry about it, since its 3 days. but sometimes it may delay due to stress..... but you can still have your period and be pregnant as well. but you shouldn't be pregnant if he didn't *** and if he used the condom correctly !|`|OqUg7pGOaa	It is most likely your period is late because you are worried/stressing. If you are 100% certain the condom didnt break, I'm sure you will be fine. And a BIG congratulations for using protection & being careful on your first time. |`|8gNWEKg0aa	Calm down. You worry to much. Your first time should be a pleasure that you will remember until the rest of your life. It'll come in a couple of days.|`|35yKplz5aa	Even stress can effect ur period . But to be the safe side , after a week buy a pregnancy test. And id recommend birth-control pills if u continue to have regular sex with ur bf . <br>  <br>  All the best for u|`|jYcazm9Paa	Yeah you might be overreacting but its better to be safe then sorry. If in doubt take a HPT. |`|E5VPjSXLaa	Its Probably just stress! 
222b275605b13f67cc62d39dde66821baa	Wow...you haven't had your period in two months and THIS is where you go for the tough questions huh?  Take a pregnancy test and/or go see a doctor whether you are pregnant or not you need to see a doctor...having unprotected sex and no period for over two months can be any number of serious things...|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Get your shoes on.  Go to the store and buy a pregnancy test to see if you are or not.  Either way you need to see a doctor on that!|`|DTPfhl7Eaa	Go and buy a pregnancy testing kit pronto!|`|mjhPteRYaa	It is very possible you could be pregnant, you should definitely take a test or see your doctor. In the meantime, try not to do anything harmful to your body that may endanger a baby, if there is one.|`|AA10015577	If I were you, by now I would have tested.  Take a test and if it's negative, I advise you to see a doctor.  Good luck!|`|ukwEzumdaa	why havent you taken a pregnancy test yet?<br>  <br>  ...TAKE ONE!!!!|`|mNh89pN8aa	It sounds like you could be.  The best thing to do is take a test.  If it come out negative you might want to see a doctor if you are still having lower stomach pains and you still don't have your period|`|YuA7a08Maa	It definitely sounds like you might be.  Take a test to find out.  If you're not, get yourself to a doctor to find out what's going on.  A test would be very accurate by now.|`|bb71fa5d33b67c8d52e5b8aca13770e2aa	Come on now.

If you are, call your doctor so they can give you advice and let you know when they want to see you.  You don't want to delay prenatal care if you are going to have the baby.  <br>  <br>  If you aren't pregnant, I would still call your doctor and make an appointment to find out what is going on with you. |`|I72GsQOFaa	i have pains in my lower stomach too, and im just as confuzzed as you are,<br>  <br>  im planning to see the doctor you should too :) i know every one gives the obvious answer sometimes you wish some one on here would be able to diagnose you straight off lol :) <br>  good luck x|`|oV6eejqPaa	i think you are, and if your having lower stomach pains it could be something serious.

3RFu4W38aa	I didn't feel my baby move until week 21. Most people feel the movements between weeks 16 and 22, so there's a good window there. You still have plenty of time for her to get started, don't worry.|`|HKEywfRkaa	Don't worry. I didn't feel my first baby move until I was just over 19 weeks. I hate it when people tell us stuff about what to expect in pregnancy when really, it's different for everyone and you will feel different things at different times to them.<br>  I did feel little flutters occasionally but the first time I felt him, it was a proper kick. Soft, but definite. I also didn't feel it again for a day or so. Your baby will get stronger and you will feel it soon enough. Then you'll be wishing it stayed still! :-) Haha! Good luck with it and enjoy it!|`|6RR9jaxZaa	you wont notice a lot of movement. usually just a tiny kick or something. i questioned my movements a lot at first, but once you start feeling them regularly you'll realize the baby has been moving longer than you thought!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|53cc150ebe0f38cfe19970c41015246daa	I didn't feel my daughter move until 22 weeks and it was an obvious kick!  It's just different for everybody.  Some women don't feel anything until 26 weeks and everything's fine. |`|QrZcKRsDaa	I'm 22 weeks and I've only felt a lot of kicking, not a lot of actual moving...unless I just haven't paid enough attention, but like people say, you'll KNOW when he/she moves!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You will be able to tell. I first felt my flutters around 18 weeks and I also am pregnant with my first. |`|LzwghKMOaa	To be HONEST, it feels like my baby was boxing someone in me the whole time. It does not feel like "butterflies" to me|`|WBV16h9jaa	I first felt movement at 20 weeks.  It's the coolest thing!!!|`|KUsyxicwaa	youll know it feels like a butterfly|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It all depends on the baby's position. Most first time women can feel the baby anywhere from 16-22 weeks or so but it just depends. If the placenta is attached anteriorally (in the front), then you might not feel movement until a little later. |`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no average person doesn't feel the first until about 20 weeks or so- you'll know it. you're fine|`|Coc593Ikaa	"Most people" lied to you. It is unlikely for you to feel the baby now, especially since it is your irst. Give it a few weeks. You have nothing to worry about. As the other anwerers say, it should be more around 20ish weeks.|`|QvQmeUKhaa	I had a baby 7 weeks ago and I didn't feel the baby move until 20 weeks.  Some babies are more active than others.  Don't worry, you'll know when it happens.|`|8RfmosODaa	You'll know! You'll probably be feeling it soon. It's really light at first but it's the most amazing feeling in the world!|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Don't stress, lots of people will tell you different things but it varies for every person and for me I only felt the occasional butterfly type feeling at around 18 weeks but I didn't actually feel strong movement until 21 weeks. I am pregnant with my first too =] When you do feel kicks you will be overcome with happiness but it is also such a strange feeling and nobody ever tells you that you may or may not like the actual feeling.. I know that sounds funny and I love knowing my baby is moving etc but it is the weirdest feeling I have ever felt lol. <br>  <br>  All the best xx 
H74F8jxuaa	12-48 hours.  Most tests have different lengths of when you can conceive, but the rule of thumb is to have sex the next two or three days.  You have such a small window of opportunity, so I would say 24-36 hours after you get the positive, then you should have sex.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	I think its somewhere between 12-48 hours. I am not positive thooo!!! It might say on the box somewhere tho!!! good luckk!!!|`|6d75ad8cf0574b4b06e7c2f514178171aa	That really depends on when you caught your serge. If I'm not mistaken you ovulate 24 hours after you get your positive reading. You should have had sex yesterday, today and tomorrow to cover your bases. Hope that helps|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would say the day you get the positive then make sure you have sex that day. It will probably be too late the next day. Good luck!|`|mhj4bEV0aa	ur fertile for about 48hrs. but u may have tested in the last 4 of those!
1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.<br>  I think Dr's are more qualified than the average or below average person. I'll stick with the Dr.|`|yZ8fv8ozaa	NO !!! I do not care what these women who do smoke while pregnant have to say for themselves!! "my doctor told me not to quit cause it will cause stress to me and the baby", "my doc said just to cut back" "i smoked all through pregnancy and my baby turned out fine" bull , bull bull!!!<br>  <br>  If you are a smoker and want to have a baby QUIT before you try to get pregnant!! If you accidently got pregnant then QUIT, if you find it difficult to quit cut back to 2 a day then to one a day.<br>  <br>  I AM a smoker, I quit with all 3 pregnancies!! With the knowledge we have these days about smoking and pregnancy and the risks it cause to an unborn baby there is absolutely NO excuse to smoke while pregnant and if you people who do smoke while pregnant think that your excuse for doing so is a plausable one then you need a kick to the head to put your brains back in!!!|`|NWSnWiYXaa	I didn't know there was a law saying they couldn't.  It's a bad health decision in general and even worse for a child.  Pregnant women are advised not to smoke and they shouldn't.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Nope! You are harming your baby & your self when you smoke. Your baby didnt ask for that & doesnt deserve that!|`|m49GT5Xiaa	no but how would they stop it? People are going to do what they want to do anyways. Which is sad...just for their selfish pleasure..|`|VHRqb4KZaa	nonononononononononono<br>  is dangerous|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	im going to say this again....their life...their baby...they can dow hat they please....why do u guys care what other ppl do anyways,,,|`|5QDcpmGpaa	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TrkPeyDTaa	You mean like should there be a law that pregnant women cannot smoke? I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Women are free to choose what they want to do. I think most smokers do a good job cutting way back when pregnant. If a woman smokes heavily during pregnancy, her child is probably screwed in more ways than that one. To disregard the warnings and blatantly endanger your own child's health doesn't bode well for its future.|`|Arb9IOs5aa	OMG are all you lot from planet perfect or what..!!!!!!!!!!!!. Its up to the inividual and their choice as to whether they smoke or not. And what right do any of you have to tell pregnant women they shouldnt be allowed to. And if the do they want a kick in the head, u all need to get a grip on how life actually is and stop pretending you and your lives are perfect...........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|PtkRQeZfaa	Absolutely not! In fact I always voice my opinion to pregnant women who I see smoking. There is no excuse! I quit with both my babies. You wouldn't put your new born in a choke hold, what the hell is the difference? It also makes me mad whenever I see parents driving around smoking with their kids in the car. Why not just hand them the cigarette!|`|4KdcmVYJaa	Should women be allowed to have abortions????<br>  <br>  Seriously....I have always wondered how woman can be pro choice and think smoking while pregnant is a crime!!<br>  <br>  I don't think that smoking is good.. It ups your chances for problems.|`|3rda58OCaa	No, smoking is very unhealthy for the baby!  It can make the baby have a low-birth weight, higher rate of preterm labor, and premature/low-birth weight babies have higher risk of medical problems.  Smoking also unhealthy for mom-to-be!|`|Io6zcKP3aa	Everyone has a choice of whether or not you should smoke but it isn't healthy for the fetus.  After the baby is born then they are more likely to have health problems.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Are you serious? NO... Smoking is bad for you child and can cause serious damage and can actually kill your child. Why would anyone think it would be alright to smoke while pregnant|`|EC8Q1XZQaa	Only if they could be allowed to Drink during pregnancy..they are doing the same amount of damage to the unborn baby and their self.|`|OSDfODkNaa	no and if they have an addiction they should go to rehab or have their baby taken away so they no they deserve to be punished|`|0aecoqSZaa	It's not something that should be "allowed" or not, but "chosen" not to do it.|`|kkzLOFkiaa	Never. It is irresponsible. It could hurt the baby.|`|u1lcZZYfaa	NO! first of all its bad for the woman....and secondly it could hurt the baby...|`|EgZz6EK9aa	they are allowed but it's very bad for the baby if they do|`|4PPRsXpjaa	noooooo|`|czVkP9RZaa	no|`|H0fXySX9aa	no they should not but how would we ever enforce it|`|9ZN1pyFOaa	they shud either cut down or try and quit because its not healthy for the baby|`|bvX8ycVzaa	A better question would be do you have the right to judge someone else for their choice. Smoking is far better for a baby then say drinking, doing drugs, or having an abortion. You can have your opinion but honestly you cant push your beliefs on someone else no matter what they are, people have the right to make their own choices with what they do.|`|198a20dc746be07d1a84a32346a3eab9aa	Everybody has a right to their opinion but it is not our place to "allow" pregnant women to smoke or not. Should we "allow" women with gestational diabetes to eat pasta or other foods which raise their sugar levels? That is even more dangerous for a woman and her unborn child. Should we allow pregnant women to live in cities with horrible air pollution? That is just as bad as cigarette smoke. Or should we allow pregnant women to live with their smoker husbands?<br>  <br>  Why don't we just take it upon ourselves to take every pregnant woman and put them all in a little plastic bubble and then regulate what they eat and drink, how much sleep they get, how hot the water is that they bathe in (because, if it is too hot, it could cause brain damage to the baby), etc. I mean, really, why should they have the right to make any choices for themselves based on their own personal situation?<br>  <br>  Sometimes, people can be so judgmental when they don't even know what they are talking about. Each person is different, each situation is different. Most importantly, it is none of your business. Get a life people and worry about your own stuff. Trust me, you aren't perfect either and a very close inspection of your lifestyle could reveal some pretty unsavory things about you too. Get of your high horse already.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Yes of course they have to be allowed. They should be told the risks if they don't know them already, but ultimately its their choice if they want to smoke then they can just as pregnant women can take drugs and pregnant women can eat 5000 calories a day and get gestational diabetes.  You can't take away a persons right to do as they wish even if that seems a bad choice to the majority of sensible people.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Well technically I believe there is no law stopping pregnant women from smoking, but if you want to do what's right for both you and the baby, then the wise thing to do would to not smoke. It causes so many health problems it's ridiculous: Premature birth; low birth weight, asthma, lung developmental problems, etc. I don't know why any woman would do that intentionally.|`|IWinNj2saa	Should people who get pregnant be allowed to have abortions? Come on, what kind of question is that. Should people who drive be allowed to drink?
HVxinjHTaa	thye best thing is either belly bands or tie a rubber band bettween the button of your pant <br>  <br>  <br>  The rubber band is a common tool used by pregnant women. The runner band is wrapped around the button hole to create a loop. This loop is then used to hold the button. This keeps the pants "buttoned" without actually using the normal buttonhole. This allows the expasion you need. In a few weeks, you may need to be more drastic though<br>  <br>  4After the rubber band trick is no longer working, you may be able to continue to wear your pants by unzipping them. Leaving them unzipped will allow for several more inches of room for your growing belly. Of course leaving your pants unzipped is a bit embarrassing, so here is your next trick! <br>  Step5Belly bands are used to cover your unbuttoned and unzipped pants. They can be purchased online or in maternity stores and come in several colors and styles. They are quite simple to use. You place the band over your pants and pull your shirt down. This creates a layered effect. The band will appear to be a shirt under your top shirt - thus a layered appearance. The band will stay in place as it is stretchy. With the many styles and colors available, you can create a look just for you!|`|MtC3CWZraa	Bella Bands www.ingridandisabel.com/  That’s what I did at this stage. It’s a band that holds up your pants so you can wear them unbuttoned. It sounds bizarre, but it works. They’re also helpful when you hit that awkward stage of fitting into neither your old clothes nor maternity. They'll help hold up too-big maternity pants. <br>  <br>  I also found some pants at Motherhood Maternity that were really stretchy polyester (not something I would normally wear!!) with an elastic waist. They didn’t have any sort of regular maternity panel though. I found that those fit no matter what stage I was at.|`|ZErpLwQUaa	alot of the stores online are starting to sell some bands that connect from one side of the pants to the other side. <br>  you can search Pregnancy bands on yahoo or go to <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/search/176-8436233-2169157?ie=UTF8&ref=tgt%5Fadv%5FXSJH1060&afid=yahoosspslp&lnm=pregnancy%20bands&field-keywords=pregnancy%20bands" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/gp/search/176-8436...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this one is from target|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Either a belly band or you could buy black sweat pants that don't look like sweats.

Sometimes a period just skips a week. It doesn't get consistant until you're in your mid 20's. There's not much you can do. If she's not pregnant you might want to think about other more accurate birth control options in addition to the condom.|`|jhNUuz0maa	Its not what she can do, its what you can do, go buy her a pregnancy test and see if it comes up positive.

vJ0j5rRLaa	I would go down to your local state building, there you can apply for medical assistance.  You could be approved for only pregnancy related appointments, depending on your qualifications.  If you get denied because of too much money, the hospital has a program where you can pay little to nothing on the hospital stay.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Apply for medicaid. =]|`|PLK1p8cUaa	Depending on the state you live in you need to apply for your states health insurance.   Since you are already pregnant you will be given priority so you can see a doctor as soon as possible.  Don't wait to apply for the health of your baby.  Good luck.|`|xszqbAFXaa	Go to the Department of Social Services and ask about Medicaid help. If you qualify it will pay for your doctor visits, delivery of the baby and your six week check up. You can also get medicaid for the baby too -for doctors appointments.  I'm not sure of your money situation,but if you cannot get Medicaid ask someone there about other ways to get that help. You can also try to get WIC which helps you get milk, eggs, cheese and juice so that you can eat healthy ( usually stops about 3 months after the baby is born- for you) You can also get Wic for the baby that will take care of formula for a while then include cereal and juice. I don't want to use Social Services for lots of things, but when it comes to pregnancy and my baby ( and the one thats on the way -second and last-) I definatly go to them.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Go up to your social services office and apply for Medi-caid, and if you meet the income guidelines you will get approved and all you have to do is call around and ask each doc if they accept the type of insurance you have.

I know that getting insurance after you are pregnant in CA is very expensive-- $500+/mo for a PPO and more for the HMO. I would look into state health plans in your state. Usually the health department provides adequate prenatal care for uninsured mothers who meet certain financial requirements. Congratulations and good luck!|`|751ac32b39470e8511f8fed44f440f28aa	Depending on your income, you *may* qualify for Medicaid. I would check into that first. Many insurances don't cover pregnancy after you are pregnant so you end up having to pay out of pocket. I would check into Medicaid and if you qualify that is the best route to go at this point. Otherwise you can look into individual policies that might cover some of it. <br>  <br>  Other than that I would find a doctor that is willing to put you on a payment plan and start making monthly payment each month before your baby is born. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MDTgUDnUaa	Apply for your state's medicaid or medi-cal program.

Have her get on some form of birth control.|`|APrvPTsNaa	Any day, as long as you want to be a daddy.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	any day if you want her to fall pregnant, no day if safe if not usually it is 14 days before the start of your next period you ovulate but this isn't for definite a women can ovulate at any time or even twice a month so if you don't want a baby USE PROTECTION!!!|`|rsrBUSJ6aa	dude dont even try to do sex during thosse days, coz a women passes through great pain during that period and what comes out is all waste from the body of a woman so u better control your self for your and her safety otherwise you might face great problems|`|UQ0PoEfAaa	if she has regular period then her ovulation date should be regular, mine is 14 days after the 1st day of my period, get ovulation test stick like a pg stick from ebay, boots, basically it detects when she's ovulating so she can avoid sex.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you're trying to avoid getting her pregnant then I do want to let you know that every woman is different and can ovulate at different times.

miPubuDYaa	LOL. Starting to grow up and mature at 15... Thats funny<br>  <br>  I had a my first child at 21. I had support from my family and it was the hardest thing that has ever happen to me. I had to leave college, get a full time job working in Manhattan. I would kiss my daughter good-bye at 5:15am and would not get home until 5:45pm. When i finally got our first apt when i was 22. I lost my job and had to work for minium wage at a retail store, used up all my savings to pay the bills. And tried to go back to college. After another 1.5-2 years i got my associates degree.  My daughter is 7 now an i'm still not financially secure.<br>  <br>  Trust me. Wait until you are 23+, have a college dergree and can support an infant on your own  to have a baby|`|FXCoGD44aa	It isn't wrong to WANT a kid at your age.<br>  <br>  But I would say it would be wrong to act on these impulses and actually get yourself pregnant. Mature or not, at 15 you do not have the means to really support this child and give it the best life it deserves. Having a baby just because you "want" one now would be SELFISH.<br>  <br>  Wait. You have to be one before you can be two, and you have to be two before you can be three.|`|DutTBV3caa	i think so. you may think you're mature enough to handle the situation but youre not. even IF you were, you're not even old enough to get a job. how are you supposed to support another human being? most people my age (20) and older aren't mature enough to have a baby so i'm sorry but i dont see a 15year old being mature enough. <br>  also, i wanted a baby more then anything when i was younger but i knew i couldnt handle it. i got married a few months ago to a great guy and we got pregnant by mistake. now i'm having worries that i'll mess up this child some how. <br>  once you get pregnant you see if a lot differently then when you're younger and just imaging having a baby. <br>  just hold off for a bit ok?|`|QikvnTnqaa	And you are "stating to grow up and mature" I don't think your ready. A baby will cost you hundreds a month. And  your mom (or legal guardian) will be the one "stuck" with watching him/her. <br>  <br>  Some teens have a baby that young...and I've only seen one person who actaully is doing ok financailly (sort of) right now. She is now 19/20 and is just now going to college. Having her kid has made her put off her plans. <br>  <br>  I will be honest. I wanted a kid at 16. But there was no way my parents would let me "keep it." So I waited. By the time I was 18 (able to leave the house) I realize there is no way I would be in college right now. Now way I would  have my car. No way I would be as "set" as I am now. I do plan on having kids. I would love one now. But I couldn't give my child what I want to be able to give them right now.<br>  <br>  I would wait. Plus, if I  guy truely loves you for YOU. He will wait. I made my (now) fiancee wait almost 2 years. His friends gave him sh*t. But I wanted to wait and he respected that. Wait tell you find a guy like that. Then MAYBE (depending on how old you two are) start thinking about kids. Definitely make him wait. If he can keep it in his pants and respect you. Then he's worth something.|`|4NcshCDvaa	I dont think it is okay to even have sex at 15. <br>  <br>  But sometimes things happen and at 15 people do have sex. <br>  <br>  If you have sex and "accidently" (hate saying that because sex was made for pregnancy) get pregnant...I think you should have the baby. And if there is no way to keep the baby at home with you...go for adoption.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	starting to grow up and mature does NOT mean you are ready for a baby. how are you supposed to support a baby? how would you go to school and work? who's going to watch your baby? i mean you are still a kid yourself. god grow up first have a life.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It would be wrong to bring a child into the world on purpose when you are still a child yourself. First of all I doubt you have a job and if you do I doubt you're making that much so it's a lot harder to support the child. Also, you should be in a serious committed relationship like marriage before you go having children. You're so young and even if you do have a boyfriend you never know how long your relationship will last. I think it would be best to wait until you are an adult and are graduated from school and married before you go having children. I think everyone goes through the "I want a baby phase" though. Just really think about it before you do anything because I know that it doesn't really matter what anyone says on here, you'll do whatever you want. Good luck!|`|2exwzXiBaa	Yes it is wrong.  You need to finish school and get a job...Adults right now who are married are in danger of loosing their jobs and have had to put off having children, they fear losing their jobs and their homes.  How are you going to care for your baby, and dint day I will live with my parent or I will get a job!!! The jobs are gong to be taken by adults with children whom are losing their home!!|`|xeA4v7rIaa	Sweetheart, God made us to want to procreate, but at 15 your body hasnt even finished developing yet. Your hormoones are going crazy. Keep it together build up your life. Keep yourself for your future husband and then have a family. Having a baby is BIG job, It doesnt jsut go away.
c7Gv3N3Raa	Same thing. i would have pulled over, put the kid in my car and sat there while i was talking to the dispatcher.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing. If it were your kid at your mom's or dad's and he accidently took off into the road and they didn't know it, you'd want the same thing done.<br>  <br>  You possibly saved his life.|`|zj91sSsuaa	What kind of human being say " Don't get involved"<br>  You know that maybe a wise survival tactic, but who knows what would have happened if the child was put there to lure Innocent people into a trap.<br>  I still think you did the right thing, and who wouldn't do what you have done.<br>  But to say don't get involved, your husband is nuts.|`|Wa0pHJwMaa	I agree with everyone who has posted....You did the right thing!<br>  <br>  As for husbands or others, there is still a culture of people who believe that a person shouldn't get involved when the child isn't theirs, which is sad but true.|`|21gJZ9i3aa	I would have done the same thing. You know how husbands are...don't like to get involved. The child could have been hurt or kidnapped.<br>  <br>  God bless you.?|`|bFNtJogSaa	I would of done the exact same thing. Why would any one not get involved? The kid could have been kidnapped or hurt!|`|6ri7AYC1aa	I would of done the same thing.|`|IgvrguCVaa	call 911....duh|`|kSZx9cY5aa	You did the right thing! What did the 911 dispatchers say?<br>  If I saw a little kid on the side of the road I would ask where their mom or dad was, and if they couldn't tell me I would ring 911 for sure.<br>  We were at a carnival a few years ago, and a little girl who wouldn't have been older than 3 was wondering around through the crowds by herself, (there were thousands of people there, tons of them were real creeps) and my daughter asked where her parents where and she didn't know and was lost, so we took her and walked down the street with her and told her to tell us if she saw her mom or dad, and after a few minutes she ran towards a stall and towards her parents who were carnies running the stall. They knowing let her wander off and didn't seem to care at all that she had been lost. Imagine if we hadn't been nice people trying to help her-we could have easier been pedophiles, picked her up, carried her off to the car and abducted her. TOO easily. Anything could have  happened to the poor kid. I very hashly said to her parents "Next time your daughter wanders off chances are it won't be us who finds her, it'll be a pedophile, or child abducter-a 3 year old should NOT be left to wander off".<br>  I don't care how rude it was. I just hope it gave them a reality check!|`|0lnamekJaa	OMFG!<br>  <br>  ANYONE that kept driving should be found and charged with child endangerment.<br>  <br>  To not have stopped would have been 1000X worse then stopping... Even if the grandfather turned out to be right there...<br>  <br>  Who knows what would have happened if you hadn't stopped!<br>  <br>  Once I faced the wrath of a pissed off mom in Phoenix... I went to the Best Buy on Ray Road and I-10 in Ahwatukee and it was HHOOTT out... I parked in the handicap spot (I have a placard) and the van next to me had a baby in the front seat... In a car seat... In the sun... The windows not even cracked...<br>  <br>  I figured that the mom must have just run in for a second so I went in to the store and shopped for a new computer monitor... <br>  <br>  I came out like, a half an hour MINIMUM later and the car was still there... The baby not moving...<br>  <br>  I stood there, not sure what to do... <br>  <br>  I saw another woman walking out of the store and I flagged her over... "Um... There is a baby in the sun in this van and I don't know what I should do!" <br>  <br>  That attracted a few other women and like 6 of us were crowded around the window, wondering if the baby was still even alive...<br>  <br>  That was when the mother came out of Best Buy and INSISTED that she had only been in the store for 5 min's...<br>  <br>  Yeah... I was in there for 30 to 45 min's and she swears that she was only in there for 5 mins.<br>  <br>  We women SHAMED her and told her she was horrible and if she didn't get in the car and drive right off, one of the women was in the process of calling the cops... <br>  <br>  We got involved and hopefully we caused her to never do something that horrible ever again.<br>  <br>  IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO GET INVOLVED.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I would DEFIANTLY have gotten involved and made sure it was a honest mistake (or should I say, temporary lack of intelligence) before I left.<br>  <br>  Children + roads aren't a very good mix.This just proves that people need to watch kids...especially sneaky toddlers! Luckily, my son isn't too worried with escaping out of the house.Even if he were to get the thought, we have locks located on the door that are beyond his reach.|`|OYy82bAYaa	Power to you love many others would have done the same thing.<br>  <br>  I was totally freaked out when I kid ran out in front of my car. I missed him by inches.. The mother came out of her house with a bottle of alcohol in her hands and started abusing the hell out of this kid. Poor thing. I parked the car up and walked over to her she was very apologetic but I didn't hear a thing I just grabbed the bottle and smashed her over the head with it. Not the most rational thing to do but all i kept thinking was what if i hit that child. I was in total shock and then angered because she was abusing the hell out of the child like it was his fault.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I would have done the same thing. You never know with how irresponsible parents are these days. I used to work at a shoe store and one day this lady came in with her kids and she was too busy looking at shoes for herself and her toddler son wondered out of the store and out into the road which is a pretty busy street. I actually heard the door ding so I went to the front thinking there was another customer so that i could greet them and I saw the toddler in the road. I went out and got him and I told the mother that my store was not a daycare and that if she was too busy looking at shoes then maybe she should come back without her children because I didn't want to have to call an ambulance when her son would go out into the road and get run over. She got really mad and walked out of the store. She called my manager the next day (I called my manager after it happened and told her exactly what happened and what I said) and my manager told her "I'm sorry mam, but my employee was exactly right in doing what she did"|`|prqrQcd1aa	I would have done the same thing. The grandfather should have been keeping a better eye on the kid. If you wouldn't have done this he may have gotten hit by a car..which is something that happened about 9 years ago close to where I live. This toddler was always playing in the street. I would take him back to his house all the time, and several people called social services.. No one did anything about it at social services and the little boy was hit and killed. <br>  I live in a small town with roads that are not that busy..this can happen anywhere!|`|FiUprYsvaa	I would have stopped and called 911.<br>  You never know these days.<br>  <br>  So this one kid wandered away from home.<br>  <br>  But just think it could be a little kid who escaped from being kidnapped.<br>  Or you never know, if you had continued driving the next person who came along could have kidnapped him or hit him.<br>  <br>  I think you did the right thing.
vygYFdsSaa	No. No need for an old wives' tale when there's a perfectly good real test available! Do you really think girls would be dangling their rings above their tummies if they could find out the sex simply by peeing on a stick? :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	There is no way to know if you are pregnant without taking a test or waiting for the baby to come out. Also the ring and chain thing is an old wives tale and doesn't work for most people.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	heard about it b4 but i didnt enough attention to help you out. i had a blind neighbor in the past who use to place her hand on women neck (the part were the collar bone meets the neck btwn the 2round bones) and she could tell who was pregnant. she said pregnant women had a faster pulse there. i witnessed her do it and she used to be rite on the $...|`|EwA1gLWAaa	no it doesn't work , from experience it doesn't work for telling the sex of the baby either , i was told of 3 different people that did the ring test with my last pregnancy and they all said i was having a boy . My daughter is 19 months old . there are really good tests and accurate ones out there to tell you if your pregnant|`|mFQydvncaa	No. Its all wives tales, just take a test They work!|`|qzY6TuQmaa	no it doesn't work for that sorry.. i am a with the master string and needle lol
TXtNdYqqaa	Hi Cody,<br>  There is a very nasty virus going around as my 6 year old and I both caught it.<br>  YOU NEED to keep that child home no matter how many days she has missed: In fear other don't catch that air born virus, or she and other will be repeatedly getting it! Your child will still have the quinsy stomach feeling up to at lest 2 to 3 weeks later, almost leaving your child with next to know hungrier feelings or feeling hungry just can't eat much. Just keep your little one pumped with fluids: Gator Aid, ginger ale, popsicles, and soup. She will feel better.<br>  What we contracted was the Nor Walk virus, plus mine had an ear infection. (Was put on antibiotic for the ear infection as antibiotics do not work for virus). I hope I helped you out some?<br>  Could your your Child have this too?<br>  <a href="http://microbiology.mtsinai.on.ca/faq/norwalkfaq.shtml#one" rel="nofollow">http://microbiology.mtsinai.on.ca/faq/no...</a><br>  <br>  Take care, she will get better, good luck.|`|AA10949447	she needs to eat like stuff like soup etc anything hard will irritate the stomach and come back up.Keep her home as long as needed .contact the school to get homework and make up work.talk to her teachers also.|`|ZttGhvMTaa	She needs to rest. I keep my boys home and I stay home from work at the first sign of trouble such as throwing up or fever. Keep her in bed until it's completely gone. At 6, she can afford to miss some school. Arrange with her teacher to pick up school work. When I was a child, I remember times I'd be sick on the couch for a whole week. That's jsut what it takes is good rest.|`|dW9pFT9Daa	Why are you so stressed about her not going to school? She is only six and she needs more care. Perhaps letting her stay home to get better would be a good idea since she had gotten sick at school in the first place. Perhaps she had food poisoning. You have to keep putting the effort to see a doctor or take care of her until she gets well. There isn't much else you can do. Maybe a specialist would be better rather than a general practitioner. <br>  The illness will keep coming back unless you give it time until it is totally gone. Make sure she takes ALL her medication as well.<br>  Good luck|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Well, the first thing is you don't send a kid to school that's been vomiting.  Nice to expose the rest of the kids to it.  You don't send your kid to school, playgroup, dance class, etc until at least 24 hours after their last symptom. She's 6.  It's not like she's going to miss a calculus exam.  You are dealing with a different bug than she's had in the past.  They have to run their course. I don't mean to sound harsh but that is my biggest pet peeve when parents knowingly expose other kids to illness.  Keep her hydrated and on clear fluids like broth, pedialtyte, etc|`|CxCigxZIaa	LOTS AND LOTS of liquids and saltines. <br>  Ease her into her 'normal' eating routine.<br>  The flu probably isn't there any longer, but the uti can be very painful and often sometimes make younger children sick. (besides the medicines she's taking) is she still taking antibiotics for this? If so, some antibiotics and upset your stomach if not taken with food or/and milk. (read the bottle to be sure)<br>  I personally would take her back to the Dr. <br>  Missing school at such a young age is going to be fine.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I LOVE that smell too!!!<br>  <br>  I love just sitting in the rocking chair rocking them to sleep and them feeling so tiny in my arms.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Oh, and open mouth kisses!!!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	The baby giggles!  Golly, you get my 9 month old going and she starts snorting, lol.  But it's such a sweet snort :)  And my son had the Gerber giggle, lol.<br>  <br>  I also love the stage where every things just SO fascinating.  The chubby cheeks, he chubby legs, I'll really miss breast feeding when I wean.  It's so precious to listen to her little "eating sounds" and watch her curl her arm around my boob.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I absolutely LOVE it when they find their toes! They looks so cute just laying on their backs with their feet in the air grabbing their cute little toes. My 15 month old still does it at diaper changes and I love it!<br>  <br>  I also love a baby's laugh. It's so cute and innocent. Their smiles are contagious. I also loved it when my boys were newborns and they made their lips pucker (like giving a kiss) when they pooped! That was cute too!<br>  <br>  Oh I can't wait to have another one!! (Hopefully TTC #3 this fall!!)|`|G9ywiLqvaa	BABY'S BREATH!!!!<br>  oooohhh...i would've loved to stick my nose in those tiny mouths forever!  angel's breath, that's what a baby's breath truly is.<br>  <br>  but now that my boys have grown, i think they've got pizza-lasagna-chicken curry breath.  and darn, i'm not sniffin' that!  lol!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	cuddling, snuggling, feeding them, caring for them, watching them grow, first smiles, first laughs, love finding their personalities, cute little outfits, meeting them the first time.<br>  okay enough of this question!|`|flqAr30laa	their newborn skin...its soooo soft you can barely feel it, it feels like a whisper.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	They definitely do grow up too fast. I can't even name what I loved most about them when they were babies. Now I even miss the things that I dreaded back then, like waking up in the middle of the night, doctor appointments, temper tantrums, etc...<br>  They all bring back fond memories.|`|yrDqtazLaa	When they snuggle on you when they're tired! It's just the sweetest feeling to me. And I'm with you on the johnson and johnson lotion.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh yeah, I also miss when they're newborns and you put your finger in their little tiny hand and they squeeze your finger. That is so precious.|`|pVWk12oOaa	My absolute favorite thing was when I was nursing my son, he'd reach up his little chubby hand and just kind of stroke my face. It was just so sweet.

Their tiny fingers and tiny toes.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	well i haven't had mine yet but i also love the smell, i love their little baby clothes (especially little boys in suits are so friggin adorable like a little man lol). and i love when they first start to walk and they haven't really mastered it yet so they have their legs really wide and kinda kick out to the side when they try and run. its so cute. Oh and when they are new and you put em in the bath the first couple of times and they get really big eyes like wtf. And even when they fall and they don't know what to feel or if they should be hurt so they just stare at you like "what do i do now".|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I miss the way they use to smell:)  Loved their chunky rolls on their legs and their soft tiny feet.  I also miss their funny looking butts, both of my kids had old man butt, it was hilarious.  They have since grown out of that!  <br>  <br>  My daughter is 17 months and I love the baby belly, she runs around with this giant tummy, it looks really funny because she is so petite:)  My son will be 5 at the end of the month and there is nothing baby about him anymore:(  It does make me a little sad.....|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I loved<br>  - I could lay them down, and they didn't move.<br>  - They didn't run, scream or climb.<br>  - They looked at me with such love, and just a bottle or a boobie, and they were satisfied.<br>  - They didn't care about Thomas, or any other fancy dancy expensive things.<br>  - They didn't have best friends called JOHNNY who is soooo *cool* and idolised their Mummy.<br>  - They didn't deny me love.<br>  - Loved being cuddled and kissed<br>  - Their little chunky bums|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I love the way she smears banana on her face. The way she pulls the cats tail until it screams. The faces she makes when she is pooping her diaper. <br>  <br>  But, what I love the most is how she immediately stops crying when I walk into the room and pick her up. She gives me a hug and a kiss and I know that there is nothing better in this world then her love!|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	I love their smell when they get out of the bath and are all warm and cuddly in one of those plush sleepers.  I love the little fat rolls around their neck - the perfect place for smothering them with kisses!<br>  <br>  I love when my little guy comes running to the door yelling "Da Da Da" when I get home from work.  (They're the only "words" he knows so far...and I'm o.k. with that!)|`|fdnbXfvfaa	She didn't back talk when she was a baby XP<br>  <br>  But seriously, I love the shoes.

Unfortunately, we don't have a dog at the moment - except for my mother - in law's ancient but sweet Dachshund who stays with us for many weekends.  I grew up with a Golden Retriever, who was a great family dog and a big teddy bear.  Since we live in the city and I have allergies, we're thinking of getting our son a Boston Terrier - short hair, very smart, not too big, and a great dog for a family.  They're on the smaller side, but can hold their own when roughhousing with kids.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	we have a boxer and she is soo kind and so gentle with my toddler. riley pulls on her jowels and ears and everything and my boxer just lays there, they love eachother. <br>  <br>  i would say a boxer or a lab. labs are wonderful, but they shed a lot. my mil has one and when my daugther was about 6 months old she tried to cuddle with the lab and was COVEREd from head to toe in black dog hair! hha|`|WirFwirLaa	We don't have any dogs as of right now b/c our house is pretty small. But my mom has a chocolate lab that my 13 mo. old adores! They're really good buddies and 'Chase' (the dog) is great with my son.

GREAT child-friendly dog also!|`|SEzIkGNiaa	We use to have a  Hungarian Vizsla. He was a great family dog!  Although he was always in need of attention (special needs), so we had to give him to another family cause another baby was on the way =[<br>  <br>  <a href="http://plucky.zenfolio.com/img/p907087292-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://plucky.zenfolio.com/img/p90708729...</a><br>  <br>  I would say the Vizsla is the perfect dog for kids!  The dog rarely barks, is hypoallergenic, and ours didn't bite.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Edit:  A Thumbs down?  For having a different kind of family dog?|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I don't have a dog.  I have worked with labs at various kennels, Timber Ridge, Rebel Ridge.  The chocolate lab is very recessive and prone to issues, both owners of these 2 kennels have said chocolates have health issues and aren't as smart which is why you never see them competing.  So I would definately get a black or yellow lab over a chocolate and a black lab over yellow.  Golden Retrievers are nice, German Shepherds, American Bulldogs are a great choice.  Really any of the working breeds, but these are known for being great with families:<br>  labs and AB's.  Both of these are used for special needs because of their loyalty, patience, and tolerance.|`|j2mRop0laa	My husband has a chow and I would just like to say that I don't think they make good family dogs. In case anyone is considering it. I had a pitbull growing up and my husbands chow is 100 times meaner. <br>  He is more of a guard dog. He is fenced in a half acre of our land that the children don't play in and only my husband can play with him because apparently most chows only like their owners (we found this out when he tried to bite my face off for giving him a bone). <br>  <br>  I have heard a million good things about labs.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	We have a 5yo choc lab that we got when he was 6wks old (Cruiser). We also have a 5yo lab mix that we adopted when he was 2yo (Red). They are both beautiful extemely intelligent animals, and they're great with our son. Our 2yo rolls all over them, chases them and plays with them. They've never once snapped or growled at him. And Red is soooo protective of him - it's really cute!<br>  <br>  I really think that if you're looking for a big dog that's good with children, a lab would be great for you! Good luck!<br>  <br>  Just FYI- Lab puppies are very hyper until around 2yo. But they are so smart and easy to train. Cruiser was house trained 1 week after we got him (7wks old), and he also learned tricks very quickly.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I have a rescued shih tzu as well life :D  i love her to death. she wasnt a literal shelter rescue, she was born and after her and her 2 littermates were weaned  they were tossed in  a corn bin and only fed about half the time....anyhow i could rant on this one lol it makes me mad so ill behave.....but shes a wonderful little dog, shes almost 4 now. (we got her at a VERY early age, we guess 6-8 weeks, she was the size of a guinea pig)...shes very gentle and cuddly and loving,if all shih tzus were like her i would recommend then to ANY  family with kids (kids that have been taught to be good to animals) <br>  <br>  for bigger dogs,  labs or retrievers are great, but almost any dog will be if its raised right...have fun.  i hope you find you  a good one :-)|`|aCUHzMrmaa	We have a yellow lab named Sammy.  As a puppy he was hard work and peeing all over the place but he's such a good dog.  A yellow lab or a golden retriever are great with kids and they are also special needs dogs so it is perfect.  They are so patient, loyal, and would never hurt anyone. Just stay the heck away from Pitbulls, Rotweillers, they are statistically the most likely to bite and attack their owners, and stay away from chiuahaha's (simple cause they are annoying).|`|QnJvJ67uaa	We have a border collie. She is early 12 now and has been raised with our kids.<br>  Please understand though (and Im not trying to be patronising just helpful :) that there is no such thing as the postcard perfect family dog.<br>  Rough and tumble on the floor will mean your pup/ dog will have no respect for your children and is more likely to bite.<br>  Dogs are great with kids and great for them but make sure that they learn by learning about dog body language, dog training and taking care of the dog, not just the fun stuff.<br>  There my 2 pence worth, but many people have a TV image of dogs in their heads and think that their soppy old lab or retriever would never snap. Ok I'll say no more :D<br>  A lab IS a good choice though and chocs are gorgeous :)|`|kQEnJpOvaa	We have 2 Boston Terriers and a chihuahua. The bostons are GREAT with children, the chihuahua is scared to death of Cade.<br>  <br>  I think a Lab would be a great addition, check your local animal shelter, there are millions of puppies and dogs given to them daily now that everyone is loosing their jobs.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i have a chocolate lab and he is amazing with my kids. i mean they can do anything to him and he just loves the attention. he is so great and gentle with the kids it blows my mind sometimes i figured he would be running away from them but he is just so great. my mom has a golden retriever and a husky but they aren't half as good with my kids as our chocolate lab. i would recommend a chocolate lab for anyone with kids.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Labs are very hyper but good dogs.

OQFd3pl5aa	Look on this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com/opkfaq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com/opkfaq.html</a><br>  <br>  read question number 8. It has a chart that tells you when to start testing with opks based on your cycle length. It also has a lot of answers you are probably looking for. An opk is used the same way as an hpt. You pee on the stick and read your results to find out if you are ovulating. Good luck to you and lots of baby dust :)
gb3uividaa	Oh yuck I had this as well! I think I passed out a million times waiting in lines at restaurants with my first son! Any store with a pharmacy carries little sugar tablets that dissolve in your mouth (by they diabetic supplies) my doctor recommended these or Life Savers for me to suck on until I could get some food in me!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5UdgZEn4aa	Same with me! It got so bad I finally told my doctor cuz I didn't know what was going on. It also causes me to have terrible "can't think straight" migraines. Now I just keep some sugar on me and I try to eat small things through out the day. Good luck. :)|`|EnKFZ7Roaa	I get like that sometimes, my doctor suggested to up my water intake.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|nmu6coapaa	I have diabetes and while I was pregnant I was the same way! My doc told me that one of the pregnancy hormones lowers blood sugar! Eat little and often! I used to carry mini mars bars with me
DKqsFGymaa	It is a testing period.  He's trying to figure out if this form of communication can work for him.<br>  <br>  What I do when my daycare children go through this is simply explain that I won't answer them or deal with them when they approach me in a whiney voice.  When they can use nice words, I will respond.  I usually get a pretty immediate change.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the terrible twos!!!|`|oiJITSNZaa	Should I depress you further? If you think the twos are bad the threes are many times worse!! Its a phase they go through and I think sometimes they are trying to grow faster than their little minds can keep up with and thus makes them one confusing mess. Lots of love, patience and consistent discipline and one day you'll realize he is actually growing up! Good Luck.  mom of 4 month; 11/2 yr and 4 yr old|`|zjuMrDmGaa	When he starts up, very firmly say, "I don't speak Whinese" and walk away from him. Then pointedly ignore it until he can speak Big Boy again.<br>  This will take time and patience, but you have to do it.|`|IxLkAEA3aa	it probably is from the daycare, same thing happened to my son lol hes 3 1/2 now and finally acting somewhat normal again haha. it takes time but its  a very normalt hing they all go through<br>  <br>  nd|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  He'll grow out of it... at least you got to two before it started. My daughter hit her "terrible twos" just after a year.
paerqxfMaa	Sit her down and explain exactly what you've said here - that you want to be ASKED to babysit on certain days/nights - that you may have other plans - you are happy to work with her, but you have a life.  And, when her son comes to her with "issues", you would prefer that she speak to you first about them, before making any judgments by listening to a 9-year-old.  If these terms can't be agreed to - you find another job, she finds another babysitter.  If you're not comfortable with this, how about asking your mom for some advice on how to handle her friend.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	When she asks you to sit tell her that you can't do it. Or you can tell her a few days in advance that you can't sit on the weekend. Just in case she goes to your mother go to her first and explain how you are feeling and that you want your on life and friends and she is preventing you from doing it. Tell your mother what you have said here and ask her to back you up. You are her child and you should come before any of her friends.<br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I would arrange to have a talk with her when the children are not in the house or wherever you meet.  Just tell her the things you have told us.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Find another employer.  THEN leave the current one.  Until then, think positively.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you have to stand up for yourself. if she demands that you work on a day that you can't or don't want to simply tell her i'm sorry but i can't work that day. if she is blaming you for something you didn't do say 'excuse me but that's not what happened' you may not want to quit but if she is going to be a jerk to you then it's not worth it. you need to let her know that it's not ok to blame you for something you didn't do and if she isn't going to respect you while you are working for her then you won't work for her anymore. otherwise talk to your mom about what you are dealing with and see what she says. it's her friend so she may be able to give you some input on what to do or how to handle the situation.|`|AA10572259	Do you want to keep babysitting for her?  If you don't then tell her in advance that its just not working out, and she needs to find someone else.  End of story.  If you do then you need to sit down with her and work out some terms.  Try to sit down with her, without the children around and talk face to face.  Tell her that you are okay watching them but she needs to ask you about dates not tell you.  If you aren't actually working for her full time or at certain times then that's not okay.  You have a life too.  Don't get loud or bitchy just state it.  Then tell her that you do the best job you can do and would never do anything to hurt one of her children.  Sometimes you and the oldest have problems because he wants to do one thing and you tell him to do another.  You think that he is mad and will just tell her anything so he can try to get his way.  You want to make sure you don't go after her parenting or the kids though, people get crazy over their kids.  Tell her that you need her to trust you and let the children know that you are in charge and what you say goes.  If they don't like it that's okay but they can't go around telling lies to try to get you in trouble.  If she doesn't trust what you say then she shouldn't let you watch the kids in the first place.  Don't let her walk on you.|`|b9c2499f0da55e2c5c2ad05aafb17351aa	Since she apparently won't let you have a say in any of these matters, perhaps you can discuss the problems with you mother.  Maybe another adult, her friend your mother, can get through to her.|`|0v55bQT1aa	If you have a laptop with a camera included, try to record her son and his actions and then, play the video to the mother. Make sure, you tell her at all times, what your working hours are !|`|hPbG7XDKaa	Tell her to pay some 30 dollar an hour text a holic to watch her kids if she don't straighten up|`|LbiPnoFIaa	If I were you, I would job hunt for some income.  Never quit a job without not having another one lined up. Be sure it is secure and have a starting day. Then If you want you can put the mother of the children that you babysit on a schedule for your needs, not hers.  I think some people take advantage and do not think other ppl have lives too.  I understand about the saturday situation but maybe you had plans.  I mean you need time for yourself as well.  Plans and other things come after responsibility.  I think that you should get a job and set her on a schedule after that.  If she does not meet your schedule then she can find another babysitter.  That is, after you get and secure your other job.|`|lgVmgBb8aa	you should speak to your mum about how her friend is making you feel, then maybe she could have a word with her friend. make sure it's not going to sound like you're telling tales on the woman because that might make her mad and maybe more mean. just tell your mum that it is upsetting you and you're only talking to her because you don't think you can cope, you're just sticking it out because you need the money.<br>  <br>  her behaviour is not fair and she has no right to treat you like that so you'renot in the wrong, hope it gets sorted out!
6hb04Ow0aa	Katherine is pretty. And it will suit someone of any age (eg teenager, child, baby, adult, grandmother). Skyler is nice too but I don't think it ages as well.|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I love the name Caitlin and the nickname Cait!!<br>  <br>  I also like Kat!|`|S4y7V4diaa	Katy Reanne? I like that!
AA11569882	What are you changing it from?  Skyler is alright, but I don't know if you'll still like it in ten years.  Why not just go by your middle name if you don't like your first, Reanne is a lovely name.<br>  <br>  Caitlin isn't a bad name!  Then again, I hate my first name too (it's Karen, so I'd change it if I could), what about thinking about some nicknames, you could call yourself Kate, Cate, or Kat... How about when you go off to college or something just introduce yourself as Skye or Reanne, because it would be very difficult to get those who already know you to start calling you Skyler.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	don't change your nasme|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Well, it's your name, and your life, so you can do as you want! I personally like both Caitlin and Skyler. It's entirely your decision. Actually I do like the spelling Skylar, I find it to be more feminine. But if you're not a girly-girl like me then Skyler is still a great name. And if it suits you better too!|`|edLbogmYaa	I think you should stick to Caitlin..It's such a pretty name... Skylar is a bit much...  why do you hate caitlin so much? I maybe thinking about naming my baby Caitlin... Is it that bad?|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	Ummm - I guess it's not a bad "trendy" name but what will it be like when you are called Aunty Skyler or Granny Skyler?  It's different and I'm not keen but it's your choice.|`|lc51V6EAaa	I like it, you don't hear that name much. I never met anyone named Skyler. So yeah, change it(if you want) :)|`|LbwGQyuLaa	Well whats your name now?|`|bhNaTYjOaa	I think 'Nobrain' would suit you better.|`|UkC41QVNaa	Thats my neices name :)<br>  <br>  I love it. :D
l79QIWszaa	Gerber has great juices!  Make sure to only give them apple, pear, or white grape since citrus juices will cause a very sore bottom.  They should only have 4oz of juice per day until they are 12months, or whatever your doctor suggests.  I give my little guy two ounces of juice mixed with 2-3oz of water once or twice a day and he's also 8 months old.  I have also mixed the juice with his cereal and he loves it.  Check out the nutritional facts on the gerber juice and then look at some other (more inexpensive juices) like old orchard or juicy juice.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vCq3dR40aa	Gerber juices are simply no sugar added juices with double the water.  Save your money and cut no sugar added juice 50/50 with water.<br>  <br>  While we are at it, stay away from Juicy Juice because it just uses sweeter fruit juices in order to artificially make all the drinks sweeter.<br>  <br>  I started giving some juice when my daughter could ask for it with sign language.<br>  As to feeding your 8 month old juice.  Juice is a concentrated form of carbohydrates and natural sugar (but sugar none the less).  It is much better to fill your baby's diet with real food. Fruits, veggies, squash, meats, etc. than let them fill up on high sugar, no fiber drinks.<br>  Additionally, water is better because they won't expect everything they drink to have taste.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	My son is only 5 months old.  I will occasionally give him diluted apple juice when he gets a little constipation.  If you basically go with the guidelines, things will be fine.  You don't have to do everything the book says all the time.  Sometimes, just do what you want.  Give her juice if you want to.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	I've never given my babies juices. Once in a while as a rare treat the toddlers will get a cup of juice, but not my baby. I don't like giving them all that sugar, and all juices have alot of sugar.  But I believe the age you can start giving them juice is 6 months.|`|68c6B8dRaa	You can give her any juice it pleases you to give her; there's no such thing as "baby juice." Just a marketing ploy; Gerber makes a lot of junk, so always read ingredient labels carefully...|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well gerber has great juices for one. the first recommendation is that if you do start giving her juice use half water half juice. i would wait until you talk to the pediatrician and see what they say. i started giving my daughter juice when i started her on whole milk at about 11 months. but each baby is different so you can try it once or twice and as long as her system tolerates it i don't see a problem.
59GymH27aa	I can't believe it either.  Just think soon your daughter will be running around shouting MaMa like mine.  My daughter is one and looks more and more grown up everyday. I can't believe sometimes that I am her Mummy when she sits and blows me kisses.  She never fails to put a smile on my face no matter how upset I am.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My daughter will be 8 months on the 19th and is amazing me everyday. I have been watching the videos we make every month and they make me want to cry. <br>  <br>  What really makes me sad is that my first baby will be 9 years old in less then two weeks. I just watched a video we took when we went to Disney on her 3rd birthday. The tears were flowing!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	My Sons haven't grown I swear.<br>  <br>  I look at them and I still see the babies I had those years ago, sweet and helpless, wrapped up in their little blankets, relying on me for everything.<br>  <br>  I do not see those rampaging 5yo, 3yos, almost 1yos, throw my house. They are sweet helpless little babies|`|aMpMFLo3aa	yeah they do grow up fast when I was growing everyone used to always say you grown up fast and I am like really I dont think so and now that I see my children they do grow up too fast  I cant believe I have a 9 year old sometimes lol|`|zxhCy80eaa	I am in SHOCK! My oldest son will be 13 in October, my youngest son will be 12 in October. (Seems like only yesterday I was bringing them home from the hospital.) In August I will be having baby number 3. THAT was a shock! I found out on Christmas Eve I was pregnant. (Ultrasound on the 26th of this month to find out if it's a boy or girl!)<br>  God, when I think about how old my sons will be when this baby is 10, I feel like I age 20 years!|`|mcmOslOFaa	Awwww!!  Yes I really miss that.  Mine are all 9 years, 7 years, and my youngest is 3 years!  It has gone by sooo super fast and then there are times when I am like..."where did my babies go??"  Love it while you got it, it will be gone before you know it and then they will be in their terrible 2's...lol!  Have fun!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i agree. my daughter is almost 19 month and i just can't believe how fast the time has gone. it's like in super fast play. i look at pictures from when she was younger and im like... was she really that small? i can't believe how much she has grown up and her personality has developed. i absolutely love it and wouldn't trade it for the world!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	LOL..you wait until you have another, then watch as your 1st baby turns overnight into a lumbering giant of a toddler...seriously you won;t be able to stop thinking.."wow!! look at the size of her head!!"
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	it was probably 3 weeks until i felt normal again|`|wENdWT5kaa	I had two.<br>  <br>  It takes up to a year to fully heal. But i started feeling like myself about a month later, the pain stopped shortly before that. <br>  <br>  My second, not so well for me anyhow, my son is 3 months and i'm still experiencing pain near my incision. But that is probably due to scar tissue. <br>  <br>  It depends, everyone is different. But as far as i can remember, it didn't take me too long to feel better after my first.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	I felt like myself after about two weeks.  I wasn't running around tap dancing, but I felt pretty much normal.<br>  <br>  Pain wise I was taking nothing more than motrin the day after the surgery, and then only at bed time by the end of the first week.<br>  <br>  It does take about a year to fully heal, and about 6 weeks before you are back to your normal activities.|`|jn34aSgHaa	1 month just from the pain and discomfort, the only thing i hated is that i couldnt sleep good. but overall the doc says that you cannot strain or lift things for a couple of months after because then it could tear. good luck|`|QCVzUC1baa	I had one in october 08 and still have some problems from the surgery. :-( They say 6 months to FULLY recover from the operation.|`|nmu6coapaa	Well I was walking the day after my section, very slowly and bent over! After about 2 or 3 weeks I felt great apart from the odd pain here and  there!|`|UkQuMykiaa	This was my first c-section out of four pregnancies. I was really expecting terrible things from what others had said and I was really scared to have a c-section. But I was surprised - it really hurt the first week and week two was still a little tough. By week three I was doing so much better. I was actually doing some house work and drove to my friends work to hang out with her for a while. By week four, my incision was still tender but much better and I was feeling better everyday. Now I am six weeks pp and I am back to normal. My dr. said to take it easy (which yesterday my belly was a little sore so I think I over did it a little).|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	You're suppose to wait about 6 weeks before resuming "normal" activities according to the doc, but you will start FEELING better in about 2-3 depending on your surgery/surgeon/and your body.
145RUNQHaa	I have a son who's 23 months he's in a toddler bed he sometimes wakes and comes climbing into our bed for the last few hours of sleep but we don't mind he doesn't really disturb us and we enjoy a cuddle.you sound like you have an incredible amount of patience to be rocking him for all that time he's so lucky to have you.poor you ,you must be absolutely exhausted!i don't believe in leaving little ones to cry alone all that teaches them is that when they're upset or lonely you will not be there for them.if he was just going to cry for five minutes and fall asleep that's not so bad but if he's been used to the rocking i think he would be more upset than that so i can only suggest stopping the rocking that sounds like such hard work but going in and holding his hand instead but without picking him up and soothing him with your voice.i'm sure he will cry but no need to feel bad about that because you are there to hold his hand.over the nights move away from his bed so you are not holding his hand but are just there he will be comforted by your presence.at this point you could give him something to comfort him that he can hold instead of your hand.you could try a hot water bottle in a fluffy cover.my children always find that a comfort if they are upset or ill.your aim is so that you can go in and soothe him with your voice give him a comforter doesn't have to be a hot water bottle and go back to bed hopefully he will start to settle quicker when he realises there's no rocking which is worth waking up for!xx|`|1tmX7xbRaa	sometimes when we lay our daughter down (19 months on the 16th) she will talk or play or cry. the best thing we have done is just to let her go for a while. if she cries for a half hour or more then i will go check on her. (i can't stand to hear her cry like that but hubby insists on letting her go) so anyway when i go back in i don't rock her or bring her back downstairs because the one time i did that she wanted to do it every night. my best suggestion is just letting him go for a bit. when you do go back in his room lay him down and tell him it's time for nite nite (or whatever you call it bed time etc). eventually he will learn that crying like that isn't going to mean that you are going to come in and rock him. either that or maybe you are putting him to bed before he is ready. i have noticed with our daughter that when we started putting her to bed a half hour to an hour later she would end up falling right to sleep until the morning.|`|KmC0K59taa	Mine is 23 months and she wakes up almost every night.  She'll have a week or so where she sleeps all night.  We put her in bed with us.  We both work fulltime jobs and have to be up at 6, and I know she will go right back to sleep in our bed.<br>  <br>  Is he taking too long a nap during the day?  Mine has never been up for more than 20 mins during the night.  I don't really believe in crying it out, but in your case you may have to.  Cut him off from the rocking.  Tell him no more.  Move the rocker to another room.  After a few nights he'll get the picture he won't be rocked anymore and hopefully he'll settle down.  Just go in his room and comfort him but make him stay in his crib.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	My 17-month old went through a period again last week and the week prior of waking up at night more than once. A few of those nights were due to illness,though. The other nights, I was concerned that she had gotten conditioned while she was sick. I don't think she did. Also, even before she got sick she would wake up and only want Mommy. So, after my husband changed her diaper, I would sit with her and nurse her until she went back to sleep. I usually expect to be up for an hour. Even after she falls asleep, I hold her to make sure that she is asleep. <br>  <br>  I suppose letting her sit and cry in her crib in a semi-dark room alone to "teach" her to go to sleep, or go back to sleep on her own would work, but that just seems mean. (She does not even use a pacifier.) Something could be really wrong, but she won't call for us because she has been conditioned that if she wants or needs Mommy and Daddy in the middle of the night, we won't come. Also, her diaper is usually pretty wet when she wakes up. Personally, I couldn't sleep in a saturated diaper, but that's just me. If she still needs Mommy and/or Daddy to help her go back to sleep, fine. I'm cherishing these moments before they disappear completely.<br>  <br>  I am concerned about this weekend when I will be gone for a conference. Last night was one of those nights when she only wanted Mommy. However, if Mommy is gone, she will probably cling to Daddy more. (His parents will be here, but when she is really upset, Grandma won't cut it. We left our daughter at my in-laws' last week for dinner and a play and when our daughter realized we were gone, she just cried herself to sleep.) <br>  <br>  Most nights, though, she sleeps. The one or three she doesn't, it's cool. It happens.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	you need to stop.  period.  he is plenty old enough.  if he wakes up crying, go in and kiss him...give him his pacifer, lay him back down...then leave the room.  look at the clock and do not go back in for 15 minutes.  after 15 minutes if he is still crying, repeat the process.  it will be a living nightmare for you for a few days....but he will quickly catch on that mommy isnt playing that game anymore...and he will slowly begin sleeping through the night.  a great book on this subject is "Baby wise" by gary ezzo.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Yes my 18 month old wakes now and then throughout the night but I just let her go and she goes right back to sleep because she knows that nothing will happen. I think sometimes getting molars can affect sleep patterns|`|9kgYFEbOaa	I have a 20 month old. Around 18 months she started to all of the sudden get super clingy and started waking almost nightly to come into bed with us. When she was 7 months in 1 night we got her to sleep all night in her crib. So we couldn't understand why she was 1: waking up and 2: had such a strong will power to be in our bed. I have heard from a lot of other people that around this age it is a common phase of wanting to be with the parents and closer ect. Maybe it has something to do with a newer level of automonmy then they had before; but they also still crave the closeness of infancy. Anyway, what worked for us was getting her into her big girl bed ( a FULL!!!) after a few nights with us we realized that a hge reason she was waking up is because she lays out totally flat and stretched out head-toe when she sleeps. And at the same time she also moves in circles like a clock as she sleeps. Well in her crib/toddler bed (it converts) there wasn't enough room so about half-way through the night she was getting her feet stuck in the rungs, or hitting her head ect. Once we put together the bigger bed we started going to her rather then her comming into our bed. We would go sit with her in her bed and rub her back and as sson as she was asleep we'd leave. I've also noticed though that she has/is going through a bit of a growth spurt, and this is a common age for that; so that could be a big factor in the waking up. I would just start to wean him little by little. Rock him, let him fall asleep, if he cries immediatly let him go for 5 minutes the first time; rock him again. and just keep waiting longer and longer to go rock him. In his mind he knows that if he wakes up mommy comes to his rescue, snuggles him, reads to him, ect. Who wouldn't wake up for that?|`|72SrLDQ3aa	My daughter will be 20 months on the 16th, and she wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night, but I just let her cry and she usually falls back asleep within 10 minutes.<br>  Don't go in there when your son wakes up and he'll probably cry and fuss for awhile, but if he knows you're not going in there to get him, where he probably thinks it's time to play because you do go in there, he'll settle back down and go back to sleep. I can never go into my daughter's room in the middle of the night when she does wake up because she thinks it's time to get up and play.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my son  is 15 months..not in the age range you requested, but a toddler none the less....he only wakes at night if he drops his binky and cant find it.i go in and find it and give it to him and hes  right back asleep  ( im dreading breaking him of that nasty thing but i know its coming soon.).the only place he has it is in the bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  i would never allow my child to cry for 30 minutes without checking on them and seeing what was wrong, when lil man cries he wants somethnig, usually he has either thrown his favorite blanket out of the bed or his binky...i dont care to let him fuss for a few (maybe 5-7) minutes..but never for half an hour
AA11085356	It could take a few hours to a couple days|`|crutXlguaa	It can take from about half an hour to mostly 3 hours to get into your fallopian tubes. At least this is what I learnt from the research I did. <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!!|`|AA11370170	i thought a couple of days
nnyowt2oaa	I did for 2 months, and I hated it. Finally I went last week and bought my 'fat jeans', or 'transition jeans' as my nice neighbor calls them. We'll see how long it takes to get back in to my regular jeans, probably just around the time I'm ready to have #2!|`|hbjbm3SRaa	Yes I did. I think for about 3 to 4 weeks or so I did just because right after the delivery I was in a lot of pain and just felt like being comfortable so once I healed I started getting back into regular clothes (not my normal clothes before delivery, but regular, non maternity clothes) :) It won't be too long. I know, maternity clothes get annoying after a while you just want to be able to wear something that doesn't have elastic in the waist :)|`|Y8rQQKuVaa	Oh, yeah. I started to be able to wear SOME of my normal clothes by 3 months, and finally gave up the maternity clothes by about 4 or 4.5 months. <br>  <br>  I still can't fit into a lot of my dress pants, but it's because my hips are just a tiny bit bigger than they used to be.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	i still wear my maternity jeans. i only bought one pair, and they were skinny jeans so they aren't big baggy ones. you can't tell they are maternity jeans, and look great tucked into boots! i wore them on boxing day. was great not having a tight waist line after dinner! :)|`|xV0APOtaaa	No. My mom went and bought me a new not maternity outfit to go home in. New clothes for baby, new clothes for mommy. <br>  <br>  But I only gained 15 lbs while I was pregnant. My daughter was born at 7 lbs 2 oz. then once you add the placenta and all the extras I lost it all after delivering.|`|uxItOSkmaa	yep, for like 3/4 months LOL  They were literally falling off me, but soo comfy.<br>  My sister & best friend told me they were going to burn them within 2 days of each other.  That's when I stopped.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I did for about 2 months postpartum. And then I found the biggest jeans I had and squeezed my butt into them.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I had my daughter last Friday and I'm not wearing my maternity jeans now. I have moved into sweats and jogging pants. I can't wear regular jeans yet because I had a c-section and the waistband would be right on top of the cut. But I probably could fit in regular jeans if it weren't for the cut.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I'm wearing a pair right now, and my son is 8 1/2 months old!  LOL!  I don't need to wear them, I was back in my regular jeans 6 weeks after he was born, but they are so damn comfy.  It's like putting a pair of sweats on in the morning.  I don't really wear them out, though.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	yea ... i left hospital in them, but about 10 days later i could fit back in my regular ones. I just wanted to wear my PJs instead!<br>  <br>  I wish regular jeans were as comfy as maternity ones ...|`|14JQ11AUaa	I was until I was 6 weeks postpartum!|`|nmu6coapaa	I was back in my size 8's as soon as that little fella was out of there! LOL!
lJ5Ao2aIaa	Don't think too much about SIDS. Just keep your baby in her own crib right next to your bed, cause if you let her sleep with you in bed you might roll over her at night or cover her face with your blanket ...etc thats why you'r advised to keep her in her own crib. About smoking, just don't smoke when ur around her or in the room she sleeps in, for instance you can smoke in the kitchen or next to the window. Keep your windows open for an hour or two for letting fresh air inside every time you smoke. Have faith and cheer up:) God bless you and your baby.<br>  <br>  And I just read your extra detail. So NO you r not co-sleeping if her crib is beside your bed, all babies sleep in the same room with their parents! On the contrary, making her sleep in another room would be more dangerous than co-sleeping in this age! :) So don't worry you are doing the right thing.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I don't define what you are doing as co-sleeping.  I sleep with my daughter right next to me, nursing much of the time.  That's co-sleeping.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I would be concerned about third hand smoke on your person and in your house as the danger, even if you aren't smoking around her.  It's been found to be cancer-causing as well, and still causes respiratory problems in children.<br>  <br>  If you're a light smoker, why not give it up entirely for the sake of your baby?|`|1SGl03Zlaa	If she is sleeping in her own crib than its not co sleeping.  I co slept with my daughter for a year and my husband and I are both smokers (outside and not around the baby of course).  To reduce the amount of 3rd hand smoke around your baby you can get a jacket or sweater to wear only for smoking in and try to wash your hands when you come in from a smoke.  Since your mostly worried about the 3rd hand smoke when you are sleeping you could try to make sure you have a shower before bed and no smoke afterwards so the baby wont be breathing in as much 3rd hand smoke.|`|hbjbm3SRaa	I really don't agree at all with people smoking who have children but that's really up to and what you decide. Even though you do smoke outside the smoke will stay in your clothes and things for a long time. My brother smokes and I can always smell it on his clothes so even though you're outside doesn't mean the smoke is all staying outside.  As for the co-sleeping, I was too scared to have my baby sleep in our bed with us when he was so young because I heard things on the news and stuff about people sleeping in bed with their babies and smothering them on accident. It's just you don't know what you're doing when you're asleep so I think what would be best is to just keep her in her bed either in her room or maybe put her out in the living room. It was so much easier for me to sleep and my baby not to expect me to be around all the time when he started sleeping in a separate room from us.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	<a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000...</a><br>  <br>  I found this article to be helpful.  I can not recall for sure if it includes information about smokers.  You can always Google it or call your pediatrician.  If he/she cannot help you, they may know who can.<br>  <br>  Even if it doesn't include the info you want, there is a lot of helpful information here and I think you will benefit from reading it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  P.S.  Try to ignore the judgmental comments of other posters.  People seem to have a God complex.  There is research that says it is safe if DONE PROPERLY with all the precautions taken.|`|V1LMRJgPaa	I wouldn't worry to much, i had my son so close to my bed he was almost in it and im quite a heavy smoker. Just like yourself i have never smoked around or near my son and he is now a healthy happy 12 month old. There is so much advice on what to do and what not to do these days that it is ever so confusing, i think you should do what you think is safe. And nobody should give you any verbal abuse on here, it's takes a good parent to ask for advice.. x x|`|OLW0Irbhaa	In all honesty, I wouldn't take any chances with my newborn.  Any smoke exposure is too much.  I wouldn't try to justify it at "3rd hand smoke at a push".  It's on your breath, it's on your clothes, it's in your hair-all of which she is exposed to after you come back in from smoking. My parents smoked outdoors too but our house still smelled, they still smelled and to this day the smell of cigarette smoke makes me ill.  She is being exposed to more than you might think everytime you hold her.  Here's the thing-make a positive change now for your health, your husband's health and most importantly the health of your precious newborn.  Would you want your daughter to grow up to be a smoker? Be a positive example for her in the future.<br>  <br>  And co-sleeping is perfectly safe as long as you follow the rules-baby sleeps between the wall and mom, never between mom and dad, firm mattress, no soft bedding, no drinking or drugs/medication of any kind.|`|AA11085356	I am a smoker, and occasionally I bring my son to sleep in my bed with me. I have never had any problems or heard that there is anything wrong with it. I also only smoke outside, and never around my children. From what I understand, co-sleeping is when the baby is actually in bed with you, not just in the same room. If I were you, seeing that this is a concern, I would bring it up to your doctor (or baby's doctor) next time you see him. I'm sure they will have tons of information for you to answer all your questions.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Yes, it's very very possible.  Well, as you know I was around 9 weeks pregnant when I got a positive with my son.  And a good friend of mine was around 7 weeks pregnant when she got a positive.  She's now 20 weeks.  So, it's highly possible!|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hiya hunni,<br>  <br>  some women dont get a pos test for a good few weeks,so dont loose ehart, u may well be pregnant and i really hope u r hun xxxx<br>  <br>  i have everyting crossed 4 ya chick (starting to hurt my ears though lol)<br>  <br>  hmm we need a new song.....im going to get my bfp de dum dum dee, next time i wee it will be a bfp de dum de dum laula says its true so Hcg show up will you!! lol<br>  <br>  hahaha xxxx<br>  <br>  best wishes luvly xx|`|zSABr7praa	I can't say i've ever heard of someone having a negative at 8 days late, and been pregnant.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen!  Just not to my knowledge.  Are you ovulating every month?  I would be weeks late off an on for a year, and after I started using ovulation strips I found I wasn't ovulating every month.. maybe this month you simply did not ovulate?  I doctor could tell you for sure!  Best of luck, my fingers are crossed for you!|`|0VHolTVEaa	Aww bless u poor thing. I found out i was pregnant at 10 weeks. I was upset ttc as i brought so many hpt but none showed positive. Then one day i got a BFP. If i were you i would go to your doctor and get a blood test done as they will tell you for sure because sometimes the hpt dont detect hcg in your system where a blood test will tell straight away.<br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust xxx|`|DN6XtoViaa	it's very possible! some women don't get their positive for a couple weeks lol.<br>  <br>  maybe you should make an apointment and get a blood test done so you can relax!<br>  <br>  make sure you ask for the blood test that Mesures the Amount of HCG! <br>  <br>  good luck chica!|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	My mom got negative tests until she was 3 weeks late for her period, she finally got her BFP after the three weeks. My sister also didn't get a BFP until she was 2 weeks late with her first and her second baby would not even register on an HPT, she had to get a blood test to find out what was making her so sick. I hope that this helps and good luck, hope you get your BFP soon!!!|`|sUBFp1oIaa	I say its definitly possible you could be pregnant. Are you pretty regular with your cycles? 9 days late is a while, you might have just conceived late in the cycle and thats pushing things back so you dont have enough hCg hormone for a HPT to detect?! I would wait a few more days and retest. If you still dont see AF or get a positive, make an appointment with your Dr to get blood drawn or something. Good luck!!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Absaloutely!<br>  <br>  Some women don't secrete HCG in to their urine for a long while. I have read on here about women not finding out they are pregnant until they are 10 weeks gone. Your best bet is to go for a blood test, HCG enters your blood stream much faster than it enters your urine.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	im i the same boat and im gettingneg tests. im confused??????????|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i didnt get a positive until i was 14 weeks pregnant|`|9osFXKPyaa	TRY A BLOOD TEST|`|gwuTKiNXaa	It may just be tooo early to test that is all wait another week or so before testing again
32739bf251ecc5a809d7cee0e1237afcaa	You need to just keep asking her, but don't get angry with her.  Ask her if a friend has done it for her, tell her it looks pretty and make her relax. <br>  <br>  Of course you could go to the shcool and voice your concerns to her teacher who may be able to enlighten you :)|`|zoD71BuKaa	Does she ride the bus? Maybe there are older girls on the bus that want to give her makeovers. :) These girls might make her feel special because she gets to hang out with the big girls, and the big girls probably feel admired by her, almost a big sister feeling. :) My guess is if they are more complicated styles, older girls are doing it. You could talk to her teacher and ask if these styles are being created in the classroom, and if they are, you could ask her teacher to please intervene and stop the glam sessions. :) If they are not done in the classroom, you could talk to the bus driver, and ask her to move your daughter closer to the front of the bus... Then, her 'big sister' friends could still sit with her, but the bus driver could keep an eye on them. :)|`|PCxDTT0paa	I know in daycare I had to do several hair re-do's due to the hair being so messy after naps and lunch. I am not sure why she would be coming home from school like this-I would definitely get to the bottom of it though.|`|IFDHqkLTaa	Hi blue jay,<br>  Maybe she just has a very talented friend, but that is something to question. I would write a letter to her teacher. I would be concerned that someone may be touching her inappropriate ways.|`|irLnPW4aaa	She and her friends probably play with each others hair.  Or maybe her hair gets in her face and her teacher pulls it back for her or something like that|`|5X8btZSraa	something is not going right. check on it.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Is she in before care or after care?  If so, maybe the person that is watching over them is doing it?  In our school some of the high school kids come down as part of there classes to watch the kids in these programs and the younger girls love to hang out with high school girls.  Maybe instead of playing with the other kids she's letting them do her hair.  If your daughter isn't answering you just ask the teacher, maybe it's happening at lunch? Try to speak to the teacher during pick up time or send her an email.  Good Luck|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Ask her teacher! Probably an older child did it.|`|CxCigxZIaa	Maybe the person that sits behind her is doing it? <br>  Just a thought...<br>  It sounds like maybe you think an ADULT is doing this? <br>  Suggestion: if this were my daughter this is how I would handle this.<br>  I would tell her that I liked it - very much and would love to tell whomever did this to possibly be available for a party and do other girls. (you have to think like a 6 year old here)<br>  IF she still says, "i don't know" then by all means say, "awwwww I sure wish I knew so I could thank them because it's beautiful and you'd like to get a thank you card for them"<br>  For whatever reason she's not wanting to tell you..she might think you don't like it and will make a fuss with whoever is doing it. Use reverse psychology.|`|wC0sxhJXaa	I know my daughters have done through this and it's always some girl on the bus or at recess that wants to play hairdresser..but it's not that safe....LICE....she'd come home with different ponytail holders and i was ewwwwwwwwwww....NO more....lol be nice and talk to her like a friend in this situation be like oh your hair looks beautiful who did it?? then you can explain to her the risks of that...|`|IxLkAEA3aa	i tottaly agree with the person above me! you need to use some good old reverse psycology on her!

AA12145826	That would be a made-up or fake word. Kind of like Dr. Seussisms. Tartism as a word I believe refers to the worshiping of tarts which depending on what definition of the noun "tart" you go with could mean:<br>  <br>  (a) A pastry shell with shallow sides, no top crust, and any of various fillings.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  (b) A prostitute or a woman considered to be sexually promiscuous.<br>  <br>  If the adjective is being referred to it would mean:<br>  <br>  (a) Having a sharp pungent taste; sour. See Synonyms at sour.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  (b) Sharp or bitter in tone or meaning; cutting.<br>  <br>  For the purpose of argument, I'll assume you are referring to the latest member of the "trolls-r-us" club Ms. TartismSucks. In this case I can only assume the "tartism" she is referring to would have direct correlation with the second definition of the adjective tart. Why its related to calling a child by a nickname or "pet" name and therefore why she is against it, is totally beyond me.<br>  <br>  I refuse to give her enough credit to think she could come up with a "creative" way to insult Tantrism within the Buddhist religion.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Oh look, it speaks.|`|mcmOslOFaa	www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=379154...<br>  <br>  From my understanding its people who are against Christianity.

dthWo7u6aa	if you thinkg the doc won''t take you seriously have you tried ringing NHS Direct?  They are fabulous and a nurse will go through everything with you over the phone and give you an idea of what they think.|`|CQscf3wfaa	Is he teething? My daughter always gets sick when she is teething. it lowers their defences to fit of illness. When she is teething one minute she would be fine and the next she would be very moody and off. It also makes her very tired. Hope he gets better soon. nothing worse than seeing your little one ill.|`|hPgDNG2haa	it wouldnt hurt to get him checked out by your doctor .he is still quite young so maybe hes just getting tired and really likes the comfort of his own bed.has he been doing some extra activities lately.<br>  dont panic ...just make an appointment with your doc and go from there but i would definitly get him checked to be on the safe side.<br>  hope everythin is ok...im sure it will be!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	My daughter is 19 months old and she is pretty much the same as your son when shes poorly. She'll not eat much, becomes extra cuddly and just wants to sleep.<br>  <br>  I would not worry about the temperature too much, unless it is accompanied by a worrying rash/fits. Temperatures are more common in toddlers as it their way of killing the bug. I called NHS Direct about my daughters temperature last week, the nurse told me that a temperature is usually a sign that the bug is leaving their body and that their immune system is combatting it.<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing by giving him calpol and plenty to drink. Toddlers are the same as adults when they get a bug, they need a lot of rest, plenty of fluids and something to alleviate any aches and pains.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you get really worried, call NHS Direct on 08454647. They can be pretty helpful and reassuring :).<br>  <br>  If he gets convulsions you should speak to a doctor about how to bring his temperature down safely (I think the best way is Calpol!). Most doctors advise not to apply cold flannels etc but in your sons case they may advise differently. See if you can get your GP to speak with you once surgery has finished for the day.|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Phone the doctor and ask to speak to him and let him decide if you little boy needs to be seen,.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Wow! 17 months and says "bed now mommy". That's awesome!<br>  <br>  He might be coming down with something, or check for teeth, he might be getting some new ones. Another possibility is he could be heading for a growth spur.
ISjFdI1taa	The underarm temperature might be slightly cooler than his actual temperature.  An electronic ear thermometer might be a good idea as it is more accurate - anything over 39 is a really high fever.<br>  Calprofen is better than paracetamol at lowering temperature and you need to make sure that he isn't wearing much and has no blankets.   If his temperature really rises, take off his clothes and sponge him down with a tepid/warm water using a damp cloth.  It's important not to use cold water as this will make the blood vessels constrict and will keep the heat in his body.<br>  My first daughter used to have febrile convulsions and this was recommended by a doctor to us - her temp went up to 40 at one point but we got it down by sponging her and with child's ibuprofen.  If you're worried or it doesn't bring the fever down, get him to a doctor.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	A toddlers temperature can reach 38 degrees C and still be considered safe. Anything 39 degrees and above can be classed as a high temperature.
TXtNdYqqaa	Hi Girl,<br>  Gee..That's a tuff call. But if I were you and to be on the safe side: Not maybe until she is about 11. 8 in my eyes, given todays world only is just a wee bit young, however like the another person commented: Stand a distant and watch her in plain sight, seeing the bus pull up and your child gets on it. Small town, large town...Sh_t happens, sad but true so why take that chance. Just my 2 cents worth ;-)<br>  Edit: Some feel the need to thumb me down...Do you know just how quick a child can be abducted;  In a mater of seconds; Age makes no different but seconds count.<br>  BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!!!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	My own concern where I live is the speed of traffic that comes through my village, this stops me from allowing my eldest son (9) to walk to school alone (5 mins walk).<br>  If she really wants to be "grown up" make sure she is 100 % on her stranger danger, to not be afraid to SCREAM if an adult tries to touch her or get her in a car. Also its easy to follow her spy like ;)<br>  Un known to me my dad followed me to the Corner shop for weeks when I was 8 lol.<br>  If she is mature and confident and knows the dangers then go for it..they have to grow up sometime :P<br>  good luck x|`|CxCigxZIaa	You are right to worry now a days. (crazies in this world)<br>  Why not walk with her? (if possible)<br>  That would still let her walk and be a bit independent but yet safer.<br>  You don't necessarily have to walk "all the way" but just so you can still have her in your eyesight.<br>  My son is 10 and has just started riding his bike to school. 3 blocks.(this was a long month long process is letting him do this) that's another story.<br>  Final note: I am assuming there are other children at this same stop and most of the time the crazies that prey on kids do it to children that are alone/ not in groups.<br>  Always..better safe than sorry.|`|h3rN7snkaa	You could just stand at the driveway. See her off. I don't know, my mom actually followed behind me in the car going l about 5mph.....it was pretty harsh. And out bus stop wasn't even at the end of our street. Don't do that though......|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My daughter will be 9 in two weeks. She walks to school with the neighbor, but she walks home by herself. There are lots of other kids, so I feel good about it. If she isn't home within 15 mins of school being out, I start walking towards the school. <br>  <br>  I think it depends on how responsible they are.|`|Cv0UkQVXaa	Do it when you are ready. She is your daughter and the world is rough. My kids walk to school 2 blocks away (they are 11 and 13). The only reason I allow this is all the parents in the are are outside before and after school and we are a close nit community.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	tell her she can start doing that when she is 10 or 11 she is too young right now|`|kK3uyS4uaa	6 yrs. old|`|CeS9Pin7aa	I was letting my daughter walk HOME from the bus stop in grade 1 - because if she didn't arrive home I would know right away, whereas if she didn't make it onto the bus in the morning it could be hours before the school called to see why she wasn't there.   But I always took her to the stop because it was about a block away and through a path between two houses.<br>  <br>  We moved in grade 2 and I can see the bus stop from our front step now so she and her little brother go by themselves now, I just look to be sure that other kids are there before letting either of them go by themselves, or they have to wait for each other.  <br>  <br>  Could you see the bus stop if you just go to the end of the driveway/sidewalk?  If so, I would let her go herself as long as there are already other kids at the bus stop.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	First of all, the world is exactly as safe as it was when you were 8. The only difference is that you hear about it now.<br>  <br>  I walked to the bus stop alone when I was 7, it a a few blocks from my house, the majority of the distance was around a corner and out of view of my house.<br>  <br>  At 11 I started walking to and from school which was halfway across town on my own, because I was fed up with the buses. About the middle of winter my parents found out I was walking to school.<br>  <br>  This would have been late 90's, early 00's, seeing as I'm 18 at the moment.<br>  <br>  My parents never had this freak out over it, it was as soon as I knew the route I walked myself.<br>  <br>  In fact, I remember distinctly in the other town I was living in during K-1 that I and two other kids my age would walk from school to the babysitter's place, which was across the street, through a field, and then three blocks away. This was at about 5 or 6.|`|zoD71BuKaa	I would suggest just going out to your mailbox to make sure she gets on the bus... Instead of standing on the porch... Even if she doesn't want you to, it will be a comfort to YOU to see that she gets on the bus, and since she is 8, that is still a little young... I still drive my sis to her bus stop, but her bus stop is about a quarter mile from our house. Isn't that crazy? My sister is six, and she would have to walk almost a quarter of a mile to her bus stop!! As for when you were younger compared to now, I think you are right... These are different times, and I don't think it's safe anymore. <br>  <br>  However, if she really wants to go alone, are there other moms that wait with their children at the bus stop? If so, you could walk her to the bus stop, and then once there are other parents there, you could go back home... That way, she technically is waiting at the bus stop alone, but there are OTHER parents there watching their own kids, but I'm sure they wouldn't allow anything to happen to your daughter. :)|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Does she have to walk _alone_? I would see if there's a slightly older child who she can walk with, at least initially.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	better safe than sorry...you cant go back in time and refix anything IF it did happen ..she is 8 . Anyone can pick her up and toss her in a car
fYMWDQLGaa	hey hunnnn i got BFP toay morning ... tons of thanks to you.... :)<br>  <br>  i have posted with pic!!!!<br>  <br>  thanks again........|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Yup!!!  Just got her question in my inbox.  She's one pregnant Momma!!!  I knew it!  =)|`|DN6XtoViaa	i've been waiting to hear from her too! i hope she got it! :)|`|2nfMSDiPaa	Hi mommy to be Yep she's got her BFP in Digital!!!just now I saw her post!!!Im so happy for her!!!
cAtWxJG1aa	We took our kids, like yours of varied ages, and it was perfect for all of them.  I would go back if we were down there again.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	I haven't brought my children yet, but I am planning to. I have home videos of me going there as a child, and it looked like so much fun!  It's perfect for young children.
vCq3dR40aa	Yes, it is OK and healthy.  Congrats for creating such healthy night sleep habits for your baby.<br>  <br>  Does she nap too?<br>  <br>  From Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child, 90% of infants sleep less than 13 hours of night sleep.  (50% is almost 12 hours)  So your girl is doing just fine.  <br>  <br>  Please don't try to feed her while she is sleeping.<br>  1.  You could cause a night waking problem<br>  2.  You could cause excess gas<br>  3.  Your baby doesn't need it.<br>  4,  Would you like someone to wake you up in the middle of the night by shoving a bottle in your mouth?|`|hbjbm3SRaa	I think that's fine. My son has been sleeping 12 hours a night since he was 3 months old and now he's a year old and the pediatrician said it's great that he's sleeping so long. It would have been a concern when your child was a newborn but I think that since he/she is past a year old it's fine. You should be happy they sleep that long because a lot of parents aren't so lucky.|`|O7U1tUaJaa	it is normal and don't try to feed her while she is sleeping that's just dumb.  twelve hours is great and even one to two 2-3 hour naps a day is still recommended.  As a baby gets older they sleep more and more up to 13 hours a night.  then around 2-4 yrs they start sleeping less and less until they get beck to a regular 8 hour schedule with at least one nap during the day.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes. A 13 month old can sleep all night and wake up in the morning and eat.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Yes!  And count yourself lucky!  My oldest slept anywhere from 10-13 hours from 8 months on.  They will get what they need during the day and if she gets hungry or thirsty she'll wake.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I assume this is at night? The yes its great that she is sleeping that long. Babies at that age need 11-14 hours total of sleep, most of it at night and maybe a nap or two. As long as she is eating and drinking plenty during the day, its fine for her to go that long without eating or drinking!|`|emKXU1QFaa	It's fine. She should still be sleeping 14ish hrs a day so that plus a nap.  Her body is getting use to eating and drinking during the day only so she doesn't need to wake up as much during the night.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	Yes - at this age, if shes hungry or thirsty shell let you know about it!<br>  <br>  You should be happy at all the sleep your getting! lol! <br>  <br>  If your concerned, give her a quick feed just before you go to bed!|`|oiJITSNZaa	If that's a 12 hour night that is perfectly fine. Even my 31/2 year old sleeps 12 hours at a time. Good Luck
mcmOslOFaa	I love that you asked this question...lol!  I have 2 daughters that have to get ready for school (9 and 7 years old)  and I think I would rather roll around naked in a blizzard sometimes then have to get them up and ready for school!  Then when I get them to the bus stop, we sit there waiting for the bus and they start fighting AGAIN!!  Ugh!  Sometimes its ok, but my girls are not morning people...lol, I am, but their daddies are not so I guess thats where they get it. How about you?  You never told us how your mornings are?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	No|`|yrDqtazLaa	They do when we wake them up early to take them to the sitter so I can go to work. My 2 year old won't eat, and he will kick and scream when we try to get him dressed. My 1 year old is better, he will eat and won't fuss when we dress him.|`|8tGAE1Nmaa	Yep my youngest son does... every morning he throws a fit and acts up so finally today was the day he got 1 week grounded off toys, tv, dvds, games, and a early bedtime of 630pm.. we told him if his behavior improves we will shave off one day for every day of good behavior... but this goes on every morning... also my son has adhd and oppositional defiance disorder...|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Only if she didn't go to bed at a decent time or if she has a test that day. Other then that she is pretty good.<br>  <br>  However, I am wil Charli on the coffee thing. God's nature anti-depressant.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	No, I wear ear plugs, and drink coffee.<br>  <br>  I am immune till at least 11|`|0v55bQT1aa	No, they go to bed 8:30 p.m sharp. We have a weekly routine.

Ela3o96Raa	If you have been induced with all of your other children then chances are, you will be induced this time also. I am also 38 weeks pregnant, almost 39. I just went for my weekly OB visit yesterday and we found out that he wanted to induce me on Monday the 10th. This is my second child - my first was a augmented labor (my water broke, wasnt progressing beyond 4 centimeters so pitocin was used). I am so happy to find out that he will be arriving on Monday - we are so excited and I am sooo ready, so I know just how you feel! <br>  <br>  Maybe on your next OB visit you can talk with your doctor and see if he/she would agree to an induction, if that is what you really want. I dont see the harm in it if you are full term and baby is healthy, although Im sure there will be some people who will tell you how wrong you are for wanting your baby out sooner than later. And dont let anyone scare you by talking about all the "risks" involved. If you and your baby are healthy and full term - why not?<br>  <br>  Im sending good labor vibes your way and who knows? Maybe you will end up going into labor before he/she even decides on an induction!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|QhCy2009aa	I think doctors are just so ready to induce mothers today to benefit their schedule. I was adamant about wanting to go natural with all of mine (4) and i even went past my due date etc.. and if everything is healthy between the 2 of you, then you should express to your doctor that it is something that you really want to try for.<br>  Good luck and you can do it!!
1z3C0R2Vaa	so i heard don't know if it is true i wish you luck.......)|`|xoQxDGAlaa	I have read that zinc will help sperm. I have a natural remedies book that told me evening primrose oil was good for both male and female reproduction (even though the bottle talks about female PMS symptoms). I've tried them both and are still TTC #1. Another one of my contacts said maca (I think) but I'd never heard of it. Probably a multi vitamin and a well rounded diet and exercise (not biking) will help. Good health. Best of luck to you.
AA11048627	my 1st labour was really awful 17 1/2 hours i had to be induced i had all the pain relief and eventually asked for an epidural which still didnt work after 3 hours of pushing the midwife eventually decided he was stuck (i cuda told her that already lol) i was given a spinal for pain and they rushed me to theater where it took 6 attempts with forceps before being born<br>  <br>  2nd labour was so easy was only 7 hours long i started myself off with lots of sex then went into labour 4 hours later we took the drive to hospital and i had some diamorphine it was fantastic and i slept most of the way through my labour eventually pain started getting bit worse so midwife examined me n my waters broke and i had 2 push summer was born 10 mins later<br>  <br>  so all in all i would say it was so much easier with my 2nt baby i think it was because i was more relaxed and knew what to expect|`|7PXFXcKfaa	Yea it sounds terrible ... <br>  <br>  But tbh i wouldnt worry about it too much - if your high risk they will keep  an extra close eye on you. <br>  <br>  Every labour is different - dont worry.|`|AA10424047	Neither of my labours were horrible, it was my recovery with my first that was horrible. I went into labour naturally with both of them. My daughter was 2 days before her due date, my son 12 days before his. I was in labour for 8 hours, 55 minutes with my daughter, and only had 15 minutes of pushing. I had gotten the epidural 1 hour, 25 minutes before she was born. The nurses told me I wouldn't go before midnight, so they gave it to me, then checked my cervix, and I was already at 8cm. I pushed from 5:10pm to 5:25pm, when I started to throw up. As I threw up, my daughter came out, head, shoulder, knees, toes, all at once. My little 6lbs 6ozer gave me 86 stitches on her way out, which too over 4 months to heal.<br>  <br>  With my son, I went to the hospital at 4am, 2cm dilated. They sent me home at 7:30am telling me I was in false labour, since I wasn't due for another 12 days. I hadn't dilated any further. By the time I got home, I was contracting every 2 minutes, not even baths helped. I was on my hands and knees constantly, my daughter was crying because I was in pain. Thankfully my in-laws were visiting from Hungary, and my step-mother-in-law was a midwife.<br>  <br>  I went back to the hospital at 9:30am and the nurse wanted to triage me to make sure I was actually having contractions. When she saw that I couldn't sit still, she decided to check my cervix. 7cm. Yup, 2cm to 7cm in 2 hours.<br>  <br>  My husband called my mom, the conversation went:<br>  <br>  Mike: Brandi's in Labour.<br>  Mom: How many cm?<br>  Mike: 7<br>  Mom: click<br>  <br>  11am, they broke my water, still at 7cm. 11:03am, I was 10cm, 11:15am, my son was born..no epidural, no puking, and only 7 stitches,<br>  <br>  I'd do labour with my son again in a heartbeat. I was up and walking an hour after he was born.|`|KVBTtF9faa	I didn't labor with my twins as they were my first and when my water broke I ended with a c section. I didn't experience contractions or anything with them. So skip ahead to the second pregnancy... My first labor was not so bad, I was pretty relaxed through it. My second labor was hell, thanks to the damn nursing staff who just wouldn't leave me alone. The hospital had no rooms for birthing so I had to labor in triage, and fight with the nurses who wanted to do a bunch of interventions, which I wouldn't allow for because I know interventions cause more harm and risks to me and the baby. But my 3rd labor was beautiful. It was 100% painless (without pain medication!!!) and in the birthing center. It was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. I had candles lit, was in a jaccuzi bath tub, and had music playing. It was perfect, I was able to just relax and breathe and joke with my husband. <br>  <br>  Now granted, a major difference between you and me is that it sounds like you had a complicated/high risk pregnancy where as I had low risk and no complications. <br>  <br>  Having inductions and being in the hospital are going to pose all sorts of risks that wouldn't normally show up if you were to just let the body do it's thing.<br>  <br>  Keep this in mind: Every pregnancy and every labor are different. My first labor (all my vaginal births were  natural, no interventions, no pain medications) was 6 hours, my second was 4, my 3rd was 2 hours.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	Oh God, that sounds like a real time of it you had, bless! With my first, I went 5 days overdue, my contractions started at 5.30am, started pushing at 11.30pm and he was born at 12.13am. I had no trouble at all with my first although I did have a lot of gas and air and the morphine injection in my ***! With baby no.2, I went early 38wks, and contractions started that night at 2.20am and I had him by 9.27am. He was very distressed during labour and had to be monitored with clips on the top of his head and my heart rate and blood pressure were continually monitored. This freaked me out a bit as my first baby was no problem. When no.2 came out, it took a while (felt like a lifetime) to hear him cry but he was fine in the end. Oxygen levels were monitored for 2 days in hospital but he's now 4 1/2 mths and just as lively as my first. I would definitely say no two births are the same! Good Luck and try not to worry x|`|PpXXftTTaa	my first labour was not like yours with mine i just had back labour no contractions at all. i was in labour for 10hrs my second labour lasted 55Min's i almost had her in the loo. my third i had him at home and it was great that lasted 2 hrs because he could not break the membrane of my waters once the midwife snapped them with her fingers he gusted out with my waters. please don't worry no two labours are the same.|`|WhQFJkLiaa	my 1st labor was horrible! i went into labor 4 times before my due date and then when my water broke i was stuck in the hospital until i delivered and then 4 days after due to blood loss..i haven't had a 2nd or 3rd though so i can't answer that. but i've heard from all of my friends with several children have told me the first was the worst and 2nd was better and the third came out like nothing!|`|Nnw9XM8Caa	im 23 , 1st baby boy 2nd jan., my labour was ok actual didnt hurt, gas n air,3 hours labour started at 4.10am and finshed 7.10am he was born. stayed in 2 days due to 3rd degree tear as he come out like superman, so overall fanastic labour and a gorgeous baby boy.|`|7B6PxDzYaa	At 42 was induced didn't work was taken into hospital and induce every 12 hours for over a week, kept in a labour ward for over a week, I was bored and Im self employed and could of been working rather than that.  Anyway the baby went into distress and 10 medical staff ran into the room and they gave me an epidural took me into theatre and cut me open (only the epidural had not worked as they were so keen to get the baby out, I was screaming) then they gave me a general to knock me out and was then kept in the high depency unit for a week (which was pretty good as a least they bring you lots of cups of tea, loads of one to one breastfeeding, infact I was waited on with my own nurse, brill or what) .  Then I was moved to a ward and discharged myself within 24 hours, cause other women's screaming babies due to these mother's who were having difficulty breast feeding and refused to give them formula, even though their child looked straved doing my head in, thought I would leave them to it, as I had to get back to work as I am a single mother, besides it is hard being in hospital with no man for support if you are surrounded by caring and attentive husbands.  <br>  <br>  I would go through it all again for my son.  Yes birth is difficult but you forget.  As for 2 and 3rd as my Grandma used to say the road is now made.|`|O7U1tUaJaa	With my first it my labor was long and miserable.  I was at the hospital for 16 hours before having her and it was almost unberable.  with my second, I went to the hospital at 11:00 at 12 my water broke and at 1:30 I gave birth.  I pushed 2 times and she was out.  it was a complete breeze.  Same with my 3rd he came out in two hours and 2 pushes.  It's so much easier with your second, third, fourth...because your body knows what to do already and so do you.  It comes back you just did it yesterday.  the difference, for me anyway, was incredible.|`|QCVzUC1baa	Blimey sounds like you really went through it.<br>  <br>  Mine wasn't great either. My waters broke after a stretch and sweep at 41+1 weeks then my contractions started about 3 hours later. I was at home and could deal with them at first but after about 9 hours I was struggling and really wanted a bath but believe it or not our boiler broke that day! So no hot water my TENS machine helped a little but I just wanted to be in hospital and get some drugs. So we went in and they gave me some pethidine which did nothing. :-(<br>  Then still in labour they told me I was going to be induced as my waters had broken 24 hours a go. By this time I had the wonderful epidural followed by more hours and hours of labour. I only got to 8cm as I had a big baby for my size. Which meant after 41 hours of labour I had a csection. <br>  Then after all that 2 days with no sleep my LO was rushed to intensive care as they thought he had an infection as my waters had broken so long a go. He had to go on to anti biotics for 3 days. So I was in hospital for 6 days no fun and was so pleased to go home with Henry.|`|p5zvl7hIaa	My first birth I was induced for on set pre-eclampsia.  The birth wasn't too bad.  My only regret would be I had an epidural.  This slowed the contractions down and the birth.  Although the birth only took 7 1/2 hours.<br>  <br>  My second I was also induced because I was 11 days over due.  Although not long after being proded ready for inducement I went in to labour.  I had gas and air this time and the birth lasted about 2 hours.<br>  <br>  I'm due to give birth with my 3rd in 2 weeks time so I am just open minded how this one will go.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	Your story sounds traumatic... I had bad labor but not like that.  I can't imagine you would go through the same thing again.  <br>  My first labor was 3 hrs, my doc said it was 24hrs packed in 3 hrs.. she said it was "intense".  My second was only 45 min once they broke my water. and my third was overnight because they didn't brake my water until the morning. (and I always go super fast once they brake the water) like 10pm-9:30am.  I never had an epidural, the idea of something in my spine freaks me out.. but I had nubien and demerol with the others (based on what was acceptable at the time)  I plan to go with nubien with #4 due in august.
VMASMHX6aa	If you are seeing a definite thermal shift and your temps stay elevated until af arrives, then yes, you can assume that you have ovulated.<br>  <br>  If you have an avoulatory cycle then your temp never rises for more than a day before it goes back down again. Believe me, I've temped for a few anovulatory cycles and the charts look very different to my ovulatory cycles.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i think if ur temp goes up then u def ovulated coz temp goes up because of progesterone level increasing and progesterone is produced in later half of cycle by corpus luteum  and corpus luteum is formed by the remanents of the egg realsed soo all of these r interconnected. Hope u understand my point.<br>  BABY dUST.
5ZCoL4vEaa	yea,waiting for your period to start if your TTC is pretty frustrating lol But just to be on the safe side,I would wait until its late to get your hopes up. Iv been trying myself and completly understand how you feel. Im now 13 days late and getting negative HPT. Pray for me please,Im praying for you!!! best of luck!!!|`|oiJITSNZaa	There's no way to tell. Dont get your hopes too high cause then you just have all the further to fall. Good Luck!|`|AIskV0efaa	i dont believe so. you may just not be showing signs of your period. if you get your body too worked up about a baby you can end up miossing a period or even having signs of pregnancy
O3EtP4vOaa	Everyones temps will be different, you need to look at your base line and then at what temp you average after ovulating.  If you then take another jump up and you have high temps for over 16 days w/o a drop in temps that is called a tri-phasic bbt and indicates you are pregnant.  You should have a temp decrease the day of/day before AF comes a callin', if you stay high (above your base line) you should take a hpt you may be preggers!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|V8JoRHnnaa	in later half of ur cycle ur temp goes up but a day or two before AF it falls down. iF it stays higher then u should get HPT<br>  Baby Dust :)
D0oqTblpaa	8 weeks was around the time my husband started noticing a difference with my second pregnancy.  The first one he didn't know until I did at 12 weeks. <br>  <br>  You are plenty pregnant for a pee stick.  Best of Luck.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Your cervix was probably higher and more firm. There is no way that the penis can pass through the cervix. The tiny whole is only big enough for microscopic sperm to pass through. The cervix is like a tiny donut. It doesn't dilate unless your in labor. So I am guessing that your cervix must have been in a different postion. Which is very possible as it changes position throughout your cycle. Also if you were pregnant your cervix would be completely closed. So there is no way that he was hitting your uterus. Female anatomy can be very confusing! lol So are you late for your period? You should take a test. If you are pregnant your cervix may be a little bit softer. Ohh and also if you think your pregnant and very early in the pregnancy your uterus is still 2 small to feel. You may feel a little bloating tho! Neways GOOD LUCK HUN!!! I hope you get your BFP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|S1gJJHNzaa	i think likely your cervix is low and that is what he is hitting, my hubby has told me that too.  (low cervix usually means no pregnancy)<br>  <br>  are your bbs sore, that's always my first symptom and at 6-8 weeks your bbs would for sure be sore.. not like just a little sore like after ovulation or right before your period but nipple, bbs sore sore.<br>  <br>  good luck and God bless!|`|FMmncxToaa	Did you try to take a first morning urine hpt? Also, you should have a blood test done which is more accurate during early pregnancy.Good luck!|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	Hmmm, that is a hard one. My husband never mentioned that one but I wish he would have being that I am about 3 months pregnant and didn't know! haha<br>  <br>  Well, if you are about 6-8 weeks then it is ok to take a test now. Go ahead and get a First Response... I took that 4 days before I was due with my 1st son.<br>  He is 7 month.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Maybe that's so, take a test. Or maybe your cervix was low due to ovulation and the other night was it.  Good Luck|`|DN6XtoViaa	take a test :) wouldn't that be a nice surprise! (if that is what you want! lol)<br>  <br>  good luck!
EdB0ghKwaa	This is quite a common problem, and you have done well to breastfeed for this long!  I don't think it's an issue to give some formula at this stage, he has already received enough of your anti-bodies from your milk to help with his health, and it is more important at this stage that he is putting on weight.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up over this, I'm sure you will find that other mothers have done the same. You are not failing him, you have already given him the best start to life you could!  My sister had to supplement her first son with formula when he was only a month old, as he was a very hungry baby, and she couldn't make enough milk to satisfy him.  He is now a very intelligent and healthy 12 year old!|`|hbjbm3SRaa	That really doesn't sound like enough formula you're giving him. When my son was that age I was giving him about 6 oz 3 to 4 times a day so you might want to be giving him more at a time so that you don't have to feed him so frequently.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My son wanted to eat constantly. And when he wasn't eating he was crying. When he was 2mo, I took him to the dr for that reason. He hadn't gained any weight since his last appt. At that time I wasn't working, and therefore not pumping, so I had no idea how much he was getting. But since he wasn't gaining weight, I obviously wasn't producing enough milk for him. My dr suggested supplementing formula. So when he was 2mo I started supplementing formula. The change in him was amazing! He went a while longer in between feedings, and he no longer cried constantly, and he started gaining weight.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If you can't pump enough to meet his needs, yes, you can supplement with formula.<br>  <br>  However, his intake actually sounds pretty reasonable.(7 feeds a day is fine for a 5 month old.)   If he's satisified with what he's getting, he's probably fine. (He gets more when he nurses.)  Remember that babies DON'T gain weight steadily, and he might be due for a growth spurt.  I'd probably hold off for a few weeks and get him weighed again. If his gain is still slow, then consider supplementing.|`|oiJITSNZaa	If you think he needs more and your body can't provide definitely formula is the road to take with the extra bottle. Don't fell bad he will get all the nutrients he needs from you in those other 3 or 4. Good Luck|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Your not doing anything wrong by giving him formula. In a perfect world, moms wouldnt have to work adn babies could nurse on demand but hey we dont live in a world like that and a lot of moms have to work. Your baby should be bottle fed just like he is breastfed, as much as he wants as often as he wants. If he wants more, then he needs to have formula. he should be fed until he pulls away and stops sucking, not just when he runs out of breast milk.<br>  <br>   Formula won't hurt your baby, and he probably wont be taking more than 8 ounces a day of it and the rest breastmilk. He will be getting all the benefits of your milk plus the extra calories he needs from the formula. Just make sure he gets the breastmilk first and formula after and keep up the pumping as much as you can. Good luck!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	It is better for a baby to have some breast milk and some formula than no breastmilk at all.<br>  <br>  Lots of breastfeeding moms will say don't give formula.  And lots of them dislike when I promote doing both... but you can't please everyone.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you're trying!  It is better for you to continue pumping as best you can, but also supplement.  By introducing formula, you do have some other things to think about though.  Your baby will have to learn how to process a totally different product and he might have some belly aches.  There might be a couple of weeks where he gets used to the formula.  And you might have to try different kinds to find one he likes.  It isn't as good as your milk, but it won't kill him either.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to keep up your pumping though - don't give up.  If supplementing him once/twice a day helps him gain weight and takes some pressure off you so that you can continue pumping without stress then I say go for it.  Good luck!|`|z6IekuwSaa	The goal is always a happy healthy child. If supplementing helps you acheive that goal then there is absolutely nothing at all wrong with it Just keep up what you're doing, add formula when you need to and don't when you don't have to. Just the fact that you're worried shows how much you care for your LO
dFHsAXDMaa	Hi as a nurse I will tell you that I always used baby oil you have to leave it on for about 15 minutes to soften it then use one of those men type combs the black one with teeth close together and comb his hair very gently scraping scalp to remove it... if he does not have a lot of hair you can also use one of those bath scrunchy things will help gently exfoilate scalp  it is kind of yucky when it comes off but really just dead dry skin building up. loofa or bath scrunchy works great for babies with little of no hair...but leave the baby oil on for at least 15 minutes so it has time to soak in good.. my oldest daughter also had this and it was like an ongoing battle for first few months then just kind of stopped as her hair grew in ridiculously thick. <br>  <br>  Nappy rash is not related..but the key to getting rid of it is changing diaper very often. and keep applying ointment you need to make sure you clean him well to avoid hurting him or stinging do not use diaper wipes ( they could be the problem could be allergic) use a luke warm face cloth and pat him not rub.. you also might want to try cloth nappies for a few day as they breathe better than plastic backed ones.<br>  <br>  good luck and enjoy your little one they grow up too fast my baby one of 4 now is graduating from High school this year seems like yesterday I was treating her scalp.|`|BJERgbM5aa	If the timodine doesn't work, (it didn't work for me), try zinc ointment or zinc oxide ointment/cream.  Over - the - counter at pharmacy.  not expensive.  Good Luck.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	The common advice of applying (vegetable or mineral) oil liberally to the scalp and letting it soak in overnight or for lesser periods of time seems to conflict with the fact that Malassezia yeasts thrive in oily environments. If the cradle cap is not severe, you may try to comb it out gently after bathing. The softened scales can then be brushed away with a soft brush, comb or cloth, but if not done very gently, this can worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. There has been no study done on these recommendations.<br>  <br>  Applying petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning.<br>  <br>  Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales.<br>  <br>  There is broad disagreement regarding the role of shampoos. Some sources warn against frequent shampooing, others recommend it. Mild baby shampoo is often recommended, while never specifying what "mild" actually means. Baby shampoos often contain detergent surfactants, perfumes, quaternium-15 and other eczemagenic irritants. Again, no studies have been performed.<br>  <br>  Keratolytic (dandruff) shampoos (e.g with sulfur, selenium, zinc pyrithione, or salicylic acid) are generally not recommended as they sting eyes and may worsen the dermatitis. In stubborn cases some doctors do recommend them while others warn against the use of medicated shampoos in newborns due to systemic absorption. Dandruff shampoos often contain sodium dodecyl sulfate, a noted skin irritant.[1]<br>  <br>  Steroid and tar preparations have also been used but have significant drawbacks. Immunomodulators (tacrolimus/Protopic, pimecrolimus/Elidel) have not been approved for babies under two years.<br>  <br>  Ketoconazole shampoos and creams are taking first place in medical treatment of moderate to serious cradle cap. Research so far indicates that this anti-fungal medication is not absorbed into the bloodstream. Ketoconazole shampoo is currently made with a number of problematic irritants and allergens.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	How long do you leave the oil on his scalp?  Mineral oil should work, but another type would be better for his skin.  Even vegetable or olive oil.  Leave it on for a good 10 minutes, then scrape the cradle cap off.  It will work.  And there's no relation between the cradle cap and diaper rash.  Sometimes there could be a relation between teething and diaper rash, but not this. Best wishes.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	I know you said you tried baby oil but did you put it on and let it sit for a little while.

Cradle cap is actually a fungal infection. He said just to get dandruff shampoo, it has 1% something zinc and to wash her head with it 2-3 times a week until gone. But make sure it doesn't get in her eyes!!!

With nappy rash i tend to put talc on his bottom every time i changed him to keep him nice and dry,also let them have a kick around on there changing mat without a nappie to let some air get to there bottom should dry it up a little. I hope i helped.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My daughter had it too.  Everyone told me to put baby oil on it.  I did.  It didn't get any better.  Then my hair dresser sister came to town and told me I was doing it wrong.  You put the oil on and let it sit for about15 minutes.  Take a soft bristle brush and rub all over baby's head so that the oil is absorbed into the scalp and not just staying on the hair.  Then take a baby comb and gently scrape off flakes.  I had to to this about 3 times, with 2-3 days in between each "scraping" before most of it came off.  Good luck!|`|eYkWFU4Zaa	when you used the baby oil, did you use a baby brush with it? or just leave it sitting on the scalp? if not, try that, take a soft baby brush and just do circular motions over the area that has baby oil on it. for the diaper rash, it could be a yeast infection, my son gets them all the time and the regular baby creams dont take it away, one thing that will most likely work is to put 3-4 drops of tea tree oil in his bath , or you could try putting some cornstarch on the rashy area. (make sure his skin is dry though)|`|oiJITSNZaa	All I can say is my baby battles with cradle cap and while her dr recommended putting on baby oil a few minutes before bath time then washing it out it didn't seem to help.

a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	I miscarried in 2005 and i did not even know i was pregnant.<br>  <br>  I started my period that may and it was normal. Then a few days after it stopped i started bleeding again but it was brown and my husband & mom made me think i was having another period (which never happens to me but i believed it)<br>  But i started hurting bad in my belly and back also i was tired. Not once did i think "i could be pregnant".<br>  After 5 days of this i went to the ER and they drew blood (cause i figured maybe it was a cyst or something causing me this pain/bleeding) but the doctor came in and said your pregnant. They then hooked me up to an IV because they put me in the hospital, done an ultrasound and it showed nothing was in my uterus. I had done miscarried. I did not have to have a D&C.

No clots. I had pain in my stomach and back plus felt run down.<br>  <br>  And do you know i started my period the next month when it was time for it, it was not late or anything. This was something i would have never even knew about if i hadn't of gone to the er.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	I never knew I was pregnant at the time and was in the same situation that you have stated.<br>  I had been on my period for 16 days and then went to the doctor who told me I was pregnant. He sent me to the hospital and they told me I was having a miscarrage.|`|fbguVOiQaa	A more heavier period than usual, maybe clotting and stomach cramps|`|eth48m7Iaa	you would know because you would probably have cramping or a lot of bleeding|`|GxJL9UjVaa	miscarriages are very painful and usually come with A LOT of bleeding and clots|`|ibg67Xtvaa	How often do miscarriages occur?<br>  About 15 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Most of them occur in the first 13 weeks, or first trimester.<br>  <br>  Does age affect miscarriage rates?<br>  For women in their 20s and early 30s, the chance of miscarriage is about 15 percent. At 35 the chance of miscarrying rises to one in four, and at 40 the miscarriage rate is close to one in three.<br>  <br>  What causes miscarriages?<br>  Most early pregnancy losses are due to genetics and cannot be prevented. But losing a pregnancy doesn't mean that anything is wrong with a woman's health or that she can't have more children. Ninety percent of women who have one miscarriage go on to have a healthy pregnancy. Despite the fact that recurrent miscarriages may increase the risk of future pregnancy losses, even women who have had three or more miscarriages in a row may have a good chance of carrying the next pregnancy to term. However, these recurrent miscarriages may be an indication of problems that require medical help.<br>  <br>  What are the symptoms of miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Vaginal bleeding that may be preceded by a brownish discharge <br>  Cramps in the pelvic area <br>  Tissue or blood clots passing from the vagina <br>  A decrease in the usual signs of early pregnancy, such as nausea and breast tenderness <br>  Pain in the lower back or abdomen <br>  <br>  What are the warning signs of miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Spotting or bleeding without pain <br>  Heavy bleeding with severe abdominal pain <br>  A gush of fluid from your vagina but no pain or bleeding <br>  <br>  What will the doctor want to know?<br>  Your doctor will ask you to describe your symptoms. She'll also want to know whether or not you've passed tissue out of your vagina. If you have passed tissue, save it in a sterile container for later examination.<br>  <br>  How will my doctor be able to confirm a miscarriage?<br>  Your doctor will give you an internal pelvic examination. This will determine the size of your uterus and reveal whether your cervix is open. An ultrasound will be performed to confirm whether or not your baby still has a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  You will also have a blood test to check your hormone levels; decreases in pregnancy hormone levels may indicate that you've miscarried.<br>  Can miscarriages be prevented?<br>  A miscarriage that is about to occur usually can't be prevented. But you might be able to decrease your chances of miscarrying by taking good care of yourself early in your pregnancy and not smoking, drinking, or taking drugs. If you've had several miscarriages in a row, your doctor may recommend genetic testing to see whether you or your partner carry any chromosomal abnormalities that affect the egg or sperm.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may also give you instructions to reduce your risk of miscarriage. These can include putting your feet up for the day, avoiding intercourse for a short period of time, or avoiding some forms of exercise.<br>  <br>  What happens if I do miscarry?<br>  After a miscarriage, any remaining tissue may be removed by dilation and curettage (D&C). This procedure involves dilating the cervix and gently scraping the tissue from the lining of the uterus.<br>  <br>  You can expect spotting and some discomfort for a few days. However, call your doctor if you experience heavy bleeding, fever, chills, or severe pain — these can be signs of an infection. Your doctor will probably want to see you again in a few weeks to check your recovery.<br>  <br>  It is generally recommended that women not try to get pregnant for three months after a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  I've had several miscarriages. What does this mean for my current pregnancy?<br>  If you have had repeated miscarriages, future pregnancies should be planned, diagnosed early, and monitored carefully.<br>  <br>  Get a complete medical work up before you try to get pregnant again and try to have the cause of your earlier miscarriages diagnosed and treated by your doctor.<br>  <br>  As soon as you think you're pregnant, seek prenatal care. The sooner you can receive any care you need, the more likely that you will delivery a healthy, full-term baby.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to follow your doctor's instructions. She can instruct you on keeping you and your fetus healthy.|`|ROJans2Taa	an early miscarriage usually resembles a slightly heavier then normal period, unfortunately it's estimated in up to 50% of women experience  an early miscarriage and never know, symptoms generally dont appear until the 5th week of pregnancy which would be 1 week past start date of period, usually most women get menstrual like cramps around the expected start of their periods when they are indeed pregnant. unless you get blood work done soon after, you may never know, best luck|`|yrDqtazLaa	The signs of a miscarriage are painful menstrual-like cramps, heavy clotting, and red/bright red bleeding. If your cramps are the same as they normally are and you didn't have heavy clotting (it's normal to pass clots when you're on your period, but if it's a miscarriage, the clots will be bigger and there will be more of them) then it's probably not a miscarriage.
MubTZUKXaa	OK, we all know it would be illegal for them to sack you for being pregnant but the point is that you are probably still on trial until you've been there a certain period of time so they can let you go for any reason.  For E.G they can let you go and  just say that you are not suitable for the job.... even if they were obviously letting you go because you are pregnant. After your trial period they obviously couldn't let you go without a good reason.. they have a system they must follow... disciplinary etc and you have rights to object.<br>  <br>  Definitely wait until you have passed that trial/set amount of time before you tell them (can be up to 3/6 months).  After this time you should sign the proper contract and you will then be protected from being sacked.  Until then you're not protected at all.<br>  They may not want to let you go just because you are pregnant but you can't afford to take the risk!  You will have a little baby to think about :-)<br>  <br>  If I were you I would def keep it quiet xxxx Good luck with your baby!|`|WhQFJkLiaa	this was a problem at my place of work! i knew it was because the girl that got fired before i began working was 7 months pregnant and couldn't do the lifting and all. i didn't tell my bosses until i was 4 months! by that time they had grown to like me as a person and didn't think i was just using the job for money until i had the baby and so i could get a paid maternity leave.  however, once i told them they did change their attitudes towards me..and so did my coworkers so its all up to you and how you think they will react!|`|JDw1RDcaaa	they cant get rid of you cuz ur pregnant thats against the law but they dont have to pay u maternity cuz u have to be there over a year to claim it, you have to claim maternity allowance off the government when you are 11 weeks from your due date, but u do need a later from ur employer to day that they will not pay you and why.|`|UXwFJOwuaa	its illegal for them to fire you for that. but if you are worried try asking someone to tell for you. get legal advice or advise from a citizens advice bureau... you will be fine... <br>  <br>  ps congrats on baby|`|9osFXKPyaa	i had a friend that got a settlement for getting fired for being pregnant and after the settlement she got her job back with a payment for $15,000.|`|ibg67Xtvaa	i think you should tell them but do some research about it online iso you go into it educated and get the wool pulled over your eyes good luck|`|3w7ekDQJaa	it's illegal for them to fire you just because you're pregnent.|`|eth48m7Iaa	just tell them the truth. they can't fire you for that|`|AA11510511	If you have worked for them for 26 weeks, at the point of 15 weeks before your baby is due, then they are obliged to give maternity leave to you.|`|yrDqtazLaa	It is illegal for them to fire you because you're pregnant, but companies are starting to do a lot of things and are able to get away with it. If you work for a crappy team, they might try to find ways to get rid of you without having to say it's because you're pregnant. I hope you work for a good company, they won't do that if they're good people. But, by law, if you haven't been employed with them for a year when you go on maternity leave, they do not have to hold your job for you until you get back. You need to tell them the truth and see how they react. If they react negatively, I would suggest finding another job now before you get too far along. Time is of the essence, my dear.|`|mCDopsLEaa	They can fire you, however, they can't do it legally. I would tell your senior and don't mention anything about keeping it secret, just tell her you wanted to let her know first as far as finding someone to do your job while you are out on maternity leave. If they fire you, you have a wonderful wrongful termination case.|`|wxImZRssaa	You don't have many rights till you've worked there for 3 months (so they could fire you for no reason). So wait till you've been there 3 months before you tell them.<br>  <br>  You have to have worked there for 6 months to be entitled to maternity pay. That's if you live in the UK.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	i've been with the same company for 8 years and i didn't tell them until i was 4 months pregnant|`|claUGpVRaa	Are you in the UK?<br>  <br>  If so, your employer cannot get rid of you to avoid having to pay you, it would be illegal. Google Maternity law. Now every woman is entitled to mat leave regardless of how long they have been with the company and your employer is not allowed to make you redundant or sack you until your return to work date (you can legally take 1 yr off and they have to keep your job open)<br>  Re pay, usually you  only get mat pay if you have completed 26 weeks of work by 15 weeks before you are due. If not, you wil still get maternity allowance from the government but the firm still has to honour your job, and cannot discriminate. He also has to complete a risk assessment on you when you tell them officially as they are not allowed to put you or your baby n any danger throughout your pregnancy because of what you do. If you do a job that puts baby in danger they have to provide you with lighter duties. All the rights are with you so enjoy them!  All your benefits have to stay intact as well through mat leave (ie any discounts etc)<br>  The sooner you tell them the more secure your job is (if that helps??)<br>  <br>  Good luck
7PXFXcKfaa	mmm i dont think its such a problem - most babies have cold hands and feet due to bad circulation.<br>  <br>  If your concerned though try speaking to your doc.
oiJITSNZaa	Day 1 of your cycle is considered the first day that your period starts. Therefore day 5 would be five days after the first day|`|5ZCoL4vEaa	yes it is 5 days from the first day your period starts.

DN6XtoViaa	this is a tricky question but i'll try my hardest to give a good answer :)<br>  <br>  i'm guessing the period from Feb 5th to Feb 26 was not normal for you.. that would be a 21 day cycle.. the period from Jan 5th to Feb 6th would be a 33 day cycle... soooooo<br>  <br>  i'm going to guess that you will start your next period anywhere from the 28th of march to the 31st... which means you will probably ovulate around the 17th of march..<br>  <br>  to be on the safe side i'd recomend BD'n the 12th, 14th, 16th, 17th 18th, and 19th..<br>  <br>  good luck dear! hope its your month :)|`|FMmncxToaa	Your best bet is to monitor your discharge, which will be like raw egg white consistency. Also, if you feel a twinge on your sides that is also a sign of ovulation.Finally you should buy a ovulation kit, which is like a home pregnancy test but for ovulation. You should be good if you do all these things to max your chances.Give us updates!!!Good luck!|`|JOVWBOOCaa	Those calendars are no good anyway!! I tried them and the always predicted a week early for me. You need to buy an opk (ovulation prediction kit) they are very accurate. I got pregnant the first time I used it. If  you don't want to use them the only other way is charting your bbt and cm . This is also good to do while using opk so you can't go wrong. The only downfall to charting is that you will have to chart for a couple months to really know your body.. Good luck!|`|VZaqk5CYaa	the calenders may not help, but have you tried charting your cervical mucus - the clear egg white type stuff your body produces to make to show you are ovulating. you can also try an ovulation kit. or a basil temp chart. any of these might work for you - since they are not dependent on the length of your cycle. <br>  good luck!
FkGh0LuWaa	Personally I think she is a little young for a doll stroller.  My niece who is 21 months got the rain forest one for Christmas and she kept trying to sit in it and it ended up braking.  I would wait a little longer before you buy one for her and I would suggest the Graco doll jogger.<br>  Edit:  If she understands that it is for her doll then any of them would be great.  The rainforest one was very cute and it took a beatin it just didn't hold her weight.|`|oiJITSNZaa	I'm a Graco fan and plan on getting my 18 month old the Graco one. She dearly loves strollers.

jLYTKr33aa	A "gifted" label will only hurt her at such a young age, trust me.  First of all, we all want to think that our children are exceptional.  While your daughter sounds like a very bright child, she's probably not gifted.  Furthermore, putting her with older children would be a recipe for disaster.  Even if she could tackle academic work for older children, she's still 20 months old.  Emotionally, she's still her chronological age.  Emotional development is even more important than academic development when it comes to preschool.  Keep encouraging her at home, but keep her in a class with children her own age.  <br>  By the way, most preschools couldn't care less where a child is academically.  They set an age limit, and will not let children start before it - for good reason.  My son goes to one of the best schools in the city, and they strongly discourage parents from trying to enroll their children before the cutoff age.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	for the colors -- can she play a sorting game ... say put blue blocks in one pile and red in another, even if she's not naming which is which? if so, you can play that from time to time and label the different colors and she'll get it eventually. <br>  <br>  otherwise -- i also had a child who was very ahead of the curve as a toddler (and I was labeled "gifted" myself).  i'd strongly recommend not getting her tested right now, even if you could find someone who would do it (i think most medical professionals would discourage you from it, as well).  you know what she's capable of learning and can meet her at her level.  when she gets to elementary age, if she's still ahead of the curve (some kids get off to a fast start and taper off, others get off to a slow start and then rocket away), then you might want her tested if it will allow her entry to a gifted and talented program or something of that sort.  otherwise, there's little to be gained from any kind of testing.  it will show you what you already know (that she's ahead of the curve right now), but there's nothing you can actually do with that information, and it can lead to increased pressure and/or disappointment depending on the results.  keep challenging her and providing plenty of stimulation, which you're obviously already doing a great job at, and save the testing for school.<br>  <br>  for the frustration ... that's very typical toddler behavior and i'd treat it as a disciplinary issue just like any other toddler would have.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	she sounds very smart, but i'm so hesitant to label such a young child gifted - it puts pressure on them, even if its not intended.  there was a girl in my son's gymboree class that spoke eloquently before all the other kids, had a massive vocabulary, all around the age 2.  but you know what? they all caught up, and by 3 1/2, she didn't seem to stand out in her abilities.  smart girl, don't get wrong, but not exceptionally gifted liked she seemed early on.  as for the colors, your daughter is 20months - its to be expected.  call the preschools and maybe they have someone to evaluate her - but there is a social factor with having her with older kids. consider that.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Your daughter sounds much like mine, excpept my daughter has been speaking in 5-10 word sentences for a few months now (she's almost 2).  And my daughter isn't great at doing puzzles yet.  My daughter also gets her colours mixed up but she too knows pink and red only.  It does not mean she is colour blind - it means she is a normal 2 year old.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, my suggestion is forget about labeling your child at such a young age.  It is completely irrelevant, let her be a child.  She's also too young for such a label.  Wait until she is in school and just see what happens.  She has lots of time to be labeled as "gifted", or not.
vue9NOhYaa	There are fertility medications that may help if you have specific problems.<br>  <br>  If you've been trying for over a year, you need to see a fertility specialist, who will do tests on you and your spouse/partner to determine exactly what's wrong, and recommend appropriate treatment.|`|mCDopsLEaa	Honey you really need to be focused on yourself.

2F5HNPqPaa	I'd say no, not for the price!  We got one for our son when he was about 4 months.  He didn't like it then so it was put to one side.  He's 6 months old now and still hates it, only now he's big and strong enough to try and escape!  He's been sitting without support since 4 months anyway, though was still wobbly, which is why we bought the Bumbo in the first place.  A friend had a playnest, which her son loved.  I bought one too like this:  <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10001&catalogId=1500001501&productId=1500369973&langId=-1&engine=froogle&keyword=Beanstalk+Playnest" rel="nofollow">http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>   Lukas absolutely loves that as he can sit, lean back and even move onto his tummy/knees.. in a Bumbo it's also too easy to drop toys out of reach but in here that rarely happens.  <br>  <br>  The only thing the Bumbo has been useful for was with the playtray used as a travel highchair as it's small enough to take anywhere.  He still hates it but usually food distracts him!|`|TBNaPkl6aa	My daughter hated hers, and I only used it a couple times.  If I were you, I would wait to get one until you get a better idea what your child's personality is like.  My daughter hates to be confined, and she likes to move herself around.  We could easily figure this out by the time she was three months old, judging by how she reacted in her baby swing.  We tried the Bumbo to see how she'd like it since one of my husband's relatives gave us a hand-me-down one, but my daughter didn't like it at all.  Babies do not absolutely need one to learn how to sit up unsupported.  I helped my daughter learn how to do that simply by sitting behind her (if she fell then she fell into my arms) and having her practice sitting up everyday, and after a couple weeks, she mastered the skill.<br>  <br>  That being said, my niece really liked her Bumbo seat, and my sister-in-law liked it because she had some place to set her when she was still very young.  I just used the playpen.<br>  <br>  This is my experience and every kid is different.  If you think your baby would like one, then get one.  They're about $30-$40 I think.  If this baby doesn't like it, then maybe the next one will.  That's my mentality and that's why I'm keeping the Bumbo seat I have.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son went in it when he was around 3 months old.  He'll sit in it quite happily in the mornings while I get his bottle ready.  He's just started trying to get out of it now, he's 5 months on Sunday.  He won't sit in it for very long if I'm not sitting beside him amusing him.|`|pVWk12oOaa	I think it's worth it. I used it to feed my son his baby cereal when we first started solids, as he was too little for his high chair. Once he got a bit bigger and older he started trying to get out though.|`|hbjbm3SRaa	I don't know if it's really worth it because there's not that much time between your baby not being able to sit up to learning how to sit up. Pillows will work. My son was ok with it. I think we started using it between 3 and 4 months (not completely sure). If you're going to have other kids it might be worth it to purchase it. It is nice to have when your son can't sit up by himself and you want to be able to do some things so you don't have to hold them the whole time but they'll still be happy not having to lie down.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	If you can get one on Craigslist pretty cheap, it's worth it.  With my son, we waited to long to buy it and he was only able to use it about 2 weeks before he was sitting up on his own.  So far my 4 month old will sit in it for about 1 minute at a time before she gets mad.  Also, with my son he would push his feet down and his backside would go back and up out of the chair.  There were a couple of times that if I hadn't been there he would have pushed the chair backwards and fallen out of it.|`|dde8ee0158b3da0fb4d185658f2c094faa	My daughter loved it! At about 4 months she wanted to sit up, but couldn't do it on her own, and we would be stuck holding her in our laps most of the day. I didn't want her to get used to the constant holding and bought one off of craigslist for $7!!! And it had a tray that attached so I could put toys on it for her. After a month or 2 she became bored with it and could already sit up on her own, so I gave it to a friend.<br>  I suggest getting one off craigslist and try it out. Big help when you need to cook or clean.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Don't bother with it.  It's too much money for a very short time period of use.  It makes me nervous, too.  You're putting a baby who doesn't know how to sit up on their own or do much on their own in this little foam seat.  <br>  <br>  I didn't have one, and we did just fine.  When my son was able to hold his head up pretty well, we started sitting him in his high chair.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	My little guy used to sit in it. It helps them build upper body strength by allowing them to sit up before they could on their own. Just make sure you get the toy tray that goes along with it as they tend to drop toys at that age and they can't reach them if they fall off their laps.|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	My 4 year old ( When he was little of corse) HATED His bumbo chair. I think it seems really uncomfortable. <br>  If you get one, I would get the toy tray to go with it.<br>  Good luck!|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I liked mine. Get one early though, else they will be out of it in no time. <br>  <br>  Mine has seen three babies sitting on it and they all liked it!|`|EMt11Qfzaa	I bought one second hand. My son hated it and learned to sit up by himself the next week. <br>  Thank god i only spent $15 on it. Try craigslist.|`|l79QIWszaa	I was rather unimpressed by my bumbo.  For one thing, I think we waited too long to get one; he was four months.  Our baby was a little chunky and it was hard to get his legs in...and out.  Sometimes he loved it and other times he didn't.  The chairs aren't too roomy and there was no way to use it after he was about 5 months.  If someone has one that you know, you should ask to borrow it.  It may have or may not have helped him learn to sit up...kind of hard to tell.  They aren't cheap, so if you use someone else's you can get an idea of whether or not you might want one.  My little started hanging out in his high chair around 4 months and he liked that a lot more!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I never had one and did just fine.  Their was no way in hell I was gonna pay $40 for a chunk of foam.  <br>  <br>  My boppy worked fine for learning to sit.  I am sure my son would have hated having to sit in that thing.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	My DD hated hers; she spent maybe 2 weeks using it and then it was wasted. I even bought one that i could attach toys too, but that's only my experience.
1jwbQaZTaa	other than a doctors note, there are no "rights" that you have as an employee other than taking your alotted vacation or sick time off to go to the doctor. employers do, by law, need to provide you with maternity/paternity leave in some states, or at least hold your job for you. but unfortunately dealing with a sick child doesnt fall into the labor laws. is there anyone else that can take your child to the doctor? a grandparent or someone? how badly do you need your job? if your child needs to be at the doctor enough for it to affect your job, it may be more beneficial to take a leave of absence and stay home with your child until they get better! hope this helped|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Is your child sick as in the flu or does your child have a condition?<br>  <br>  If your child heas health issues, then Melody is absolutely right.<br>  <br>  FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) protects you from losing your job due to a serious meical condition for yourself or immediate family member.

Some ladies get it on the first try, and others try for years.. Dont stress out about it, have fun and just wish for the best. <br>  <br>  baby dust :)
DN6XtoViaa	that sounds VERY promising!<br>  <br>  keep your fingers crossed and i will to for you :)<br>  <br>  good luck and God bless!
ROJans2Taa	completely normal, my son was breast fed soley for around a month then we started supplementing, once he was more on the formula and less on the expressed milk, I found he would go from weeks where he would eat non stop, to maybe I could get him to eat 2 ounces every 2-3 hrs, and he was 8lbs 7 ounces, at birth, a big boy as well, now he is 6 mths and still does that every now and then, im not sure of the reason, some say the growth spurt is over or maybe gas, but I do know within 5-7 days he is usually back to normal, as long as he is still wetting a good amount of diapers and soiling he's regular amount I would worry, best luck|`|nmu6coapaa	My son done this around that stage too and it turned out to be acid reflux!|`|V1LMRJgPaa	I had this problem with my son, after stressing about him not eating enough and trying just about everything, i actually found that  when i thought he was screaming for food, he actually had really bad wind/colic. he found some sort of comfort in having his bottle in his mouth but wouldn't drink it because the wind made him think that he was full. Maybe you should try a little bit of gripe water or colic drops just to see if it is wind, most babies that get colic tend to get it between 4-8 weeks. Good luck x|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Sometimes babies are like that, My two year old did this at that age. He wouldn't take a pacifier and would scream for a bottle. So when I would give it to him, he would just kinda chew if you will on the nipple. If he got any food in his mouth he would spit it out. I think that it is just a fixation in their mouth. I think that it will be ok, It only lasted for about a week with my son. If it persists I would call your doctor if you feel that he is not getting enough to eat. Their appetites will increase and decrease as they get older. Hope this helps.|`|qZINunh7aa	see if it depends on the temperature of the formula.
oiJITSNZaa	Sorry there's no set answer. Did you do a HPT?|`|DN6XtoViaa	it could be a lot of things! <br>  <br>  1. you are ovulating from the left side this month<br>  OR<br>  2. you already ovulated (from the left side) and are now having cramping due to the fertilized egg digging into your uterus wall :)<br>  <br>  Or it could just be the regular cramp we sometimes feel!<br>  <br>  good luck and hope its what you want|`|GEfpzUNvaa	your probably ovulating...|`|ibg67Xtvaa	my lower left side hurts all the time now and then i have really sharp pain that happen there to
yrDqtazLaa	False positive pregnancy tests are extremely rare to come by, especially if the doctor's office called you to confirm that you're pregnant. False negatives happen all the time, the tests were just either defective or they just didn't pick up on your HCG hormone. If you haven't had any cramping or bleeding, you're still pregnant. You don't feel pregnant now, but trust me, you will soon enough. Enjoy it now while you can. Good luck and Congrats!|`|igPBuDHkaa	it can take time to show up on a urine test go to the docs and ask for a blood test they are never wrong good luck x|`|ibg67Xtvaa	no sorry haven't had this problem before and i am so sorry that you have to go through this alone. i think the only way you will no whats wrong is to go the doc and get a scan a.s.a.p and try not to stress yourself think positively don't let it get you down

My son always wants his bottle with the formula so now I'm having a hard time weaning him off of it. Just try and keep as much of a regular schedule as you can. Maybe if you make sure you give him a bath every night and feed him a bottle right before bed he'll start to get the routine.  Make sure his bedroom is dark at night so he can associate day from night and knows when he needs to sleep longer.  If you give him a lot of food during the day and he has doubled his birth weight you shouldn't be needing to get up in the middle of the night still. Don't go to him every time he cries. He needs to learn how to soothe himself sometimes and if you go to him everytime he cries he'll get the idea and that's what he wants.|`|vue9NOhYaa	At 6 months my daughter was fed on demand.  She was mostly breastfed, with small amounts of solids. She was waking once at night -- sleeping 2 roughly 4 hour blocks at night. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you need to be encouraging a lot more breastmilk or formula during the day.|`|ROJans2Taa	he wakes around 7am I feed him 4 ounces of milk around 7:30, I have to take my daughter to school so we walk at around 8:45, by 9:30 he has another 4 ounces, we play he usually has a nap around 11am, on average about a 20min nap, he has some cereal around 12 am, about 2-3 tablespoons (made) also a 3 ounce bottle, he will take another nap around 3-4 if I can get him too, he will also have another bottle at this time around 3-4 ounces he is usually fussy by this time but fights it(sleep) because my daughter comes home and my husband and I guess the extra commotion, he will eventually have a nap and around 6 have more milk by 7pm he will have another 2-3 tablespoons of cereal, by 9pm I try to get him down for the night and usually this is another struggle, we usually sit on the couch together with the lights low and tv low and after a 4 ounce bottle he will usually go down at least by 10, he has been stirring in the night, but only feeding twice now, around 12-1am and 4am, and we start all over,lol, also during the day we do tummy time, he spends time with me holding him, in his swing and exersaucer. best luck|`|Ic1u6INRaa	get up around 7 or 8, change him, feed him... a bottle.  Then, play or whatever till about 10 or 11 and he takes his first nap.  when he wakes up, he gets changted and eats again...a bottle, and a jar of food.  then, he's up playing or whatever till about 2, then its another nap.  when he gets up, change and feed.  Then around 6, its dinnertime...  a bottle and some baby food.  After he eats, he takes a bath, gets ready for bed...  another bottle to help him fall off to bed around 8.  then, thats it for the night till around 3 or 4am sometimes, he may need to be changed, get a small bottle, find his pacifier, or somethin small, but he's right back off to sleep until around 7 or 8 am, and he'll start the whole dam thing over again.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son is going to be 5 months on Sunday, his routine generally goes along the lines of:<br>  <br>  7.30 - 8am: Bottle<br>  8.45: Breakfast<br>  11.15am: Bottle<br>  12 noon: Lunch<br>  3pm: Bottle<br>  4.30pm: Dinner<br>  6.30pm: Bath<br>  7- 7.15pm: PJs on, bottle<br>  7.30pm at latest, bed<br>  <br>  He doesn't get up at night.  This routine obviously varies a bit, the only thing I'm "strict" on is that he gets a bath every night, it helps him wind down. I don't schedule playtime or anything, and the feeding schedule came about naturally.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	My son is 6 months old going on 7 months old in a couple of days<br>  He wakes up at 8:00am every morning has a 6 ounce bottle and gets a diaper change,I play with him and read to him until about 11am he get's his frist nap he will sleep till about 1pm and than wakes up eat's a little solids with his bottle gets a diaper change, we go for a walk and play until 4-5pm he takes a short nap until about 5:30-6:00pm wakes up gets a diaper change and has dinner solids and a bottle, Than a bath and reading time and is in bed at 8:30pm and than sleeps through the night until 8:00 am.

j2mRop0laa	Well I would be searching youtube like mad man and trying to get that video taken down and possibly calling the others kids to let them know if you find out anyone has the video and doesn't get rid of it- you will press charges and they will be charged with child pornography.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think your punishment is sufficient...I never understood why some teens act this way. I surely never did, or did I have the desire to. She needs to learn that there are consequences for her actions and that you put a great deal in trust in her by letting her attend an unsupervised party and she broke your trust.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Youtube will take it off pretty quickly, they always do, she's naked on the internet and embarrassed enough already, isn't that enough punishment?<br>  <br>  What exactly did she do wrong any way, how does negatively affect any one else, can't accept that she's not your little baby anymore? As you said you lost it so you're obviously more concerned about getting your anger out rather than teaching her a lesson.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Wow,I would not want you as a Mom! My mother was very strict as far as going to school and doing things around the house,but always let us make decisions about what we did on our own.I think the best thing for you to do is to talk to her and see how she feels about what she did and find out if she thought she made the right choice.<br>  Kids learn from going through experiences,not from someone telling them what and what not to do.You can give them direction but in the end they will more than likely try things to see for themselves.You will more than likely make her bitter,instead of sorry...|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Don;t go overboard on punishing her. How has she reacted to what you have said??<br>  Firstly did she admit to it?<br>  Secondly how bad was it??<br>  Its hard to be the only one at a party not joining in at 16...Try to find the you tube so you can see how bad it was.<br>  Clam down and talk to her.<br>  Things are so much harder for teenagers now with video phone you tube and FB bebo etc...its hard to just make a mistake anymore. If she has always been reliable in the past don't risk her rebelling against what she might see as excessive punishment. TALK talk talk and tell her how disappointed you are that she broke you trust and work out a way for her to earn it back. Treat her like an adult and she will act like one.<br>  Good luck and remember..you were 16 once as well :P|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Grounded until further notice. When she asks how long, you say "I will let you know. The more you ask, the longer it will be".<br>  <br>  No parties, no movies, no sporting events, no nothing. If she has a friend over, NO CLOSED DOORS. No more than 2 friends at a time.<br>  <br>  Taking away her tech support and car is a very good move.<br>  <br>  Stick to your guns.<br>  <br>  If she behaves, I think about a month (her offense was pretty serious, not like staying out past curfew). But don't tell her. Next time she will may think twice about behavior that she knows you would not approve of.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	well if this is actually true.... yes the punishment is apporopriate. but you should never have allowed her to be at an unsupervised party.|`|jtbDrlbMaa	I feel that her punishment was more than enough, she has to learn that what she did was wrong and SHE only did this to herself and with her actions comes with consequences.|`|VK11cBvpaa	GROUNDED|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Sorry I dont have any answers, but I am dreading my three little girls growing up!!|`|51d57483d1f6319218c2bc7c948690b7aa	I believed you did exactly the right thing.  This type of behavior is unacceptable.  She should have no rights for at least a month and a half. The only way she should be able to drive is if she had a job.  What I would do is if she doesn't have a job I would make her get one.  If she is old enough to drink, then she is old enough to take in the responsibility of having a job and paying for such bills as her cell phone, car, and car insurance.|`|AA11104649	Sounds appropriate to me.<br>  Leave it at that.<br>  I don't have a daughter (or a son, for that matter), but I can well imagine how hard it is to think of one's children as adults with all the interests, needs and desires that adults have. Truth is, your daughter is growing up - she's no longer a girl. She's going to be interested in sex, in her body, in other's bodies, in all the things YOU probably did when her age.<br>  Don't get me wrong - you have to come down on it and act like a responsible parent (which it sounds like you've done), but you also have to know that she's no longer a little girl. Talking to her and treating her with respect will probably do you both good. Oh, and realising she'll make mistakes every now and then - but being philosophical about it.|`|PGGRVTo8aa	it seems everyone who thinks you went a little over board is geting a thumbs down on their answers. True a couple of points they make are flippant if nothing else, however, by the sheer fact you have asked the question makes me question if you think it were too harsh and heat of the moment. <br>  <br>  All adults were kids and we know what it was like to be 16. If you think back you will also remember that at 16 you had a pretty good idea of what you were doing. It's only experience that has schooled us to where we are now...in my case 31years of age. <br>  <br>  A teenagers body is going through some hefty changes and hormones and chemical inbalances in the brain all make these years quite uncomfortable at points. It also means that screaming at her and prolonging a punishment will only cause resentment between you both. Sure you are angry and upset that she has done this but really was it that bad? Teenagers are all experimenting and exploring their bodies, it's natural... I'm sure you went to a few parties like that when you were younger. <br>  <br>  I think one key thing is that she knows about birth controle and must be an advocate of it. <br>  <br>  Talking things through with her rather than removing her possessions will set you off in a far better route for the future. Don't forget she is now a young adult, and should be given the respect and treated as such. By talking to her you can pass on your experience, but try and talk to her as you would your best friend... <br>  <br>  Good Luck...|`|zxhCy80eaa	Wow that's a toughie. It might be a good idea to schedule your daughter with a doctor and discuss birth control though.(Believe me I used to be a 16 year old girl. And you used to be a 16 year old boy. It's not a comforting thought, I know, but we both remember, I'm sure, what it was like being a teenager and believe me 16 year old girls want the same thing as 16 year old boys do. Looks like your daughter has already started exploring that territory.) And I would definitely ban her from going to unsupervised parties or ANY for a while for that matter.<br>  Good luck with that. I know you must be steamed.
4SKIE1C8aa	Larry is a nickname to start with (for Lawrence) so there really aren't anny nicknames for it.

My sister-in-law is called Gay and she takes an awful lot of stick for it these days although it was quite an innocent name when she was born in the 70s.
AA11085356	It doesn't matter when you conceive, it depends on which sperm gets to your egg first. All those stories are old wives tales.|`|DN6XtoViaa	there is no sure way to tell what child you will have...<br>  <br>  the thing i think you may be refering to is this however:<br>  <br>  having sex right on ovulation day gives you a much higher chance of having a boy as the male sperm are much faster than the girl sperm! <br>  <br>  having sex a day or two before ovulation gives you a higher chance of having a girl as girl sperm live much longer than the male sperm and are stronger when it comes to surviving.<br>  <br>  hope this helped! good luck to you :)|`|VZaqk5CYaa	its actually the male sperm that swims fast but dies fast. while the girl sperm last longer. but it is SUPPOSED to be true that if you have intercourse a few days before you ovulate it is a better chance for a girl, as the male sperm will die off before the egg is released. and if you want a boy to have it on or just a day before you ovulate and the say that deep penetration will help conceive a boy. <br>  <br>  Some Dr's believe this, but some don't. so it isn't a guarantee. the women's PH in their vagina and such can also cause one or the other type of sperm to die. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Girl sperm swim fast but die fast, male sperm swim slow but stay alive longer so if you have sex at your prior to ovulation time supposedly it will result in a girl, but if you have sex right at ovulation time it will result in a boy.|`|sIRnRy17aa	It really doesnt make any difference...it all depends on which sperm makes it to your egg first! There are so many wives tales which would be so lovely if they were true but it really doesnt work like that!

Once I started putting him to bed earlier, he seemed to quit.|`|jcXSNjowaa	just looking for a comfortable position.|`|nnyowt2oaa	My 2 month old daughter does this every now and then as she's trying to fall asleep. Sometimes I put my hand across her cheek and rub her forehead with my fingers and that seems to settle her and calm her. It's almost like she's looking for something to put her face against, (she's a snuggler, but with SIDS I don't let the poor thing snuggle against anything but me when I'm holding her.)|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	my son moves his head rapidly from side to side too but only when he is hungry and searching for the bottle :) check to see whether this applies to you too.

Like foot creams, lotions, certificate for pedicure, etc.  I saw a kit for belly casting and thought that would be a fun gift.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	my most favorite idea for any gifting occasion in order to make it memorable is buying a wicker basket and filling it with stuff. if it's for a baby shower (what i usually do) is get the wicker basket (you can find them cheap almost anywhere) and buy some things off the registry... blankets, clothes,diapers,wipes,lotions.... anything... then i wrap the basket in something baby oriented like a blanket, or decorative bag (even at the dollar store you can find huge bags that are related to babies) then i put a huge bow on it. i love this idea because most people buy one or two things from the registry and wrap it with regular old paper or a boring bag. with this idea it can be as expensive or cheap as you like and everything including the basket is reuse able.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	This is probably the one of the coolest baby shower gifts I received and the only one he still uses, he's almost 5yr:)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Twilight-Turtle-Constellation-Night/dp/B000BNQC58/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=baby-products&qid=1236262691&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Twilight-Tur...</a>|`|CnLL5ENmaa	I would get an after baby gift, for mom.

Here are some similar names though:<br>  Samantha: Name of God<br>  Samar: Conversations at night<br>  Samara: Protected by God<br>  Samayah: Spiritually high<br>  Sameh: Forgiver<br>  Samira/Samirah: Entertaining<br>  Samiha: Wish or desire|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I don't think it has one cause I goggled it too and found none.Sorry.
AA11085356	Have you tried just rinsing it in warm water? If there are spots left after that, I like to use Shout. It seems to work very well for me on just about any spot.|`|AA10478980	Physically scrape and clean off as much as you can.  Then treat the clothing with one of the pre-wash stain treatments such as Shout - scrub well as part of the pre-wash treatment.  Most of those products are very good at removing such stains.  I'd also soak the clothes for a few hours in something such as Dawn dish washing liquid and water, which is excellent for removing grease stains.  You might even try pre-treating the stains with Dawn.  Then wash in the hottest water possible with a good detergent.  That should do it.|`|C8QTGBYxaa	take some vanish or sprout
zzaScg0haa	It's your body adjusting to the pill
J2f5ZzSnaa	Take another one, if its a faint line before the time limit then you are pregnant. I had a very faint line and i was. Make sure your doing it first thing in the morning. Good luck!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	if it was longer than the 10 mins I wouldn't worry about it.. Wait a couple more days and take another test|`|uuHPneEcaa	ur pregnant. <br>  <br>  i think everyone has a faint line on those pregnancy test.. I had one so i took another and it was posiitve as well.. I think the digital ones work better then the ones with the lines.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	If you read it after the ten minute time period then don't worry about it. But if not, I would take another test just so you know for sure. Kinda confusing to understand what you are describing, but I would just try another test. Maybe the test was faulty or something. Good luck!|`|i8Ch743Laa	Don't pay attention to any that old. Over ten minutes,the results are inaccurate.|`|xnhwmontaa	Retest|`|2QOcTTTuaa	Retake the test using first morning urine (when you get up in the morning and have to empty your bladder).  Wait for the test to finish, then take it out into daylight.  Reading the test using sunlight is much more accurate than dim bathroom lighting.  My tests looked negative for my first pregnancy, until I thought to look at it outside, and then I knew I was pregnant.  I went back and checked all my old tests and there was a faint line there too.|`|VWyW8tJXaa	It doesn't sound like you are pregnant, but I had some problems with a first response test also. I went and bought a clear blue digital test that reads pregnant or not pregnant. Those ones are way more clear and less confusing.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	It's probably an evap line. Don't read a pregnancy test after the amount of time it says on the package, generally about 5 minutes or so.|`|R8qooymyaa	you got a pic so we can c what you mean??? x
dFHsAXDMaa	as a nurse I will tell you... that you should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.. if you think there is any chance you could be pregnant because these symptoms could be one of a few things  tubal pregnancy... very dangerous if not caught early....implantation bleeding....or miscarriage.. your health is not something to play around with.. make an appointment better to be safe than sorry you waited. good luck|`|gwuTKiNXaa	um mm Now that is a hard one.. have you been doing any activities where you have been doing heavy lifting that can cause some on of that stuff. I would wait a few more weeks and then test if you haven't. Reasoning saying that is because it may be to early to test|`|43610f61e745e21fe38388296de975f9aa	'If' you're pregnant it could have been implantaion bleeding... the blood looks like more of a light pinkish to brown color if its implantation bleeding because its old blood. Some women do experience back pain while pregnant ( i know i do) but to be sure just take a test or go to your doctor and explain the symptoms you're having.|`|jc6iAN3Naa	You just have the pregnacy blues. No worries!<br>  (: The same thing happened to me
MubTZUKXaa	Firstly, I asked my Dr what my success rate would be as I read it can be as little as 13%!  He told me that these figures take lots of things into account, lots of different problems and some more serious than PCOS, age of the Woman etc.<br>  <br>  My Husband had 85% abnormal sperm but a good count.  I had PCOS where I hardly ovulated at all :-(<br>  We tried for a baby for a total of about 6 years.  We tried Clomid for at least 6 cycles (alone, not with IUI) and also Metformin.  In all those years I never had a single BFP!<br>  We had our first IUI in August and I'm 30 weeks pregnant today!  Be positive :-)<br>  Can't really tell you about the Clomid + IUI process though.. I used injectable FSH meds called Puregon +IUI.  <br>  <br>  Incase it's a similar process I will tell you what we done...<br>  # I started injecting at home on cd3, this was after a scan to check everything inside was OK!<br>  # I had a scan every other day to check how my ovaries were responding to the Puregon dose... bascially just checking for signs of any maturing follicles.<br>  # on cd 22 I was told to start using an OPK and make an appointment for the following day after a positive..  The Dr had seen that I had two mature follicles which looked like they were about to release eggs from the ovary.<br>  # Got a positive ovulation test result on cd23.  Booked IUI for cd24.<br>  <br>  # Husband went in early to the clinic to give his sample.. the sample was then treated and I went in for my IUI in the afternoon.<br>  The procedure itself is painless and over in about 3 minutes!<br>  <br>  # we were advised to test 16 days after the IUI.. I tested at day 11 and got my first BFP!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!  Good luck xxx|`|PeEIuzP5aa	sorry im not sure what to tell you, i didn't go though what you are going though. i can say this to you talk to your dr for more answers good luck hope everything works out for you and your husband.|`|91hxNCfWaa	I've been recently diagnosed with PCOS (I'm 16), and I wish I could help, but I'm not sure how to answer your question. I'd like to say good luck though :)|`|xjRCdRnxaa	hey,<br>  Sorry for all your troubles firstly!<br>  Im TTC and find it hard, especially as 10 good friends in 5mths have said they are preg - i started way before them too! lol - i guess at least i can borrow all theirs in the meantime :-)<br>  Can i be honest, the success rate he has given you does seem really really high to me - but who knows, if he is really good as you say, then maybe he is correct!<br>  But these sites are posting about IUI success.<br>  www.fertilityplus.org/faq/iui.html<br>  www.babycentre.co.uk/preconception/fer...<br>  But we are all different i guess, so who knows.<br>  I may be inline for IUI, took 5th round of Clomid this mth, due AF 17th March, if get AF, take 6th Cycle of Clomid then if nothing, back to specialist on 15th April see whats next and thinking IUI from research.<br>  My old boss had IUI and conceived twin baby boys though which made me pleased and reassured!<br>  God luck, i really hope it goes well for you.
AA11481889	My friend was have the same kind of aggression issues you're describing...and after talking to someone...they figured out that it was basically frustration because he was having a really hard time communicating.  He didn't have many words and when his parents couldn't figure out what the pointing and grunting meant...he'd flip out and hit and kick and bite.<br>  <br>  He's been with a speech therapist with his mom for about 4 weeks now...and he's a different child.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's something totally minor that is causing so much frustration that it looks a lot worse than it is.<br>  <br>  If it were me...and it was my son having these issues, if my husband was being pig headed about getting help...I'd do it on my own.<br>  <br>  Men are very good and bottling things up...if they can't fix it themselves..."it's not really a problem"...and "you're just being emotional and blowing things out of proportion."<br>  <br>  My husband now has more sense than pulling that crap with me...but he used to...And when he realized that it wasn't going to stop me from dragging him to doctors appointments, or forcing him to take the child on his own....he stopped fighting me on medical issues regarding our son.<br>  <br>  If you feel that your son has grounds for medical care, and given the frustration he's exhibiting I would tend to agree, your husband shouldn't stand in the way...and if he does...leave him standing there and get the medical care anyway.  <br>  <br>  You can always take yourself out of it...and say "You know what honey...you might be right....maybe theres nothing wrong...but since neither of us is a child development specialist....lets just go and see what they have to say"  And let the doctor show him he doesn't know what the F he's talking about.<br>  <br>  And as far as the why...I think part of it may be that we handle the primary care of the children...but part of it is that we're just wired differently...I think women tend to be a little more proactive when it comes to our kids...hell , when it comes to everything.  <br>  <br>  Men just seem to deal with things as they occur, rather than spending two second thinking about the potential complications in the future.  Boys are dumb..I don't know what else to tell you...lol|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Wow, your husband is in total denial or has serious "not by son" syndrome.  There is a simple solution to your problem.  Leave your son with him for the weekend.  Go out of town or stay with a friend.  Let him have the full experience from Friday night to Sunday night.  I guarantee you that he will be rushing to the nearest pediatrician for advise, which is where you should be going.  Your son may have the beginning symptoms of ADHD.  Have him tested by a pediatric neurologist.  It's a simple easy test.  The test is not always conclusive but you have nothing to lose.  He's 2 and too young to have serious anger issues.  Could also be a simple chemical imbalance.  My friend's son had that and it was taken care of with a mild med until he grew out of it.  I'm banking on ADHD....meds have come along way for ADHD so don't be too afraid of it.  If it is ADHD, do your research.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	yes, it's tough. I am the disciplinarian unless the kids are really out of control, then my husband steps in.  usually im the bad guy with the 'dont get him all riled up before bed' 'you arent going to think its so funny when he says that to his teacher', etc.<br>  I'd say put your foot down with your husband - as long as youre not always like that, he'll know you mean business - tell him that you will not have your son throw chairs and act out like that, and he has to back you or he'll feel responsible for the consequences when your son is unable to control himself and be in regular classes, etc.  make it hit home with him.<br>  as for your child, i think a very firm no and removing him from the situation will help.  terrible two's vary in each child, but if its a phase (and its the age for the phase) they will outgrow it.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	The three of you badly need family counseling.<br>  <br>  It is not uncommon for a Dad to not understand the 24/7 experiences of a Mom, but you all are in CRISIS.<br>  <br>  I gather you have found help for the boy, but you and your husband need help big time.  If the agency that you have contacted can't/won't deal with the problem as a family issue, either find one that will or find marriage counseling in addition.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, single parenting isn't easier.<br>  <br>  This will not go away by itself.|`|KeUGwKndaa	you know when i first started reading your question you have had family issue with your husband just maybe your son has pick up on  all the anger that's in your home.it sound's like your son might have some serious issue's. because parent's have to agree when raising children it can't be a two way street.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|5ci9IZd2aa	You leave for a week and let your husband see what it's really like to be the full time parent, and then he won't be able to down-play your sons behavior|`|0v55bQT1aa	Your husband is immature if he puts you down for being a good and caring mother ! Men sometimes, don't seem to be real when it comes to raising their children ! You're doing the right thing by testing your son for possible behavior issues.

My husband works a lot so he doesn't get to spend as much time with her. He doesn't want to be a bad guy with her. We fought and fought. He thought that I was being to tough and mean to our daughter by sticking by my no and putting her time out. He defends her saying that she's  bored and I should do more to entertain her. <br>  <br>  He was home for three weeks last Christmas, it was a bit of a reality check for him. We still have arguments about it.<br>  <br>  Just hang in there, be consistent with your son, even if your husband isn't. <br>  <br>  I got book called 1-2-3 Magic  that was recommended by her pediatrician.

I pulled myself together quickly so a not to freak them out but it seemed to help them understand we are not on opposite sides where one needs to win but in a team.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	My husband and I have no issues like that.

kTu7UtS1aa	That's a tough one.  I got a faint line on my test last week, but I did not have to tip it or move it any way.  I waited the time it said (3 mins, I think) and then I took a look.  It was faint, much lighter than the "test" line, but it was there, without a doubt.  Since you are only a week past ovulation, I would wait another week just to be sure, at least 4 more days.  I got my positive 11 DPO.  I think it's too early, but everyone is different.  Good luck to you!!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	The same thing happened to me last week.

I had it on an asda test, thought I was pregnant and even showed my friend who said she could see a line, but 3 days later I got my period :-(.  That might not be the case for you though, id wait a few days and test again maybe with a different brand.|`|E6obQSpraa	Generally, if you have to hold it up to the light or tip it, like you have, its an evaporation line, not a BFP.  I would say its far too early for your body to be producing HCG.<br>  <br>  But.....i may be wrong. Leave it till you are due AF then test again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck xxx|`|GxJL9UjVaa	well they say any positive line is a positive!! :) just to be sure u should test again in a day or two. Good luck|`|A90lbgZ7aa	Give it a day or 2 and try again your hormone level may be borderline for the test to show at that time. Good luck we took 3 years to conceive we were just about to see about ivf when my wife fell pregnant the idea of ivf took away the stress of trying and she fell pregnant straight away. Worrying about wanting a baby and stressing will possibly make conceiving difficult
Z1e3Cxjoaa	If you did conceive on the 22nd then that means you would implant 6-10 days after that which puts you around the 28th-4th...so yeah you would have to wait till your period is due to really get a true hpt result.  You wouldn't have symptoms yet...sorry.|`|WZ52LU39aa	you could be pregnant my advice would be to just wait at least five days before your AF before you test through.|`|Q08p7jYGaa	You could be pregnant that was my first sign of being pregnant.

emUfO7oNaa	well considering im 17 pregnant the father of my baby has 2 kids im his ex girlfriend and he knocked me up after he got in a fight with his current girlFriend and he got kicked out of the house and ill probably get kicked out of the house to. i probably wont have one|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Don't be nervous! :)~  Your shower will come and go so fast that you won't know what hit you!  My shower was planned by me and a few other people.  I almost wish it was a surprise, but would be afraid it would've been disastrous lol!  When I had my wedding shower my mom was up my butt in control of it, so I vowed I wouldn't have that happen at my baby shower.  My shower was 3 hours long at a BREWERY of all places, but with very delicious food and a beautiful restaurant.  My theme for nursery is Noah's Ark Babies and my MIL made Little Ark centerpieces, we had homemade cookies, great food, and we played one game with the string to guesstimate how "Round you are."  Don't be nervous...I mean, be excited because everyone will be there to support you and I wasn't bombarded at mine thank God.  Just relax and enjoy the pampering.  If you don't want to seem like the object of attention crack a joke about it and see how many laughs you get!  Have fun!|`|uTEr67Bhaa	I knew about my baby shower.  I am the same way I don't like to be the center of attention.  I was a little nervous, this was my second baby shower, and it still felt like it was my first.  With all the games and food and stuff you really start to relax and have fun.|`|72b1b98cae822f6e9e185fe824d0b9cdaa	I knew about my babyshower, i planned my own babyshower. Don't make a really big deal out of it trust me you'll have fun. I haven't had my shower yet (march 21st) but i've been to plenty and they are usually lots of fun.|`|f5yIF5CFaa	I knew about mine ahead of time and really enjoyed myself. You will have great fun once you are there opening all the gifts and thinking of all the excitement ahead, plus sharing stories about others child bearing experiences =o) Sit back and enjoy...Congratulations!|`|Jk4wnsZwaa	I knew about my baby shower-I actually traveled 1200 miles to be there for it.  It was a lot of fun-although I did feel a little uncomfortable having to open every present in front of everyone.|`|LDPabWk0aa	I always have had baby showers  from my both kids but is nice to be the center of attention  that way you now they care of about you i love baby showers don't be nervous.|`|AA11540246	i knew|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	mines may 9th and then my 2nd one for other family is in june so i know of them all lol and yeah its nervous being center of attention, i had a bridal shower almost 3 years ago and im not used to being center of attention, but people will be so focused on the baby not you lol get used to that lol|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I've had 3 children and not one baby shower, but I have been to a couple. It's about the baby. There should be games to play, and food to eat, so not everyone will be in a circle sitting around staring at you lol<br>  It will be like any other get together. People talk and laugh, play cute baby games and often, give you gifts for the little one. <br>  Do you know these people well? It should be fun for you to see friends and family and celebrate your child. <br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|bTlhBX3daa	I don't like to be the center of attention either, so I am always nervous at things like that. <br>  <br>  I had a shower with my family and friends back home (Utah) and it was really great. My mom and cousin threw it and instead of playing games, they bought a bunch of onesies in different sizes and colors, stencils, fabric paint and markers, iron-ons, etc and everyone decorated onesies for my unborn son. I absolutely LOVE that my son will have onesies made just for him.<br>  <br>  I have another shower on the 14th in Oklahoma with my fiances friends and family (I won't know most of the people there, so I am really nervous). <br>  <br>  There are small showers planned at both my work and my fiance's work here in Texas. And then someone else is throwing a guy/girl shower/celebration for our friends here in Texas. <br>  <br>  So in all, I ended up with 5 showers being planned for me. Yikes. I'm SO grateful for the gifts, the help, and the good thoughts. But it has been a little overkill as I am pretty sick, fatigued and sore these days.<br>  <br>  I wish you a beautiful shower and I hope you get lots of nice things for the baby.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I hate being the center of attention because I blush! I was so nervous, like I was for my bridal shower. (but then at my bridal shower I had margaritas, so it kept me calm) Can't have that at a baby shower and can't drink... So I sweated my butt off the whole time I was unwrapping gifts, and would choke up every time I would tell someone thank you. Just wear something loose fitting, in case you get all hot and sweaty... and try to stay calm... It will be fine and you will get tons of great gifts.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I'm the same way you are! I hate being the center of attention. I didn't have mine yet obviously, as I'm only 18 weeks, but my husband has a big mouth and can't keep a secret and told all the details... gotta love men! :)  It's in June, however, and at this great country club down from our house.  Looking very much forward to it.  Best of luck and enjoy!|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Total surprise. And, I am no tone to normally fall for surprises...I pick up on little things very easily and put all the pieces together. But this one caught me totally off guard. I cried. It was awesome. I loved it
4p9sBdyTaa	I am worried about the same thing lol, I was in active labor for about almost two days and then had to push for over a hour, I hope Connor comes out easier:)|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I have no stories for you because baby #2 is still cooking ;) but my youngest will be almost 10 when he is born and I am worried about the same thing.  She was pretty fast.  My labor was 6 ish hours and I pushed for about 14 minutes and she was here.  1 1/2 weeks before my due date.   I am hoping he is as easy.  I have a feeling I might go early, but not too early which is what I am hoping.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	my first was 16 hours of labor with NO epidural - crazy! then, 3.5 yrs later my 2nd was 6 hrs total - WITH an epidural... <br>  now its been 8 yrs and I'm due in Aug with my 3rd... so we'll see. good luck!|`|R0RnjdnXaa	I'm wondering the same thing because my oldest boy is 9 and by the time I have my baby girl he'll almost be 10. I delivered him vaginally  BUT I also have a 4 1/2 year old but I had him c section because of complications he's a preemie so I haven't delivered vaginally since I delivered my first son 9 years ago! so I'm so scared I'll have a long delivery painful delivery. Though with my son who is 9 I was only in labor for 3 hours but every pregnancy is different and maybe I'll take longer than 3 hours this time is what I'm thinking. Good Luck|`|AnRjtvqFaa	I dont have any stories for you because unfortunately my children were all c sections. I just wanted to shae that you and I have the same due date. Im also due July 27th. We find out tomorrow if we are having a girl or a boy. <br>  Good luck with getting a good answer.|`|ROJans2Taa	My daughter was almost 7 when my son was born, my labor with her was 14 hrs long, 2 hrs pushing, no epidural,she was born at 37 weeks. my son(second baby) I got my membranes stripped at 39 weeks, my labor was 17 hrs long, I got stuck at 5cm, I got the epidural at that point, I also had pictocin with my son to get me past the 5cm, I pushed for 1 hr. I found my second labor longer, but less pushing time, he was also bigger though, my first was 7lbs 7 ounces, my son was 8lbs 7 ounces. I am not sure if the longer labor was due to him being bigger or the fact that I got my membranes stripped instead of going into labor completely natural.|`|v3LnJycKaa	i had 5 years between my two, and my second was a FRACTION of the time pain and effort of my first, both induced, but on pitocin in the hospital from monday until friday afternoon (hard labor contractions no progress until friday, literally went from 1 1/2 at 230pm to pushed her out at 5:41pm... :) ) <br>  <br>  my second i wa sin and out of the hospital in 24 hours :)
VKQzj4Pmaa	If I don't find a question to be serious, I will save them until my child's next scheduled appointment. I will usually write them down and bring them, so I do not forget. In the mean time (before the appointment) I am always on the internet researching my questions.<br>  <br>  I trust my doctor for the most part, but if I still feel a little off, I will again do my own research. I don't believe any parent or doctor is 100% right, so having a piece of mind by reassuring myself does help. So far there have been 2 things I did not do as my doctor advised because of a strong mommy instinct. My son turned out just fine and rosy in both situations (I'll just add that those 2 situations were minor, and nothing serious).<br>  <br>  Maybe I just need a new doctor whom I could feel more confident in.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my kids doctor i do trust 100%.  i do however my own common sense and a mother whom i can ask if something didn't feel right.  my internal judgments are still there i just also trust this woman.  she is a mother of 5 kids and a pediatrician.  it was extremely important for me to have someone i trusted that much.  i have made phone calls if i was uncertain about something but very rarely have i had to go in for extra visits.|`|CrjozlCjaa	Follow your instincts, ask your Mum and other mothers of similar age children.    Trust your mother.    You survived, didn't you?
v3LnJycKaa	well there are def times that our husbands are jerks they are human too, but during pregnancy (i find the begining and end to be the hardest) smaller things seems to become much larger to us and frustrate us much more.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Ask yourself is this something that irritated me before I was pregnant?  It may be a combination of the two.  It is probably that your husband is being a jerk but you were more tolerable of it before.  Now that you are pregnant you may not feel like dealing with it and are being more vocal about it.  People have a tendency to want to blame everything on your pregnancy while you are pregnant and it can be really annoying.  When I was pregnant I hated when strangers would touch my stomach.  People would tell me I was just being hormonal, but no, I don't like people treating me like I am a walking science project, pregnant, or not pregnant.  It's just that unless you are pregnant, random people don't feel a need to touch your belly, so that is when you find out.  The best thing you can do is re-evaluate how you are approaching your husband.  Try to be calmer when you address your husbands behaviors.  Or bring it up during a down and stress-free time.  If you start flipping out in the heat of the moment, people are less likely to respect what you are saying and blame it on your being pregnant.  And congrats on your new baby!|`|5UdgZEn4aa	I ask myself the same question all the time! Oh I just don't know... even stupid little fights you'll just sit and second guess yourself. I don't have much advice just wanted to say congrats and good luck on the baby. :)|`|YsQQ30YJaa	You said "everyone". That is the clue. If everyone just stares at you with a WTF? look on their face then it's all you. Go with the people that love you. Take their advice.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You have to ask yourself if it is really worth getting upset over. Pick your battles.|`|X1ACfL8eaa	Oh! How much I hate it when people tell me I'm being hormonal! I can tell when I'm being ridiculous. Sometimes I will be overreacting, but then when I have a serious opinion about something everyone just assumes it's my hormones. If you feel strongly about something then about 5 minutes later you know you were overreacting then you know it's hormones. But we DO have real opinions that have nothing to do with our hormones and don't let people tell you differently!|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I knew I was being hormonal because there were times I would cry over every little thing. I cried because I couldn't get the can opener to work. Really stop and think about the situation that you are upset about. If it's not really that big of a deal then it's probably just the hormones, which is nothing to be ashamed of. Your hormones are all screwed up at this point especially being so close to your due date. It's hard being that pregnant, I remember. But you're almost done so pretty soon you'll be rid of those pesky hormones.|`|ddS7unC2aa	It could be a mixture of both. This pregnancy there has been a really thin line between love and hate when it comes to my hubby.  Most of the time I can tell whether I'm just being hormonal and irrational or if my husbands being a jerk. We'll just apologize to each other and make up then about 2 minutes later be annoying each other again.|`|sUxqJJpiaa	Here is a trick my mother in law told me. When he makes you angry go into another room and read or lie down for 15 minutes. If you are still upset after that he is probably being a jerk. If you are thinking of ways to dispose of the body, it is probably your hormones.|`|4dQ3xu7Aaa	He probably is being a jerk, but you are probably being hormonal too, you are more sensitive to his actions or reactions.  Just ask him to more sensitive to you and you will try to do the same in return.  Good luck with that and your pregnancy!|`|AA11105653	I sometimes think that my boyfriend is the biggest jerk ever! Lol then I remember that I'm hormonal. The other day I got upset because he beat me at cards. lol But he always does.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	I say when a woman is pregnant, if she is upset about something, it is ALWAYS her husband's fault  =)  You're entitled to be hormonal!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I only made it to 36 1/2 weeks, but that last week I pretty much constantly wished I had a BB gun so I could shoot people between the eyes.  One of my work colleagues used to apologize every time he coughed or scraped his chair.<br>  <br>  He might be being a jerk, but it's impossible to tell because you're so very, very pregnant.  Just let it ride for now.  Ask him to be especially considerate with you.
rHufcHwHaa	I'm 29 weeks and still get cramping.  It's just a part of pregnancy I guess.  I'd only worry if it gets really bad and you start bleeding.  Good luck with everything!|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	No it can be totally normal and very common.  I'm 17 weeks and still experiencing this.  I asked my doctor about it at the last visit and she said it is just your uterus stretching and making room for baby.|`|1od9E4sEaa	no worries the cramping on the side are round ligament pain.  extremely common i am 31 weeks along and although my menstrual like cramps stopped around 14 weeks i am still dealing with the round ligament pain (especially the right side)  Just your uterus stretching to accomodate your baby :)|`|J6KtQn8Maa	that's your uterus stretching... but if your scared consult a dr. you may be high risk. <br>  <br>  Sit down and prop up your feet... let nature do its course, it will also help with the cramps.|`|tKXMQCN1aa	Actually, its a good sign you are cramping...its a sign of your growing baby. As long as it isn't excruciating or with bleeding its normal. Sounds like you have round ligament pain. Thats when your muscles surrounding your uterus is stretching and pulling from the weight of the baby. When I was around 16 weeks, I had a cramp on my left side so bad it took my breath away. It continued to around 20 weeks, and then has gotten a little better. I understand your fear of something being wrong because this is my second pregnancy as well, and I also miscarried my first pregnancy at eight weeks. You've made it thus far, and your going into your second trimester, and I believe everything is okay....Hugs to you and your little one. Stay blessed.
ROJans2Taa	we found out at my 18 week apt, and it was clear he was a boy, we were excited but my husband was a little pee'd off just becuase the tech didnt show him what she saw, he wanted to see for himself, so we had the 3d ultrasound and seen his parts lots,lol. I think he was in doubt till he saw.lol|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	When we found out we were both sure t was going to be a girl...but alas it was a boy. I was a tad disappointed at first, I'll be totally honest, but when I got into "boy" mode and started looking at all the great boy nursery sets and cute little clothes I was better. Then he came into this world and I wouldn't have it any other way. Of course I still hope to have my little girl next(when the tine comes), and best part is she'll have a big brother to look after her and protect her.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	We found out 3 weeks ago that we are having baby girl #2! I think that all men deep down want a boy, but my daughter has got my husband wrapped around her finger so he was really excited about having another girl. I cry every time I get an u/s...never fails. There is just something so amazing about seeing that precious little life! <br>  Most offices will tape it for you if you bring in a VHS tape. You should call the office and ask about it. It's a great memory to have and to share with other family members. Congrats!|`|5UdgZEn4aa	I'm 39 weeks and 3 days but I remember feeling nervous when I found out the sex of the baby. They told me it was a girl so I got excited and started buying girl stuff. A month later I went for a second ultrasound and turns out it's a boy! Lol either way I'm just happy to have a healthy baby. :)|`|AA11220327	we get to find out a week from tommorrow, the whole family has their own ideas about what it will be, i think a boy, my husband thinks a girl, my son desperately wants a brother, lol|`|EnKFZ7Roaa	I find out the day after you.  I am guessing mine is a boy but a baby girl is VERY welcomed! Good luck!|`|rui1fmv7aa	My boyfriend and I found out just this morning what the sex of our baby is... A BOY! :) I went in by myself and my boyfriend waited in the waiting room since I really wanted to the person that told him if our child was a girl or a boy, and I was going to wait until we went for breakfast right after our appointment but I really was horrible at keeping the secret.. he found out right when I walked out of the doctors office. My boyfriend was so happy about the news and couldn't stop smiling while we were on our way back to go and eat breakfast, and I'm sure he is still smiling even though he is at work now.<br>  I wanted a girl at one point but ofcourse I am happy no matter what, and my boyfriend really wanted a boy, so it turned out really great. But for some reason even before we went to the ultrasound for about a month I was already calling it a he when we would be talking to our friends about the baby and I don't know why, but I really felt like it was a boy, and I guess I was right :)<br>  Good luck on finding out what your getting, it really is a great day! <br>  Take care!!!|`|AA11916244	My boyfriend never went to any of my appts. Then the one appt i dragged him to the dr did an ultrasound. He just knew we were having a girl but i was convinced it was a boy. As soon as the dr put the wand on my belly I started to laugh and my heart literally leaped for joy. The dr asked if we wanted to know the sex and i said she didnt have to tell me cuz it was VERY obvious it was a boy. I made her point out the parts to daddy so he could see. It was so funny I was elated and he moped out of the drs office. I laughed at him all the way home. We only have one girl and this will be his 4th boy. He's better about it now and even picked out the baby name. Congrats and i hope he gets to come!!|`|fh6TgqENaa	We found out on Feb. 25th that it is a girl! Since we have our pair one boy & one girl I wasn't too picky as to what I wanted. Although another boy would have been nice only b/c in my opinion they are a tad bit easier to raise. Not saying anything against my daughter I love them both so much! My family was with me, My husband, My daughter & My son! It was an amazing experience, I hope he can make it with you, maybe even his son! My daughter wanted a sister so bad! I had that gut feeling that I was INDEED carring a girl but you never know. My husband also thought girl and so did my daughter but my 4 year old son thought boy! He has accepted that we are having a girl so well he tells everyone what her name will be and is always kissing and singing to my belly! Good Luck!|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	I found out on 19th Feb that i'm having a litle girl.... I was absolutely adamant in my mind that it was a little boy..!! So it took me about a week to get it through to my head lol!!<br>  <br>  I wish you loads of luck hun, make sure you have something sugary before you go in so that baby is awake!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and CONGRATULATIONS xxxx|`|TuRO6QHlaa	It is exciting but remember that they can not always tell with my son they noticed the first time because his legs were spread wide open but with m daughter it took like  sonograms|`|dpPqH7BAaa	Well, I was 20 weeks and just had a feeling it was a boy. We had a name picked out and everything. But when the lady did the ultrasound she said it was a girl, I was shocked! I didn't care which I had either way, but I just FELT I was having a boy. It was so amazing to actually see the life I knew I had in me and realize that it was actually a tiny human, my child, the DNA mix of my husband and I. I was in awe when I saw her tiny hands and cute little face. I instantly fell in love, more than I ever thought I could. Watching her move as I felt her inside, I just wanted to hold her in my arms right then and there. I looked up and my husband and the look on his face was priceless. He was staring at her with this look of complete adoration and love. With tears in his eyes the only thing he said was "That's my daughter". He later confessed to me that he wanted a girl all along, and not a boy. He was so happy he called his whole family right when we got out of the room. It was the most amazing moment, and 5 minutes after we got back to the car we had her name picked out. It felt so different knowing rather than guessing. She wasn't an "it" anymore, she was real and it was so incredible. You feel such a strong bond with them after that, being able to actually see them and know that it's a real person. Congratulations, your child is truly the greatest blessing. Don't find out the sex without your boyfriend, it's such a bonding moment for the two of you.
G6eBvDz8aa	Well.. That almost exactly happened to me when I was about.. 6 months pregnant.. After having blood taken twice, an IV of magnesium, because my blood pressure went up as well, an ABG (aterial blood gas. OW!), about 4 breathing treatments, a chest xray, and an okay-for-baby MRI.. forget what it was called but they had to call in a specialist to do it.. anyways.. I had to stay for 2 days.. Apparently chest wheezing and shortness of breath badly in pregnant women could turn into a blood clot.. which they were checking for.. or, simply in my case, a bad asthma attack.. So now I have an inhaler and all that fun stuff! haha.|`|M9mjCEQpaa	Just because you have never had asthma doesn't mean you can't get it.  Asthma is cause by lots of things and can develop later in life.  I got asthma with my third baby for the first time in my life.  Never had it before and then boom.  If they say it is asthma then they are right and don't argue with them because it is serious!  I carry an inhaler with me all the time now.  They might keep you over night to do breathing treatments.  If you are really bad off they may have to do breathing treatments every so often.  I was never over night in the hospital on my asthma, but yours may be worse than mine.  They did do a breathing treatment on me once and then a few hours later again and then they sent me on my way with a Rx for a breathing machine and albuterol.  Good luck and I hope everything turns out ok.|`|iFDye9RMaa	More than likely they will keep you over night if they cant figure out what is wrong with you! They won't jeopardize the health of the baby!|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	likely its a cold being complicated by pregnancy. Especially if you are farther along in the pregnancy. When I was pregnant with my first baby I had no allergies that I knew of, but when my friend came to live with us for some time she was a smoker, she smoked outside but the minute she came in I would get such a WHEEZING and shortness of breath attack I thought I was dying. Turns out that due to the pregnancy I was SUPER sensitive to any kind of cigarette smoke. It would trigger something close to a bad Asthma attack. The doctors checked me thoroughly, I didn't get an X-ray but they prescribe Advair for a week. It worked wonders and I only used it when she would come around me after smoking, which she STOPPED doing as soon as I told her what was happening. I kept the Advair around so when I bumped into anyone that was smoking or just had gotten done I had it available. I didn't have that reaction with my second baby (37 weeks now) though I run through bouts of breathlessness and wheezing when she pushes her feet into my diaphragm.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	I had a lot of stuffed up, runny noses and feeling congested. That is totally normal in pregnancy. Also totally normal is having less lung capacity since your lungs are being compressed by the baby.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you really can't breath then get checked, but it sounds probably like normal pregnancy symptoms. Check out www.babycenter.com for more common symptoms. They also have a "Is is Normal"? and "Is it Safe" sections of Q&A.<br>  <br>  Congrats!!
Ks4YN4iHaa	Don't be self diagnosing yourself!!! Everyone is different, with my first pregnancy I puked my guts out all the time, with my second pregnancy I just felt sick all the time but never puked, unless I ate onions and my son is now 4 years old and perfectly fine. If you have any concerns talk to your doctor!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i doubt you had a miscarriage, some women are different when it comes to pregnancies but if you are worried you should go to your ob|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	my mother and sister never had morning sickness.  My cousin felt sick but never threw up.  All had happy and healthy babies.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I'm not sure where you got that information, but I can tell you it's not true at all.  Every woman and every pregnancy is different.  With my first, I had horrible morning sickness, with my second pregnancy I didn't have a sign of it.  Some women have every sign in the book and some get lucky and don't.  If you've had a positive pregnancy test, then you're pregnant, even if you're not experiencing morning sickness.  Count yourself lucky!  :)<br>  Severe cramping and/or bleeding is a sign of miscarriage.  If you experience either of these, see your doctor right away.  Otherwise, it sounds like a normal and healthy pregnancy to me.  Congrats!  :)<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  Nausea is still considered morning sickness.|`|nISYAHkfaa	No, I have nausea without vomiting all the time and I'm pregnant.<br>  <br>  I haven't actually thrown up this pregnancy, though I have done some dry heaving.<br>  <br>  Some women don't have morning sickness and pop out beautiful babies just fine, so don't worry . . . unless you suddenly have a huge reduction of symptoms, I would rule out miscarriage.<br>  <br>  FYI, it is the having morning sickness and then losing the symptom that is the hallmark of miscarriage, not never having it in the first place. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I recommend buying "what to expect when you're expecting"--best and most reassuring pregnancy book on the market!!|`|uuHPneEcaa	that isn't true.. u didn't have a miscarriage. morning sickness starts at different times for everyone. all pregnancy are different. if ur felling nauseous then that is sometime of morning sickness. ur okay ur baby is okay.. Don't worry ur self over that. Be glad that ur not throwing up..cause when u do it hurts sometimes. I had moring sickness for 4 months THE WORSE EVER!! now everyonce and a while it come back. but ur fine okay.. <br>  <br>  some woman don't have it some have it all through out their pregnancies.|`|a1uoxczTaa	my mom has had 7 kids biologically, she never had morning sickness once.|`|AA11129622	oh sweetie, i strongly suggest you dont search the internet for info - its just way to scary and you will always find the worst cases! buy a baby book :) xxx<br>  i had very bad nausia and felt like i would throw up in the first trimester, but was never actually sick.  im the only one of my preganant friends that had any type of morning sickness :( and i had 6 pregnant friends (3 have now popped).<br>  <br>  so dont worry about it xxx|`|4qmNtwRoaa	Everyone is different and each pregnancy you have may be different.  I did not throw up when I was pregnant with my son but had nausea.  If you are really concerned that you had a miscarriage, go buy a pregnancy test to ease your mind or your doctor can tell you at your next appointment.|`|zYBLzO9Naa	All women are different. I have morning sickness but I don't throw up as well. It's just you feeling nauseated. I don't think you would have a miscarriage, but if you are feeling like you might be. Go consult a doctor. I hope for the best! Good luck!|`|PvEEOdKBaa	I have morning sickness every time.  But as long as you are nausea's you are considered to have it.  So you are good.  Some women do not.  A women with a missed miscarriage often gets the same symptoms anyways because sac continues to grow though.  If you are worried go to your doctor.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I had severe morning sickness and didn't ever throw up until my m/s went away and I have a very healthy baby boy so no, that does not mean you miscarried. If there isn't any blood then you are fine.|`|LDPabWk0aa	im pregnant and i feel just like you i think is normal i have 2 kids and i felt the same way so don't worried and stop reading to much things in the internet it just give more stress.|`|Khk94siCaa	I too felt sick and didn't throw up... dont worry about it if  not talk to your doctor. Everything will be okay

QKn1oUnEaa	Dinner at home should be relaxed, never a formal dining experience since in today's society is often the only time families gather.  I have three boys and I have taught them all table manners for when we dine in public or with family however I do not feel the urge to tell them to get their elbows off the table, fold their napkin in their lap, or other such nonsense at home.  The main etiquette we use at home is not to talk with our mouths full.  It is important that you teach your children etiquette but there comes a point where meals with your family are no longer enjoyable if you make table manners too big of an issue at home.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i'm with chicken farmer that elbows on the table don't bother me at all.  I also don't care tremendously whether someone is using a fork or a spoon, or if they cut all their food before eating it rather than cutting a piece at a time.<br>  <br>  but it matters tremendously to me that kids say please, thank you, politely try a little of what's on their plates without saying anything rude if they don't like it, clear their dishes when they're done, and avoid, say picking up their pasta with their fingers or blowing bubbles in their drinks.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Important:<br>  <br>  -Please and Thank-you<br>  -No chewing with your mouth open<br>  -No farting, or blowing nose<br>  -Use your napkin, not your sleeve|`|AkFag8tNaa	We're more lax than my family was growing up but manners that make people comfortable are still really important. As the others have said, no bodily noises, no yelling, grabbing stuff, no toys at the table but I don't really mind elbows on the table and I don't expect white tie behavior. As long as they are  polite when eating at someone else's house, we're good.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Quite so, I don't go into the fancy stuff like using cutlery correctly/elbows off table but I won't accept playing with food, wolfing it down & making disgusting noises, no slurping or banging forks either... especially no talking with mouth full! Then we wash our own plates afterward not just leave in the sink, something I will teach early on. We eat on tray's infront of the tv (so not really table manners, but still..)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	normal polite behavior - using a napkin not your sleeve or the table cloth, no yelling at the table, use your silverware (unless you are too little to get it), excuse me and thank you.  nothing too fancy.|`|T864ejaiaa	no nose blowing, eat all food, no farting at the table.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	There are the table manners that our family has for everyday eating, don't use your finger, wipe your mouth with your napkin not your sleeve - don't talk with your mouth full, don't lick your knife, excuse yourself if you burp  ......<br>  <br>  However, there are other Table Manners that children, and adults, should know for when they are in a more formal dining situation.<br>  <br>  For example, which fork to use for salad if you are in a fancy restaurant, or how to ask nicely for someone to pass something to you - "Would you be so kind as to pass me the potatoes, Archbishop?" or how to conduct a polite conversation with the person beside you - these are lost arts these days.<br>  <br>  So, to me there are two sets of table manners - those for informal dining at home, and the Table Manners for people to know when there are somewhere else.<br>  <br>  If your kids are taught the manners, even if they don't use them at home, they will still know them when they need them as adults.<br>  <br>  For small children, you can play "Fancy Restaurant" where you are a guest and they are the waiter and you ask nicely for what you want and put your napkin on your lap, say "Please may I ....." when you want something.  Then switch, they get to be the diner and you are the Waiter - it is fun and they learn.|`|ajbMVt8maa	Yes they are important because I do not want to be embarassed when we go out to eat. Rule we abide by: <br>  1) no chewing with your mouth open. I don't want to see you food after it comes off the fork... also, no talking with your mouth full, yuck.<br>  2) no elbows on the table. we are eating, not lounging<br>  3) you sit for the entire meal, unless excused. no bouncing around like little sugared up monsters<br>  <br>  that's about it. my son is very good about following the rules without being reminded because it is something we have done his whole life :)|`|678421ef7889d44a940948af69477778aa	Well, my son is only two right now, but I think as he gets older I will enforce table manners. Im not going to be crazy about it. Like, I won't yell at him for having his elbows on the table, but I will ask him to chew with his mouth closed, not talk with his mouth full, no nose blowing at the table, no nasty bugger/poop talk at the table.. lol  I'm pretty laid back, but I don't accept nastiness.|`|Lor20kXcaa	Mealtimes are supposed to be fun, social activities in our house.<br>  <br>  We have build your own pizza and taco nights... lots of salad.<br>  Stuff gets taken off people's plates, i eat off my husbands fork, (unhygienic? we're married.)<br>  <br>  Elbows are all over the table, because talking and debating is part of dinner.<br>  <br>  Gas/burping is okay, as long as people apologise. Certainly not the nicest thing in the world, but you can't always control it.<br>  <br>  No smacking lips, etc.....<br>  <br>  Fork / spoon i don't mind. Doesn't bother me one bit if my husband or daughter wants to eat spaghetti with a spoon.<br>  <br>  As long as everyone respectful of other people's space, and food, then i don't really mind.<br>  <br>  Food is fun.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I guess there are the manners where common sense comes into play.  I also expect my family to eat together and stay sitting until the meal is over, use please and thank you, and not yell.|`|AA11222790	YES!!!  SO IMPORTANT!!!  I don't like it when people talk while they have food in their mouth.  I hate when people chew loudly...smacking is by far the worst though!  <br>  <br>  I beg everyone...please teach your children proper table manners.  It is so important!|`|ddP3klT3aa	No blowing your nose at the table (that is absolutely repulsive), and no chewing with your mouth open. No passing gas. <br>  We don't use 10 different forks or napkins in the lap.
YBYnZlP8aa	Both times our daughter had rotavirus, we also were infected.  We recovered much quicker - 1-2 days.  The virus is not as strong each subsequent time you come down with it.  So by the time you are an adult, you have probably had it a few times in your life, the thinking is that your immune system should be able to fight it better.<br>  <br>  Call your OB and get their advice.  You probably should just focus on staying hydrated and drink electrolytes.  You can also take Culturelle to get your digestive system back on track.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|oP6G4AXBaa	Yes!!!  My son got it when he was probably 4 months old.  We took him to the ER because when he woke in the morning he hadn't wet his diaper at all and his pedi suggested that we take him in cause he could be dehydrated.  By the time we had left the hospital I was sicker than a dog and stayed that way for about 2 days!!  So, yes, it is very, very possible!  As far as being harmful while pregnant I'm sure it's not good.  You could get dehydrated so I would just take in lots, and lots of fluid!|`|SWAWw0Wdaa	There is always a chance; however it is easier for a child to get anything from the mother|`|ROJans2Taa	rotavirus is extremely contagious, however having it while pregnant isnt as bad as some other illness. your main concern would be to stay hydrated. I dont see it effecting your baby as long as you keep some fluids down. I caught 3 bad colds while pregnant, one was a chest infection needed antibiotics early on. I would of course keep washing hands frequently but other then that, theres not much you can do, just rest assured that if you do get it, you will be the only one suffering, not your baby, best luck|`|ad0F70IMaa	oh wow. my daughter had that and stayed at the hospital for a week. Dr. said it was very contagious and nobody was allowed in without a mask for their mouth. i stayed with her the entire week and never caught anything. i think maybe its passed more from child to child because their immune system not being as strong as ours. but just be careful. im sure it would be harmful considering you would become severely dehydrated.
bMZ7lOfVaa	Kalia...I love that name. It's unique but easy to say and very pretty.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Sienna Autumn Rose is gorgeous and my hands-down favorite. <br>  <br>  My second pick is Kalia Mylee Rose.|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	Hi sweetie, i really like Kensley and Kaila-strong sounding names.<br>  I am also really into the name Kiara-my cousins name, its awesome!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice.<br>  Kensley Kaila sounds pretty good!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Sienna, if I must choose, but they are all pretty horrible. Kensley is a masculine boy's name and is horrid for a little girl. There is nothing feminine, girly, or unisex about it or any other Ken- names. Miley is trashy and qill always be associated with that talentless wonder, Miley Ray Cyrus. And even though I did not think it was possible, you have made it even more trashy with an ugly, trashy spelling.|`|dC7nBu53aa	Kalia is a lovely name.<br>  <br>  Mylee reminds me of miley cyrus, and she's not a good role model|`|KOcCenrEaa	Mylee Autumn Rose.|`|6YJfHgksaa	i vote for Kensley|`|2sICxnuKaa	They are really beautiful names, with mine I was unsure but when they were born I just knew Good Luck and any of the names are really lovely!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Sienna|`|SIp415MFaa	Kalia is a nice name. but why dont you keep all four in mind and see which one suits ur babys characteristics when born better|`|25Ys3DEPaa	Sienna 100%|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Kensley|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I really like Kensley! :)|`|HDS3IGj1aa	voted<br>  i like mylee and kensley, kalia would have to grow on me|`|5Wnv44iuaa	I voted!  <br>  Sienna for sure!<br>  <br>  My second choice would be Kalia... but that's far behind Sienna, which is just gorgeous!  <br>  <br>  If you think Sienna is too popular, maybe consider:<br>  <br>  Scarlett<br>  Isla<br>  Acacia<br>  Liliana<br>  Alessandra<br>  Juliana<br>  Selena<br>  Daniela<br>  Marianna<br>  Dahlia<br>  Sage<br>  Cassia|`|qqj7e64Waa	I like Kalia, Mylee and Sienna<br>  Sorry i counldnt choose!!!!<br>  xx|`|ua7wLkQGaa	Kensley|`|Uvh4mWQBaa	I like Kalia|`|Q60i3HANaa	sienna miller|`|gjUs8ZzGaa	I like Kensley the best.
rHufcHwHaa	yep, i had to pee all the time during my second trimester.  I don't know about every 20 minutes--i guess your baby is putting a lot of pressure on your bladder! IT may be a UTI, but your doctor should regularly be checking for this, and if he hasn't said anything then it's not anything to worry about.  Having to go that often is so annoying though! I get to the point where I just don't want to go...but I keep telling myself I only have a few months to go! Congrats and hang in there :)|`|MW1yrHbOaa	yes, i peed a lot the whole pregnancy|`|yZkf3zFeaa	Super normal, and annoying.<br>  I went from being in the bathroom from morning sickness all the time to peeing all the time. It slowed down for a short while and now its almost back to every half hour, at least its only once a night now.|`|xpstigPTaa	It is TOTALLY normal hun! Your uterus continues to expand for the baby which in turn puts pressure on your bladder. Your not alone!!!|`|NE96fU9vaa	oh yeah, get used to it sister.
72b1b98cae822f6e9e185fe824d0b9cdaa	I'm due april 17 and you won't be 8 months until 32 weeks and yes i'm very excited|`|QSodlfMraa	from my knowledge you enter in your 8 months at 32 weeks, and then 32 to 36 is 8 months and 36 to 40 is 9 months.<br>  <br>  congrats still :).|`|AA10953561	According to my "What to Expect" book your eighth month start on week 32, so since you've finished the 31st week and are actually in your 32nd week then yes, you've just started the 8th month! Congratulations! I'm currently 32 weeks pregnant, due April 25th, and I can't wait to see my baby girl either! I feel so swollen all the time, and stretched as big as I could possibly be. I have our hospital bags partially packed, and am trying to wait a little longer to start setting up the baby furniture.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|WJF8LNm4aa	I am so excited, I can't wait to meet him.  I've been taking my time with everything though.  I haven't packed my bag yet and will have my baby shower in two weeks, when I am 36 weeks pregnant.  I really hope he doesn't come before then LOL!  I just don't want to get too anxious because these last 6 weeks will feel like an eternity : )<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|bTlhBX3daa	Technically, you still have 2 months to go. <br>  I am due on May 5th. I am super excited but my baby has gone head down and I have become very sore. I'm having a hard time walking and/or moving.
l3ZNEED1aa	yes. if you have missed ur periods then u can get pregnant.just have the test.|`|nXZUOJ20aa	Get a pregnancy test or go and see your GP, that way you will be sure wont you? are your nipples sore? have you become moody? have you not come on your period?|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	then get a test|`|lkMW2G35aa	dont be silly wrap his willy|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I hope that's good news<br>  <br>  Take a test and see|`|COecrPrMaa	Wow... how completely vague.<br>  <br>  Have you had unprotected sex?  If yes, then, well... yes.
s4LWmcTjaa	I haven't heard anything on any 911 calls, but she puts her own selfish wants and needs before those of her children.  <br>  <br>  I agree with Me and D*Kat on this.  She shows an incredible lack of maturity and intelligence.  She is irresponsible and her kids deserve better than a money hungry, attention grubbing woman.<br>  <br>  I have no issues with her wanting a large family, but she did it in the most irresponsible way I can think of!  You don't go popping out 8 more kids and having plastic surgery when you have 6 more kids to care for.  She's not mentally stable and she needs some serious psychological help.|`|T864ejaiaa	i don't see any one on here butching about illegals coming here and living off our tax dollars while popping out kids like rabbits. get real people. i wanted a big family and didn't. don't you all have a better life then to hate on a woman that wants a big fam? grow up!!!!!|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Yes, but not really for the reasons you've listed.. Their are millions of mothers who sponge of the government, she wont make that much difference, But I think she's mentally ill & not fit to bring up ONE child let alone 14, setting a bad example for other naive women who will think of doing the same thing to get money & publicity aswell. Funding this is telling her & everyone that this complete madness, selfishness & irrisponsabilty is perfectly fine.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	It was actually $160,000 she got for her back injury. Which makes it that much worse. <br>  <br>  This is not how a healthy person thinks.<br>  <br>  I won a lawsuit, so instead of buying a bigger home for my 6 kids, I'm going to have as many more kids as possible all while looking like Angelina Jolie. <br>  <br>  She's not fit to raise those kids. I have nothing against large families, just parents that put more time and enegry on their wants than their childrens needs.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think if we didn't give people so much attention maybe they wouldn't do ignorant things like this and wouldn't get offered so much money.<br>  Honestly, I could give a **** less about this woman. I hope her kids turn out ok. I hope they will adopt them out. But really, I have a life. What she is doing is no concern of mine.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Show me one piece of proof she has abused her children. Not financially or simply by having too many children, but real true abuse. If you can I will agree with you. <br>  <br>  Until then she deserves the same rights as the rest of us.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Who f***ing cares?
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I was showing at 14 weeks with my first pregnancy.. it all depends on your body. the best way to find out how far along you are is to go by your LMP, not measurements.|`|i8Ch743Laa	No,your tummy won't be growing already. Not if it's your first. I know that with my daughter,I didn't show at all until 6-7 months,and then it just popped out overnight. Sometimes,it just looks smaller than it is. It depends on the type of ultrasound they did,etc.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Did they change your due date as a result of this? 2 weeks isn't really too big of a difference in the long run. I would say that you're probably closer to 9 weeks though.  If you thought you were 6 weeks at your first ultrasound then that means you were really 8 weeks and they would have known for sure that you were 8 weeks and not 6. Maybe you baby is just a growing machine!!! <br>  Also, I'm 11 weeks 2 days and I have a little tiny belly but some people don't get one until they're closer to 4 1/2 months along.|`|cRz31MlMaa	At 11 weeks the fetus is only about 1 and 1/2 inches long and about .25 grams in weight so depending on your body shape and size no you probably wont be showing yet.It is usualy about 20 weeks you start to show.  When the doctors give you your due date it is a give or take 2 weeks estimation that is why you can go into labor or deliver at 38 weeks  being 2 weeks early or 42 week being 2 weeks late being the reason the docs don't stress too much if you are a little under or a little over your 40 week estimated date. Hope this helps and good luck and safe delivery for you and you baby.|`|gdnL63ngaa	They should also take into consideration the first day of your last period. Maybe your baby was measuring small but had a growth spurt?<br>  <br>  When I though I was 7 weeks I was actually 8.5 which was awesome - closer to the due date! LOL<br>  <br>  I didn't start growing until 13th week, but I'm now 22 weeks and have a bit of a bulge but nothing too noticable, yet.|`|lWd6fkgFaa	I was always under the impression that the earlier the ultrasound the more accurate the age of the baby. So I would have thought 9 weeks was more pregnant. Usually With your first baby you don't start showing until you are around 20 weeks. Perhaps you have just put in weight|`|6jXgOuUPaa	alot of times doctors have no clue of what their talking about and they base size on how far along you are. you can have a slightly bigger baby and they'll say that its x amount of weeks when its not. you can also have a smaller baby and they might say your x amount of weeks pregnant when you might not have even had intercourse to match that date. thats why its always good to kinda take not yourself and to always pay attention to any changes going on in your body. im now 25 weeks. and with this pregnancy i knew the exact date i concieved just based on paying attention to my body and the changes. and it really depends on how many your pregnant with in reguards to "YOUR STOMACH GROWING' NOT SHOWING(big difference)". if its one, more then likely your stomach wont start growing for a few more weeks. 2 slightly yes. 3 its growing rapidly.|`|EnUYe4r6aa	your dating scan (which is the second) will be more accurate hun, i went for my first scan and she told me i was 8 weeks then on my second she told me i was actually 12 weeks and 5 days on my second which i thought i shud of bin 14 weeks. its hard to tell on the first scan as there not actually classed as a baby. and as for your tummy growing it depends it could be your mind playin tricks on you. as it still may be the size of a prawn! :-)<br>  good luck hope i helped.|`|Zdp0GlyUaa	I'm pregnant with my first baby, I started showing around 14 weeks but the time i was 18weeks i was massive, I'm now 27weeks and look full term, it all depends on what Your having and how your body carrys the baby good luck x

e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	I think it's because you havn't had enough fluids today hun!!<br>  <br>  You should try drinking a few glasses of water!!<br>  <br>  I find that my wee is that colour when i havn't had enough fluids :)<br>  <br>  xxxxx|`|77Zt3gn9aa	realistically all wee should be clear....anything other than that just means you need to be more hydrated.  Nothing too serious though with dull yellow or bright yellow wee.  I would just drink a lot of water during your pregnancy.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	the brightness is probably from your vitamins, the dullness or cloudyness I am guessing means you need to drink more water and keep your eye out for a uti.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	It means you're dehydrated.  Urine should be a light straw color.  You need to be drinking at least 64 oz of clear liquids a day- but anything with caffiene doesn't count.|`|ded4210b2d8375997cd6719be107446baa	Well, mine has been the same for a couple of months now and always seems fine when I have antenatal, however you can always ppa sample into your GP to have it checked, or your midwife may do it if you phone. best have it checked sooner rather than later, look out for any other symptoms like swelling etc..|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	It's probably just your prenatals. It says on the bottle that it might cause discoloration in you urine.|`|AA10063059	its probably due to your vitamin tablets,thete is no need to worry anyway|`|8uiH6iRbaa	me thinks some one is a little dehydrated<br>  <br>  you may need to up your fluid intake !!!<br>  <br>  Dehydration can cause contractions so staying well hydrated can help prevent contractions.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Mine's been more orange! Which is a little worrying though there's never anythign wrong when I have it checked at my midwife appointment.<br>  <br>  Just try drinking more water and see if this makes any difference.<br>  <br>  First thing in the morning it is probably more likely to be coloured but after that just drink more water and if it doesn't make a difference call your midwife to make sure, though I'm sure it's fine.
s2F6pK9Xaa	That's an awesome name! I've only known ONE other Keeley and I thought it was the coolest name since I met her.<br>  <br>  I like that spelling the best: Keeley. Second favorite would be Keely. But definetly do not chose to spell it Keeleigh! I'm really sick of all the names that are now spelled with -leigh instead of their traditional endings...that trend is getting old.<br>  <br>  I love the name just how you put it; Keeley Christina is beautiful. Don't change it one bit!|`|iRc3xhubaa	I really like that name. I have never heard it, but it is beautiful. <br>  <br>  I think Keileigh looks the best. It looks femine and pretty. Keeley and Keely, just don;t have the same affect. They look too simple and almost masculine. <br>  <br>  Also, I feel like Keileigh Christina are too BIG STRONG names, and I think that the middle name is supposed to compliment the first name, as a petite statement. <br>  <br>  How about Keileigh Claire?|`|7B6PxDzYaa	Ok I going to be horrible BUT keeley is not a name for a high court judge or doctor, more a low paid job.  BUT Christina has class for a first name, you don't think Christina she must live in a deprived council scheme, but you do with a name like Keeley.  I think you might be young so think carefully, it does affect you child, Im a boss and you cannot help make assumptions about candidates names as usually your spot on.|`|78ouhV4caa	i think Keeley is best way to spell it :) thats a lovely choice<br>  Christina is a beautiful choice too but i personally dont like the flow of those two together. Its not terrible though! Go with what YOU like. Shes your daughter:)|`|GognIJnBaa	If your name is Chanelle Christina, maybe name your daughter Keely Kristina.  Then you have CC initials and she has KK.  :o)  Just a thought.  I do like Keeley though, and I like it spelled that way too.|`|9QAVNJtWaa	i reckon keeley is best<br>  <br>  christina is nice.  i also thought of keeley suzannah hassell <br>  <br>  if she marries someone with surname hoff she can be hassell-hoff lol|`|AA10151168	Keeley..<br>  <br>  Christina is very common name|`|3d16f3f2397b4ddf7986e1573401231aaa	I think that "Keeley" is the best spelling for the name. Christina sounds great with it too! Good job :)|`|yZuMwhgraa	Keeley is lovely!! I think you're spelling it thw best way too. Christina goes lovely too.. Good luck & congratulations! Got any ideas on a middle name for Maisie? We are thinking about that name but cant find a middle name that we like.. xoxox|`|CTmWS6dMaa	Keep it Keeley or Keely. Adding more letters only makes it less appealing. <br>  <br>  Keeley Christina sounds pretty.|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	Keeley Christina<br>  Keeley Michelle<br>  Keeley Nicole<br>  Keeley Nevaeh<br>  <br>  either way it will be cute and unique|`|p6Et4xpUaa	Adoreable name but Id spell it Keileigh, I like christina but Prefer Keileigh,<br>  <br>  but overall its all up to you, what ever you want really!|`|JV8hD8gKaa	Keeley Christina is lovely id keep it as that if i were you. plus if its just spelt keeley leaves less confusion with ways its spelt and junk! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck  with everything.:D|`|EGpFJXDhaa	Keeley. Very cute name.|`|vGk4PlSWaa	Keeleigh Marie|`|U2tx9gDHaa	I like Keeley best and Christina is a lovely name so stick with it.|`|HjYP8YSNaa	Keeley Christina Hassell is really a cute name..Go with it..|`|uK3erCEOaa	It's got a great ring to it...stick to the way you want it...first choice, best choice...good luck and enjoy!!!|`|r42fprwUaa	love tha name;leave it how you spell'd it its very cute;|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Keeley is the way I like it spelled<br>  It's the way Pierce Bronson wife spelled her name<br>  <br>  Keeley is gaelic and means beautiful<br>  I love the name<br>  <br>  Keeley Christinea Hassell is a great name<br>  <br>  IF both parents love the name, that is the only thing that matters|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I like Keely!|`|Prm7yND4aa	Keeley, however you spell it, is incredibly unattractive sounding. All I hear is "keel", as in to keel over in pain. Charming.<br>  <br>  Christina is much, much nicer. Christina Keeley Hassell would be quite nice. If Keeley must be used, I would spell it this way or Keely.|`|iAfmejYTaa	i kinda like keeley CHRISTIAN. not so much christina|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Keeley Christina is a great name|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like that name.I like the way you spelled it first.
DN6XtoViaa	it can take some women a few weeks after their missed period to test positive! so yes it can take longer for some :)<br>  <br>  also, they say first morning urine is the best because it sits for a good 5-6 hours in your bladder and builds up more hcg!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HW89eJEZaa	yes, for some women, if your urine is diluted, the test may not come out right, if i were you, i would do it first thing in the morning so that your urine is stronger.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	it can take long i would go to your dr and tell him that you did a home pregnancy test and it came back negative. see if you can get answer that way.<br>  good luck and if you are congrats.
iRc3xhubaa	Alesse is a birth control, right?<br>  <br>  For the same affect, what about Alise? I have a friend named Anne Alise. I have always thought that was very pretty.<br>  :)|`|TCpPdqcBaa	Spell it Elise and it will be beautiful.|`|U1h6Dntjaa	That's a type of birth control pill.  I'd not name a child that.|`|Prm7yND4aa	What on earth is Alesse? "uh-less", "uh-less-ee", Elise, Alice?<br>  <br>  If it's Elise or Alice, spell it this way. If it's anything else, ditch it. It looks unattractive and confusing.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Birth control?<br>  That's the first thing that came to mind.<br>  Other than that, it's a pretty name.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Alesse is birth control.|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	How do you pronounce alesse?   <br>  I can see this poor kid having to tell people how to spell and pronounce it's name the rest of it's life.|`|p6Et4xpUaa	It sounds like the sports brand ellesse, but you daughter call her what you like, how about Anise?  Nisie for short? i think it's cute anyway!|`|33SuBPLWaa	Alesse is a birth control drug!|`|AA10151168	I think pretty cool..
fh6TgqENaa	Your Gross Income.|`|Ela3o96Raa	In the state of PA, where I live - it does not matter what your income is if you are pregnant or if you are apply for a child under the age of 19. If you are not pregnant or not apply for a child then you will not be able to recive it unless you make under 20,000 a year. I dont know about your state but where I live we have a program called CHIP, which covers all children, no matter what your income. Pregnant women are also considered under this, so if your expecting it doesnt matter what your income is - you still qualify.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Gross income, before taxes.
a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	This was a concern for me last year. I had mono and had a 1 & 2 year old child and I was informed that children under age 3 cannot get mono. I was told this by a Doctor, a nurse, a preschool director, a child development specialist and it never happened so I believe it's true now!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	YES. <br>  Antibiotics or not, mono is an AIRBORNE disease and just breathing on your child can cause them to be in contact with the germs. Mono is NOT something that you can fool with because it can affect major organs and get serious quick. It can sometimes take months to fully recover. I would NOT let someone with mono watch my kids- regardless of how old they are- but especially a toddler who could become very seriously ill with this.<br>  <br>  I think I would tell them flat out that because of the mono you are not comfortable having her around your family and children right now because they can get seriously ill if they were to catch it- antibiotics or not. It may be called "the kissing disease" but kissing has NOTHING to do with it. That is a myth.|`|1hciyvKdaa	A situation like this, warrants a call to your pediatrician. For one person an illness might just run its course, for another it could become life threatening.  Call your Ped, physician or er to find out exactly the risks. sometimes we have to say no, sorry cant do.|`|wqL84O8Naa	its highly unlikely, however the worst thing that could happen, is it would tire him out and give you some much needed relaxation time|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Not if she is on antibiotics for at least 24 hours.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes.|`|z3A8meCNaa	I've been reading some of the answers on here, and they are sadly misinformed.  It's stupid really.  Mono is "the kissing disease" because a lot of teens get it through stuff like french kissing.  I don't think a toddler can get it, but just make sure he doesn't touch anything that's hers that she might have put her mouth on.  Don't worry,it's not airborne.  My friend had it and I hung around her all the time, I still haven't gotten it.  It's not life threatening at all, it just slows you down.  I agree with the person who said the worst it could down is make your toddler less energetic and more willing to take naps.|`|q1y7kgnEaa	i was diagnosed with mono 2 1/2 months ago, i have no idea how i got it but apparently i got it....i have done alot of research on it...your son should be ok as long as she doesnt kiss on him and dont let him drink after her, basically it is caught through fluids, otherwise he should be safe...just because she has mono does not mean she is dangerous,lol...i'm assuming that since she was diagnosed with it that she is on the antibiotics for it, so just dont let any fluids transfer from her to him and they should be fine...ie...its called the kissing disease....its called that because its transferred through fluids...so...no kissing, no drinking after each other...if she is sneezing or coughing or anything like that, make sure she is careful to cover her nose and mouth with something and stress to her that if she is going to touch anything she needs to wash her hands...a good idea would be to maybe get her a little thing of hand sanitizer that would be good....here are some sites in the source section u should check out so u know some facts about it...hope i helped u....|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Mono is super contagious and lasts a long long time.  In an infant it can cause severe illness.  Your child should be no where near her.|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	Yes he could easily catch it. I would suggest other accommodation for your sister.
l3ZNEED1aa	this will be too early to test.wait for your period.if it is missed then take a test.|`|25f5eacafe9e63ff5ee0fcc70495c2bcaa	Well it all depends on when you think you conceived.  Symptoms (if any ) usually show up around 2-3 weeks after conceiving. For most women its the usually "morning sickness." Seeing how the time of your period is about to approach, the sickness you are feel may be that your body is getting ready for your period. This varies from woman to woman. After the date of your period has gone by and you still haven't had it, I suggest you take a home pregnancy test. If this comes inconclusive, then that would be time to go to the doctor.|`|0UAIBW53aa	you can test as soon as 5 days before your period is due, try first response|`|SvwAADrVaa	yes you are|`|WZQKevt8aa	You may be pregnant, do a test on the 3rd or the 4th. Good luck!
98qMZZPlaa	Get outta here!!  When you Google Tartism My questions on Y!answers are first???<br>  Yall just made my day. I accomplished something, but education middle America about tartism!<br>  Can we make an Anti-Tartism Petition?<br>  Anyone interested?<br>  My son's like to play with Barbies, by the way, their sister's, but do not call them Buddy.  They are already Anti-Tartism at their young age.|`|cteyFJxhaa	I call my son "Hamster Brain" and it doesn't seem to have done him any harm so I can't imagine what the problem would be with buddy.<br>  <br>  I did meet a guy once who had a problem when I asked where the kids were....he pointed out that he didn't have any kids, but his children were in the back yard....kids are baby goats.....<br>  <br>  Some people are just idiots.|`|AA12145826	*Note the OOZING sarcasm*<br>  <br>  Of course it does?!

Yes she's a trolling troll of a troll and I am ashamed I've even given her the time of day.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	That "tartisim" troll got to be my favorite yet. I googled "tartism" and the first things to come up was her questions here on YA followed by stuff about pies!|`|AA11997524	No that's ridiculous.  She's just raising little barbarians.  The kinds of kids that grow up to commit hate crimes because they were never man enough for their big ole mama.|`|wUooHVU3aa	I'd like to recommend you stop drinking, at least before 12pm|`|nKXTjqQWaa	What are you talking about?|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Ask Tartism (thingy)..she seems to think shes knows about this !|`|21c37ca5802bb16b17aaeeea0b09f2bbaa	OOkay, step away from the ledge. I've called my son (his name is Charlie) Charliebugs, BooBoo, Buddy, Bubba, Charlie Chubbiecheeks, Mr. Misery, as well as Charlie.<br>  If he does ever want a Barbie...well...that`s the way it goes.<br>  Nobody knows how to raise a child at first, ``experts`` be damned. Experts are people who know how they want a child raised, and woe betide any who disagree. They just have a publishing deal.<br>  You will be fine.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	Can't we all just get along?|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	more than 1 account or name change how original|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	all the time.  i also dress him in pink and paint his nails|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I call my boys bubby, not buddy. <br>  <br>  And fyi, my kids like Barbies and baby dolls as much as they like toy guns and trucks. If you have issues with that, too bad. They're my kids and I'll call them what I like and let them play with whatever toys they like.<br>  <br>  Even if it's a tutu and a magic wand, you would love that, wouldn't you?|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	if you are talking nicknames i think it's ok.  i call my sons buddy all the time.  what the hell are you talking about.|`|yrDqtazLaa	I call my 2 year old "Bud", and he's all boy. You won't ever see that kid playing with dolls (unless he's ripping their heads off).|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Are you crazy? What in the world are you talking about exactly? Just how many accounts do you have now?
AA12193113	I bought my son the rainforest jumperoo and he adores it.  It was definately a life saver.  I looked at the precious planet one and it does look identical to the rainforest one, other than the curved posts.  If you ask me the precious planet one looks like it would take up more room than the rainforest one.  However, both look like fun.  Good luck.|`|9eno55hCaa	My daughters Amby bed came with a jump so we just use that :)<br>  <br>  But i think the Precious Planet one looks more interesting myself.<br>  <br>  Though I have heard from our daughters doctor that babies that are not sitting up on thier own should not be in a jumper.  We were told not to allow our daughter in one till shes sitting up because her back is not strong enough for standing.  I would personally be checking with my babies doctor before putting them into a jumpy thing or anything where they practice standing.|`|0viZhxi6aa	We have the blue pony. (It's like a cowboy theme - too cute!)  My son loves it! But really I think they're both great. Good luck!|`|C4miEeuYaa	OMG! My daughter has the rain forest jumperoo and LOVES it! I feel we made a great decision in getting it.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	My son has the Rainforest Jumperoo and has always loved it.  He started in it at about the same age as your son.  <br>  <br>  However...do they sell Rainforest things anywhere anymore? Just based on what I see in Babies R Us, it seems like they've dumped Rainforest for Precious Planet.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I'm pretty sure that they don't sell Rainforest things in the stores anymore.  I was in Target today and all I saw were Precious Planet things.  I looked at the jumperoo and it looked like the same thing as the Rainforest one, just different decorations.|`|uxjmNfOcaa	We bought my daughter the rainforest jumperoo. She loved it, she had a lot of fun playing in it, and whats best is that it is unisex so it can be used for those future babies. ;) Which is very helpful, since we have another on the way!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Are you talking about looks wise? Because otherwise I think they are pretty much the same. It seems like Precious Planet is replacing the Rainforest theme.<br>  <br>  I do think the Precious Planet is cuter.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	To be honest they're so similar it's hard to say which one I prefer.  My son has the rainforest one and LOVES it.  It has two spinning toys on it that he particularly loves, there's a toy that makes noises at the front, and two other smaller ones.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend it, but I'll be the other one's just as good.  I've never seen the Precious Planet one before.

ay8tXLD2aa	From 6 to 9 months a baby "should" be having two naps each day, from 1 - 2 hours long, and getting 11 to 12 hours of night time sleep.  Total sleep needed in a 24 hour period is 14 to 15 hours.  The afternoon nap is usually a bit longer than the morning nap. Some babies take 3 naps at this age still, more like a 1.5hour nap in the morning and at lunch time and then a 30 to 45 minute catnap in the late afternoon. <br>  <br>  The person who said 17 hours .....well, 17 hours is what newborns are expected to sleep.  No healthy 6 month old will sleep 17 hours out of every 24.|`|FWUSLQN2aa	how ever much you can get them to sleep honestly, they are actually supposed to be sleeping over half of a 24 hour period, my son is two now and he sleeps 12 hrs at night (7-7) and gets anywhere from 1hr to a 4 hr nap, depending on how tired he was, but i belive for 7 months its about 17 hrs. but if he's sleeping less, there's nothing you can really do about it. hope i helped.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Ideally 2x 1-2 hour naps in the day and 12 hours at night but every baby is different.<br>  <br>  My son (7mos) does roughly this, a bit under the 12 hours at night usually though - more like 10-11.
x647LeB2aa	When J was in hospital he became doubly incontinent and very sore.  They gave him a huge tub of aqueous cream but the name escapes me!  Whatever it was it worked though.<br>  <br>  I'd go see your doctor and get them to prescribe you something.  That way you can try out different creams until you find the one that works and won't be forking out loads of money.  There are so many on the shelves it is hard to decide.|`|1NDHSSqwaa	I tend to use vaseline and talc on my babies bottom when he has a rash. I apply the talc first to absorb any excess moisture from when his bottom was cleaned (my sons a wriggly chap and i don't like leaving him nappy free) and then vaseline to prevent moisture from touching his skin.<br>  <br>  You could also try putting a touch (say half a capful) of disinfectant in his bath water. I do this when i'm bathing my son and have found since doing so he rarely gets rashes. Just make sure the the disinfectant you use is stated as being safe for bathing (which dettol is).|`|2GhwuXksaa	Hi <br>  <br>  I have a 1 year old daughter who suffers very badly with nappy rash, sometimes to the point where she bleeds. When she was in the hospital, I was given Bepanthen to use instead of sudocrem as it is more gentle on her delicate skin. I personally found that it did work, its worth a try with your son? On the parents page of YA they are offering a free sample so why not give it a try?<br>  <br>  I hope you find what your looking for. Good luck!|`|UR9BX77haa	Bepanthen is brilliant, the best we used if we needed it. My hubby buys lots of it because its great for his new tattoos. It still lets the skin breath as well as healing the soreness. I would avoid vaseline because its a complete barrier and you may find little spots appear after using it from it blocking the skins pores.|`|8938823b93c7a8fab3771af7c8ebf1e7aa	Your health visitor can recommend one, I cant remember the name of it but it begins with M.  Its bright yellow/orange in colour and smells strongly a medicinal smell. It works like magic and really quickly.  You can buy it in all chemists.  Its in a yellow tube.  Sorry I cant remember the name.<br>  <br>  Bepanthen, by the way, is fantastic on newly done tattoos!!|`|wxImZRssaa	I use sudocrem, only when its sore. To stop her bum getting sore, I let her spend a while everyday with no nappy. Fresh air works wonders.|`|TwVd0etQaa	My sister swears by it. I will definitely use it when my baby is born. Its smooth texture and sooths the skin too.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I love Bepanthen. It is so much better than the stuff in the grey tub who's name escapes me! <br>  <br>  It really does the job!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Bepanthen is great!<br>  <br>  I prefer Sudocream though. There is also a cream that is chamomile based, its really good for sores. I can't remember the name though, sorry!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If sudocream doesn't work, try applying Vaseline before or/and after your chosen cream. It is a natural water retractor so its great for preventing sores.|`|5jqFrtrwaa	Bepanthen is the bext cream i've ever used on my babies bottom. He hasn't ever really had bad nappy rash as as soon as I see any sign on redness I put this on him and it goes away so quickly.|`|nbUpqg04aa	sudocrem, it works wonders! also great for zits, shaving rash and eczema!|`|KhxIyJOcaa	i only have had to use it once, cleared it up straight away.<br>  so it last ages :)<br>  x|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I don't think i've used it but I may have been given a sample in a bounty pack and used it!? Lol. But we use sudocrem and that seems to work with us. But my partners niece has always had severe nappy rashes and was given something called timodine (I think?!) and that is apparently really good. You can only get it on prescription though. :O)|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	i've heard of it on here, but only this week seen it advertised. I used, and swore by, drapolene for my daughter, but for my son i prefered sudocrem. i don't know why.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	i think bepanthen is brilliant i used it last week on my daughter who is 3 she had chickenpox and it soothed her when she went to the toilet and i did not have her screaming in pain|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Used it once.

1tmX7xbRaa	well i think the time depends on the day and what you plan on doing during the shower. for example i would recommend doing it on a sunday from about 1-4. i would have some food, games and opening presents.<br>  this way everyone can have about a half hour 45 minutes and then start eating (1-2) during this time people can also socialize. then from about 2-3 i would play some small games and give out prizes. there are all kinds of cute games you can find on the internet. and giving prizes is easy because you can come up with a million different ideas. then i would say for the remainder of the shower you open presents and socialize. if you have more then 50 people i would extend the shower about an hour to have extra time.|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	I had my baby shower on December 14 and my due date was January 6.

It consist of games like baby bingo, guess moms (or dads) size, mystery baby food, dirty diapers (not real messy diapers,lol), guess what's on the tray and etc. You can throw your own shower too cause I planned mines until finally those who said they would stepped in at the last minute and put it together in a rush.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	I would say between 6 and 8 months, definitely not in the first trimester.  Other than that, whenever works for the mother to be. I would want mine to be in the afternoon. <br>  <br>  'Usually', a baby shower is thrown by a friend or relative of the expectant mother, but it is becoming more and more common for people to plan their own showers.

OgzHcNMsaa	Sounds  more than attachment issues with the constant shoving her boob in the 1 year old's mouth. At this point he can have  baby foods (i.e arrowroot cookies etc). Maybe(i'm  not making a joke) she gets off on it.Apparently some women do. I read that once|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	First time mom or not, I'd say by this stage in her child's life she would have more of a handle on things. Pulling over three times to nurse a one year old? He could have a sippy cup by then, surely. By that age both of my kids were nursing first thing in the morning and at nap and bedtime, not during the middle of the day. I agree, though, when you're that close to home, a kid that age can easily hold off for a few minutes, assuming he's even hungry. <br>  <br>  It sounds like she's misreading his cues on eating - does she normally feed him a lot at home? My SIL was like this with some of her kids - she'd feed the child whenever he cried, and sometimes he'd throw up. It was obvious he wasn't hungry. <br>  <br>  It sounds like your friend is ... well, not unhinged, per se, but a bit overbearing. She complains about him being clingy and then does stuff like this? It's hard to step back and notice your own behavior, and if she's *asked* for advice and yet won't take it, then just step back and let her do her thing. If he's not eating well - is he on solids? Does he drink from a cup? She could feel that the only thing he'll take is the breast, or she could be in denial that he's beginning to lack interest and is self-weaning. Who knows. Just keep your distance with that one and know there's really nothing you can say that will change her mind.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	kind of she sounds like shes obsessed with breastfeeding|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well if she is a first time mommy i don't think it's too odd. i mean this lady sounds like she takes it to the extreme. there is no reason why the baby can't fuss in the backseat a little until she gets home to feed him. sounds like she has a few issues but it could just be cause shes a first time mommy and she wants to make sure she is doing whats best. i don't know really.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Yes, it's a little odd, but if she won't listen and take any advice there isn't much you can do.....|`|7PXFXcKfaa	its you. and its really none of your business how she decides to raise her child.<br>  <br>  I say kudos to her for not letting her unsympathetic "friends" lack of sympathy put her off breastfeeding her child ... which, by the way, she is doing for the recommended length of time! <br>  <br>  I assume you are formula feeding? You need to just stop harassing this poor lady and give her space to let her do whatever she likes! Its not odd . . . at least to people who do breastfeed. If your kid starts screaming and gets hysterical its impossible to latch them on. <br>  <br>  To be honest it sounds like you think shes weird for breastfeeding her kid ... and shes probably picking up this vibe from you. This is why shes not listening to your advice. <br>  <br>  Maybe if your a bit more sympathetic, she would be able to come out a bit more with you, and listen to your advice ... because at the moment it does sound like your being a bit judgemental. sorry.|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	I think you are right to be concerned, but how to put that concern into practical advice she will follow is another matter. One thing I am sure of, feeding a child in a car parked at the side of the road is definitely not a safe place, so maybe that is something you could point out to her.<br>  She also needs to get him interested in other foods as he will pass through the stage this normally occurs and then she will have difficulty getting him to try anything new without making a major fuss.

O3EtP4vOaa	I would say go get a hpt just to be sure, it very well could have been implantation bleeding.  If it was not then you could have had an annovulatory cycle, where you do not ovulate but you shead some lining which gives you the brownish mixed w/ blood mixed w/ cm.  I unfortunately have these cycles alot and have the same stuff.  You could also have a bacterial infection which can cause the missed period and odd bleeding, and bleeding brought on after bding.  Take a test to make sure if it is neg wait it out til next month if you still have issues make an appt. w/ your gyn.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Bn5JoVlLaa	hey im in a similar situation... last month i got my period as normal (32 day cycle) and then 14 days i had cramping etc thought well hoped i was prgnant but it ended up it was my period asthought not like my usual period ( it was the exact same as u described) anyway i have looked into it an think i may have PCOS (can cause lots of irregular bleeding/ cramps etc) I have not made a doctors app yet so i am only guessing but we have been TTC for 9 months and no 2 lines yet! i had said i would give it a year of doing natural baby dances and then look into getting checked out! im not due my p today (if i go from the 1st period i got last month) so hopefully i willgo back to 'normal' .

phZR63Rdaa	<a href="http://www.televisiontunes.com/Andy_Pandy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.televisiontunes.com/Andy_Pand...</a>
Wd7ujHNhaa	First...you are testing way too early!  You have two possible outcomes with this...When you got your positives  (no matter how faint the line, as long as there was a colored line and not a gray line, it is still a positive) then the test detected hcg in your urine.  If you are taking fertility drugs that create hcg in your system, then the test may have picked up that...if you are not taking fertility drugs, then yes, you are/were pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Since you got negatives after the positive, then either the tests just did not detect the level of hcg in your urine or you had a chemical pregnancy.  Do not rule out pregnancy yet!!!  HPT tests generally do not detect the same level of hcg in your urine...some can detect more than others, even if they are the same type of test.  Some do not even detect the same amount that they say they can on the box EPTs are especially bad for this.  So, because you are testing prior to your missed period, you may just be driving yourself crazy over this.  My doctor warned me that this may happen if I test too early and she told me to wait until 1 week after my missed period to test in order to get an accurate result.  I know it sucks waiting...but it really is best too.  <br>  <br>  You may have also had a chemical pregnancy, but I wouldn't be stressing over this unless AF comes or you continue getting negative tests at the end of next week.  If you do continue to get negative test results and AF doesn't come, then go see your doc.<br>  <br>  And no, your hcg levels do not fall during pregnancy unless you are losing the baby.  Your hcg's should be doubling about 2 to 3 days, but like I said - hpts detect different amounts of hcg depending on the individual tests...so your negative tests just may not have detected the hcg.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't stress too much!  Try to relax...you are probably still pregnant!!!  But if you are really worried and you want to know now, then go to your doctor and ask for a quantitive hcg blood test.  This will let you know how much hcg is in your system, and a second test 2 or 3 days later will let you know if your numbers are rising or falling!  Good Luck to you!!!!!|`|se3RwEWyaa	I went through the exact same scenario. The doctors called it "a chemical pregnancy". They said that HCG in my system that was detected in an early pregnancy test, was gone by the time he did a blood test. He said that these early pregnancy test are just causing more confusion than answers, I agree. Things like this happen, but we must stay positive. But this might not be your particular situation. You should test again after your AF start date, then you will get a more accurate answer. Hope this is your month!!! BABY DUST ALL AROUND*******|`|Kf9rSlTWaa	hello, i have heard about chemical pregnancies which are pregnancies that dont follow through so its possible that you may have been pregnant. Most people dont know about them but if you test early you will get positive result and then when testing a few days later get a negative, either way i would book in to see a dr and get a blood test|`|dJ8H9q1taa	maybe wait and see if you get your period, there is a test that you can get and it has a digital reading it comes up either "pregnant" or "not pregnant" this might be easier to get a clear answer i think its the clear blue brand <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WZ52LU39aa	i also say wait until your period is due than test again because now you are just wasting test and driving yourself crazy. goodluck and lots of babydust
vue9NOhYaa	At this age my daughter was 90% on table and finger foods. The only purees she was getting were meats -- she got teeth very late, and never seemed to  like the regular meats I shredded up for her.  She mostly ate what we ate.  If something was inappropriate, she got a simple alternative (cheerios, yogurt, etc.) <br>  <br>  I myself don't cook with salt, so most of the table foods she got were saltless, except for whatever was in processed foods. (Like canned tomato sauce.)|`|5uEAHEQJaa	I gave mine a combination of table food and baby food.  at that age, mine was a very selective eater, I wanted to make sure she would at least eat a variety of foods and still make sure she got staples.<br>  <br>  But at 12 months, my daughter only had 2 teeth, I did not give her ribs nor meetballs.|`|8brZAonnaa	my son is 11mnth old and we feed him whatever we are having for dinner if he couldnt chew it i will blend it for him... i have done this since he was 5 monthsold he is not over weight and has a very balanced and healthy diet i would not add extra salt into anything i cook as it already has enough|`|FYDw1rjlaa	When my son was that age I feed him pretty much anything that he can eat except not too much meat because he didn't have a lot of teeth then.

xpstigPTaa	Yes, I am sure you are fine. Your cervix was probably just disturbed a little bit during sex, as long as it doesn't turn into heavy clot filled bleeing, you should be fine. I would call your doctor and let them know though. Best fo luck to you hun! And btw, I have been spotting now for over a week and I'm about 6.5 weeks along. Doctor says it's a clot and there's nothing to worry about and I will continue spotting until my body cleans the clot away. So there are soooo many things it could be, doesn't always mean something bad is going to happen. Just go easy with the sex for a while. The doctor told me I can't have sex until we are out of the first trimester which is like another 6 weeks or so! AHHH!!! Oh well, it will all be worth it! Best of luck hun!!!!|`|nISYAHkfaa	If it's just a little blood, yeah, your baby is fine.<br>  <br>  During pregnancy there is more blood in your internal organs just waiting to pop out because it's giving your baby oxygen . . . so it's more common to bleed during pregnancy after sex, since the slightest pressure can cause blood to overflow . . . so don't panic, relax, and call your ob-gyn if you're concerned or start having pains or lots of bleeding.|`|PvEEOdKBaa	Light bleeding is often better than no bleeding.  See if you have no bleeding or heavy bleeding you have to worry about A. missed miscarriage or B miscarriage but with light bleeding neither of those are an issue.  You can still have one but it is not a symptom of either.  You likely just bruised your cervix.  If are are super worried go to the doctor.

XhIYAH6Laa	I really have never liked the digital tests...I took 3 before, the day of, and after my missed period...all came back not pregnant. Then I took a regular stick test and it was positive..and I am 12 weeks now. I guess it works better for some and not as well for others, all depending on the amount of hcg that needs to be detected in the urine.|`|v3LnJycKaa	that was pretty accurate for me, I took it the day before my period was due with my last baby, at 6pm, and it took all of 3 seconds to flash PREGNANT on the screen... try the first response I have had better luck with them.|`|GxJL9UjVaa	Clearblue are pretty accurate.

Tell her you will always be willing to watch her kids, but you think that she should be spending more time with them. Most moms dont get to party, thats part of being a full time mom! Ask her what she would do if you werent around. You dont want to be taken advantage off, and you dont want to be the primary caretaker to HER children. The mother is always the most influential role model in a child's life, and in this case, you dont want to be that mother.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Have a talk with her about how her kids could be seriously affected by her neglectfulness & behaviour. don't hold back on words, sometimes people need to hear the truth.

We went to a County fair together once and her daughter asked her to take her to the bathroom, and Mom says "What do you want me to do, I don't know where the bathroom is" I grabbed her daughters hand and said I will help you find it! In a tone that got Moms attention. I wish I had some advice, your not alone, there is always that difficult person in our lives that we just don't get.|`|OTaMwyz5aa	Chances are that she does the same thing when you are NOT around, so her children are probably used to fending for themselves and may be more capable than you think.  You should not assume responsibility for them when you are together.  Let her be the parent, not you.  As long as the children are not in physical danger (like leaving a 2-yr old at home alone), then perhaps it's just a case of different parenting styles.  Many parents are more "hand-off" than "on" and that's ok.  If you don't want to watch her kids overnight, then don't.   As long as you keep saying "yes", she'll keep asking.  BTW, if she is putting her children in danger, then you should report her.  Neglect can be just as harmful as abuse.

Stress can throw a period off but then again I took a HPT 5 days after my missed period and was getting a negative...3 days later got a faint positive...next day had a blood test done and now I'm 20 weeks pregnant :-P
N8DxgAD7aa	Be really afraid, it really is painfull and usually very embarrassing with all the people watching you while you have pain and lie there uncovered. Most women hate it and will never go back again.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! Actually I was supposed to have one but got pg before it was scheduled so I haven't actually done it yet but my dr gave me a few tips. <br>  <br>  *take an aleeve before hand<br>  *bring a few pads as you may have a little spotting/discharge<br>  *bring a clean wipe so you feel cleaner after<br>  *wear comfortable clothes!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well first off you need to relax because having high blood pressure from worrying can complicate the procedure.  I'm sure they give you some sort of medicine.  If it is worth having children then I would just bear with it.|`|uNRvZWifaa	I've had 2 done they are not that bad i only had some light cramping. I was scared to death before i had mine done too the first time. Just relax it's not that bad at all! good luck|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	i took a valium before i did mine, but it didn't work well cuz i was nervous... and the doctor botched, it slipped out and ink got all over the place, so you couldn't really tell what was going on, so i had to do it again....<br>  but it's important to be relaxed and have a good doctor do it...<br>  <br>  good luck i hope everything is clear!|`|xpstigPTaa	I have never experienced this but I just wanted to wish you the best of luck, stay strong and truck loads of baby dust to you!
Y3Fp6oKxaa	Hi there<br>  To be honest i would speak to your GP about something as serious as this<br>  It's no good finding out to late that it has caused a problem with your baby imagine how devastating that would be.<br>  I wish you all the best<br>  Dave (gorleston uk)

Wait until after school and you have a career set up so your attention isn't divided any more than it has to be at this point.|`|v3LnJycKaa	if you will be starting college this fall why would you want to try now, wait until you have completed you medical assistant courses and established yourself in your career.|`|jrVlzffeaa	It's up to if you chose to have another one, I was 17 when I had my son, I'm now 19 and I'm ready for another abby. What you need to look at is whether or not you'll be able to go to college while you're pregnant, take a couple fo months off and then continue or whether they'll accept you next year and have your baby this year and then go to college next year, and also who's gona look after your kids while you're at college, etc. Talk to your boyfriend and see what he says. Good luck and I hope you make the right decision Xx|`|4p9sBdyTaa	I think you should wait, get your education and establish yourself. You may be a great mother but if you are not prepared then you shouldn't have another because it is what you want.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you have the financial means then go for it! good luck!|`|a1uoxczTaa	then go for it... good luck!|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Ah, the baby blues.  I had my daughter at 16 also and I don't regret it.  Around the same age 18/19/20 I was trying to finish community college and get a good job and having those baby blues.  I did get pregnant and at about 7 weeks pregnant realized what I did was very stupid because finishing college and having a job and a young daughter with another on the way was NOT going to be easy.<br>  <br>  I miscarried 2 weeks later and now I am 25, with a stable job, a house, a husband, my daughter is 9, etc.  We are doing good.  I don't think it's worth it having another so soon.  I would definitely wait if I was you :)|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I'm 19, my son is 2 months and I will be 21 when try for our next. It all depends on what you can afford. Realistically you can never afford a baby, but if after you pay all your bills, cover food, gas for your car, and any extras you may need/want and you still have a decent amount of money left over then you should be fine with another. But it is going to make going to school that much harder.|`|PvEEOdKBaa	Is the father in the picture?  You do realize how many children end up dysfunctional not because they had a bad mom but because their dad was not there or stable right?  That said (come on I have to sound like an adult sometimes) I have 3 children and we are currently in the beginnings of another 9 weeks or so now.  Oh wow 9.4 now (pregnancy age anyways).  This is hopefully going to be my 4th live child, we have lost 3 in early pregnancy.  I will be 22 in april.  But- I am married, all my babies are with my husband, my husband is 13 years older than me and I am not a normal 21 year old.  I grew up in a dysfuntional household where kids had to grow up fast or risk it not ever happening.  My dad is again in jail, I did not even meet him until I was 16 and I was told he was dead.  My stepdad only liked me until he had some of his own.  I was quickly forgotten.  I was working to help pay rent by doing lawn care, baby sitting etc by the time I was 11, I pretty much raised my sisters until I was kicked out at 16 and at 17 I joined the army where I met my husband.  My first two pregnancies I was 17.  I was married at 18 out of the military by 18 as well and husband was deployed 4 months later.  My husband had worked as a government employee for years by then, we knew what and how and where we were doing after all we made the average income for our area for a family with two working and only one of us had to.  If you cannot buy your children a house I would not have anymore until that point.  Stability is really important.  Obviously you will do what you want to do but try to think what you will do when childcare is 7.00 and hour and you make 10.00 - after ss and medicare you really are not coming home with much.  Welfare is time consuming and a pain in the but, I would hate to be on it as well and I think there is really very little they give you.  I just want to point out as well- college is hard, very hard to study, hard to leave a sick child to get to class and medical assistants do not make that much.  You really need to look at getting a 4 year degree, right now with one child all your stuff will be paid with pell grant and a small scholarship a year, if you are interested in medical most states pay back loans for registered nurses who stay in state to work and they make decent though not great money.  Get through school first hon, make sure you can give your child you already have the life you wanted as a kid.
OgzHcNMsaa	I think in the US/Canada you're looking at around 20,000-25000 for surrogacy|`|gJrHBtp1aa	"First time surrogates charge anywhere from 12 to 18,000 or more. But the surrogate's fee isn't the only expense involved. You also have to be sure all her medical bills are paid. The doctors and lawyers can be expensive as well. I think altogether, our surrogacy cost us about $50,000." Quoted from the surromom website|`|8WbfmK5daa	Are you talking about surrogacy?<br>  <br>  It is Illegal to pay for or buy a baby but you can pay for the woman's 'expenses' depending on your argeement it can be anywhere between ￡5, 000 - ￡25,000.<br>  <br>  It is common practice but not always the case to ask a woman you already no, a close friend etc, to carry your child.<br>  <br>  You could also look into adoption which would not cost you anything and you would be giving  a home to a child that is already in the world.<br>  <br>  Or you could consider fostering. <br>  <br>  Unless you want a biological child then surrogacy would be your best bet.
oJsrGmmPaa	Well, since I'm a dude, yes, I don't feel pregnant.|`|AA11031068	Oh my I am soooo glad I found your post. I go for my 6 week scan on Monday and I am terrified of them telling me there is no baby or worse a baby with no heartbeat. I am 5 weeks 5 days today and although I too have had cramps off and on they have seemed to not be as frequent and my breasts don't seem as sore and I dont seem as emotional etc. I am like are my pregnancy symptoms fading?? I too have had no bleeding and want to assume all is well but it's just so hard to allow yourself to get excited about something so uncertain. Try to hang in there (I will too) and just keep praying that all will be okay. I know I feel as though my husband and I have been given a miracle and I have never loved or wanted anything more in my entire life. God is good and no matter what just remember, "I can do all things through Christ who strenghens me". That verse has helped me get through even in the must uncertain and scary of times.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i forget im pregnant sometimes and im 7 months lol. I understand where you are coming from.

I am sensing some mood swings there hun. your fine. your scan is going to show a baby.|`|AA11305214	I'm so glad I'm not alone.  I'm approximately 12 weeks, and I haven't felt pregnant this whole time.  Any symptoms I've had have been so mild and infrequent that they could easily be passed off as something else entirely.  My first appointment is on Tuesday and I'm terrified that they won't find any evidence to support the 4 positive test results I've received, and I'll be just wasting their time.   I also feel unemotional and a lack of excitement about it all.  I've been reading so many articles about false positives, that I'm somewhat convinced I'm *not* pregnant until I can see for myself on an ultrasound screen, pop the buttons on my jeans, or feel it move.  I haven't even thought about shopping for anything yet.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Not to cause concern or anything, but check with your doctor if you are really not having symptoms anymore; that's a sign of a missed miscarriage. Those are extremely rare, so don't panic, but it's a good idea to see if you can have an earlier appointment.<br>  <br>  edit: whoever voted me down, keep in mind that it is better to find out sooner rather than later . . . even if it does cause a little extra stress for nothing. You can die from a missed miscarriage or become infertile. Seriously, OP, please take all necessary precautions . . . don't panic, but discuss these concerns with your doctor/midwife.|`|uplHIW2Baa	You're probably still pregnant.  I'm almost 9 weeks and have had the same feelings; "am I?"

If you are that concerned make an earlier appointment with your OB.|`|3p0QBNpwaa	When I first found out, I did not feel pregnant either(and even now,sometimes I still don't) It's common!

deIzFnV8aa	Sorry that I can't really be helpful here, but I can at least reassure that this appears to be _very_ normal at this age.  In the past couple of days I have read about a dozen other questions on Y!A very similar to this one, all about 5 month-old babies.  And my baby has started fitting this description very well, and she will be five months tomorrow.  So maybe there _is_ something in this idea of "preteething", which I really thought people were making up as an excuse for fussy behavior they couldn't explain. Though you would think the ibprofen would help with that at least a bit. Or maybe at 5 months babies are just starting to get a mind of their own?  Anyway, you have probably already let her get a good chomp on your finger to see if there are any sharp edges coming through; I understand ibprofen doesn't always help all that much if teething actually _is_ the problem.  I don't really know what to do either; I am laying on the white noise pretty heavily during naps, which has been helping daytime sleep, and I think I will start using it at night too - as in, all night.  I have also been extra alert to tired signs for naps, because a semi-cranky baby is already hard to get down, even w/o overtiredness.  And hopefully _someone_ here will come up with a better idea than that, so I can use it too, lol!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Maybe she's hungry. A 4 hour routine just doesn't cut it for some kids.

cP03k3cXaa	How do I tell my parents I'm thinking about having sex?<br>  <br>  My partner and I are at the stage where we are seriously considering sex as a next step. We both live at home with our parents and neither of us is keen on the idea of discussing sex with our parents as we assume that their eyes will fall out of their sockets if we so much as mention the word sex. I don’t want them to freak out, but if anything goes wrong when my boyfriend and I have sex, I don’t want them to be completely oblivious to the fact that I have actually been sleeping with my partner. Do you have any suggestions on how I could try and discuss this with them without being totally humiliated? <br>  <br>  Answer: <br>  <br>  First off I want to say how great your process sounds. Talking with people, in this case your parents, can help a lot when trying to make a decision or figure out how you feel about something you feel is significant. It’s not that they’re going to give you some earth shattering news, but sometimes just talking through an issue helps you figure out where you stand in a different way. Now for some suggestions... <br>  <br>  The first person I turned to with your question is Dr. Miriam Kaufman . Miriam spends a lot of her time talking with both parents and teenagers about sex. She’s also the author of Easy for You to Say and several other books that deal with youth and various health issues. Here are some of Miriam’s thoughts on your situation: <br>  <br>  The first thing is to remember that your parents have had sex, and likely still do, so they do get the fact that people like to do this. Sex is a pretty private thing, and not something that most of us want to discuss with our parents, but it is good that you don't want to be skulking around about this. If your parents aren't abstinence-only people who have asked you to take a virginity pledge, they will not kick you out because you are thinking about sexual activity. <br>  <br>  Many people choose to tell one parent first, so if you are closer to one of your folks, or feel that one of them is less judgmental than the other, then consider starting with him or her. <br>  <br>  Having said that, you might want to hit them with a hypothetical first (e.g. "There's this girl at school who's had the same boyfriend for quite a while, and she told me that her mother would kill her if she had sex" or "Susan sleeps over at Jim's house every weekend, what do you think of that?") <br>  <br>  Also, instead of talking with your parent about sex, you might want to discuss birth control. Your parent will get the message, and will be happy that you are being responsible. <br>  <br>  Miriam also wanted me to tell you that you might want to talk with your parent about the new HPV vaccine and ask if their insurance covers the cost. <br>  <br>  I have a few thoughts to add to Miriam’s. You mention that you don’t want to be humiliated. It might be worth thinking about what you’re afraid will happen when you talk to a parent, and then imagining how you might respond in that worst case scenario. <br>  <br>  If you have no idea how your parent is going to respond, you might want to stick with Dr. Kaufman’s suggestion about making this about a friend. You can even raise the subject in terms of something you learned in school or saw in a movie. Having a more general discussion about sex in our culture can be a safe way to start, and gauge your parents comfort level and general attitude. <br>  <br>  Another possible way to broach the subject may be to ask the parent you feel more comfortable with about their first romantic and sexual experiences. Obviously you’re not asking for details here, but you might ask them how they knew they were ready to start being sexual with partners. This won’t work with a lot of parents, but some might enjoy the opportunity to talk about their own past, and may even share experiences that can help you with your own decision. Again, you need to gauge this for your own parents. If your parent seems interested in talking about this, but expresses confusion as to where to start, you can always point them to this link about talking with your kids about sex. <br>  <br>  In the end it would be good if you can remind yourself that you can’t control how your parent is going to respond. You may be able to be mature about your sexual decisions, and you may do a great job of laying out your thinking and planning to your parent. But in the end they may respond in a completely inappropriate and irrational way. If this is the case, you can still feel good about your ability to bring this up with them, but you need to not take responsibility for their reaction. Whether parents like it or not, at some point we all assert our own control over our lives. This is a healthy part of growing up and becoming an adult. <br>  <br>  As one final point, which is slightly off topic, I want to point out neither you, Dr. Kaufman or I are being clear about what we mean by “sex”.

I would tell her that I want to tell her something very personal and something that you're afraid will make her angry but to try to let me finish before she says anything.  I would tell her when she's relaxed....like after dinner.  You dont want to bombard her with this the moment she walks in the door from work or anything.  Tell her that you just started having sex for the first time with your boyfriend.  Tell her that you want to have the type of relationship with her that you feel comfortable tell her anything and that it's important she be understanding.<br>  <br>  Now you have to be understanding as well.  If she does get angry which is a possibility then you can't lash out and go all rebellious and angry back at her.  The more calm you stay the calmer she might stay.  Besides if you lash out at her you will only be showing her that you are inmature and not ready to be having sex.|`|mFvtaOYCaa	why do u want to tell her?

1z3C0R2Vaa	No condom better to use so pregnancy will not happen to abort a special gift from God is SIN............)|`|nXxtBkguaa	This only answers your first question, with a resounding NO!<br>  <br>  don't read this unless you want to make a REALLY informed decision, I warn you these are the facts, if the facts won't make any difference in your decision don't read this.  It will make your life alot easier if you get an abortion WITHOUT knowing this.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  During an abortion at twelve weeks, the baby will struggle to get away from the<br>  suction device, its heart rate speeds up, and while it is being dismembered, it<br>  opens its mouth as if to scream.  But some people would have you believe that the<br>  same baby that screams in pain, is not alive.  One dictionary defines life as: “the<br>  condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead<br>  organisms” a fetus is not dead, it can’t be, it has never died.  Nor is it inorganic, a<br>  look at a fetal development chart will show you that.  So what about an unborn<br>  baby is not alive? I can’t think of anything.<br>  During pregnancy the fetus develops at an alarming rate.  At nine weeks the baby<br>  starts to move and can feel pain, by week eleven almost all of the organs are<br>  functioning.  At week thirteen the baby begins to breathe and is comforted by<br>  playing with its fist.  By week fourteen the baby can suck its thumb, in just one<br>  week it will be able to perform different facial expressions such as squint, frown,<br>  grimace ect. At week sixteen the baby begins sucking, swallowing and hiccupping<br>  and by week eighteen it can cry without sound.  After nineteen weeks the baby<br>  sleeps and wakes like a newborn would and after twenty it begins to recognize<br>  familiar sounds and startles at loud noises.<br>  One surprising bit of information is that 52% of abortions take place before week<br>  nine, 25% happen between weeks nine and ten.  12% happen between the 11th<br>  and 12th week and 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week.  4% happen<br>  between the 16th & 20th week.   While four percent may sound like a negligible<br>  amount, it’s 82,200 babies in the US alone every year.<br>  Abortion is used extremely casually by a shocking number of people.  Forty seven<br>  percent of abortions are performed on women who have had at least one before. <br>  In addition, 93% happen because of social reasons such as, “It’s not convenient”<br>  or “I’m not prepared.”  Only 1% take place because of rape or incest and 6% take<br>  place because of health risks for the mother or baby.<br>  The methods by which these babies are murdered are not painless in the least; in<br>  fact they are completely horrific.  An eight week old baby is sucked out of its<br>  mothers womb, it is dismembered in the process.  At sixteen weeks a poison is<br>  injected through the mother’s abdomen that will poison the baby as well as<br>  burning off the baby’s outer layer of skin.  In this procedure, the mother still gives<br>  birth to a dead baby.  <br>  An eighteen week old baby will be pulled out of its mother’s womb piece by<br>  piece using forceps.  The teeth of the forceps tear and twist the bones and tissue of<br>  the unborn child to rip it limb-from-limb.  At six months a drug is given to the<br>  mother that induces violent contractions meant to kill or decapitate the baby.  In<br>  an abortion that takes place in the last three months of pregnancy a C-section is<br>  performed, the umbilical cord is cut before the baby is removed from the womb,<br>  suffocating the baby.  If the baby is not suffocated it is left in a corner to die from<br>  neglect or exposure.  <br>  Finally, the most horrific method: partial birth abortion.  Thankfully, this method<br>  is fairly rare, but does happen and therefore deserves a mention.  During a partial<br>  birth abortion the abortionist will force labor using forceps, delivering the entire<br>  baby except for the head.  The abortionist then shoves scissors up into the baby’s<br>  skull.  The scissors are opened to enlarge the skull so that a suction catheter can<br>  fit in.  The suction catheter is inserted and the baby’s brain is sucked out.  The<br>  skull collapses and the dead baby is delivered.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and this is copied and pasted from something else, not written for this question, so sorry about the random enters, they were neccassary for the other project.  And sorry if this addresses the issue wierdly, again it made sense for the other thing.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Actually, birth control is the solution for unwanted pregnancy.<br>  For an unwanted baby, adoption is the solution.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i wouldn't say its the solution. its one option you have. the cost depends on where you are and where you go...  and time depends on the type you get. like getting the abortion pill (before 8 weeks) they do an ultra sound give it to you and you take it at home then you come back in a week or what ever to make sure it worked properly.  i may not have the answers your looking for exactly but at least I'm trying to help and not jumping down your throat.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	it is no more a solution than it would be to murder your 2 year old because he acts up too much.  only difference is that the 2 yr old is bigger than a baby.

If you are less that 63 days pregnant, there is a pill that you can receive at an abortion clinic. 63 days-14 weeks, you will go to a clinic for what is called a D&C. It will take 2-4 hours and will cost $400-1500, depending upon your weight. 14+ weeks will cost more money and is a two day procedure. 1st day is about an hour and the second day is 2-4 hours depending upon how far along you are. There is an option for anesthesia however that is typically $150. <br>  I agree that adoption is the best answer, however there are the facts if you chose abortion. I think you should be given all information possible so you can CHOSE the decision that is right for you.|`|HiIzcUNtaa	abortion in india<br>  abortion sometimes become necessary.  <br>  <br>   To avoid the misuse of induced abortions, most countries have enacted laws whereby only qualified Gynecologists under conditions laid down and done in clinics/hospitals that have been approved can do abortions. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act was enacted by the Indian Parliament in 1971 and came into force from 01 April, 1972. The MTP act was again revised in 1975.<br>  <br>  The MTP Act lays down the condition under which a pregnancy can be terminated, the persons and the place to perform it.<br>  <br>  The reasons for which MTP(abortion) is done, as interpreted from the Indian MTP Act, are:<br>  <br>  (i) Where a pregnant woman has a serious medical disease and continuation of pregnancy could endanger her life like.<br>  (ii) Where the continuation of pregnancy could lead to substantial risk to the newborn leading to serious physical / mental handicaps<br>  (iii) Pregnancy resulting of rape.<br>  (iv) Conditions where the socio-economic status of the mother (family) hampers the progress of a healthy pregnancy and the birth of a healthy child<br>  Failure of Contraceptive Device irrespective of the method used (natural methods/ barrier methods/ hormonal methods).<br>  <br>  This condition is a unique feature of the Indian Law. All the pregnancies can be terminated using this criterion. <br>  <br>  <br>  Any institutions licensed by the Government to perform MTP. The certificate issued by the Government should be conspicuously displayed at a place easily visible to persons visiting the place.<br>  Advantages:<br>  <br>      * A single step procedure.<br>      * Safe.<br>      * Possible to carry out Sterilization or insertion of an intra-uterine device.<br>      * Can go home on the same day.<br>      * Can resume working the next day. <br>  <br>  Risks<br>  <br>      * Reaction to the drugs used in anesthesia<br>      * Bleeding<br>      * Infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes.<br>      * Accidental perforation of the uterus.<br>      * Emotional distress.|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	Absolutely NOT. Adoption is always the best option. Please do Not Kill that Baby. You can find someone to take that baby. If you didn't want a baby you should have never had sex or at least prevented it. please just put the baby up for adoption. Don't have an abortion- you will regret it.|`|t4HCywMCaa	first of all your gf  is pregenate?
i9M0U9Meaa	i am a soon to be teen mother myself, but i have to agree with you. the media is making it to be something good when really its not. but i guess they dont know what else to do exactly because in case you haven't notice, teen pregnancy is a pretty expanding thing right now, and i watch secret life, i watch OLTL and i've seen Juno, they dont really make it look easy, they show that it can be hard. but i must agree with you!|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	I think that they are trying to raise awareness that it is hard to be a teen parent, but that you can do it if you try. (Except Juno, that sick sick sick movie. that is not how you handle a teen pregnancy.)  I do not think that it is their intention to make teen pregnancy "in" though. It is also supposed to help parents and teens strike up conversation about the subject.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Its not that they are glorifying it, but that society makes teens feel so purposeless and that there is nothing worthwhile, they desperately look for something that makes them feel whole. <br>  If people would just shut up about how normal things are not worthwhile, because life is worthwhile, maybe teens wouldn't resort to acting like this.|`|COecrPrMaa	Yes.  I sure do.  What happened to good parenting and good common sense?<br>  <br>  Edit:  I think that it is the parent's responsibility to teach their kids how to grow up and how to take care of themselves responsibly.  It seems like the media doesn't care about kids having kids... interesting information (and movies) sell.  Teens can be great parents... but it isn't a smart move and the more you hear about how cool it is to have a baby the more you (well... a teen) will want to have a baby.  The media has too much control on younger people's minds than those younger people's parents do.|`|WZQKevt8aa	The media is going on a bit about teenage pregnancy, but they do seem to show the different options for teenage parents, such as adoption, etc.<br>  Just because you're a teenage mum, doesn't mean you're a bad parent, things happen, people should deal with it and get over it and stop being so narrow minded.<br>  I do know some teenagers get pregnant because it is in the 'in' thing, which is wrong. A baby is a human life, a person, and not an accessory, and shouldn't be treated like one.|`|WFVWKOtgaa	Yep it defiantly has.<br>  Im 15 myself and 15 weeks pregnant.<br>  its not easy.<br>  i regret it<br>  but refuse to get rid of baba.|`|i8Ch743Laa	In some ways yes,in some ways no. The media is just doing what they do,and keeping people informed with stuff like the jamie lynn spears case. That show the secret life of an american teenager,i see how that could even be a thing where yes it does but no it doesn't,it makes teens see that reality of what would go on if they were to get pregnant. So yes i agree with your point,but at the same time,that's just media for you. They're going to bank on whatever they can.|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Yes there is alot of it on t.v etc but there is also alot of violence drugs you name it does that mean you should go do it ?? Teens make mistake like most adults do its life its going to happen no matter how much you see it on t.v ,Being a young mum myself i didn't see any influence on t.v that would have even been close to making me want to have sex nor have a baby but it happened and i dealt with it ,I don't belive i see where you get these shows saying its in to have a baby as a teen ?  Just because they are in the public eye doesnt meant they are not going to make mistakes also its human nature . This is my personal opinion having a niece that is 13 and she does not see that in the slightest i think if anything it would be a weight issue with teens and looking like there fav star on t.v anorexia suicide should be a more of a concern then pregnancy
V8JoRHnnaa	i think it depends from person to person. ii have low temp normally. like in my luteal phase it was arouna 96 but now its around 97.8 and i am hopeful. i stay cold all the time, really cold hands and feet, low BP etc but i feel ok soo i dont worry<br>  baby dust to both of us :)
8x7rFddHaa	I would say that if you can afford to take a test then do so to put your mind at ease. Dollar store tests work just fine. You also may just want to give yourself a few days and see what happens, it won't cost anything but your nerves to wait.<br>  <br>  Baby dust!|`|V8JoRHnnaa	yes take another PT.<br>  baby dust|`|tdNfQWaAaa	That is werid! Hmm... It could have been implantion bleeding. But I have heard that some women still get "periods" when they are pregnant. I guess after your body becomes pregnant it still thinks it releases an egg, or just thinks its time for a period, so it has one. But I would say if it was implantion that you would need to wait a few more days to test again to give the pregnancy hormone enough time to build up to get an accurate result. I would say test Saturday or Sunday morning with first morning urine. If it is still negative, you could always go to your doctor and get blood work or have him make sure nothing else is wrong. I hope the best for you!!! Baby dust!!!!! xxxx|`|Ql09WZa8aa	Take another HPT, or blood test is more accurate... they never fail you , GL
5ZvALiclaa	utmost joy....<br>  <br>  actually its more like an extradinarily overwhelming feeling of adoration, love, wonderment, happiness, joy and excitement mixed with sheer exhaustion and pure adrenalin!<br>  <br>  To put it simply, yes its great!<br>  <br>  (and the pain is instantly forgotten too!)|`|rjVALevtaa	When I had my first son I was just completely amazed.<br>  <br>  When I had my second son they gave me Demerol (they wouldn't give me anything else for the first couple of hours, I had to wait on my epidural) and so I was kind of drugged up. They say it's non-narcotic but I really don't believe that. Anyway, I was just relieved to be done with it. I didn't really feel joy or anything. I'm still kind of sad about that, I wish I hadn't taken the Demerol.<br>  <br>  Later on, when they brought him back from the nursery I was happy.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	With my son, my first two thoughts were 1 - utmost joy; I cried a little from being so happy and 2 - this boy is going to be trouble!  For starters, I could not be handed my boy right off because he had his first bowel movement inside of me before he was born! So they had to get the poop out of his lungs, lol.  Plus when I was in labor, I had been pushing for 3 hours and no baby.  They called in the head OB to see if I could still deliver him naturally, and she evaluated and said there was no reason I couldn't and he wasn't in any danger, etc. so I was welcome to continue pushing if I wanted to; which I did.  Another 38 minutes later he finally was born and we found out what the problem was.  He was born with his arms above his head!  My grandmother always said that when a newborn has his hands any higher than his heart, it is a sign of good health, and let me tell you, that boy was healthy!  He had a perfect Apgar score and the doctors all said he was the healthiest, strongest newborn they ever saw.  I was right, he's trouble!<br>  <br>  With my daughter, I again had two first thoughts; 1 - again utmost joy and 2 - how the hell did I do that?!?!?!  Again I was not allowed my baby to be given right to me, but this time for a different reason.  I am a small framed person and 5'3" 105 when not pregnant.  Very tiny frame.  My daughter was 9.5 lbs and I had her naturally.  They took her away for one reason being her size, and the other being that her shoulders got stuck during delivery so they had to make sure it didn't dislocate.  I didn't know at that point that they rushed her away that she was so big!  But as I was laying there praying my baby was okay, I heard the doctor say, take guesses everyone, how big is the baby? And one nurse says, 10 lbs! I thought they were kidding! I thought I was carrying a tiny 7 lb baby!  Oh, and my other thought I guess was, tell me it's a fricken girl!  The ultrasound had been like 95% sure it was a girl, and since we had a boy already, I had gotten excited and bought everything in pink and purple, and everyone just kept calling her the baby, and I would say, is SHE alright, and they would say, the BABY is doing good.|`|AA11109728	I was still in disbelief - it didn't seem 'real' yet, even then!  I was happy - no pain.  I remember noticing that she had her daddy's nose, some dark hair, and long, skinny fingers.|`|lmT3zXa9aa	I was thrilled even though I had secretly hoped for a girl and got a boy.  He was the light of my life from the moment I first held him.  He was a 9 lb 11 oz baby, and I gave birth with no anesthesia.  I went on to have two more children - another son and a daughter, and I was delighted to see and hold both of them as well.<br>  I did have a co-worker who claims that she was so angry over the pain of birth that she wouldn't even hold her daughter.  She claims that the doctor actually told her that her reaction was so negative that he didn't think she should ever have any more children.  Even to this day, her husband is truly the nurturing one in the family, and they did go on to have a second child.  This woman is truly a self-involved individual so perhaps that has more to do with her reaction at the birth than the actual pain of labor.  I, and most moms I know, all say that once the baby is born the pain of birth rapidly fades.  Yes, there is discomfort but there isn't horrible pain.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I had a c-section when my twins were born.  When my first twin came out, I could hear her cry then she stopped because of breathing difficulties so they had to put tubes down her throat to help her breath.  I felt so helpless because I was lying on my back could not move and watching the medical stuff working on her.  Then 2 mins later my second twin was born and she let out a big cry.  I saw her for a few seconds then they took her away to be checked.  Once they were all ok I felt a wave of relief.  I had the c-section at night so I had to go back to the ward and my twins went to the NICU so I did not see them that night after the c-section.  I felt horrible.  The next day the staff wheeled me up to the NICU to see my twins.  I could hold one of them which bought tears to my eyes.  She was so tiny and so light.  She immediately calmed down once she was in my arms.  I attempted to breastfeed her and she tried with all her might but because she was tiny she could not suckle properly.  Then I saw my other twin and she had a CPAP mask on her so I could not even see her face.  She had tubes attached to her so I could not hold her.  I held her hand which I think calmed her a bit.  The next day she had the mask removed so I was able to hold her which was really special.  She tried to breastfeed as well but she struggled also but I think she was content to stay in my arms.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	I thought 'Thank God he is OK'.  All I felt was relief that he was OK, healthy and alive.<br>  <br>  In my last trimester I had an abnormal ultrasound that showed his limbs were developing a month slower than the rest of his body.  I went to a specialist and have many many ultrasounds, all of which showed the same thing.  The docs said 'There is a slight chance everything will be OK but be prepared'.  They had a perinatologist present at the delivery in case his jaw bones were under developed and he had trouble breathing.  I was at the doctor literally about 10 hrs per week the last 3 weeks for non-stress tests.  His in utero diagnosis was 'suspected minor skeletal dysplasia'.<br>  <br>  He came out (via csection) and the first thing I heard was the perinatologist saying 'he is OK, he is OK, he looks fine, he can breathe'.  <br>  <br>  Turned out his after birth measurements are completely normal and within range.  All that worry was for nothing.  Don't ask me how the u/s done by so many different doctors could be so wrong...I assume it is the source data they used to compare his measurements to the average.|`|BmU1755Uaa	It wasn't utmost joy, but it wasn't hatred either. It was like meeting the parasite that had been living off my body for the past few months. "Ah! Welcome to the world" type of feeling. I think there was a certain amount of joy to have my own body back though.<br>  <br>  One of my babies had back fur like a little monkey, so I bonded with her faster... she needed protection. But no worries. Back fur falls out in the first few days.|`|uAhpXUoLaa	When my son was born I had to have him by a scheduled c-section(he was breech with the cord wrapped around his neck). My husband and I were waiting for them to begin and on the radio "This Magic Moment" started playing and my son was born. I was so amazed that my son was finally here. One of the best days of my life. Pregnant with #2 and can't wait to feel that way again:)|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	When my son was born he got stuck and when was eventually born he came out quite flat...which scared the hell out of me!! To top that off I heamorraged and nearly died after losing 4 litres of blood so I was taken straight to theatre and didn't see him for 4hrs. Ididn't know if he were alive or not....so believe me when I saw my lo I was so overwhelmed with relief that we both survived I just burst into tears and didn't let go of him for a whole 24 hours! the love that I had for him at that moment could never be matched:-)|`|8brZAonnaa	mine was a feeling of joy and relief and overwhelming love.... i was 36 hours in labour and then rushed for a emergency c-section because my babys heart rate dropped so low he was close to dying... but all i wanted was to hold him and protect him.. i know some women dont bond with there babies my aunt didnt and there is help you can recieve for that by contacting a doctor..|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I was so happy to see my baby son, I couldn't believe it!|`|AA12112469	My reaction? Hell, he was 9 pounds 15 ounces and I delivered him naturally. My first reaction was I need a cigarette. So I took my IV pole down outside the hospital (back when you could smoke there) and puffed away. The doctors had rushed him to be xrayed for fear his collar bone was broken since I had a hard time getting the big bugger out. The doc told me my son was fine and would be walking in three days.....lol...my feeling was of relief. The pain had gone. I lost 40 ppounds just having him....|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I hyper ventilated. They had to put me on oxygen to calm me down. =) It was utmost joy though. It was just so overwhelming that my body reacted that way.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I loved holding my babies right after birth. With my first I was giving him kisses even before he was wiped down. <br>  <br>  With my youngest I was really sad because my newborn was whisked away from me as soon as he was born. I was in labor for less then an hour and he came out not breathing well. Then I hemorrhaged. It was really scary now that I look back at it, but at the time I was just upset I wasn't getting to hold my baby.
3p0QBNpwaa	It's very unlikely your pregnant with that much protection!|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Well, there is always that chance, but I doubt it unless he has superhuman sperm and your BC pills weren't working.|`|HW89eJEZaa	probably not.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Frankly, the chances are one in a million. If you're not having symptoms of pregnancy, I wouldn't worry. And even if you are, I still wouldn't worry until you are late on your period.|`|Yd3YLIlraa	Although the chances are very slim, there is always that super itty bitty possibility of it.|`|NE96fU9vaa	unlikely|`|o5r5dTfFaa	its alway possible. birth control is 99.9% effective, but theres always that .1%. Go buy a pregnancy test and if theres any questions see a doctor.
OgzHcNMsaa	I would hope thats not true|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I'm not going to watch the video but it makes me sick to my stomach that someone could be that callous.<br>  <br>  <br>  **Edit** Okay so the other posters are saying this is false. I'm glad to hear that.|`|kprKXEOSaa	This is actually a "botched" abortion.  It is different from a partial birth abortion, I believe it is called an induced labor abortion.  This type of abortion is usually used at about 20 - 24 weeks, and labor is induced.  It is usually done with babies who have Down's syndrome or other handicaps that aren't diagnosed until this late in the pregnancy.  The theory is that labor will kill the baby, but in about 15% of cases, the baby survives the labor and delivery, sometimes for as long as 8 hours.  They basically take the baby to a back room somewhere and let it gasp and sputter until it dies.  (The lungs aren't developed enough to breathe, and a baby at that gestational age cannot regulate its own body temperature, and because the mother doesn't want it, no medical treatment is given to the baby.)  When the baby does die, it is taken to the morgue, and has a death certificate issued, just like anyone else who dies at the hospital.<br>  It is a disgusting practice.  It isn't a bogus story, this actually happens.<br>  <br>  Google "induced labor abortion" you will find everything you need to know about this barbaric practice.<br>  <br>  This was a big issue during the last Presidential campaign.  I can't believe more people haven't educated themselves about it.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	I think the story came from a true happening.  When Barack Obama was in the Illinois legislature he voted three times to allow doctors to ignore live births that occurred from botched abortions.  The babies were not permitted medical care and died.<br>  <br>  Obama also wants to make the laws permitting partial birth abortion stronger.<br>  <br>  Elections have consequences|`|4qT0TfMZaa	That story is entirely bogus.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	I do not believe that story. it is disgusting.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	I have seen this on the news. Its called infanticide and I am a M.A. and if you look up in the Taber's medical dictionary the definition of "infanticide" its defined as the killing of an infant. HOW IS THAT NOT MURDER?! I don't understand and how could someone could deny protecting this. When the vote happened some of the PRO CHOICE parties went neutral. Makes me sick!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: This isn't a bogus story it really happend. It was on CNN as well.|`|AA12112469	My suggestion? Call the White House and ask.  I would. Seriously, call your local congressmen or senator's offices and tell them what you were told. However, I would make sure what you are being told is something that can be proven. And thank God for adoption. I was and I gave up my first born for adoption so she had a chance in this misery we call life.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	wtf!! that is horrible!!! this can't be for real! I've given a baby up for adoption because I couldn't take care of him so I know it can be done. instead of killing one of gods creatures and leaving it there like a lump of thread!!! ugh! now I'm mad!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	That story is sickening and false. Hasn't anyone ever told you not to believe everything you see on the internet? I am reporting your question because it is entirely inappropriate and disgusting.|`|JU3TLLYjaa	not to long ago an abortion didn't go through and the baby was orn before doctor got there and the nurses killed baby. That jus makes me mad I could NEVER hurt an innocent baby.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Babies are dying every day across the world because of disease and hunger so why are these babies so special? Dont believe everything you read and see on tv or myspace or whatever. A lot of people have a lot of issues and they don't mind going to any lengths to air them. Do what you can about the people you can and don't fret about things you have no control over. If all the do gooders had to take these children and raise them there would soon be a lot less do gooders. Life sucks and in a lot of ways is very unfair I agree. But that is the way it is.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	I just read something from another poster. They had said that they were planning to send letters to Obama at the whitehouse in a red envelope and every red envelope sent is one baby that is killed by abortion. I think that it is a great idea and you should pass it along. I am PRO LIFE as well. And I think that if they can have premature labor then they should be able to have the full term baby and give it up for adoption. That is freakin ridiculous.
BguLBgOraa	I had the exact same problem about 2 weeks ago, i went to see the doc and they sent a urine sample to the lab for a more thorough test and it came back possitive, the results came back in two days so it doesn't take long.<br>  <br>  I sugest you do the same,<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|mc6YtaRbaa	No, it only means you had a negative test. Many people can't get a positive test. You should go to the Dr. and get a blood test to make sure you are/are not pregnant. A friend of mine had 4 negative tests and went to a clinic to get her positive blood test and has a healthy baby boy.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you probably arent pregnant. at the same time, you could have ovulated later than some women and it's too early to be picked up on hpt.|`|zs4Rpa6Vaa	depends witch brand of test ur taking my fieance took bout 5 dollar store test *rolls eyes* and they all said neg. but igot her a first alert gold... i think? and it said postive  after 5 days. if ur that worried dish out the extra bucks and get a good one...good luck =]

I did spot early in my previous pregnancy, but it ended in miscarriage.  I know several woman who experienced spotting and some had girls so I don't think it has anything to do with the sex of the child.|`|7ZsvzIP7aa	I'm 37 weeks, 3 days along with a baby boy and I didn't have spotting, so I'm not sure. I've actually never heard of the correlation between spotting and baby boys.|`|DVJoW71saa	my sister in law was pregnant with a boy and DID NOT have spotting in early part of pregnancy. I do not know where you got that from.|`|AA11916244	Ive never heard that before but if there was one my guess would be the extra testosterone in your system. That may cause it.
01kEv36Faa	No you arent washing it out.  You would have to be spraying water into your cervix.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	To be honest, it would be really discusting if you didn't.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't hurt your chances, because some would still be up there from when your husband ejaculated.|`|NWv9hOFYaa	I am someone who hates sperm so I always race to the shower after sex. I got pregnant this way.Laying there and doing the pillow thing is not gonne get you pregnant. Now I am trying to conceive the 2nd and I have a hard time every month. No pillow or laying worked. The time did not come yet, that's it!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	No. try a pillow under your hips though during sex to aid gravity! You have to make sure u have sex around ovulation, or there's little point as u won't conceive. save ur energy for those days. Some people take 1-2 years to conceive. 3 months really is not long.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	No, you aren't washing it out.  After lying for 15-30 minutes by this time any sperm down there that hasn't made it simply isn't going to make it, lol.  Sperm dies within 4 minutes of touching air.|`|GhetCx0iaa	So many teenage pregnancies could have been prevented if it was only that easy....<br>  <br>  *sigh*
Qfq4lpe7aa	I had this!!!  They asked me if I smoked and I had never smoked in my life... Although I had family members totally disrespect me and my unborn by doing so while I was pregnant with my first son... they found mine about 35 weeks and I went for stress test twice a week for 2 weeks and the last one I went to my son's heart beat dropped into the 90's during a braxton hicks contraction they sent me to the hospital for observation the next day I was induced and had to have a c-section...I inquired about it I never got any answers...Good luck!  And they actually told me when my son was born that he was loosing weight so it was good that they got him out....<br>  <br>  Edit: I was definately not implying that you did so please don't take it that way... that was just a question that I got asked when they told me about mine...I have no idea why this happens...|`|v3LnJycKaa	if your cervix is favorable i.e soft, effaced some or dilated some, dropping into the birth canal and no longer 100% posterier then I would say an induction is very possible, it is dificult to induce an unwiling cervix.|`|C55pji5Qaa	I have had grade 3 since 32 weeks because I am carrying twins and my MFM never mentioned it effecting how I delivered.OB agreed.37 weeks is ok for a grade 3 placenta,you are considered term,I think you are going to be just fine,but it is a great thing they will watch for continual growth.<a href="http://www.doctorndtv.com/FAQ/detailfaq.asp?id=5634" rel="nofollow">http://www.doctorndtv.com/FAQ/detailfaq....</a>

Drnpe4T5aa	For the sleeping issue:  She could be teething.  Long before you are able to see the tell-tale bumps or even feel the tooth under the skin, her teeth are pushing upward and causing pressure in her jaw.  <br>  Try giving a dose (talk to her ped for the correct dose) of tylenol or ibuprofen about an hour before bed.  This may help with the going to bed crying.<br>  I found that rocking in a darkened room was the best way to get mine to nod off.  She may still cry a for a little bit, but not as long.  Just keep your own breaths deep, slow & calm.  It will help her regulate her own, as well as help to calm her.  At this age, you really can't spoil them enough - getting some extra snuggles in before bed will be good for both of you!  If she goes to bed peacefully, she is more likely to wake that way, as well.  <br>  As for the crying when doing housework...  Your little one loves you and just wants to be with you all the time.  ;)  It can be hard to get any housework done, especially if you have your heartstrings being pulled by the unhappy wail of an infant.  Try getting one of the various baby carriers available.  My daughter loved to be in that, while I vaccuumed, did dishes, etc.  <br>  But when all else fails, just keep telling yourself "this, too, shall pass"  Before you know it, she will be 10, asking for iPods, Nintendoes and a cell phone.  :)|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Babies can't be "grumpy" at 4 months.  And most of them want your attention all the time but don't give in when you have other things to do.  She will eventually learn she's part of the family and work into the schedule.
rFlhIgJXaa	buy eggs enriched with them... i dont know what everyone is all nuts about this now, they didnt even know about omega 3's and omfg eat this while pregnant back in the 80's and earlier and while some of those 1990's kids are a little special most of the earlier ones are fine.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bacon does kick ***,  alone or with eggs. Note be sure to find eggs that actually say Omega 3 added... i know some are available|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	No as their fish are farm raised; and therefore fed soy.  It's that way with most fast food fish.|`|ROJans2Taa	im sure it has it in it, also eggs are a good carrier for omega's or what I did was buy orange juice that was fortified with omega 3 and 6, I bought PC brand, I know there are other brands as well, also margerine can come fortified as well. im sure it'll be fine with the amount your getting. best luck|`|nISYAHkfaa	Probably not, fast food has most of the nutritional value leeched out (but daaaaamn does it make you feel good while you're preggers ;-;).<br>  <br>  Be careful eating fish though, you run the risk of mercury crossing the placenta. I don't eat it more than once or twice a week and just take a supplement to make up the lost omega-3's.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	I think you are better off sticking to your prenatal vitamins. There are good omega 3s and bad ones... just like that are good and bad fats. Something fried and battered and 40 grams of fat is not going to be good for your body or the baby, but it might taste darn good to you. :)|`|s1utniuvaa	My prenatal vitamins have it in them. They sell the supplements in the store as well. So unless you are just trying to be silly here you don't need to eat fatty fried foods to get Omega 3 fatty acids.|`|QhCy2009aa	The most omega 3's will be found in salmon and herring... not the white fried fish at long Johns... but I love them too!
Ccq8zEcnaa	You may be pregnant, and it is too early to tell right now. Did your doctor do a blood test on you to check for pregnancy that way? If I were you I would wait one more week, or wait until you miss a period, and test again. Or call your doctor and  go back in for a blood test.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I have no faith in pregnancy tests. I took four within two weeks after my period was late and they all were negative. Just for curiosity sake, I took one around 6 months and it also turned out negative.|`|KpZrveDgaa	When you are pregnant, your body secretes a particular chemical, known as Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). Pregnancy tests work by detecting hCG. However it is not uncommon for the body to produce unusually low amounts of hCG, and thus the pregnancy test produces a false negative. <br>  <br>  Keep checking - if you are really pregnant, you will come up with a positive within three weeks or so.|`|tExLMZWCaa	Only your doctor can answer exactly to this question. Make him a visit as soon as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Also i found one nice article about pregnancy and the symptoms:<br>  <a href="http://www.tips4girls.net/health/how-do-you-know-that-you-are-pregnant/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tips4girls.net/health/how-do-...</a>|`|H0VBtkkLaa	im not sure about all of your symptoms but when i was pregnant with both of my kids the test showed negative until i was around 6 weeks preg.  hope this helps.|`|Sgvs8kt7aa	yes you could have tested to early for it too show
0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My first child was without her dad. However, I still tried to have a positive male figure in her life. She has a godfather, two grandfathers and now a step-dad. This past summer her dad finally decided to take part in her life (after 8 years).<br>  <br>  I think having the other men in her life really made all of the difference.|`|satoCRC6aa	your child needs a father figure in their life,it helps them become stable<br>  use your dad or a friend to be a father like influence<br>  don't make the mistake divorced parents do<br>  turning the child against their other parent<br>  never say anything bad about the other parent<br>  let the child experience the other parent for themselves|`|3vAN5BXRaa	Hello<br>  <br>  I am a a single mom as well, what is different with me is that my sons father is around, he sees him ever weekend.  But even with that said, dad or temp dad as I call my sons dad, it's all the same to me because the dad is hardly there ( not by choice) he moved 2 hours away for a different job, but also even before he was never much responsible.<br>  <br>  My own father is exactly like a dad to my son, maybe if you have a brother or a dad of your own, let them get close to your son, boys need a male figure in their lives, they need guidance by another male, us moms can only accomplish so much with our love and care.  Boys will be boys.   In the future, when you have someone with you another man, get a man that you know will have no problem to treat your own son like his own, and in that way you can show your son that maybe his father isn't around but that he has so much love coming from his mom and the rest of the family.|`|NDU36H4Vaa	The best tool I found for working with foster children was building them a positive book about their missing parents or family. All truthful and positive. If something is not nice, I would not include it. So with that said, pictures of the parents smiling. Interests that the parent had like science or math. Maybe some stories about the parent that are positive that you know. <br>  <br>  And of course, the most powerful thing is prayer. You can pray for the father. You can pray and stand in faith that he will regret his decision and will turn things around, whether that means writing or child support or whatever. I know that child support is important but it is more important for a child to feel loved and if that means they get a birthday card from day even if dad does not pay child support, that will help them feel loved & go in the album. If the child can write the grandparents that is good too. I had my father's parents after he moved and they were wonderful influences on me. <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget who our president is and his background with a father in Kenya who, I believe, was not involved. Also, Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's was given up for adoption. And also, James Robinson was the product of a rape. Wayne Dyer also given up for adoption. So there are countless examples of people who turned out absolutely amazing with beginings that were not "perfect" or "normal." In fact, had these people mentioned had normal beginings, they would not be the amazing people they are. <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget "life and death are in the power of the tongue" and that is literal. The findings of a scientist on his study of words and water was featured in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know and it is worth watching because they explain it well. So your words and prayers can indeed change things and that movie can show you the power of your words. However, the bible & Jesus taught about it way before science could validate it.

I grew up in a really messed up family my dad was never around and when he was ... well let's just say the memories i have of him being around are horrible he was abusive to my mom my brother and i, he was an alcoholic, he was cheating on my mom it was constant abuse to my mom from him. those are the only memories i have of him always fighting causing problems for us... he left us for another girl when i was i think in kindergarten but I never missed him you can't miss what you've never had you know? My moms dad (grandpa) was always around always taking me out playing with me he was a real father to me! I don't say I don't miss my dad bc i really never had him but because i never really needed him all the love a child could get from his/her dad I got from my mom and my grandpa. I grew up just fine I never cared about my dad leaving or not having him around bc I didn't need him I didn't need that love from him i had it from my grampz. that's why if you have your father around let him be like a daddy to your son my grandpa passed away when I was 17 at the age of 55 and i miss him so much now i really can say "i lost my dad." I think that instead of book and all that the best you can do is get him in your fathers life or maybe a brothers? any male that can be like that father figure to him. good luck hun and best of luck.
ad0F70IMaa	It's still possible that you could be pregnant. Since you used the pull-out method, i say your chances are slim. Test if you miss your next period.|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	Well the chances are very good. A woman can get pregnant 1 month after giving birth.|`|QhCy2009aa	I know a woman who had children 10 months apart! So yes, it can happen.
euFDn0FBaa	Kennedy Michelle!!  Use both-it sounds great.|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Well...they're both good, but Michelle is so 1980s/1990s! And Kennedy is becoming popular as a girl's name. I'd choose Kennedy, even though technically it's a boy's name.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Michelle because it's a beautiful girls name.<br>  <br>  Kennedy is a masculine BOYS name.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Michelle|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	Of the two Kennedy but that isn't saying much because I wouldn't give a girl some one's last name.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I LOVE Michelle- I'm not a fan of Kennedy at all.|`|zAKFuGGiaa	I'm a big fan of Kennedy, which is why it's my 3 year old daughter's name!|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Michelle<br>  <br>  Kennedy is a boys name that means big head|`|uplHIW2Baa	Donna 32  has a good idea .. Combined the two names Michelle Kennedy or Kennedy Michelle.  However if you had to pick one I would go with Kennedy.

I could not do that to a child even though I like the name|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i like kennedy for a girl its so different, i thought about it for my daughter (but it was hard enough to get the dad i to agree on the one we had so i didn't push it lol). i think michelle is over used and kennedy would make her unique (but not an outcast). Its beautiful i might name one of my future girls that one.|`|tSEA42Uraa	Michelle, by far!<br>  <br>  Kennedy is a male name that means "Ugly head". It's the ONLY name that has "ugly" in its meaning.

MR9iBgafaa	I was in labour for 3 days before I even started pushing so I was exhausted and low on patience.  I tried a waterbath for 4 hours and every midwife thought I'd give birth on her shift.<br>  <br>  4 midwives later I had an epidural and it just took the pain away.  They slow the pushing bit down as you can't feel when to push.  I had a natural birth and took 1 hour 20 mins to push - I was lucky as they had just pushed the red button to call the doctors when I felt like having a p00 and pushed her out.<br>  <br>  To answer the question I had 80% pain for 3 days with no pain relief, and it was better with gas/air and water bath.  It then went to 100% and I came out of the bath for epidural.  The pain went to 0%.  But pushing is difficult - I think the right way is to push as though having a p00 as that's what made her come out!|`|ROJans2Taa	I had an epidural with my second, my first labor was natural and around 14 hrs long, with the first 5 hrs being actually pretty comfortable I didn't think I was in labor. my second, I had my membranes stripped at 39 weeks, after weeks of horrible braxton hicks, the labor was more intense and lasted 17 hrs, I had my epidural when I was 5 cm, they also gave me pictocin at that time because I was stuck at 5. within 20 mins of the epidural I thought "I should have had this with my first" I was looking at the monitor that shows heart rate and contraction and seen the numbers going to 170, for contraction which was worse then before I had the epidural and I was so relieved I couldn't feel it,lol. my legs stayed numb for awhile after but honestly even though I was so pro natural I would get another epidural if I had another.|`|abT0o6hHaa	its the best this to ever happen to modern medicine. I actually took a nap and they had to wake me up to start pushing. It lets you relax and enjoy the birth of your baby so much more. I just don't understand these woman who want to do it naturally! what are they trying to prove? Why would you intentionally be in the most awful pain imaginable if you don't have too?|`|dDVAUA9saa	I started full-blown labour at about 9pm on Thursday night.  I had back labour because my baby was posterior.  The contractions became increasingly painful and more frequent and at 1am I phoned my midwife.  She came to the house at 2am.  I laboured at home until 4:30 at which point I could not stand the pain anymore.  I was almost at the point of vomiting from the pain.  Although I had not wanted an epidural, I was begging for one by 4:30 so we left for the hospital.  I got the epidural at 6:15 and by 6:30 I felt NO pain.  However, as you said, the epi slowed down my labour, which was already slow because of the baby's position.  My contractions were not dropping the baby.  Her heartrate dropped dramatically and they had to suck her out with the vaccuum because she was in distress.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I was in labour for about 9.5 hours before having the epidural.  The baby was born 5 hours after having the epi.  If she hadn't been posterior I probably would not have needed the epi.  I'm hoping to avoid it with this baby (I"m 24 weeks pregnant).  <br>  <br>  I also had complications from the epi - I couldn't pee after and had to be catheterized, which caused a UTI - let me tell you that, on top of stitches, it was extremely painful!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Don't write any plan in stone, you may have a fast labour and not need an epi.  Go in with an open mind.|`|Ela3o96Raa	It was wonderful. I had been in labor for 10 hours and only had progressed to 4 centimeters even with pitocin. The pain was so intense and I couldnt handle it any longer. I asked for the epidural and within 30 minutes it was in via a drip bag (best way to go). The man who did my epidural was great and I was totally numb everywhere I was suposto be. Within 3 hours I was 10 centimeters and ready to push. I pushed for about 15 minutes and she was out - a beautiful 9lb 2oz was finally mine after all those months! Everything was perfect and I couldnt have asked for anything better.<br>  <br>  On Monday the 10th I am being induced with our second child, a boy! We are all so excited and I am beyond ready to have this baby! Wish me luck ladies!|`|yrDqtazLaa	The epidural allowed me to enjoy the rest of my labor and get some rest before pushing. The epidural was great, I was able to relax and I didn't lose my ability to push the baby out. And, on the contrary, the epidural actually made my labor go faster. It works differently for everyone.|`|AA10424047	I HATED my epidural. I swore I wasn't going to get it with my daughter and laboured for 7 1/2 hours without it before I begged for it. I got it, and then found out I was already 8cm dilated. My daughter was born an hour and a half later. I'm convinced that I probably would have had her sooner, but the reason I hated it is because recently, it has been shown that it COULD, not necessarily will, but COULD cause problems with breastfeeding, and for me, it did. But the worst is that it left me with a constant backache. I cannot lay down in certain positions, or the pain strikes me harder, I can only get up from a lying down position in certain ways, or the same happens, and I constantly walk around with a strain on my back. I also got 86 stitches from pushing my daughter out with an epidural. <br>  <br>  I swore I wouldn't get the epidural with my son, and I didn't. I only ended up with 7 stitches, no backache, no complications whatsoever, and my son is a pro-breastfeeder.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, I am anti-epidural, but if a woman wants one, it's her choice.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The epidural caused me to have severe nausea, and I began to throw up in the pushing stage. As a result of throwing up, my daughter came out all at once, rather than slowly (head first, one shoulder, then the rest). As a result, I got 86 stitches.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Mine was smooth sailing!  My first child was an emergency c-section and I didn't experience any labor, so with my second child it was like the first time for me.  I was in so much pain before I got the epidural, and then once it kicked in - pure relief!  It didn't slow my labor down at all ~ I went into labor around 8 a.m. and she was born at noon.  The hardest part, I thought, was holding very still in a curled up position for them to actually put the epidural in.  Other than that, smooth sailing.  Good luck!|`|5jqFrtrwaa	I was adamant I wasn't having one until I spent 15 long painful hours in labour, I then finally succumbed!<br>  <br>  I highly recommend it I could have kissed that Doctor when he gave it to me! Only rubbish thing is the catheter and not being able to get out of bed for 24hrs!|`|9GicwjX1aa	i was induced into established labour as my waters had broke 4 days before hand... so the pain was alot worse... i held out for like 7hours before having the epidural but seriously... its the best thing you could ever ask 4... it takes away 99.9% of the pain and you can still move your legs about even though you cant actually stand! its takes about 20minutes or less to kick in !|`|rBPi6N2daa	it was hell before the epi, heaven after. and it actually sped up my labor from like 3 cm to 9 in one hour.  it relaxed my body a lot. i felt normal with the epidural, no pain and could laugh and everything again.|`|claUGpVRaa	Oh thanks for asking this as I am in early labour at the moment with my first. I said all along I want an epidural and after reading your answers I am convinced!  I just want it to speed up now so I can go in and have one!<br>  Good luck with yours x|`|xocIN0scaa	Epidural is gods greatest gift to women. I was induced so Labor was more painful.. epidural was sweet relief! It does not hurt to get and makes you really enjoy the whole day better. I highly recommend it!|`|8GvVWgFPaa	I JUST had my son February 22...and I was scared...to have the epidural BUT I was TERRIFIED to do it natural. lol. My nurse told me I couldn't get an epidural til I was 3 cm dilated and I was only 2.5 cm. I kept telling my nurse to check me and to get the doctor in to do my epidural...By the time they got in there, I was 5cm and by the time they were able to start, I was 7cm... Then, I had to lay on my side instead of sitting up...honestly, I hated getting my epidural, my nerves were REAL bad at the time cause I was scared, not to mention my anesthesiologist was getting aggravated because I kept sucking my back inwards instead of arching out like he wanted me too. I was shivering the whole time, crying and not to mention my contractions were now 3 minutes apart. It did work, and I would tell my doctor to GIVE ME THE EPIDURAL the next time IF i decide to have more kids. LOL... BUT  everyone is different.....i didn't like the numb feeling in my legs though....and i got the headache & I have 4 little prick holes in my back from where they tried to get in, and they hit two nerves and my sciatic nerve is really bad now and my hip has pretty bad pain as well....my back still hurts but not as uncomfortable as it was while i was pregnant... i can actually lean inwards towards my stomach and sleep now!!  YAY!!!<br>  <br>  BUT...i am glad i got it. I was able to enjoy the rest of my labor, was able to sleep and the only time i got nausous was when I drank some sierra mist and drank water. but afterwards I had a chocolate shake lol....it was awesome...i'll definately get another one because 45 mintues of an epidural procedure is alot better than feeling the whole thing. I don't tolerate pain too well....it took me 3 hours to get a 45 minute tattoo....lol  i would recommend the epidural anytime...|`|l79QIWszaa	With my first delivery, I DID NOT want to have an epidural.  However, situations occured and after 24 hours I asked for one.  I was not progressing (only about 3cm after all those hours) and my physician was hesitant to let me have the epidural because he thought things might slow down.  But, after I got the epidural I was fully dilated within 2 hours.  Sometimes they help you relax, and you'll know when it's time!  Other people say to get the epidural as soon as you can; I'm just kind of partial to thinking you should be able to experience some pain in labor...<br>  <br>  Getting the epidural took about 5 minutes and since I was in so much pain from the contractions, I didn't feel a thing.  I only had to have it in for about 3 hours and I requested the lowest dose so that I could still feel some of the delivery.  I also requested to not have an indwelling catheter unless the epidural was in for a long period of time, and in that case I wanted to be straight cathed.  I was able to get out of bed just a few minutes after they took it out (the initial bolus had worn off and I requested no more).  It's good to know as much as you can about it so that the experience goes as much in your favor as possible.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Qij73O6Raa	I totally understand how you feel.  I felt the very same way when I had my son.  I was so scared of how bad it would feel, and when I didn't get on with gas and air I knew I had to act quickly, before it was too late to get an epidural.  Once I had decided on an epidural, it took about an hour for the doc to come and administer it, so I would bear that in mind if that is what you want.  Best to order it as soon as you arrive on the labour ward!!  My waters broke about 11pm, and I had the epidural at about 8am, so I was about 6-7 cm dilated by that point.  I used a TENS machine to that point as well, which really did help, so try and hire one if you can.  Once the epidural kicked in I was able to relax and watch tv.  It was like a dream!!  They came and checked on me frequently and I was told about midday that I was fully dilated!!  And totally painlessly!  I started pushing about 1pm but baby got stuck as he was lying spine to spine so I had to go into theatre for episiotomy and my baby was suctioned out by ventouse at 4:27pm, so not too bad timewise.  So all in all I was so pleased I had an epidural and the midwife, who was doubtful about it at the time, even said later on that I'd made the right decision as the baby had got stuck and I'd have been in absolute agony.  So I say, if that's what you want, go for it.  Don't let anyone talk you out of it if that's what you want.  You are the one going through the labour so you choose what pain relief you want.  I'm very early pregnant with baby no2 and I know what I'll be asking for this time!!  Good luck with it all.  xx|`|6IH8BhUSaa	the epidural is the greastest invention EVER!!! i was in pain for a period of 3 hours and after i had the epidural pain was all gone.. all i felt was pressure.. felt like  i was trying to push out a very very big BM.... the epidural took about 15 minutes to kick in but after that i was sooo relieved.. i was cracking jokes while i was pushing lol
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Chances are very high that you could be pregnant. You should always use protection if you do not want to have a baby right now. good Luck!|`|uuHPneEcaa	well anytime u have unprotected sex u can become pregnant. u either ovulate before or after ur period. So ur chances are alot greater..(because of the unprotected sex) Good luck to u
MYRm9nMbaa	Make an appointment with your OB/Gyn. They will draw some blood and test for HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, it's a hormone made by the pregnancy that can be detected in the mother's blood or urine even before the woman's missed period. HCG is first detectable in the blood as early as 7-8 days after ovulation and levels will remain elevated for several days following a miscarriage. It is very rare, although it is possible, to get a false positive on a home pregnancy test. You doctor can discuss your best options for treatment following this, if necessary. Do not wait, see your Dr. as soon as possible to avoid any complications that may arise.|`|cg3laVBCaa	You need to book in with the drs straight away! Just to get checked out!  Normally you would know if you had, had a miscariage as it is very painful.  Maybe you had a faulty test.  But go get your self checked out to put your mind at rest.  Good Luck!|`|6dQzmsXuaa	Sure.|`|DVJoW71saa	What is a miscarriage?<br>  <br>  A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy during the first 20 weeks. It is usually your body's way of ending a pregnancy that has had a bad start. The loss of a pregnancy can be very hard to accept. You may wonder why it happened or blame yourself. But a miscarriage is no one’s fault, and you can't prevent it.<br>  <br>  Miscarriages are very common. About 1 in 4 pregnancies end in a miscarriage.1 It is also common for a woman to have a miscarriage before she even knows that she is pregnant.<br>  What causes a miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Most miscarriages happen because the fertilized egg in the uterus does not develop normally. A miscarriage is not caused by stress, exercise, or sex. In many cases, doctors don't know what caused the miscarriage.<br>  <br>  The risk of miscarriage is lower after the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy.<br>  What are the common symptoms?<br>  <br>  Common signs of a miscarriage include:<br>  <br>      * Bleeding from the vagina. The bleeding may be light or heavy, constant or off and on. It can sometimes be hard to know whether light bleeding is a sign of miscarriage. But if you have bleeding with pain, the chance of a miscarriage is higher.<br>      * Pain in the belly, lower back, or pelvis.<br>      * Tissue that passes from the vagina.<br>  <br>  How is a miscarriage diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Call your doctor if you think you are having a miscarriage. If your symptoms and a pelvic exam do not show whether you are having a miscarriage, your doctor can do tests to see if you are still pregnant.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  No treatment can stop a miscarriage. As long as you do not have heavy blood loss, a fever, weakness, or other signs of infection, you can let a miscarriage follow its own course. This can take several days.<br>  <br>  If you have Rh-negative blood, you will need a shot of Rhogam. This prevents problems in future pregnancies. If you have not had your blood type checked, you will need a blood test to find out if you are Rh-negative.<br>  <br>  Many miscarriages complete on their own, but sometimes treatment is needed. If you are having a miscarriage, work with your doctor to watch for and prevent problems. If the uterus does not clear quickly enough, you could lose too much blood or develop an infection. In this case, medicine or a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) can more quickly clear tissue from the uterus.<br>  <br>  A miscarriage doesn't happen all at once. It usually takes place over several days, and symptoms vary. Here are some tips for dealing with a miscarriage:<br>  <br>      * Use pads instead of tampons. You will probably have vaginal bleeding for a week or so. It may be like or slightly heavier than a normal period. You may use tampons during your next period, which should start in 3 to 6 weeks.<br>      * Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for cramps. Read and follow all instructions on the label. You may have cramps for several days after the miscarriage.<br>      * Eat a balanced diet that is high in iron and vitamin C. You may be low in iron because of blood loss. Foods rich in iron include red meat, shellfish, eggs, beans, and leafy green vegetables. Foods high in vitamin C include citrus fruits, tomatoes, and broccoli. Talk to your doctor about whether you need to take iron pills or a multivitamin.<br>      * Talk with family, friends, or a counselor if you are having trouble dealing with the loss of your pregnancy. If you feel very sad or depressed for longer than 2 weeks, talk to a counselor or your doctor.<br>      * Talk with your doctor about any future pregnancy plans. Most doctors suggest that you wait until you have had at least one normal period before you try to get pregnant again. If you don't want to get pregnant, ask your doctor about birth control options.<br>  <br>  After a miscarriage, are you at risk for miscarrying again?<br>  <br>  Miscarriage is usually a chance event, not a sign of an ongoing problem. If you have had one miscarriage, your chances for future successful pregnancies are good. It is unusual to have three or more miscarriages in a row. But if you do, your doctor may do tests to see if a health problem may be causing the miscarriages.<br>  <br>  Frequently Asked Questions<br>  <br>  Learning about miscarriage:<br>   <br>  <br>      * What is a miscarriage?<br>      * What are common symptoms of a miscarriage?<br>      * What causes a miscarriage?<br>      * What might increase my risk of miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Being diagnosed:<br>   <br>  <br>      * How is a miscarriage diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Getting treatment:<br>   <br>  <br>      * When should I call my doctor about cramping or bleeding?<br>      * How is a miscarriage treated?<br>      * Should I have medical, surgical, or no treatment to complete a miscarriage?<br>      * How do I take care of myself at home when I am having a miscarriage?<br>      * How can I cope with a miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Ongoing concerns:<br>   <br>  <br>      * How soon can I try to conceive after a miscarriage?<br>  <br>  <br>  **HOPE THIS HELPS!!|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	if you think you've had a miscarriage then you need to go to the hospital. seeing you had a positive test you need to be checked. dont  take the risk.|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	There could be 2 reasons for the positive and then the negative test. 1. You could have had a false positive test... these are extremely rare, but I know from experience they can happen. 2. You could have had a chemical pregnancy. <br>  A chemical pregnancy is when the sperm fertilizes the egg, but for one reason or another the fertilized egg is not able to implant into the uterine walls. This can cause your body to produce enough HCG to make a test turn positive, but then decline rather quickly to produce a negative pregnancy test. Usually you have your period very soon after the decline in the HCG.
KOjVWXOCaa	You have to wait until you are late for your next period. If your period normally comes every 28 or 29 days and it doesn't come, take a pregnancy test. Sometimes when you are afraid and think you are pregnant you would have pregnancy symptoms. Just relax, wait until your period is late. If you start getting really, really sore breast...you just might be pregnant. Good Luck.|`|nISYAHkfaa	None of us can answer this question for you. You need to get ten dollars, go to a nearby Wal-Mart or Kroger, get a pregnancy test, and take it. I promise you it won't cost more than ten dollars, and it'll set your mind at ease. Either way you need to find out, so that you can start taking care of yourself if you are.<br>  <br>  Some people have morning sickness, some people have all-day sickness, and some people have no sickness at all . . . some people notice implantation bleeding, others don't have it . . . you can even have your period while pregnant (this happened to me). But at the same time you are obviously stressing out and that can lower your immune system's effictiveness AND cause irregular periods/spotting . . . so go take a test.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't have unprotected sex next time! :p Your school counselor, at least, can probably get you some condoms!|`|ltHKURBhaa	Yes it sounds like you are pregnant i would take a hpt and if neg retest in a week or so <br>  <br>  good luck|`|zYBLzO9Naa	Well the best possible thing to do is go out and buy a pregnancy test. If it comes up negative, try another one in a week or so. I have all day sickness, and baby, they suck. (I never had implantation bleeding though.) It's hard for me because this is my senior year of high school. And I DO plan on going to college. But anyways, back to your case...Just go to the nearest drug store and buy a pregnancy test like Ohaeri said its not more than 10 dollars. It would give you some sense of ease, even if you are pregnant. Atleast you would know and not wonder all the time and stress. And if you are, just take care. Good luck! I hope for the best! :)
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	To me, this time around, it feels like a really bad hangover without the headache.|`|ad0F70IMaa	Feeling like you need to throw up pretty much. With or without actually doing it. Although most women will get it throughout the day too not just in the 'morning'.|`|yZkf3zFeaa	Personally, I felt nauseated most of the time, and anytime I would eat breakfast, especially bagels for some reason, I would actually get sick. During times I felt totally fine, a smell would make me sick. Once I was helping my boyfriend with dishes and he handed me a plate with mustard on it to scrape off and I had to run to the bathroom.....I love mustard too. lol Its different for every one and despite its name, its not only in the morning.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	it's that nauseous feeling in your throat. Like if you smell something or see something gross, you stomach just automatically turns and you think you are going to throw up and/or you do throw up. For me things that never even bothered me before started making me feel sick (scented garbage bags, even brushing my teeth, the smell of cheese, etc).|`|NE96fU9vaa	like queezy, sick, some women smell things and become sick also, lasts a few weeks to a few months, its diffrent each pregnancy, some dont get it at all|`|AA11220327	honestly? it feels awful. it is extreme nausea, and usually vommiting. not the greatest feeling|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	I had really bad morning sickness but only threw up once. I was just always nauseated. That's actually when I started to think I was pregnant. I was doing the dishes and for some reason it made me feel like I was going to puke. There was no oder but the idea of old food for some reason made me want to vomit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and a wonderful way to get rid of that queezy feeling is by taking an ice cube, tilting your head back and rubbing it on your throat. It immediately goes away because it helps to relax your throat.|`|kDNoQaA2aa	It's different for everyone, but for me it was just a general nauseous feeling all day long. I only threw up a few times over the course of a few months, but that nauseous feeling never quite went away until my second trimester. Some strong smells can trigger the nausea as well - such as fish and coffee.|`|113FoyMFaa	feeling sick.<br>  <br>  <br>  lol, really thats what it is.  it happens anytime though, not just in the morning.
2HETgiwgaa	If you are not a New Zealand resident or citizen, or subject to a reciprocal agreement in regard to maternity care, you may need to contact the hospital where you are planning to give birth to find out what the costs will be.  I did try to find information on this on one hospital's website, but couldn't - probably because most people giving birth in New Zealand qualify for free maternity treatment.<br>  <br>  New Zealand citizens and residents, for example, can access free maternity care, including the birth and hospital stay.

1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes you need to tell him pregnancy it is very accurate.|`|COecrPrMaa	Yes.  A pee test will detect only if your hCG levels are high enough.  A blood test will tell you how much hCG is in your body.|`|AqhKpt4Waa	Its beta-hcg blood test which is done to confirm your pregnancy. This is the best way to confirm you are pregnant.

Sperm "dies" after a while if it's exposed to air and not being refrigerated.<br>  2. Yes,if you clean them good it will go away.<br>  3. No the most fertile days of the month are between 12-15 days from when ur period started BUT you can get pregnant everyday of the month(other days have less possibility)<br>  4. By saying firmly that you don't want to be. If he pressures you to be something that you don't feel like or you're not ready to do(like proceed to sex and stuff) I would advice you to find another boyfriend.He should respect you and wait for you to be ready...not force things.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped...take care|`|83t9G4gcaa	1. Sperm survive only a few hours in air or other surfaces outside the vagina.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, of course.<br>  <br>  3. No. The first day of your menses is considered the first day of the average woman's CYCLE. The egg ripens and is released on the 14 day of the cycle and is viable from about 6-24 hours. Thus, the optimum time to get pregnant is 14 days from the first day of your last period.<br>  <br>  4. Have less time alone by doing things with other couples, or inviting him over only when your parents or siblings are around. Talk to him about your concerns. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you feel pressured and are very scared about pregnancy. I hope you can talk to him about your concerns and fears.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

eD7qRBKHaa	if you don't follow the instructions, you can't count on the test being correct.  All of them I have ever seen say not to hold upside-down or shake.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your question is - are you saying no lines were showing up or just one line was showing up?  If it was just the one test line and no positive line, then you are not pregnant.|`|WFVWKOtgaa	You need to go to the doctor.<br>  pregnancy tests are not always accurute.<br>  and by shaking them it might or rubbed of the ink.x|`|FYDw1rjlaa	Pregnancy test won't be accurate if you shake it.

876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	I would think that older women would be more of the ones to get the abortions done then teenagers.  Only because teenagers, they live with their parents and i believe that most parents are against abortion.  As for adults, if they are single and want to keep living the lifestyle that they are, then if pregnant i'm pretty sure they'll most likely want to get an abortion.<br>  <br>  that's just what i think|`|xL6McXTfaa	52% of women obtaining abortions in the U.S. are younger than 25: Women aged 20-24 obtain 32% of all abortions; Teenagers obtain 20% and girls under 15 account for 1.2%. <br>  <br>  <br>  so... no.|`|DKtU1gKXaa	Fact: Each year, one million American teenagers become pregnant, and 78% of these pregnancies are unintended. <br>  <br>  this is a fact!!!!! so yes more teenagers get abortions than older women|`|qKUMaJcXaa	Well yes most teen pregnancy is unplanned and think of all the stigma that comes from being a teen parent|`|yV8fog7Paa	yes because they don't want to take their damn responsibility for their own mistakes and they want to murder because of it. :||`|pZSZUhXNaa	yes.

TQYaNGdSaa	My youngest suffers really badly with his teeth. It starts about 4 weeks before they aven appear his sleep pattern is disrupted, he gets hot and irritable yet his gums look fine. The teeth cause pain as they are moving in the gum so some babies have pain before they start to break through. Does Calpol work? ( does your baby calm down after some medicine )  if so then your baby is in pain in my opnion. The teeth are linked to ears eyes nose throat they cause all sorts of problem including nappie rash etc. I would ask the doctor to rule out any kind of viral infection as a temp that high could indicate that and if your baby has had a high temp problem for over 2 weeks they will likely give some antibiotics. Good luck i know exactly how you are feeling. xx|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Could be teething but it also could be an ear infection.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	She probably is teething. She is at that age and they can get a temp and even some diarrhea when they are teething. Give her plenty of cold clean things to chew on and she will be fine.
RIu6u1xmaa	Well if your daughter has been dating this man for 3 years she was 13 and he was18 when they started dating. Since there hasn't been any problems so far with them I would say give the man a chance. Your daughter is now to the age where even if you tell her and him that they can't see each other any more that they will just keep snicking around till she is 18. Since they have been together for three years and she hasn't become pregnant I would say they are both being very responsible and they most be very happy together so I would get to know him if I were you. It is to late for the discipline.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	No its sick he's probably just using her.|`|yV8fog7Paa	you just joined today trolllllll|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Her mother is in a different country? So it is her fault?  Where have YOU been for the past three years?  As a father, I wanted to know about their schooling, what friends, where they wanted to go ( I took them and picked them up) and why.  At thirteen, I would not allow my daughters to date one on one.  Yes, meet him and then form your opinion of him.  At 16, she is still a minor living in your house, but to try and discipline after 3 yrs? When will she be 17, as many States still consider 18 to be legal adult.  I don't envy you as you now have a fine line to walk.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	I had the same situation with my daughter. Her mother thought I should let it alone so I did. However, I never felt good about it because in my view, that's too large of an age gap at such a young age. On the other hand, they've been dating for three years already so they've been friends for a long time. I would keep a very close eye on them, if I were you.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	This guy was dating your daughter when she was 13 and he was 17.  He should be in prison.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	meet him and then if you don't think he is a "good" guy tell your daughter. but what is a 20 year old man doing with a 16 year old? he needs to get someone his own age.|`|AA12192295	If she has been dating him for 3 years, trying to keep them apart could just drive her away. Even if you tell her no, and discipline her, she could just end up seeing him behind your back. If I were you, I would meet him and at least try to get to know him. If he is really bad news then you should step in but be prepared that it could get very ugly. When I was a teen I dated a guy for 3 years and he was a few years older then me. My parents didn't like him but they let us hand out at my house so that my parents could keep an eye on us. If they had tried to break us up, I would have ran away with him. He was trouble and we eventually broke up but when your a teenager, your not thinking clearly. So just keep an eye on them. Keeping them closer is better then pushing them away.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	yes give him a chance he could be a perfectly good person.<br>  im 16 and im engaged to a 20 year old man.<br>  age is just a number <br>  it seems bad now but if shes 30 and dating a 34 year old man is anything wrong with that? what was the age difference between you and her mother.<br>  you should give him a chance its not her fault that she feel in love with him and she shouldnt have to hide it from you , you should be ok with it.<br>  you should give him a chance and dont go into meeting him thinking hes 20 go into meeting him thinking he has strong feelings for your daughter and really wants to be with her.<br>  dont disipline her.<br>  because theres nothing wrong with it.|`|iAfmejYTaa	dont do sumthn stupid and forbid her 2 date him bc that duxnt work she will just get pissed and do it anyway. if they hav been dating for 3 years then he is prolly a good guy. talk to her but i dont think there is anything to disapprove about. its only a 4 yr diffenence n age and if you think about it most adult relationships have a MUCH bigger diff. she is old enuf to decide who to date.|`|AA11537580	they have already been dating for 3 years so not too much you can do.<br>  <br>  (edit: I started dating my now husband when I was 16 and he was 21, we have been together for 17 years, 11 of them married)|`|Hi5h9739aa	I would not allow my 16 year old daughter to date a 20 year old man.  But they have been dating for 3 years now so its going to be really hard to try to break that up.  Good Luck to you.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	its been 3 years and they have been dating. nothing has gone wrong so why break it up? Get to know the guy im sure you will find him to be as great as your daughter thinks. I mean 4 years is not bad.|`|AA12211242	let me ask you this. <br>  what do you think of a 17 years old kid dating 13 years old girl ?<br>  that were their age 3 years ago.<br>  <br>  sound to me too old for her.|`|GNNtomgUaa	give them a chance....if its been 3 years you know that hes treating her right and they BOTH care for eachother....AGE IS JUST A NUMBER...xox|`|Zxd5nMrDaa	Of course you do not let your 16 year old daughter date a 20 year old man!!! Lets be honest here more than likely they are having sex and that is ILLEGAL.  Even if they aren't having sex I would say "NO" because  dating is a privledge and you said she lied to you...that says she's not responsible or respectful enough to earn privledges from you.  <br>  Now I don't mean you any disrespect and I certainly don't mean to make you feel bad about your parenting skills but I can only assume that your daughter will NOT listen to you if you tell her right off the bat to stop dating this guy.  My assumption is that she'd lash out at you, continue seeing the man and possibly even run off with him.  At this point I think your best bet would be to meet the guy, tell him how you feel about him dating your daughter while she's so young.  Tell him that he can hang out with her at your house while you're home and that if he really loves and respects her than he shouldn't have a problem respecting her parents as well.  When she's 18 cut her loose.|`|cj29AORfaa	Just give the guy a chance. Meet him. If you don't like him THEN you can discipline her. If you just say no right off the bat,you're only asking for trouble. As for the age difference,I'm 16 yet I have friends,guys and girls, who's ages range from 16-21. We don't worry about the age,it's the maturity level. And 3 years isn't that big of a difference. If the gap was 10+ years,I'd say that's a problem. But 3 years,come on people.|`|6683fa949dfc425a21a5980b5f9d8a9daa	If she's been seeing this person for 3 years, then I'm afraid that your a little too late to be worrying if you should allow her to be dating him.  She will not stop just because you just found out and are telling her not to.  If she had just started seeing him, then that would be a different story and you could have your say in her seeing an adult and her still being underage.|`|AA10605461	The way I see it is if she is truelly happy then support her. Because this day and age she is going to do it anyway. I don't think that 4 yrs. age difference is a big issue to worry about. In my pass, I found that older men know how to treat a lady. I say open the door and let him in. Good Luck!!! I'm sure you will make the right decision.|`|BthSjSEHaa	My husband is 5 years older than me and it's never caused any problems with us or other family members. They've been together for a long time, so it seems likely he's a good person. Of course you should meet him, but I don't think it's a cause for worry (or discipline!).<br>  <br>  Oh, and my husband and I met when I was 17 and he was 22 - we've been together for 10 years and married for 6.|`|nb9S2OZdaa	No you should not.  She has been hiding this from you because she knew it was wrong.  This 20 year old guy is just after your daughter for one thing.|`|oUHmpdiZaa	Just get to know him, then make your decision.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do think she should have some punishment but only for lying to you.|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	why not.whats the age difference between u and ur partner.?<br>  <br>  what was the age difference between u and ur ex's?<br>  <br>  4 years is an advisable and good gap<br>  <br>  u must giv them chance.let time decide their future|`|WvrxPfDHaa	You should let her date your ex-husband.|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Yeah, why not!|`|GM63jFD2aa	Well, first of all. Your daughter lied to you and that's a big problem. However, she's been with this guy for 3 years, which obviously means something. Usually when people that young, but with such a big age gap date, it generally doesn't last. I think that this might really be something because of the length of time that it has lasted. If I were you, I would meet him for yours and your daughters sake. First of all, if you discipline her, after the punishment is over, she'll probably go back to him behind your back or not. If you meet him up front, you can know the kind of person that he is, make any necessary judgements on his character and they can hang out around you sometimes. Maybe knowing the guy and forging some sort of a relationship with him will make you feel better.
WkIPKqlNaa	speak to yupur husband about his and your dream of family...including family size...if you both have dream for 2 children...adopt one....afterall you both have to fulfill your and each-others dream.|`|kHBCUxwHaa	don't has sexz|`|ZZ32oTfwaa	It is always a combined decision of a husband and wife and you can't decide every thing yourself.I feel, if you are trying to avoid pregnancy without consent of your husband ,the situation may worsen and in due course of time,you might have to pay a very heavy price for that.Only viable solution,either convince him or get convinced from him.Whatever be done must be mutually agreed .Another option is- you may have one of your own and other adopted one,if both of you agree.Please don't take one sided decision.|`|6uv9FMfwaa	It is a good step to give a orphan child a family, but it depends upon both of u. If u consult with u'r hubby, u can get a solution. I think u r in fear of the pain to be come.

Dard ho toh Dard jano.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	I don't understand why you can't just secretly take the pill or get an IUD.Or better yet,talk to your husband maybe you can compromise,have one child together and adopt one.You both get what you want.|`|E4ySrE6Xaa	it cant be an individual decesion when ur married either convinced ur husband about adoption or produce a baby. U can produce one & adopt when so that both of u can be happy.|`|AA10111355	Don't get pregnant.  If your husband will not get a vasectomy, simply refuse to have sexual relations with him.  Now, on the issue of adoption, be forewarned that most children up for adoption are the products of losers; therefore, I would strongly advise against adoption. My wife is a cosmetologist and has met many people who have adopted and none is happy about her decision. <br>  <br>   Your best solution is to remain childless.  I made that choice when I was 14 and had never had sex, and I've been supremely happy ever since I got that vasectomy and so is my wife who married me knowing that I had had a vasectomy.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	Come to an agreement. Just because you want to adopt doesnt mean that you and your husband cant have one that is made from your genes. I would say have one and then adopt one. You are showing your husband that you love him and also getting your dreams conquered as well. Hope this helps. If all else fails, get an IUD.

Kinda got used to it now!<br>  Its amazing how ur body changes during pregnancy! x|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Yes.  I had one VERY tender breast before my missed period.  You couldn't even touch it without it hurting a lot.  And a couple weeks after my missed period when I knew I was pregnant they both started hurting.  I could sleep on my side because they hurt so bad.  A couple more weeks they both stopped hurting though thank goodness.|`|xpstigPTaa	I would think so. Both of mine are super tender but I don't see why just one of them being tender would be abnormal. Our bodies are doing amazing things right now! Congrats!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I have one tender breast before my period so I guess it would be normal to have it in early pregnancy too!
MHg9JhEKaa	You don't always know it when you ovulate. Could be implantation, could just be ordinary spotting.

You can take a test around when your af is due. Good luck and and fingers crossed for you!
yZkf3zFeaa	He has no say, and I'm pretty sure you don't either based on the fact of a woman's right to choose. (Why don't they just get a divorce?) Though if she went through with having the baby and you are the father he would have no say in anything to do with the child, legally.|`|PvEEOdKBaa	since you are not her husband you have no legal rights until you can prove by bloodtest after baby is born that you are.  With that said, neither does he!  Men sadly in some cases have no rights to unborn children.  The mother can do whatever she wants with said baby in eyes of law as long as she has abortion prior to whatever age is considered to be the turning point- I think it is 12 weeks.|`|LUbW8kTBaa	If she wants to get an abortion then it's her decision...no one else's.  However, if she decides to keep the baby and wants to go through with a divorce, then the court will order a paternity test to make sure that the baby doesn't belong to the husband.  <br>  <br>  And in the future, if the two of you can't handle taking care of the baby that you two made, use a condom and birth control and stop making babies and killing them.|`|NroZQN5vaa	I would think it ought to but really, it's the woman's decision. The husband can fight it all he wants but in the end, she can do what she wants to do. But if she's with you and doesn't want to be with her husband any more, wouldn't it be easier to just get a divorce? That way this sort of thing won't be an issue again...|`|yKS2UI87aa	Although I really believe abortion is killing a human. He has no rights. Have her get a divorce, uncontested divorce if done by the parties themselves are only 300-500. Go to "the silent scream" on youtube and watch it before you decide to kill your baby.If you are in a relationship with her why would you not keep the baby?|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You need a lawyer.  You're bio dad, but he may be the LEGAL dad.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	If you are the father than NO his words mean nothing.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	All I can say is poor baby.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	hmm that's a hard one. Well if they have been legally separated for five years then I don't think so. I don't think he could legally make her keep the baby even if it was his, which I'm not saying it is. I'm pretty sure it's completely up to the mother if she wants to have the baby or not. I would suggest doing some research on abortion.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "The laws of the United States do not acknowledge the right a father to stop the abortion of his own child, but rather place that act solely within the decision of the mother."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/postabortion/postabortiontestimonymen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.priestsforlife.org/postaborti...</a>|`|iwYu32N2aa	neither of you have a choice in that decision. It is completely up to her to make that choice.|`|OQdPzl15aa	Well, since he isn't the biological father, he doesn't have any say unless it's related to finances. If they are still legally married, than she can't go off and spend his money on an abortion.<br>  <br>  Secondly, what about the baby's say?  You do realize that this developing human has a completely separate DNA code than you or the mother. Each human alive today, went through the same developing process, and each of us spent 30 minutes as a single cell, before eventually becoming great people like Einstein, Charles Darwin, Obama, Julia Roberts, Niel Armstrong, Will Farrell, etc.... If you don't want a baby, that's totally understandable, esp. if you weren't expecting one.  However, give the baby a chance at life with someone who does want one.<br>  <br>  I would also encourage you to google images of what you are about to abort. For example, if she is 4 weeks, then google "four week fetus". It's not a jellyfish.  Humans give birth to humans and you can't undo this once it's done. <br>  <br>   I hope I'm not upsetting you, it's just that I've talked to too many women who have regretted getting abortions and the emotional effects on them have been pretty tough.  It's hard to watch someone you love go through that.|`|nISYAHkfaa	No, in fact, neither of you have any say in this legally. It is ultimately the woman's choice. He can't drag you to court over it, especially considering that they are separated, so relax.<br>  <br>  If it's an option, I would recommend to you two to sue for divorce or try to cut yourself off from him so that you don't have to worry about the messy situation in the future--but I don't know the full story, I know it can be hard to get a divorce and very expensive too. So that is just my friendly advice based on absolute ignorance of the situation, lol.<br>  <br>  P.S.: Planned Parenthood centers can refer you to someone who does elective abortions, you can google Planned Parenthood and use their site to find a center nearby. Good luck.|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I don't personally agree with abortion, but thanks to Roe vs. Wade, the only person who has any power in this situation is your girlfriend. She can get an abortion right now today, regardless of what either you or her husband thinks or says. Neither of you have any power unless and until she gives birth to a baby instead of having an abortion.|`|DutTBV3caa	i guess the best advice anyone can give you is one, make her go through with the divorce, and two, make an appointment at the clinic to talk to them about it. maybe theres a chance its his and your girlfriend doesnt want to tell you.. hopefully thats not the case but you never know.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	His words and thoughts don't have any power over you and your baby.
6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa	You know your daughter. Think about the context of the question and try to think of what she's really asking. She probably does not want a detailed physical description of intercourse. I suspect that if you tell her something simple about how a mommy and daddy have a special kind of love that allows them to have a baby that grows in mommy's womb will suffice. Then let her ask questions if that answer doesn't satisfy her.<br>  <br>  If she wants specifics of sex you may want to gently question her to see what she knows and where she got the info. Too much knowledge at a young age may raise a red flag. <br>  <br>  I think the important thing is to be honest but reserved. In other words, do not give more Information than is appropriate to a child her age. Do not make up stories of storks or cabbage patches. <br>  <br>  Reminds me of a story where six-year old Kelly asks her parents where she came from. The parents, trying to be factual, give Kelly a graphic and detailed description of sex, pregnancy, and birth. After the talk they ask if that answers Kelly's question. Kelly says, "Not really. Tiffany said she came from Chicago and I wanted to know where I came from."|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Be factual.  My suggestion is to leave god, and mommy's and daddy's out of it.<br>  <br>  My son when he was 7 said hey remember in 2006 when you swallowed Reed (his brother) and he grew in your tummy.  He said  this at a restaurant and Nana (my mom) was there.<br>  <br>  Immediately I began thinking about how my son thinks.  My mom jumped in and said, babies are a gift from god and then gave me this snarky look.  I knew this would be a problem.  He followed up with why doesn't god love everybody?  My mom said god loves everybody.  Then he said well why won't god give aunt Jan a baby, she wants a baby?<br>  <br>  I told him that I didn't swallow his brother, the doctor gave me medicine to help my eggs grow.  And that girls are born with all their eggs.  He said like eggs?  I said no like in finding nemo, a soft egg, only he grew on the inside.<br>  <br>  He was satisfied with this.  Keep it simple and factual.  I would have gone further saying the egg was fertilized etc but he didn't want that.<br>  <br>  Also my son knows other families that have two mom's, and ones that are adopted too.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	do like my mom did me, get a woman's health book and sit down with her and tell her all about it. lol it'll be a funny reaction but no since in hiding it.|`|9VNJbARDaa	The way my Dad told me when I was that age was "God gives the Daddy a seed.  The daddy plants the seed in the Mommy's belly, and it grows into a baby."  It was enough information for my age, and it was not really a lie either, even though it made me think that babies were a bit like flowers....|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	What we told my daughter when she was younger was that she came from Heaven.  When God decided it was time for her mommie (me) to be pregnant, her daddy and I went to bed one night.

ybexjS2Paa	I wouldn't worry my son was exactly the same. On the other hand my daughter who is 14months can already say a few words which amazes me as looking back at my son development he could only say dada and mama at that age. I think he said his first proper word at the age of 18 months and it was "baby". Kids learn at their own pace. If you really worry you can always speak to your ped.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I think he is maybe starting to fall behind, but you have caught it early. What you want to do is to contact early intervention in your area and ask them for a speech evaluation for him. WIC or the health department can give you the contact information.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that the screaming and shreiking is him trying to either communicate with you, or express his frustration at trying to communicate with you. Does he have a lot of temper tantrums over what seems like nothing (ie flipping a lightswitch, closing a door)? My son would have the worst 15 minute tantrums over silly things. They disappeared when he learned sign language.<br>  <br>  My youngest said 10 words up until he was almost 2.5 years old. He was so frustrated that it about broke your heart. he would go sit in the corner with his head in his hands and look so sad and defeated. At 24 months old I had a developmental eval done on him through EI. He was OK in all areas except speech. He went to a speech therapist who said his expressive speech was on a 15 month level. She suggested sign language to help with his immediate communication needs. We got the "signing time" DVDs and within days he was signing things and much happier. Within a few months of starting therapy he was speaking much better. He still has some articulation issues, but has made TONS of progress in the last 13 months.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	a lot of geniuses don't talk in sentences till they have something worth saying.  but if you're really concerned, you can have him tested to see if he is developmentally delayed.|`|kjgonYlgaa	12 - 18 months<br>  <br>  -walks on own<br>  -eats with fingers<br>  -likes looking at pictures in a book<br>  -climbs all over<br>  -touches everything<br>  -crawls up and down stairs on all fours<br>  -Turns door knobs<br>  -becomes impatient if made to wait<br>  -Has short memory and repeats mistakes<br>  -often does the opposite of what is asked<br>  -Shy<br>  -Points at objects in distance<br>  -understands simply requests like "show me the truck"<br>  - can say about 10 words<br>  <br>  <br>  18 - 24 months<br>  -can say about 50 words and make 2 word sentences<br>  <br>  <br>  Understand that each child is different and he seems to be doing just fine for his age.

But they should be concerned. It is vitally important to identify and treat speech and language challenges as early as possible in a child's life, with a strong emphasis on the early intervention years of birth to three. At this age the brain is undergoing the most rapid development. No harm will come from therapeutic services.|`|2ElUElbjaa	My son just turned 16 months old. He can say mamama, dadadada, doggy (doyee), kitty (kiyee), baby (bayee), yes, hi, and maybe a few other words in his own version. He can point to his nose, mouth and ears. He also walks, runs, jumps and can do a ton of physical things. Often times, children will either pick language or motor skills and excell in the one for a while, and then catch up with the other. I wouldn't worry about it so much, boys take a little longer to talk but will be way more active than little girls. Also, listen to see if he has made his own words for things, sometimes I forget that just because it's not exactly how we say the word, it doesn't mean that its not a word to him. I would just say keep reading and talking to him all the time, making sure you use the words he understands and enunciate. You could also try using sign language, since he's responded to showing you his belly button, as a way to get him communicating. I know sometimes it can get frustrating and worrisome, but also keep the big picture in mind. With children that are 4, 5, 6 now, you can't really tell which ones started talking at 12 months or 19 months. Just be patient and keep doing what you're doing, he'll talk when he's ready!
VKMBaz8daa	Personally I believe that abortion only becomes murder when the embryo becomes a fetus.<br>  <br>  At the stages of an embryo I would view that the baby isnt really a human being. Therefore it only gives a timeframe of 12 weeks from conception for me to not class it as murder<br>  <br>  I can recall going to my scan at 13 weeks and seeing a little baby. If I then decided to have an abortion, I would consider myself as killing a human being.|`|55t9z5maaa	yes abortion is murder just because it is legal does not mean you are not killing a human being if you dont want to keep the baby give it up for adoption of course when the baby grows up it will relise that it was a mistake and that his parents didn't want him but at lest you wont have as much gilt as you would have if you got an abortion|`|ZHjrK0qAaa	Okay!

The Ten Commandments-Thou Shall Not Murder<br>  Don't kill-that little one is one of God's little one.  That little one was your choice my sex and if not then it was rape.

It completely stops a beating heart. That's murder.. what's so confusing?<br>  <br>  eta: Think of it like this.<br>  1) It's been scientifically proven that human life begins at conception. If not at conception, then logically when would it begin? <br>  2) Murder is "The unlawful killing of one person by another." Okay, so since abortion is 'legal,' it's not murder in the government's terms. But it's still killing. Let's say we've already established that human LIFE begins at conception. One can only either be alive or dead. So.. if it's alive at conception, and a doctor performs an abortion, that doctor is killing the baby. The result is that the baby is dead.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	I personally believe that abortion is murder. I don't care what other people say, but I believe that when you have an abortion, you are killing a child.

YOU were "just a piece of tissue" once.  Are you not alive?  We all started somewhere.  I'm sure your mother did not once mention she was having a piece of tissue when she announced her pregnancy to the world, no, she was having a baby. Aren't you glad you weren't just a piece of inconvenient tissue to her?<br>  <br>    It seems pro-abortion supporters like to absolve themselves of any guilt or wrongdoing by demeaning the beginning of human life as something subhuman, or not human at all.  Freud would have a field day.

It might seem hard to do, but they can help you through this. <br>  You were careless and put yourself in a position that could ultimately leave you with some pretty tough decisions to make. <br>  Unfortunately because of your age and limited resources you will not be able to handle this situation alone and your parents will be the best resource you have.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Yes there is such thing as precum and yea it can get you pregnant. When ever you have sex you can get pregnant. I know that sounds cliche but it's so true. I was in birth control and got pregnant. As for your boyfriend, if he is willing to fool around with you and not accept the consequences then he needs to grow up or abstain from actions that can cause pregnancy. Speaking from experience, my boyfriend was much older than your boyfriend and once he found out I was pregnant; he left me. He thought I would have an abortion because he thought that cared more about him, but he knew my position on abortion, and a baby does not ask to be conceived. It was my job to protect her. You need to take a test and find out. Once you do that, I would tell my parents first especially if you think that your boyfriend will not be supportive, that way you have a support system when he starts to treat you bad, if he does.

Saddest of all, some moms and dads think that total weaning from breastfeeding is the best way to get more sleep. They choose not to look into nighttime weaning as a good option instead.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  I have a better alternative to completely weaning or to letting the baby cry it out. Babies wake up for the optimal interaction with their moms, breastfeeding back to sleep. If we offer them a little less than that for a few nights and then a little less and still less in the ensuing nights, gentle behavior modification will lead them to realize that it might not be "worth it" to knock on the door of a closed restaurant, so to speak.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend any forced sleep changes during the first year of life. Probably the only exception to this would be an emergency involving a nursing mom's health. There are many suggestions in books and magazines for pushing "sleeping through the night" during a baby's early months or during the first year. I don't think this is the best thing to do and I am quite sure that the earlier a baby gets "non-response" from parents, the more likely he is to close down at least a little.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong. I love the family bed, child-led weaning and cuddling all through the first, second, third year or more  if it's working well and if the family is doing well. Don't let  anyone convince you that this is a harmful choice or that there will be "no way" to get him out of your bed if you don't do it now. Don't believe anyone who says that babies who cuddle and nurse all night long "never" learn to self soothe or become independent. This is simply  not true but it sells books and the myths stay in our culture.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/sleepstudies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...</a><br>  Armstrong KL, Quinn RA & Dadds MR. The sleep patterns of normal children.<br>  Medical Journal of Australia 1994 Aug 1;161(3):202-6.<br>  <br>  The above study is the definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.<br>  <br>  What did they find?<br>  <br>      * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.<br>      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.<br>      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.<br>      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).<br>      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.<br>      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.<br>      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.<br>  <br>  Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than one month.<br>  <br>   <br>  Scher A. A longitudinal study of night waking in the first year.<br>  Child Care Health Dev 1991 Sep-Oct;17(5):295-302.<br>  <br>  Abstract: A longitudinal study of the development of sleep patterns addressed the issue of continuity and change in night waking in the course of the first year. Mothers of 118 infants, who took part in a follow-up study of normal babies, completed a sleep questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Regular night waking was a common characteristic throughout the first year:<br>  Baby's age<br>   <br>  % babies waking at night<br>  3 months<br>   <br>  46%<br>  6 months<br>   <br>  39%<br>  9 months<br>   <br>  58%<br>  12 months<br>   <br>  55%<br>  <br>  The number of awakenings per night was a function of age. Following a decline in the number of interruptions from 3 to 6 months, an increase in night waking at age 9 months was recorded. Although the methodology does not lend itself to an objective validation of the changes in sleep-wake states, nor is it suitable for causal explanations, it is, nevertheless, important to note this profile. The increase in night waking towards the end of the first year coincides with significant socio-emotional advances which characterize this developmental stage.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	the doctor is right you need to let your daughter cry this out,just make sure her tummy is full before she goes to sleep cereal always fills them up and the some breast milk or formula and put her down, and if she wakes up just let her cry it may take awhile,even several days but she will go to sleep on her own,and don't bring her in your bed anymore

I never get to go on thursdays. its probably a pair of undies or a mini lip gloss.
y5sWmbtnaa	NORMAL!!! And yes very painful... its round ligament pain, pain of the uterine ligaments stretching! Congratulations BTW<br>  <br>  Check about the spotting with your doc, seems a little bit late to be having spotting.|`|4jW9rERFaa	If your spotting is a light pink don't worry much. If it is a dark color go to the emergency room or make an appointment to go in today or tomorrow. No idea what the muscle spasm could be other than just a muscle spasm.|`|f2Le6bKZaa	its probably still stretching known as round ligament pains. you can have those in different places not just your uterus.|`|AA12259102	Tell your doctor. Everyone is different and I have heard of women spotting for several weeks and I had cramps all the way through my first pregnancy.
df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	If I have a day off and want to spend it with my children. Why should my wife get upset. If my children and I have a good time then it will be positive memories for me and them. It will allow them to love me and they will be happier and better off for it in the long run. It is rare that I ever get to spend time with my kids. I should be allowede to mess with routine once in a while. Plus If we only worry about routine and schedule we miss out on a lot in life. therefore it can actually be healthy on occasion. to mess with routine.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My husband definitely screws up the routine when he's home, but I really don't care. That's his time with the kids, he can do things the way he wants. It's not hard for us to get back on routine after one day of being off. I don't mind at all.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	If he has a day off, she is still in school on the most part, so no|`|nmu6coapaa	Aw yea! But what drives me mad is I spend 2 hours trying to get my son to sleep and dad comes in and wants to play with him! Grrrrr!|`|AA10953561	He does a little of both. He'll take over handling our daughter for the day, but he lets her get away with just about everything! She wants a snack at lunch time instead of a healthy meal? He lets her. She wants to watch two hours of TV when the rule is no more than an hour a day? Okay! I've been getting after him about it, so he is trying to remember the rules and why we have the rules. It used to be that he'd let her stay up an hour or more past her bed time. Now he's generally pretty good about making sure she's in bed no more than half an hour late. I can deal with that. <br>  <br>  So he is getting better, and I shouldn't complain. As long as I'm there to remind him that it's time for dinner or time for bath or time to do something other than sit in front of the TV things go pretty smoothly.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Yes, he puts a wrench in the entire routine of  the house. He sees a day off as it meaning all of us should hang in our PJ's on the couch doing nothing. In a perfect world, that would be great...but who is going to make dinner, laundry, change the baby, feed the baby, etc.<br>  <br>  He just doesn't get it.|`|vRodocjcaa	Oh my gosh yes the day falls apart when my husband is home. Routines are blown to the wind, my son's behavior changes because Daddy lets him run wild, and everything is in general, chaos. Makes me a little annoyed ;)|`|GU3RauKOaa	YES he messes everything up including the whole house. it looks like a hurricaine after his days off.<br>  <br>  But he does occasionally take the baby so I have time to relax and he cooks for me too, lol... so its worth it.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	My kids are older so don't have a routine as such. He does odd things though such as making mince sandwiches!! The kids like them but I bet they wouldn't eat them if I gave them to them! Mind you I'dnever think about putting mince in a sarnie!!|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Yep! But, the kids love it! :)|`|bVkIEpyGaa	It takes your partner a whole day? My husband can recreate a civil war in the time it takes me to do a weekly shop!|`|e22ae614e89bdf91f720595fcc752bd9aa	definately messes up the routine but that can be a good thing - means we all get a break from the norm, sometimes its a bad thing though and it really riles me up|`|q84KT11saa	My kids are very flexible, they adapt to change very well.  They are 1 and 3 years old.  They are fairly good at reminding daddy when its time for naps, and meals/snacks.  Even though it looks like a tornado hit the house afterward, the kids have fun and that's what matters.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	When I came home from France for a week for a business trip, I wasn’t happy to see that my son’s bedtime had gotten later, he’d gotten into the habit of sleeping in our bed, and he was back to using his pacifier ALL day and ALL night at 2 yrs old. Not happy at all….<br>  <br>  I have another trip coming up next week for 3 days. And well, I’m worried for that too. But a girl has to make money to keep food on the table so unfortunately, there’s nothing I can do about it.<br>  <br>  So that'd be the first answer for me.<br>  <br>  ** ADD **  <br>  My opinion but you don’t miss out on anything for having a routine! We wake up each morning and have a sit down breakfast while we watch cartoons or while I read my son a book. That’s quality bonding time. I LOVE my breakfast’s with my son. After daycare we get the dogs together and go for a long walk. My son looks forward to this because we see animals, pick up pinecones, see other dogs, visit the playground. We talk about his day at daycare and if they painted or read books, etc. After our walk we have dinner together and then it’s bathtime which is always fun! And the best part – cuddling up before bed with a story and hugs and kisses!<br>  <br>  It’s all routine but with flexibility. And the keeping routine is important but it doesn’t mean you have to take the fun out!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	when my husband has the day off it is just like another child at home.  My kids are very versatile, not much messes up their schedules.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I don't know how we figured this one out but my son loves getting hit with a pillow. I have this small down pillow that if you lightly toss it to him and it hits him any where on his body he just smiles and laughes and wants you to do it again. He also loves ceiling fans and the bath tub as well. He also loves the sink faucet. You can roll up his sleeves and turn on the faucet and hold him, he will play in it for as long as you let him.|`|lGcpXteaaa	My daughter loves pinging the door stoppers! She could really sit there and play for hours and she just cracks up laughing when it goes 'ping'!<br>  <br>  The weirdest most random thing that makes her crack up is if you give her an open mouth smile. She sees you and just really laughs and opens her mouth herself.<br>  haha its so funny :D|`|heDtLdz5aa	aww that is all cute...the other day we had evan out at the play area in the mall and this little boy i would say about 2 years old was real wild and banging his head off of the mats they have there..evan thought it was the funniest thing...is laugh was so hard and uncontrollable...i just hope he doesn't try to be a crazy little man like the other little boy...he he|`|EeGgovyCaa	Mine also love ceiling fans. also balloons and anything electronic like cell phone or ipod.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Seeing his daddy, watching our little dog "lucy", taking a bath, if I come around the corner and say "I see you" he goes crazy, Watching his brother and sister. I love to see him smile it makes my heart melt.<br>  Edit: almost forgot, its funny but every time he sees his blanket he smiles.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Ceiling fans here too! lol, it cracks me up. She grabs glasses off of every ones face that has them and they instantly go in her mouth.<br>  <br>  She has a really big habit of staring at babies. I mean to the point of being rude if she weren't a baby. lol. It makes me laugh so hard|`|FUOLr64jaa	Last night it was the people singing on American Idol.... He was almost asleep and then they started singing and he sat up and started jamming with them......|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter loves my pillow. I don't know why, but she'll lay and stare at it for aaages, plus she flaps her arms, kicks her legs and smiles away at it. This morning though, she was laying against my wall (which is covered in pictures of her) and she was staring at my wall - directly at a picture of her in a Tigger costume and she started kicking her legs and smiling, it was so cute! (Okay so I know she probably wasn't focusing on the picture but i'm pretending she was :])|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My belching.  It's gotten so that burps I would normally hold in I now let rip because he gets such a kick out of it.<br>  <br>  Any small blue LED light (must be blue, for some reason) like the one on the front of the CPU, or the one that comes up on my laptop when the battery is being charged.<br>  <br>  One of my tattoos, just a specific one.  He smiles and laughs and then tries to scrape it off with his fingernails.
HvALvdc7aa	Yeah I had the same thing happen. It was just to early to really see anything and to early for a heartbeat. Went back 2 weeks later and there she was. Her heart was beating away. She's now 3 months old. Good Luck to you!!!|`|8a46cf985d12bfcd9a6c364a7844b9a6aa	I have been thru this 3 times now. All 3 times I miscarried.<br>  HOWEVER, my girlfriend had the same thing, and she had an etopic pregnancy with a twin. She had the twin in her tube removed and went on to have a healthy baby boy that was in her uterus<br>  <br>  Lots of things could be happening, and I wish you the best|`|8N4aPcpaaa	I think you should be fine if you still have all the symptoms and hcg levels are doubling they cant double with no baby 7wks is around the time they first start seein the heartbeat when i went for my 7wk ultrasound we did see the heartbeat it was so lil though so maybe it was just a lil to early i wish you and your baby the best..!|`|BcdbR6iSaa	<a href="http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/</a><br>  This is a really good site to read stories and talk to other women who have had similar experiences! Sometimes when the doctors tell you you're misscarring, they're wrong.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|zRQmWC5saa	I think u had a misscarriage . a friend of mine did the same. good luck . I hope im wrong.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I am not sure...i wish you luck!|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Honestly, I had this same thing happen to me. Finally at 8 1/2 weeks the doctor decided to order a DNC be done. I know it is heart breaking news, but at least there is not a young one inside that had formed and you lost. They call this an ectopic pregnancy. It is where your body preforms as being pregnant but actually your not and yes even HCG levels rise and eventually go down. I wish you the best of luck! Hang in there it could actually be a viable pregnancy after all.|`|68lLAQnKaa	well pray for a healthy baby!  It could have been a mistake at the er, sometimes they can't find the heartbeat because they are looking in the wrong spot.  I'll be praying things turn out for good! Blessings|`|znFhFieLaa	I have heard of this happening, I bet you arnt as far along as you thought, thats why they didnt pick up the heartbeat. Good luck.|`|HKAYbIo8aa	Wow, that is a tough one.  I, too, wish you all the best!  I hope it turns out for the good!
rOfFOcwpaa	Don't worry about it, there's nothing wrong with you. you've never had a real boyfriend because 95% of boyfriends aren't real. I think it's empowering when you don't need a boyfriend to be happy.|`|ameJkDgpaa	I feel the same way because almost everybody i know has had a boyfriend when they were like in third grade( i am 12) but i just think that it is a good thing because now a days "most" not all but "most" boys want only one thing and that is sex so if you don't have a boyfriend that isn't a bad thing it's actually a good thing|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	No need to worry. There are a ton of people who are like that. There's nothing wrong with you. The right guy will come at the right time, you just have to wait and see what happens.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	there is nothing wrong with you! you might just need to go out a little more associate with people more.|`|um8IIEn8aa	EVERYTHING!|`|GGH0HVdvaa	You don't need to do or feel any certain way about anything just because others are or tell you to. If you don't really feel the need to have a boyfriend, well then there's no reason to break your neck to run out and find one. It's not weird that you don't have a bf. You'll probably have many in the future but at this moment it's not all that necessary for you, and that's fine.|`|BLEYaodFaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with you.  At 17 you shouldn't even be worrying about having one.  Kick back and enjoy these years of your life, you will not be able to relive them, and you definitely don't want to look back on these years with regret.  <br>  I think that is wonderful that you are happy being with you.  Good for you.  Keep it that way, and live your life to the fullest.  When the time is right you will have a boyfriend.
57c8048751bb6dd1a49dc351791d9b29aa	I asked my doctor this same thing!  I was really freaking out because my little girl will move like this and I was worried.  He said that seizures in utero are very rare.  It could be a number of things, including your uterus (which is a muscle) having a spasm.  But, I think that because so many people have this happen, it is very normal and probably nothing to worry about.|`|MUEsS8tYaa	My baby is due May 25th, and I've had lots of weird feelings and sensations. Lol. Sometimes he'll go crazy, like he's hyped up on caffeine, and he'll make my insides sore! Seriously, it feels like he's kickboxing in there! Or he'll dig his feet or elbows or something up under my ribs so I can't breathe. Its probably nothing to worry about, but you could mention it at your next appointment, just in case. I'm new at this too, and I feels like I'm constantly asking questions, probably driving my doctor insane. But I always want to make sure everything is going perfectly. :) Good luck with your baby!!!!!!|`|mjd1qjy7aa	This is an awesome experience. My daughter did this after I eat or whenever she feels like playing. It is normal.|`|1kLCl7snaa	Its normal, all 4 of my kids did that. ALL the time.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i am same as you about 30 weeks my boy goes nuts hehe my girl did to and she is now 21 months ,, she is climbing on the table again|`|HYGPyxAHaa	I am 29 weeks and This is really weird. For a few days I didnt think my baby was moving enough. Then last night she went crazy! moving and rolling all over the place. <br>  So I think since we close in dates that this is just to be expected and all should be okay. I have read that a baby can have seizure inside the womb but I really dont  think that is what is going on. If it happens all the time and in patterns you could call your doc. But I worry about everything and I am really not worried I just love feeling the baby move|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I hope it's normal, cause my little guy does the same thing!!! Sometimes I can just picture him freaking out in there, wishing he was free and just flailing his arms and legs all about... It feels pretty crazy, and looks really funny from the outside... And it usually happens after he rolls around a bunch too--I'm thinking he's trying to get comfy but can't cause he needs more space so he flips out, out of frustration... haha... It's just a theory but it makes me laugh when he does it now... <br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure it's normal, most of my friends with children have described the same feelings... <br>  <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy and good luck!!|`|dCLnLlsCaa	It's normal, it happened all the time with my daughter and now its happening with my son too.  Not sure exactly what they're doing but it is normal, haha.|`|1025679c26c10bafb22778153af1d2a8aa	Happened with both my pregnancies. I was wondering the same thing  yesterday when mine started going crazy.|`|AA10230627	both my girls did it and my third baby is doing it as well. they just like to let you know they're there
qSmCA82Aaa	Hey!  I have a Blackberry Curve!  Do you get on YA on it? lol!<br>  <br>  My daughter is 7 and alot of her friends have a phone and it blows my mind!  I don't see the point - she is either in school, at  my moms or at home.    Now we do have a spare phone that she does take with her when she goes to her dad to stay the night but that is just so that she can call if needed.  I would never let her take it anyother time and certainly not a touch screen one!   I actually know a girl that bought her 2 year old son the Ipod touch phone!  Now that is just freakin ridiculous!|`|zJamClb2aa	My oldest is turning 5 in May and we have decided that as soon as he starts going to friends houses he will have one. For 2 reasons, one it will have GPS in it so we can be sure he is where he says he is, and two in case he something happens and he needs us to come get him but doesn't feel comfortable asking to use their phone. He wont be chatting on it just to chat tho.... oh and it will be like a disney kid phone not a touch screen lol I dont even have one of those lol|`|8SjoUQmEaa	There is absolutely no reason for a child to have a cell phone until they will be going places without full adult supervision, which usually isn't until at least middle school, and even then they should only get a very basic phone. A 7 year old with a blackberry is just ridiculous in my opinion, who is she going to call on it? Her mom while in a different room? Jeez, people these days. -_-|`|6CCti42qaa	An appropriate age would be when you start dropping them off at places alone.<br>  Which, in my case, was at age 10. Because once my mom dropped me off at swim practice, and I was waiting for 1 1/2 hours out in the cold because it was cancelled.<br>  <br>  Now that phone was used STRICTLY if I had to contact my mom in an emergency, or vise versa. It was a simple phone, a samsung flip phone. No front screen with a clock, no camera, no touch screen, a regular keypad, a plain, silver, phone. I was not allowed text messaging, or just calls to friends.<br>  <br>  The first time I got a nice phone that I was allowed to text/call friends on was the christmas in grade 8. So I was 13. It was the only thing I asked for and I pay for the bills with the money I get from babysitting :)|`|XPnCeJ29aa	When they can pay for it, or if their lifestyle would be safer with one.<br>  Such as the child plays sports on a traveling team, when they take the bus to the games, I would like my son to have a phone with him for emergencies.<br>  I cant say a definite age, more of when there would be a use for one..|`|MI53mUKzaa	all three of my children have trac phones for when they are over at a friends house and or they go to town with friends.  that way i can check up on them or they can call me any time they want to.<br>  <br>  <br>  my children are 7, 9, and 11.<br>  <br>  <br>  but their phones are prepaid.|`|0nrMOm7Yaa	I got one 5 yrs ago when I was 10 but now I only use it for likes rides home and stuff. I'd rather spend my money one something other than phone credit when I can just talk to my friends the next day at school.|`|AA11612508	7 is stupid. my daughters will get one around ten i think. atleast by 12 ithink thats a good age. plus its right at middle school.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my children age 7, going on 9, and 10 all have phones. Why, they are honor students and for that they got a prepaid verizon phone. GPS tracking is a wonderful thing to have on your child's person or processions now a days.|`|POHWTDPRaa	My daughter can have her own cell phone when she can pay for her own cell phone. So I say 16. Until then if she is going to be out someplace where a phone is not available she will take one of ours with her.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	My son isn't old enough to have to worry about this yet, but right now, I'm thinking that as soon as he get old enough to go places by himself then I'll probably get him a phone.  I'm guessing about 10-ish.  But, I know it would NOT be a fancy one.  Heck, I don't even have a blackberry!  There's no way my 7 year old is going to get one lol!<br>  <br>  I think its just silly how young kids get cell phone these days.  My niece has 2 girls in her class who have had their own cell phones since they were in preschool!  I couldn't believe when I saw a 4-year-old walking around with a Motorola Razor (that was 4 years ago and that the popular phone at the time).  Now, at 8 these girls have Blackberries!|`|rpsXPdFmaa	My daughter would have been six next month and believe me there would be no cell phones as presents.  I'd say a teen at least.  There were several instances on grade school field trips where kids would lose a camera or lose a cd player or a GameBoy or something like that.  Even if a seven year old is smart enough to program a cell phone and figure them out doesn't mean they won't be absent-minded enough to lose one.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I gave my son one in 9th grade when he started to need one for rides and keep me informed of his movements. I plan on getting my daughter on when she stats house jumping and will need rides and stuff at different times. Probably 7th or 8th grade I hope.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Right now I would say my kid can have a cell phone when he's 14 and has a job. But he's only 8 months old now, so who knows if things will change by the time he's 14.
cYRZpGkqaa	You should probably call the doctor just to be sure. It's better to be safe than sorry.|`|NE96fU9vaa	i had a hard time figuring out what you were talking about, did your son have a circumcision?<br>  <br>  keep it as dry as possible, keep the poop off it, it is an open sore. treat it like a wound, it is painful to him. if you see puss, there may be an infection, call youre doctor
AA11540024	you can go to www.gerber.com for all the questions you have on feeding.<br>  I feed my 6 months old solids mixed with cereal and about an hour later she wants a bottle. The food is for texture to get them ready for solid foods later on. So it's normal that he drinks formula after he eats solids. Your doing just fine in what you are doing. He will let you know when he is full.|`|zwctZ812aa	Solids shouldn't be replacing a bottle at this stage.  Give him a bottle first and then offer some solids.  The formula needs to be his main source of nutrition...the solids are just to get him used to the idea of eating food.

YFhNHzI9aa	NOT AT ALL! Please don't feel bad.  You have to take care of yourself.  Not only are you taking care of your own body, you are the lifeline of that little baby inside you.  If you can't breathe, your body isn't functioning properly, therefore your baby could be feeling the affects as well.  He should love and care for you and know that your health and the baby's is the most important right now.  Missing a few hours of sleep to ensure your health and safety is nothing! And you are right...just wait til the baby comes! lol!  I hope everything goes well at the doctor for you.  Good luck with your new little one.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I wouldn't feel bad asking my child's father to help me, but suggest getting a car as soon as you can afford one.  You don't want to be stuck in the house all night while he is working.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	no he should want to make sure you and the baby are ok. I understand how you feel though i hated waking up my guy who worked from 3pm-2am depending on the day sometimes he wouldn't get back until even later (so we just tried to schedule things on his off day). But he shouldn't really mind as long as its not 'hey wake up and watch this show with me'. if your hurt he should be there to help. Can you drive yourself sometimes? I mean if you feel bad but not like i'm in labor or gonna die pain couldn't you just drive yourself some of the times?|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	No, you have a medical emergency.  If you were waking him up to take you to a shoe sale, then you'd be wrong.  But not because you have to seek medical help!|`|68c6B8dRaa	"should I feel bad for making him take me all these places we live 40 min from my doctor??"<br>  <br>  No, but at this point you might want to get a good book on pregnancy and see if you can't do a little reading to ease your mind, and cut down on your ER visits. You went to the ER because you tripped and fell? What did you expect would happen there? You can "hardly breathe" and want to go to the ER -- but not immediately? These things are not emergencies; hyper down, kiddo.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	i would but i would feel even WORSE if something were to happen to my baby!!!! he shouldn't even care of feel cranky! my bf doesn't care what he's doing when I was pregant and told him i didn't feel well he'd say lets go to the doctor rigth away and not that the baby is here he is RIGHT there if something is wrong with our baby even a cough get him really worried. so no don't feel bad it's his job|`|ykP7I3caaa	He got you pregnant, he's the dad and you're his girlfriend.. Don't feel bad. In some cases he may think you're just being paranoid but so what..? If you can't breathe is not being paranoid it's an immediate concern.|`|rAkWoweOaa	No way, don't feel bad.

TAKE CARE.|`|zqfs7A6Caa	Don't panic. If she consumed a lot of toothpaste, there is a number on the back of the tube for poison control. They will know what you should do. There is no reason to take her to the ER unless they tell you to. If it was just a little bit of paste (like what you would brush your teeth with), then don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  Flouride can be poisonous, but toothpaste only contains small amounts. Like many things, flouride is only dangerous in large quantities.|`|RdfPFIOoaa	When I was a child, I used to eat toothpaste all the time because I thought it tasted good, lol. I don't think it will hurt her to eat toothpaste but I know that if she swallows mouthwash than you should take her to the emergency room immediately.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Did you check the toothpaste? Is there very much gone? If there is only a little gone i wouldn't worry too much, if the bottle is empty and you don't see it on the floor or smeared around anywhere then I might go ahead and take her in. Don't feel like a bad mother, these things happen to everyone. <br>  Just a suggestion though, maybe instead of childproofing everything you should teach her what not to play with. I know we have never babies my 3 year old like that and he would never even think of getting into anything that he isn't supposed to. I mean, having nothing in the bottom drawers seems excessive. I would think that is only necessary for 1 year olds.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Take a deep breath. She is fine. How much did she eat? Is the whole tube gone, or just a little like she was trying to brush her teeth?<br>  My kids have eaten a wide range of things, including toothpaste and the worst that has ever happened was a stomach ache. Keep an eye on her, she should be just fine.
F6lZHRkVaa	I would get a scheduled c-section. Just in case. C-sections are hard (I had one) but I'd be willing to do it if it's the best thing for my baby.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	If it was me I would do a c-section.  Why put yourself through another natural birth when chances are you will end up doing another c-section. I would rather avoid labor and just get my baby sooner. She has had a c-section once so why not again.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Oh heck no if I knew it was going to be so difficult then I would take the c-section you could probably mess something up and possibly never get pregnant again.|`|T48smu01aa	I would get a scheduled C-section for sure I would not want to put me and my baby at risk for anything!|`|cypZ0ykXaa	good luck to her|`|4jW9rERFaa	I would just let her decide. Maybe she will later decide that a cesarean is a better option. Just as every pregnancy is different, every labor is different as well.  With her being over weight I know a 400pound morbidly obese girl my age who had a completely normal pregnancy and a vaginal delievery after several miscarriages. Also I am not not clear on what you are saying.. does your sister have a baby already? or was she delivering the one that passed away? Oh and if it were me I would go with the c-section. I try to be as safe as I need to be and go with what the doctors recommend, but your sister does have a choice in this so its probably not too bad. If in labor and something goes wrong she'll have an emergency c section anyways. Don't worry too much!|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I would get a c-section especially if the baby's life is at risk.  I had a c-section and to be honest it is not as bad as I thought it was going be.  If she wants to go ahead with a natural birth she could but if she going to be in the same predicament as she was last time (small cervix) then I would think a c-section is her only option.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	After being through all of that, I would definitely go ahead with the scheduled c-section. There is no way I could emotionally handle the risks that would go along with trying to have the baby vaginally, If something were to happen to the baby, I would never forgive myself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to her, and your family, I hope everything goes smoothly for both of you and your babies.|`|AA11542929	she should go threw with a cesarean because of the fact that she is not only going to risk her life she is riskiing the babys too.. one will end up passing.. sorry to sound rude about it but thats how it is.. and natural birth after a cesearan is not good cause u can tear ur uterus where the cut is from the previous cesarean.. i dont think she wants to risk her life or the babys..|`|wWkfASTNaa	I would do what the doctor thought was best for the baby. if a cesarean is safer for me and baby, thats what I will be doing. But if he gives no reason for me to do a cesarean, then I would prefer natural birth.|`|vewYW4wcaa	Yes! its major surgery, but could also mean risking your babies health.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I would do the c-section only because they obviously know how risky it is for her to give birth naturally. It could really cause some more health problems. Good luck to her!|`|zRQmWC5saa	I think knowing all of that I would most deff go for the scheduled Cesarean !|`|0acF0y1Jaa	I would do what's best for my baby! I wouldn't want to take any chances!
GGH0HVdvaa	It means you had a crazy @$$ dream.... we all have them.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	1.  HAHA!!! it means you're eating too much sugar before bed!  and Having weird dreams.  <br>  <br>  2.  Haha... I think you'd wake up to a turkey baster being shoved in your Hoo Hoo<br>  <br>  3.  You think Obama is a hot piece of man meat!<br>  <br>  4.  You think Michelle Obama is scary!<br>  <br>  5.  You're a good person for choosing not to have your bastard child aborted... show's a lot of good character!  Also, you want your child to go to college so that is FANtastic too!<br>  <br>  6.... Quit eating crazy stuff before bed!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	haha it means nothing lol it's funny though. this person though that's a psychic i talk to tells me your dreams mean the opposite it probably means that that b*tch you hate wont ever do anything stupid like that to you|`|H0sPCJQPaa	It means your Crazy!<br>  <br>  No, Just kidding. Its just a dream. Probably doesn't mean anything.<br>  But honeslty. That made me laugh.|`|RLtzqQB9aa	weird dream iniit bluudd|`|wnkfYGoVaa	Haha, it doesn't mean anything. I'd go with option number 2, by the way. :p<br>  <br>  I have a friend who has really crazy and oddly specific dreams like that. She actually just texted me and said last night she dreamed she went to the store and bough 4 avocados and they cost $125. Weird dreams are fun. :p|`|um8IIEn8aa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br>  OH ****!<br>  YOUR GUNNA DIE!|`|E5NKN09Zaa	its just a weird dream don't pay much attention to it  a dream is just a dream and everyone has weird crazy dreams|`|0iAGnjFvaa	lol i dont think it  means anything... last night i had a dream i peed on someone whose pet viper bit my hands and killed me.... lol
VKQzj4Pmaa	That is wonderful. I think that when a child has a disability, it is easy for the parents, teacher, or peers to excuse her from excelling. It's easy not to think, "My blind child can become a great reader!" Or if a blind child does not do their best in reading, I would think it would be easy for a teacher to look past it, opposed to a child who could see.<br>  <br>  It's important to expect and encourage great things in children with disabilities. They may not be able to achieve goals the same way, but they certainly can become great in many ways, as they are full of just as much potential.|`|QveBSjFSaa	I MUST agree.|`|nfzQkvqraa	It's nice to hear something positive like that.  Too much negative on here.  Thanks for making me smile.
y6g0RnuAaa	When I first saw that commercial I thought- Wow, that's pretty cool. I think that is the intent of all infomercials though to make you feel like you have to have it. I completely agree with you and I don't want to rush my LO. I would rather read to him and play than plop him in front of the TV (not that we don't watch Handy Manny or Yo Gabba Gabba.)  Kids learn better through play anyways.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	my sister learned to read a high level by herself back in the 80's without this magic system at the age of 3... i think its very possible to teach a child to read and i definitely think that a parent should encourage their child to learn as much as possible including reading and the earlier the better.. but i dont think that one needs to pay out money for a system like this when you can easily do it yourself through patience and effort from the parents.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My pediatrician recommended those, but we haven't looked into it at all.<br>  <br>  I totally understand what you're saying, makes sense to me. But I also look at the children who are prodigies and go on to be major successes in life. They usually have parents who push them hard to learn as early as possible. So I don't have a problem with it either way. If parents want to get these programs, go for it.|`|jLYTKr33aa	I agree with you.  Furthermore, I don't rely on TV, even "educational" programs, to educate my son.  He learned to read at a very early age because HE was ready, and through parental interaction.|`|o2tPN5Geaa	I don't see any problem with it.  If the child is functionally able to read at such an early age why should you hold them back.  It isn't a matter of forcing it on them, if they are not ready to read they won't.  If they are ready and you don't give them the opportunity you may be slowing down their learning process which could in turn cause some problems in later development.  (No matter how minor they might be.)|`|mO7FOXNYaa	I will say that the first time I saw the commercial - it freaked me out! I don't know why but little babies talking and reading gave me the heeby jeebies - like  little mini robots or something. <br>  <br>  I agree with the other poster who said let babies be babies. If the child is naturally gifted, then they will excel just like every other gifted kid before them.<br>  <br>  That is my personal opinion.<br>  <br>  If other parents have used the program and like the outcome - then power to you! Its just not for me.|`|7OWI3DFraa	I agree. There are other developmental stages a baby should be going through. My "baby" learned to read in kindergarten. I enjoyed the times where only I could read to him and now at the appropriate age, I love that he can read to me.|`|oDlDrjF1aa	i got it for my son befor he was born i started wen he was born and he said his first word 6 months and started reading words and almost 8months now he is 11 months can read and talk perfectly i plan on useing it with my next baby|`|3Psi4kBxaa	It you spend time with your children they learn much faster. ( My Baby Can Read ) is a good way a parent can bond and teach at the exact same time.<br>  Young children only learn from what a parent teaches them. But remember one thing, you can also over do this as well. <br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teracher )|`|hKJIDdVqaa	what works for some will not work for others. My opinion-kids learn a lot in school now. My 5th grader is doing material that I did not do until I was a freshman.  Children have to learn so much so fast.  They will eventually learn to read.  In our state it has to be at the completion of kindergarten that they are able to read.
IDS64Eh8aa	If you get engorged you produce enough, no need for supplementing. He might be crying for a different reason, my daughter was the same way and I ended up using a sling/carrier a lot, she cried because she wanted to be held all the time.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Can you pump at night? You would be building up a "stash" and would be able to offer EBM instead of formula.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I never had that problem the only thing I would suggest is to pump at night when that happens.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Your breasts are never "drained" - absolutely no need to top off with formula.  Milk production actually speeds up while it is is being removed. The fact that you do get engorged shows that you are producing enough milk.  If you continue to top off with formula your supply will dwindle away bit by bit.  Jamie is probably just protesting when the flow slows down after letdown - very normal and babies do learn to adjust.  By then giving him a bottle you are surely going to open yourself up to nipple confusion (eventual refusal of the breast entirely) and no supply.<br>  <br>  BTW, Elyse is 11 months old and I still will get engorged sometimes at night because she sleeps longer than ususal...|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I was a full time working and pumping mom, so my experience isn't quite the same... but I would wake up at night so full of milk after my son started sleeping longer.  I was so happy that he was sleeping, but I was awake!<br>  I actually pumped once a night and saved that milk for daycare.  You don't really have that need, but it doesn't hurt to put some milk in the frig for emergencies.<br>  Also, you and baby will go through different changes throughout his little life.  Once you think you've figured out "this pattern" he'll start a new pattern... haha and then you start all over with trying to find a balance.  Every time you give him formula, you are telling your body "I dont' need milk now."  So you are only continuing the problem.  Your body will never catch up and make more milk when you need it, if you don't let the baby nurse.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Stop topping him up with formula and let him nurse until he is done.  Try breast compressions as he may be frustrated with the slower flow.  Or he may just be fussy in the mornings rather than the evenings and need to cluster feed then.<br>  <br>  Your breasts are NEVER empty, the less milk is in them the faster they produce milk.|`|bO2rzfISaa	How old's the baby? Sounds like he was nursing at night but your body hasn't adjusted to him stopping yet? As the baby gets older all this will resolve. I know it's hard to be patient, but it will resolve.|`|UoONXXLbaa	I had a lot of problems breast feeding.  I took classes and got a lot of help.  First get a really good pump.  When you get let down feed, or pump no matter what time of day.  Store your milk so when you dont have enough you can supplement with the bottle.  You can store frozen breastmilk for 3 months I believe.  Then make sure you drink a lot of fluids.  If you dont have enough in the morning you should drink a ton of water when you wake up.  If you baby is anything like mine then he/she will latch on to anything!  You can also mix breastmilk and formula together.  Call your local WIC office there is a lactation specialist available and they can help out tremendously.|`|TlFnIei0aa	Yes, when i have 2 much i express whats left after the feed for that night.<br>  <br>  to me it sounds like he's not eating enough at night either. my daughter is 4 weeks old and i fill her up right before bed and she sleeps 6-7 hours. If he falls asleep during the feed wake him up and put him back on.|`|iJUDoZgxaa	try pumping at night--if you're engorged you will actually send a message that its too much and you'll produce less milk. Try pumping during the day as well to get the supply up.|`|wqL84O8Naa	how old is your child? if he's sleeping through the night at a young age congrats, but you should be pumping if that's the case
JI7NQ9TNaa	One of my friends had a child that way.<br>  She was convinced that she could be enough a parent to make up for any deficit.<br>  <br>  Then her daughter hit 11, and DEMANDED that she find the father. <br>  The lady spent a lot of money trying to actually get around the anonymity clause. No dice.<br>  <br>  It all looks great on paper...until it doesn't.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	It doesnt matter how good a mother is (frankly im offended by that better mother then most american mothers comment) a person will feel the same regardless. 32. Do you mean this persons parent will literally go to a sperm bank? Or as a derogatory towards a dead beat?  If my mom told me she went to a sperm bank, I would be like why the heck would you do that?? You couldn’t find anyone to make babies with? Unless my mom was a lesbian in which case that answer would be self explanatory. I would be in shock but I really don’t think as an adult I would care too much (except that it would mean I would not EVER have a chance of having a second biological parent). But if its meant in a demeaning way towards the father i think that’s better left unsaid and the mother should simply say I have no clue who your dad is.|`|AA11206135	How would adults on YA feel if we could go one day without seeing questions asked by this unbalanced individual????|`|y6g0RnuAaa	NA|`|cYRZpGkqaa	nope|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I think I would always wonder what, exactly, the role of "father" is then. I would probably not get the concept of "normal families"|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'm guessing I would feel all of the what-if's that come along with not having a father but admire my mother for her choice.
dcd11iUwaa	if you are worried about it express into a bottle and see if that stops the coughing and wheezing.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	mine was the same. i just manually expresssed a bit off before feeding. mine still squrts out like a fountain if she falls off mid feed. i always had one breast that was too eager to please so i pumped that one and kept her on one breast. not always great but hasnt caused me ne probs. he should just get used to it as he gets better at feeding. so long as he is gaining weight. also regarding the gas issue, lily had that too...breathing like crazy whilst feeding, i just gave herr gripe water after to make it easier to get her to burp or fart, only use from 1 month.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	This happens a lot with breastfeeding moms. One solution is to pump a bit before nursing, that might help. Especially since the good milk comes towards the end of a nursing session, it he gets too much of the first milk he might not be making it to the end. So go ahead and pump for a minute or two before putting him on the breast. You can freeze that milk for later.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	i had the same problem and I just expressed some before feeding him that way the flow wasn't too much for him to handle.  After another few weeks I didn't have to do that anymore because my body was used to his intake.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	He may have hit a growth spurt. When my daughter was three weeks, she would become frantically hungry, and she would try to take in too much milk at once. I had a fast letdown myself, and what worked for me was putting my breast on the pump just long enough to get a letdown started. It also pulled my nipple out, so it made it much easier to latch. Breastfeeding also works on a supply-demand basis, so it may take a few days for your body to adjust to his increased demand. Good Luck.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Yes, everything your saying sounds like it is an overactive letdown... and an over supply of milk.<br>  <br>  I had everything you're mentioning and for a couple weeks it was terrible.  I didn't know what was wrong, etc.<br>  <br>  What I had to do was nurse for a minute or two, and once the letdown started, pull him away and let it spray into a cloth and then after a minute, let him latch on again.  It was annoying, messy, and the baby didn't like it, but after awhile I didn't have to do it anymore (once I reduced my over supply.)  But at first, it is the best solution.<br>  <br>  Then I would let my son feed entirely on one breast.  That was more than enough for him, and he got both types of milk.  (Yes the gas issue happened with my son too.)<br>  <br>  Then, after he nursed fully on one side I'd put him down and I'd pump, just for a minute or so one the second breast to release pressure, but not enough to make my body think I needed more milk.  So eventually my body got the hint that I didn't need as much milk.  In a couple weeks I didn't have to do the pull away thing anymore.  But I always ended up feeding on one breast alone.<br>  <br>  Sometimes this lead to my breasts being mismatched in size... not drastically, but obviously one was full and the other was not.<br>  <br>  If you are a working mom, this actually is a good thing, becuase I could pump the second breast and save that for later.<br>  <br>  My son did get a little bit better at the over active let down... but I also tried to prop him upright more too.  Laying down was hard because he couldn't breathe and drink at the same time... so have him sit up a bit more andthat will help too.<br>  <br>  Email me if you want more details.  :)|`|6VbNJOtfaa	It probably is.  You need to sit back all the way when you are feeding him, this is supposed to slow down the flow of the milk.<br>  <br>  All babies are really gassy, but swallowing air does not help.  If he is gulping when being fed- the milk is coming out too fast.  You need to burp him for as long as it takes.  My son would be burped for what seemed like hours before one actually came out.|`|XD42367paa	Not to scare you, but rather to make you a bit more aware, my son had lots of trouble eating, I felt like I was literally drowning him and he couldn't keep up, coughing, choking, etc. <br>  <br>  He ended up having a congenital heart defect and the fact that he couldn't keep up was an indication of poor breathing and poor oxygenization of his blood. At three weeks, your body should have adjusted and he shouldn't be having any problems with milk that is at a fast drip from you. <br>  <br>  Knowing what I know now, and knowing that congenital heart defects affect 1 baby out of 115 to 150, and are the most common birth defect there is, I would seriously take him to be evaluated for a CHD....especially if he is a bit pale or discolored around his mouth, nose, and eyes. <br>  <br>  And don't let the lack of hearing a heart murmer calm you. My son had no heart murmer at all. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YFhNHzI9aa	Well I nursed my daughter for 15 months so that and all the baby books I read are my knowledge on this, but....I would say that once he begins to nurse and your milk lets down cover it with a nursing pad and let it flow on there for a while.  It really could be that it is coming out too fast and hard for the little guy at first.  You might try to stop more often and try burping.  There are plenty of different techniques, as I am sure you know, to burping...try them all! :D one will work.  If you think your problem is too much milk, too fast, then my advice about letting some drain out first should help.  If he is still very gassy, try the Gas Relief Drops from your local pharmacy or consult your pediatrician. Also, take a deep breath and relax.  I am sure you are a great mom and he is new to this whole nursing thing...maybe all he needs is a little more practice! I hope everything gets better for you!
f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	I used mine everyday from 10w on and my baby is fine. Go ahead and use it. It's the best sound in the WORLD!|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Probably is safe but I would not over do it.  I do agree with Toy because it does make people paranoid.  I use to work for a doctor and use to get out the stethoscope at every chance so I could to listen to my twins heartbeats and sometimes I could not hear them and I would start to panic thinking something had happen to them.  I could not relax until my next ultrasound (thankfully I had weekly ultrasounds).|`|6cwJi5kxaa	Yes it is safe. Its just like a stethoscope. Just better. The only downfall is that there will be times you may not hear the babys heartbeat and get scared. But thats okay. It just might be nerve racking.|`|bqFk1du8aa	Personally,I wouldn't use it at all.  It seems to make people paranoid.  Save yourself the worry and send it back.  Congrats with the pregnancy though!|`|VSWl45cKaa	There is a good overview of the subject here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.meditech.cn/meditech-edu/Fetal_doppler.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditech.cn/meditech-edu/Feta...</a>|`|S4pNsW3Taa	If it's FDA approved it's perfectly safe especially since you got it from your Doctor's office
Rhr1umV1aa	Yes. Some men love the way a pregnant woman looks. Some women get that "beautiful pregnancy glow" some get the dreadful pimple face and such. Just knowing that there is something inside of you that you two created turns a man on. My husband won't leave me alone and this is our second child. I am 35 weeks pregnant and feel like my belly is out to tim buck two. He reassures me everyday that I am beautiful. Even when they can't tell that you are pregnant or don't know you still have something different about you that makes you more beautiful. Just like when you are a mom, some men fancy that you are feeding your baby or taking care of your child and they think that a mom is the sexiest thing. Don't know why but I like it.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	women have a natural glow when pregnant. Also you produce more hormones when pregnant which can attract men on a subconscious level. Another thing is that some men find it very attractive when a woman is carrying their child.|`|yZkf3zFeaa	Well usually pregnant women have a "glow" about them so they do indeed look prettier. Also some men do have a thing for pregnant women. There is a market for prego porn (ick).|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Is he the father?<br>  alot of men are attracted to pregnant woman , dont know why?|`|oP6G4AXBaa	My husband loved it when I was pregnant =)|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	my man is about the same <br>  i knew a guy tho that when he saw a pregoo gals he got a *****.

I was working in a restaurant while very pregnant with my youngest, and was amazed by how many men made comments like that and hit on me. Way more than when I wasn't pregnant or showing. <br>  Some men really like it, others don't. It's a personal thing. My husband felt the same when I was pregnant with all our children. It's nice to know that someone finds you attractive when you don't feel it.

They believe as the first responser does that homeschoolers like you and me are the exception... We are the *rule*!|`|AA11987492	First off, I would like to say that I was home schooled for my freshmen and sophomore year, and for 6, 7, and 8th grades I went to a TINY Christan school run by our church. It had 30 kids, grades K-12.<br>  <br>  I am not a big fan of homeschooling BECAUSE of socialization, among other things. I get what you are saying, and no doubt, you kids do get to see other kids. However, I am reluctant to call it "socialization". At a public school, the kids are around people of different races, cultures, backgrounds, incomes, personalities,and yes, different BELIEFS. So your kids are around other kids at church, and other kids that home school. They are confined to being around other people who share their beliefs. What happens when they get in the real world and have to work with a hindu or atheist co-worker? How will they handle being around people that are different than what they are used to? How are they going to handle that, because they certainly will not be equipped.<br>  <br>  ETA- If you didn't want to hear my reasons then you shouldn't have asked for them<br>  <br>  ETA2- Yes, I did read the details and I stick to my answer. They may be "exposed" as you put it, to other beliefs, but are they beside them five days a week while living WITH them, not just as an onlooker?|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	I agree with you 100 % !!! <br>  <br>  I am a 14 year old who has been home schooled my whole life and I am SO sick and tired of people asking me stupid questions like "When do you get out?" "Do you have any friends?" "I could never be home schooled because I would get to lonely." <br>  <br>  I agree that people are being quite ignorent when the stereo-type us like that. I go to MANY outings, social events, and am involved in a variety of activities.<br>  <br>  People don't understand that home schooled kids have large support groups and activities that are just for home schoolers. They don't know that we actually have friends who invite us places (not just home schooled friends either). They think we are way too shy to go out and play soccer or something...WELL I'm involved in musical theatre, two dance classes, 4-H, two youth groups, church stuff, and TONS more. I think I'm actually BUSIER than some kids who go to public or private schools. <br>  <br>  Some home schoolers are just shy. I'm not super out-going and I was quite shy when I was younger (although I do have a talkitive side too...) However, some public/private school kids are shy as well!! <br>  <br>  I also hate how people think we are being "under educated" at home. I am actually doing all of the grade 9 requirments for where I live. <br>  <br>  Oh, I am also a christian but I see no problem with socializing with others who are of a differant religion or no religion at all. That is yet another thing people think..home schoolers are all too religious and silly about things. <br>  <br>  My advice is to just ignore rude people and explain to them how do things with your kids. Tell them that you chose home schooling because you feel it fits the needs of YOUR family and you like home schooling better than the public system because _______ (whatever reason (s) you have for home schooling). <br>  <br>  YOU and your kids can actually be a light for home schooling and for what you believe. Several times people are shocked when they find out I'm home schooled because they have gotten impressions of stuck-up or kids who don't make decisions home schoolers in the past. I think that we just need to stick it out and one day people (not everyone but the majority of the human race) will come to accept home schooling as a normal education system. In fact, compared to ten or twenty years ago, they are. <br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	You are great for homeschooling your kids in the way that you are. I went to a public school and loved it and I don't think I would have liked to be home schooled, if it had been an option. <br>  <br>  I think many people look down on homeschooling because not everyone does it the way you do. Many people leave it up to their kids to choose what they want to study and they don't give them as many opportunities to learn through scouts, field trips, etc. I do not look down upon all homeschoolers, just the ones that do not really teach their children. Education is so important and children really need to start learning when they are very young. Some parent's don't teach their children properly and they grow up with a much lower level of education as others their age and they cannot get into decent colleges if they even care to apply. <br>  <br>  Then there are people like you who truly care about their children and want them to succeed. I would never look down on you for what you are doing.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	I think people like to wheel out the "weird un-socio;lized kid" pony because it an easy insult.<br>  I am lucky to have a good school for my kids (20 pupils age 4 -11) and a very sympathetic and forward thinking head teacher BUT when there was talk of closing the school and busing the kids to a HUGE school I said I would home school..no question.<br>  Perversely if I lived in the town ( I live in the country, no public transport and I don't drive so have to wait for husband to drive us places) I would have home schooled because the variety of non-school clubs and activities would have allowed it, in my village there is only school. <br>  I agree that only going to say church based activities could mean a child has little experience of other people but most sports and other clubs have a good ethnic and social mix...saying that though, no one ever suggests taking your kid out of a WASPy private school so they can get a "good mix" in a public school in a bad part of town LOL.<br>  Anyway..if you are happy and your kids are happy and they are at @ the same level of education as school kids, do as you want and ignore everyone else :)
NDU36H4Vaa	The children will feel in a large sense, how you choose to feel about it and also what you teach them to feel about it. <br>  <br>  My mother was a foster child and her parents spoke only Spanish. She only spoke English and they could not communicate. My mother was raised to be angry at her mother for giving her up or having not taken care of her enough to keep her. My mother was also taught to forget about her biological family. When her foster mother died in her seventies, my mother searched for her family. She found out her beloved brother that she remembered as a child died. Her biological parents were also dead as well as several of her natural siblings. It pretty much gave her a nervous breakdown, depression, fibromyalgia, and cancer. However, she pulled through. <br>  <br>  A few years ago I said, 'Mom, your mother chose to birth you, she could have aborted you, you can love her for that." And it brought some healing. Also sometimes if a parent is selfish or a bad example, they are better at a distance. <br>  <br>  My birth father left the state we lived in to live where his new wife's family lived when I was about 8 or so. I lost my father and several younger brothers and sisters. I found them all as a teen and finally my father as an adult. <br>  <br>  I choose to celebrate the good in my birth parents, as both have good and bad. I had step parents too and I choose to take the good with me and incorporate it into my parenting. As well as forgiving the mistakes, big and little, and incorporate that into lessons learned and not to be repeated. <br>  <br>  Before I had my own children, I was involved working with foster care children. I was also a teacher as a special school for troubled youth and in the public schools. Children were healthier & happier when taught to appreciate the good in parents and forgive the bad as well as learning not to repeat the bad. <br>  <br>  A child is part mother and part father. If you put down the father, you are putting down part of the child. If you put down the mother, you are putting down part of the child. The child can feel this, I would advise against this. However, the truth can be told too at the right age & time. And lies should not ever be told because when the children find out you lied about anything, they will not trust you at all. I have a no lying at all about anything policy with my children, not even for fun. Some people think I take it to the extreme; however, I have talked to many parents upset because their children won't believe in God becaue they found out that Santa Claus and the Toothfairy were lies. <br>  <br>  The best tool I found for working with foster children was building them a positive book about their missing parents or family. All truthful and positive. If something is not nice, I would not include it. So with that said, pictures of the parents smiling. Interests that the parent had like science or math. Maybe some stories about the parent that are positive that you know. <br>  <br>  And of course, the most powerful thing is prayer. You can pray for the father. You can pray and stand in faith that he will regret his decision and will turn things around, whether that means writing or child support or whatever. I know that child support is important but it is more important for a child to feel loved and if that means they get a birthday card from day even if dad does not pay child support, that will help them feel loved & go in the album. If the child can write the grandparents that is good too. I had my father's parents after he moved and they were wonderful influences on me. <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget who our president is and his background with a father in Kenya who, I believe, was not involved. Also, Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's was given up for adoption. And also, James Robinson was the product of a rape. Wayne Dyer also given up for adoption. So there are countless examples of people who turned out absolutely amazing with beginings that were not "perfect" or "normal." In fact, had these people mentioned had normal beginings, they would not be the amazing people they are. <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget "life and death are in the power of the tongue" and that is literal. The findings of a scientist on his study of words and water was featured in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know and it is worth watching because they explain it well. So your words and prayers can indeed change things and that movie can show you the power of your words. However, the bible & Jesus taught about it way before science could validate it.

A mother would feel heartbroken. Well most mothers, I don’t know about the one in question, because for a court to only allow supervised visitation means she cant be trusted alone with her child.

I guess that was the age that I started asking questions. It all fell on me like a ton of bricks and it shattered me. I always asked why he wasnt there and felt the whole time that it was my fault. At this point he started to call me..I hated it that my mama made me talk to him but I always blamed everything on her. He would tell me that he was going to come see me and send me money and there was never a letter or a phone call saying that he couldnt make it he just never showed.

The baby will move more if you drink something and then just sit. and the reason why the move so much at night is because you are still, and its their waking time. when you are on the move throughout the day you are bouncing the baby around in there which puts the baby to sleep, when you stop moving aound they are active..|`|yZkf3zFeaa	The tapping, especially if its a lot is usually hiccups.

DvrpBX4saa	I selectively vax my son. My pediatrician isn't very supportive, but he is supportive of other things (like cloth diapering, no rice cereal, extended rear facing over the age of 1 and over 20 lbs, etc) so I don't mind what he says. We don't need to agree on everything to have a good relationship. He simply tells me, "Well <insert disease I will not be vaxing for> is an awful thing to get. If K gets it, he will be miserable." I stand firm by my decision and just smile and nod.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I partially vaccinate.  My pediatrician was supportive, he actually helped me make the final decision to skip certain vaccinations.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Get another pediatrician if you can - you need one who is familiar with treating a non-vaxed kid.  Have you tried searching Dr. Sears's website for the list of "vax friendly" doctors?

There has been no problems or lasting effects on her. I carefully went through it all with my pediatrician. Plus consulted with specialists about all the vaccines. The risks are so low on all that, and if you are worried about the link of autism to vaccines, that risk is very very low to none too.<br>  <br>  I havent had a jerk of a Ped. but know plenty that do. They are just robots... and they want the money from the insurance companies so they push all that crap on your kids... kids born in 3rd world countries never get vaccinated and they are healthy as horses, probably healthier than Americans cause we are so germ free here. There are SOME vaccines I want my kids to have cause I would rather have SOME immunity to the nasties that not, but not all that is needed. My doctor was pushing the Flu vacc on me so bad when I was pregnant and I kept refusing cause they can NOT garauntee that i wont get it but if I do it might not be as bad... so why pump myself and unborn with that if its not going to help if i get a different strain of it? I was getting so angry with her that I changed doctors. Not just because of that there were other issues but that was one of them.<br>  <br>  ATHENS GIRL... I know that some are very strict but sweetie its only a 1/4 of the population that does it if they even have there child in a hospital. Culture rules there and yes the kids now a days should be vaccinated for CERTAIN things and only are if the parents take them to the clinics and even gives birth in a hospital... shocking but true and I know this because my husband is only 28 and he was born at home and not vaccinated against ANYTHING he had to get it all before he came here 3 years ago. i would hope that readers were smart enough to know that not all kids are vaccinated and some are. its 2009 I dont think I should have to write a book about it... but looks like I have to in order to make myself clearer. By the way India is NOT considered a 3rd world country only on outdated maps is it considered so it terms of human development and ecomomy, but that status has changed...

CnEmETVfaa	Hey sweetie!!  I don't think you are going to have a definite answer to your question until you deliver your little ones.<br>  <br>  If you are able deliver naturally and there were no complications during your delivery, you will probably be able to breastfeed immediately.  Breastfeeding immediately after delivery is encouraged, since it starts that mommy-baby bond.  <br>  <br>  However, you my friend, are having twins!!  With twins, I honestly don't know how that is going to work.  When I had my son, he breastfeed every two hours around the clock!!  I quickly became extremely exhausted since being a new mom, you don't get much uninterrupted sleep during the first few months, and I had to go back to work six weeks after I delivered.  I then switched to formula with no regrets.  My son continued to thrive on formula, and I was able to get back to my normal routine, which included a good nights sleep.<br>  <br>  If you cannot or decide not to breastfeed, a good alternative would be to express your milk into bottles.  That way both babies have the advantage of being fed with breast milk, daddy can help with feeding (and bonding...dad needs bonding time too...)and you benefit by getting more of the much needed rest you are going to need.<br>  <br>  I've included two links for you:<br>  1)  This first link is an informative article about breastfeeding after a cesarean section.<br>  <a href="http://www.storknet.com/cubbies/breast/AS-bfaftercesarean.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.storknet.com/cubbies/breast/A...</a><br>  <br>  2)  This link is about the pros and cons of breastfeeding twins.<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-twins-or-multiples_8479.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeedin...</a><br>  <br>  There are a lot of good baby feeding options that are available to you.  You will probably have to do a little experimenting until you find a feeding method that works best for you and your babies.<br>  <br>  I know that whatever you choose, you are going to be a terrific mom!!  Your love and concern for the well being of your babies shines through in every question you ask!!  You seem to be truly enjoying your pregnancy and your babies are able to already feel the warmth and the love from their mom before they are born.  Your twins are very lucky to have you as their mommy, and I'm sure you can't wait to meet them.  <br>  <br>  God bless you, your little ones my friend... AND... only 16 weeks to go!!!|`|FYiKgeN8aa	You sure can!  I suggest the football hold.  I did that in recovery after my 1st C section.<br>  <br>  Just remember, youf baby is very sleepy after birth and sometimes does not get hungry until day 2.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yes of course you can breastfeed  my mom did it with me lol. She never mentioned it being painful. she told me she loved it.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	I've only delivered by section so I don't have anything direct to compare it to, other than the experiences of my friends and sisters. <br>  <br>  The afterpains when your womb contracts can be very painful.  My sister told me hers were so bad she was asking for as much pain medication as she did during labour!   But, none of my friends have told me they were in *that* much pain.  I did have bad pains, but because I was post-section, they were pretty good with drugging me up so didn't notice them much.  I would suspect that's the case with most women - that they keep you nice and medicated for pain after your operation - and so definitely helps.   When you are breastfeeding, you feel some instant pains when your baby starts to suckle, but they only last a moment or two, and it's one good way to know that the baby has latched-on correctly. <br>  <br>  Sometimes women do have problems with their milk taking longer to come in after a section - when oxytocin is released with birth, it triggers the milk production, and this doesn't happen with a c-section.  However, it doesn't mean that you can't breastfeed - not at all!  And, it isn't a guarantee that your milk will take longer to come in; mine came in on the second day!   What is most helpful in stimulating milk production is letting your baby suckle as much as possible. The more suckling, the more the body is being told to produce and let out the milk.  Using formula the first couple of days would inhibit this milk production.  Your baby is fine on colostrum the first few days anyway, and that will be enough to feed them until your milk comes in. <br>  <br>  One other thing that often prevents or hinders c-section moms from breastfeeding is that it is painful to sit up and to lean over, pick up your baby and hold them up to your breast when you've got massive pain across your belly.  I would call LLL and get a booklet on how to breastfeed twins and how to breastfeed post-section; they will give you alternative positions. And, pester pester pester while you are in the hospital for support from the nurses and midwives on helping you get into a good comfortable position.<br>  <br>   <br>  Good luck!!!|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	Yes you can breastfeed straight after, My mum and my sister in-law did it. THe after pains you will get but i don't know how bad they will be only because everyone is different, I had really bad after pains with my first ( it felt like i was going through labour again) but after having my second daughter it wasn't as bad as my first. The only thing is that a nurse may pick your babies up for you so you won't have to move so much like they done with my sister in-law. <br>  <br>  Love and hugs..xx.|`|gx4s68s8aa	You should be able to breast feed.  Keep in mind because of the incision it might be a little more painful for you to get in position to breast feed than mommies that deliver vaginally.  But I don't think that actual breast feeding will hurt any more than a vaginally mommy.   And your milk might come in a little later than mommies that deliver vaginally.  To help avoid a long delay, make sure you take all the medicine you need to stay comfortable.  Because pain can sometimes delay the milk from coming in.|`|X6as2nOAaa	It hurt a little bit for me when I breastfeed but I didn't have a c-section because when your uterus is contracting it hurts a little bit so it hurt a little bit. I think you will have to both formula and bottle feed because twins usually need to be feed every couple of hours.|`|wBpennsMaa	I had a C Section 2 weeks ago and I breastfeed. Its a little painful on the nipples and when your breasts get engorged but its nothing you can't deal with. Your colostrum will come in right away. My milk didn't come in until I was 4 days post partum. You do get cramps/contractions in the few early days in the hospital but they aren't bad. What hurts is when they push on your uterus to see where abouts it is in your abdomen. Congrats & Good luck!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i had a c section and by the time i was able to see my son i was able to breast feed him. i stopped after a week cause he had latching problems .. it didn't hurt me to breast feed him .|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Uh, no, u can still breastfeed.   It wasn't painful at all for me...especially compared to my incision site.|`|dSSFrYUxaa	Yes you will be able to breast feed right away my daughter now 22 months layed across in my womb to.As soon as i was in recovery i put her in the football hold and breastfeed the nurses will show you all kind of neat positions to hold your babies i also got a C-section and they give you pain meds around the clock i am not saying you won't feel any pain but you should be quite comfortable.And when you look at your precious boys faces all you will feel is love.Good luck and congrats
9qkCf6Mlaa	I didn't want to eat anything when I was about 14ish weeks either.  People would come over with food just to watch me eat so they would feel better..lol.  I was eating I just wasn't craving weird foods or eating excessivly like people thought I should be.  I did have to seek out foods at the end of the night to meet my calorie requirements but trust me it will pick up.  I have to stop myself from going to mcdonnalds every day now!|`|PpYBnxgpaa	I feel the same way and I am only 10 weeks . and when I do get something down it comes back up ! I cant stand it . The only thing that taste remotely good is cherry's and I know I cant live on those alone . LOL <br>  Good Luck and I hope we get better soon|`|90zcKChJaa	I am the total opposite! I am eating everything in sight! I am 16 weeks. I am lactose intolerant also, but I still eat healthy foods despite the indigestion.|`|84b26tbzaa	I AM 18 WEEKS PREGNANT AND I STILL HAVE NO APPETITE, ITS NOT LIKE IM NOT HUNGARY IT SJUST THAT I DONT WANT THE FOOD. I TRY TO EAT BUT I JUST GET SICK ESPECIALLY WHEN I DRINK MILK OR EVEN WATER ITS TERRIBLE YOU SHOULD TALK TO YOUR OB ABOUT IT|`|mjd1qjy7aa	Eat PB&J sandwich, it has the protein, fat and carbs that your baby needs. I had a difficulty eating when I was pregnant with my 3rd baby, she is 22 days old, but I know I have to feed her although my taste buds arent working well. Give it sometime and you'll get your appetite back. Remember, your body is producing a higher dosage hormones for both of you and the baby causing this wackiness to happen.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Try soy milk (chocolate soy milk is great!) if you can tolerate it.  It has lots of omega-3 in it that's great for baby's brain development.  And, to answer your question YES, I barely had an appetite around 3 1/2 months as well....just eat small snacks every few hours and you should be fine.  If you are still having problems, talk to your Doctor.  Good luck! :)|`|f16N5QWKaa	listen to your body, it will tell you what it needs. If your not hungry dont eat, if your hungry eat. pregnancy is a hard thing and everything will change. just follow how you feel. if you still dont have an appetite in a few days maybe you should call your doc. good luck and congrats.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I'm 17 weeks and 3 days pregnant and I don't have an appetite either. I have actually been losing weight throughout my pregnancy, which isn't good. I have to force myself to eat.|`|uuHPneEcaa	its normal.. I lost my appetite around that time. its okay..u just have to wing it.. u have to eat. even if u don't want too.. I didn't have a appetite i would eat and throw up|`|hBBQZ6yDaa	It's O.K., don't worry, I also don't have an appetite, and can only eat 1 Red Delicious apple, and maybe a small sandwich or a bagel with cream cheese, and some cookies through the entire day. The baby will take whatever he/she needs from your body, so don't worry about him/her not getting enough, just make sure you drink plenty, and take all the necessary vitamins. Take calcium supplements, DHA supplements, and prenatal vits. Try eating crackers too, I buy the Multigrain ones.
285e8b302bc60e4817f5d45c744bdcfeaa	Don't get down, There is still a chance. When I thought I was pregnant, i took a hpt and came out negative (3 days before my period). Took another one the day of my period, negative again. 3 days later Positive. Just give it another couple of days, and keep your head high sweetheart!|`|WIQhh62Zaa	Regardless of the fact that it says you could get a positive that early, there is still a good chance you were too early.  Also, I have heard of women getting negative results until they were 4 months along...so wait until AF is due and if it's late, test again first thing in the morning (first urine of the day).  Good luck and baby dust to you!|`|AA12384848	Don't give up. You may have ovulated a few days late and if that's the case then the test was taken earlier than you think. Give it a few days. <br>  <br>  I know where you are coming from. Not knowing sucks.|`|9jSmmIxfaa	use first response.. I got a positive 8 days after ovulation.|`|Jgid7Pofaa	the test are not always accurate my friend was about 4 weeks pregnant and the test was negative and she was having her period if u really want to be sure waite till ur period comes and if it does not get an hcg blood test|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Wait until your period comes, if no AF then test again. <br>                      ***BABY DUST***|`|mY19PPlIaa	I hear alot of women getting their Positives 5 days before their missed period. But then again you hear the few others who get positives after their missed periods so maybe they were the 11%.  Unfortunately looking at it in purely a number perspective the odds are against you . Sorry it seems like it might have not been your month. Do you have any symptoms? if you do then dont give up hope. But I know how you must feel. There was one month when I tested five days before my missed period and it was a negative and I just knew deep down inside it would not change into a positive and it never did. All you could do at this point is try again. Sending baby dust your way **
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Honestly....why do they have to know? I don't think they'd want to know tbh. Telling them will only make it more awkward and could make them freak on you. <br>  I don't see why they need to know. It isn't going to stop you, so what they don't know won't hurt them, if you get my drift. There are somethings that parents just don't need to know. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|HMhUKAgkaa	IF you tell your parents, they are going to do everything possible to stop you. So it depends.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I would honestly wait.  <br>  <br>  "boyfriends" = plural|`|tg89r7ZJaa	i wouldn't tell them i mean if you want to you can but there's no reason for you to tell them i lost my V when i was 15 to the boy that i am still with and I've been with him for almost a year now so if you think he is the right one then go for it and the pain people always say that it hurts so bad but it is a good pain like my first time it hurt a little bit but it was like a good feeling!|`|8j7FCEOraa	You've planned to have sex?<br>  <br>  Sorry sweetie but thats not how sex works. I dont think you ready. <br>  <br>  Thats not even considering the fact your 15. I'd wait until your at least 17.<br>  <br>  1. Condoms aren't 100%. Make sure he puts it on properlly<br>  2. Birthcontrol is only 75% effective at your age, around age 20 it comes into full effect<br>  3. There is no such thing as a pull out method. A man has pre-*** that he doesnt feel which does carry sperm|`|1s3nddaYaa	i really hope you only have one b/f. you can have sex first and then tell them. cuz if you tell them they my do everything to stop it. i hinestly think 15 is to young.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	i'd say have a word with your mum about it!<br>  My neibghbour caught Herpes a few weeks ago and she was only 17:-(|`|ZxJw85hfaa	I think honesty is your answer. I would at least be open with my mother. Maybe she can get you into some birth control first. I as a parent would like my child to come forward I'd rather know then my child go behind my back and have sex then come home with a disease or pregnant. "Of course you are not gonna be like yeah I will take you to the hotel." But teaching your child and having communication will help stop all this unwanted pregnancies. If I were you I would wait till I was a little older and maybe be a little more open with your parents.If you don't think your parents would be okay then talk to someone you trust. Get educated first and then take your big step.|`|hGY08GjRaa	I won't encourage you to have sex at your age. You may really think you're in love with this guy, but statistically... you won't still be with him in 3 years. Do you really want to give it up so easily, and regret it later. <br>  <br>  But it's none of my buisnes.s<br>  <br>  No,  your parents do not  need to know.. HOWEVER.. condoms are important, but they are not 100% effective against pregnancy. You shoudl get on another form of B.C. Too. Planned parenthood gives it out very cheaply (The pill) I believe.. you should do SOMETHING to get on B.C.  If that means telling your mom to get her help to get on B.C. then tell her, but if you can get it another way, no they don't have to know. <br>  <br>  IF you really wanna do this.. if you want so badly to act like an adult.. then please be responsible as an adult. <br>  <br>  Use condoms EVERY time.. spermicidal ones<br>  Get on another B.C.  (the pill, the patch, norplant, depo shots.. something)<br>  <br>  sorry.. can't tell you how much it huts.. I'm still a virgin. I'm in my 20s and I just want to have "one and only," The person I plan to spend the rest of my life with.. It's the only way I know I won't have any regrets.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Okay.<br>  First of all, you can still get pregnant, even with a condom.<br>  Second of all, you should wait until you're sure that this boy is the one you'd like to spend the rest of your life with.<br>  Third of all, you should tell your parents. Then they'll tell you to knock it off, since you shouldn't be having sex when you're 15.<br>  <br>  I lost my virginity at 15 to a total ********. I regret it so much. I wish I had waited. Even though I didn't get pregnant, or catch anything worse than a UTI, the bastard still broke my heart.<br>  So wait. Please. I'm pretty sure none of us want to see you on here in a months time asking, "Am I prego?"|`|QGP930C6aa	well u'd be breaking the law (i know not many people care) but if i was goin to lose it (i'm 16) the last thing on earth i would do is tell my parents. so yer i dunno for personal experience but my friend told me tht it hurts alot and told me not to do it. But, i think you should wait a bit longer if you are still unsure about it (its obvious that you are) just remeber that you can only lose it once|`|dbXnW5emaa	You sound like a responsible girl.  The fact that you are concerned about how your parents will feel means that you have enough intelligence to know this is an important step.  Use that intelligence!!!  Be smart enough to wait!  Try to wait until your married, or at least wait until you're a legal adult.|`|ZKw46efXaa	I never told my parents but i definitely think you should wait a bit longer! you are too young! <br>  <br>  if you do decide to do it then definitley make sure he wears a condom and make sure you check that he is!! you dont want to catch infections!|`|CRvdmFwCaa	1.  If he is 18 or over you should have sex with him because it is illegal and he could go to jail.<br>  <br>  2.  Just wait.  You'll never regret NOT having sex with someone.  Regrets usually come after the deed is done.  You Virginity is something you can never get back.  I had a really bad first time experience with a guy who promised me the world... He got a me ring, promised we'd get married, we were like best friends and our families were close... well, he dumped me about 2 weeks after we had sex.  7 years later I still regret it.  It's in the past and I can't change it... but I wish I would have waited...  It's would have saved a lot of heartbreak and tears. <br>  <br>  3.  I'd talk to you parent's... thats what they are there for.  All parents will react differently, obviously.  Maybe just talk to your mom first or something.  Chances are they will try to talk you out of it... but it's because they love you and want the best for you... and they want you to wait for the right person.  It's hard because when you have sex with someone, you give them a piece of your heart you will never get back.  Especially when it's your first time.  AND would you rather tell them before you had sex... or have them find out when you got pregnant that you were having sex?<br>  <br>  4.  If you aren't going to wait or talk to your parents for whatever reasone and decide to have sex anyways.... 1.  Use protection, but even then that might not protect you from STD's and Getting pregnant.  2.  Really think about it and how you will feel afterwards and how you'd feel if he broke up with you.  You'll NEVER EVER forget your first time... so make sure thats really really what you want to do.  And make sure it isnt him pressuring you into it.  3.  Once you have sex... that's all they'll want to do.... Forget holding hands and making out... cause everytime  you get a chance he'll want to pop it in there.  4.  I might have forgot to say something important.  I don't know... Just becareful.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I would consider waiting until you reach the legal age for your country first, underage sex can have serious legal implications, particularly for the boy.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are open with your parents usually then yes, discuss it with them. It is important that you have an honest talk about sex, where it can lead, pregnancy, STD's and contraceptives before you consider anything. <br>  <br>  Again, I really want to urge you to wait until it is legal. If anything goes wrong and you are underage, generally you receive little sympathy from society and you will get labelled in all sorts of nasty ways. You seem sensible enough, but you need to give this a lot more consideration.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	You don't have to tell them, but I think it's a lot better if you do tell your mother because her opinion might make you realize some points that you weren't considering. A lot of teens and even adults think that they know how to use a condom, but it fails them, so i suggest you check out this website first to get more info in case you do decide not to tell anyone..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mycondoms.co.uk/how-to-put-on-a-condom/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mycondoms.co.uk/how-to-put-on...</a><br>  <br>  Personally, I think it won't hurt to wait a year, and hey it will test your relationship.. you can be intimate without having intercourse.. it's mentioned in details here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:uevA9LUycOsJ:www.teenissues.co.uk/LetsTalkAboutSex.html+alternative+to+having+sex+teen&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk" rel="nofollow">http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:uev...</a><br>  <br>  It depends on the size of the penis, but really it's mostly if you're relaxed and feeling safe with the guy, your body will co operate and help to make your first intercourse as smooth and easy as possible.

Fifteen is way to young and if the condom breaks are you ready to be a mom, not an easy job. If you do this, I think you will wish you had waited, and in today's world with all the STD'S out there , it is just too dangerous.<br>  Good luck with your decision and really think about it.<br>  Barb|`|r8hBvWEQaa	wait. you'll regret it. and if anything happens = you get endometriosis and have to go to hospital on and off for a year and are in constant agony because of having sex for the first time then I think your mum at least should know.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	Wait, seriously.  Guys respect WOMEN who don't have a "lil black book" and now a days ( god i sound old ) you have to be REALLY picky about who you give it up to.  If he's just a boyfriend chances are you will break up sometime.  Your 15 and everyone is the "one" but in reality it may be a bad breakup.  Do you want him telling his friends and the school that you'll give it up, how you were, what you look like..they do that.  If you 100% sure you'll be with him forever what's the hurry?|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Nah, I wouldnt tell them. It causes extra stress you dont want. You seem to know about being careful, so there really isnt any issue.<br>  Parents never like to think about thier "little girl" having sex - even when your 30!<br>  As for it hurting, it'll be a bit uncomfy at first, but it'll get better. If your too worried/scared it wont be very nice, so only do it if your really relaxed about it.|`|QQ5W94qjaa	well the best thing u can do do here is not have sex, even thou u are planning on using protection these can sometimes split and end up causing unwanted pregnancies, look u have ur whole life ahead of u, u mite think that yr inlove now but this time nxt year or even nxt month u will more than likely not be with this boy and i think your parents would be very angry as u are under age.|`|jwftwLBTaa	What is the rush? If it is a peer pressure thing, please, do not fall into it. It is not enjoyable at your age, and you are giving up the most sacred thing on your body.

I can see what you are going through, and I think that it is absolutely important that you tell your parents. I had an experience with that when I was fifteen as well. I am now sixteen years old. I came clean with my parents before I had sex, because if I didn't, and if I was pregnant and the condom didn't work, then I would have so much more explaining to do. Your mother will help you pick out condoms, or go on the pill. The brand of condoms my mom bought me was Trojan, and they work. And it doesn't hurt at all when you have sex, but it is not something to joke about at all. It is a statement of your love for each other, and you shouldn't do it unless you know for sure that you love this guy. I hope everything works out, good luck!<br>  <br>  -Victoria Marie (Aka Vic)|`|i071rIOMaa	If you can talk to your mom about this then talk to her. If not find a a teacher or another adult that you trust. Condoms don't always work. And if your boyfriend is gentle and takes his time then it shouldn't hurt. My daughter is 18, I told her for years if she wanted to have sex to let me know and I would get her birth control pills. I wouldn't like it but her being protected was more important than me yelling. Well she said no, no, and to make a long story short she is pregnant now. Sex is something serious, and I think you should wait even if your boyfriend doesn't like it. But if you are going to and want to have sex, get on birth control and always use condoms. You might want to start getting hiv test as well, and pap smears.|`|v4Z4YNkGaa	That is a very personal thing.  You do not need to tell them if you don't want to.  HOWEVER, that being said, although you are 15 and have reached sexual maturity, you have not reached every other type of maturity. If you lose your virginity now, I can promise you that you will regret it later in life.  I am not going to tell you not to do it if you have already made your mind up.  But if you are going to, at least protect yourself.  Condoms are only 73% effective, so try something else to prevent pregnancy. Use the condom for sure, for STD protection, but maybe go to Planned Parenthood to get on the pill or shot or something. It is inexpensive and you do not need your parents permission.  They won't even tell your parents or send you a bill or do anything that can betray confidentiality. <br>  <br>  But really, thing about this.  Why do you want to have sex?  It's a big commitment, whether you think so or not.  Once you go there, you'll never be happy with just holding hands.  And it will be easier to do it again with anyone else that you might date.  Really think about this.  Whether you agree or not, you are still a child.  You need to enjoy this time being a child.  You'll miss it when you are an adult, trust me.|`|kIsSYp8uaa	Firstly, do you think you are ready to do it? Don't rush into it. Most teenagers think that everybody is having sex, but in fact their not. Do it when the time feels right. If its just a few month till your sixteen, why not just wait?<br>  Even at 16 nobody is expecting you to do it. Everybody different. 15 is young though.<br>  However, i can't stop you so if you do decide to do it, make sure you use full protection.<br>  And about your parents, if you think they will take it in a bad way, i would avoid telling them. Some parents will understand, and will just try and give you advice. Others will stop you from seeing the boy altogether. Wait until the time is right. Its hard for parents to understand sometimes. <br>  Hope this helped|`|qYkDqyaJaa	I don't think it's right for ANYONE to tell you not to. Yes, it is against the rules but it is your life. <br>  <br>  Don't tell your parents though.. that's quite weird.. I don't understand why you would want them to know; it's personal.<br>  <br>  Make sure you really love him though. And my only advice is to make sure you are 100% ready. You shouldn't plan it, it should just come naturally. The only planning that should be done is the contraception part, be prepared :)<br>  <br>  And it doesn't hurt that much but everyone is different.<br>  <br>  15 isn't that young. The legal age is 16. If it feels right do it, age shouldn't matter.|`|U1AFYGzZaa	most teens don't tell their parents when their about to have sex<br>  however you are 15, and if u feel like u have to ask your parents, maybe your just looking for someone to force you to say no to having sex.<br>  if you are going to have sex make sure it is with someone you really care for. maybe you will, but i doubt the boyfriend your with will mean as much to you in the years that follow. <br>  also make sure you are not doing it for him. make sure that once he gets some from you, he's not just gonna leave you.<br>  though you might not like it, my personal suggestion is to wait a bit longer before you loose your virginity.<br>  as for the hurt. i was totally utterly comfortable with my boyfriend, and loved him very much, so i felt no pain at all. it was all fun and enjoyable.<br>  hope it all works out for you hun|`|ISmDFbNQaa	To be Truthful I have to be wondering about your boyfriend, this is coming from a guys perspective.  First to answer your question, No I wouldn't.  However if your boyfriend is near your age then...well your first time should be something to remember fondly.

And 15 seems really young to have sex, your parents will probably lay an egg and ban you from your boyfriend and any other boyfriends.|`|7a7a8b25f6c8edb1f3143b162357b855aa	ok i'm going to be honest-<br>  yes it'll hurt a little bit...<br>  but are you sure your ready for this is my main question?<br>  15 is still kinda young! you shouldn't be thinking about sex yet<br>  be 15!! have fun! ;]<br>  boys- thats all they want is sex....<br>  don't trust them! you think you love em, but then the never love u back|`|AhiCjCuhaa	umm dont tell your parents yet wait a sorta long time then tell them it happened..and your 15 really i dont suggest having sex in the first place at your age. you might feel guilty or regret it or the condom  might break and BOOM your a mother p.s im not one of those tight *** people that think you gotta be 30 to have sex.. but 15 maybe you should wait a few more years. please take my advice on this but if you dont.. its your choice|`|N17W5XRQaa	im telling you...wait till yer a bit older atleast til yer like 18<br>  <br>  A) you WILL regret it as you get older<br>  B) if you dont feel that you can tell your parents then he isnt the one and you arent completely comfertable with it<br>  C) even with a condom you can STILL get prego<br>  D)YER 15|`|GWJRj4uaaa	hey your in the same situation except i went ahead and did it, and im still wondering if i should tell my parents. the first time. . . it hurts! but yeah, they will get mad or angry because your only 15. <br>  how many boyfriends do you have?|`|8JPDOXagaa	Okay, what your doing is technically illegal.<br>  im sure your parents wouldnt really be happy, think this through.. are you really ready?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should have a chat with your parents - they might be able to give you some advice.. dont rush anything|`|43YkqHA0aa	dont you dare or i will get the king of the faroe islands to chop your head off and feed it to the scarecrows|`|ameJkDgpaa	you are WAYYYYYYYYY to young. you need to just wait, if he truly loves you then he will wait too.|`|um8IIEn8aa	DUMBASS!<br>  NO!<br>  YOUR YOUNG KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS!|`|ACXO5Jloaa	Don't tell them..they will just say no...<br>  And you said 'boyfriends' do you have like three or something?|`|zM0ag4NLaa	tell no one!|`|VJqDtuoPaa	WAIT! <br>  <br>  Have the talk with them and see how you feel about it afterwards once they give their point of view. They wont be angry they will be concerned for their daughter and grateful you had the courage to come to them about such and important decision.Trust me your dad will be upset but your mother will most likely be more supportive than you think even if she is scared and worried that her daughter wants to take that HUGE step.<br>  <br>  Has your boyfriend talked to his parents??? <br>  <br>  I'm 28 and I talked to my parents about every single thing even now I still do. When I was 15 I talked to my mom cause my brother said he did when he wanted to have sex and she took him to get condoms. LOL She literally laughed at me and thought I was joking. But when I looked her dead in the eye and said if I get prego and dad finds out we had this talk and you laughed...no one will be laughing. I ended up waiting but she didnt hesitate to get me to a GYN and get me on birth control. <br>  <br>  The conversation opens tons of doors and even helps your parents when you go thru those bad break ups they will understand more because they know what LEVEL your relationship may have been on. Talk to them honey. We only have them for so long share what you can even if you think they will not agree with your final decision. If they dont help you help yourself and go to planned parenthood you and your guy and get on birth control. And if he's already been active MAKE HIM GET TESTED!|`|eTbYfp13aa	I know what it fells like at that age when you get all these diffrent fellings and you just want to do it and all you hear about is people having sex. But just remember onest you've lost it you will never get it back so make sure he is the one or you will regret it. I lost my virginity at a very younge age 13 and i did it with a 18 year old we had been going out for sometime but when it was happing it hurt real bad and after it i really regreted it. Then i met my boyfriend at 15 and we have been together for nearly 3 years and even though i had sex he waited till i was ready and i really regret losing it so younge because i wish i losted it to my boyfriend of 3 years because then i would of not regreted everyday i wish i could go back and stop that from happing. And there is nothing wrong with still being a virgine at 18,20 even 30 . I just think you should wait till you are a bit older because trusted me you dont want to make the same mistake as me. But dont think you should tell your parents because it will just make it worst, talk to someone that you really trusted apart from you'r parents and mabby someone older too because they have more experience. But good luck and i think you should actless wait till you are 16.
LZAF4DYZaa	yes taking the proper medication for this is very crucial. I have an under active thyroid and take Synthroid for it, so yes if you have thyroid problem it can make a HUGE difference with getting pregnant. Not only that but a thyroid that isn't properly treated while pregnant can cause many complications during a pregnancy and including miscarriages. I think after 3 months you should be ok to TTC. It usually takes that long to get your hormones back to where they need to be.
bVdLHD5Naa	So you didn't get your period for February?  Then this is what I would recommend (as hard as this will sound): either start using a condom for the month of March, or be abstinent.  If your period for March does not come, take another pregnancy test.  Whatever the test result is, go to the doctor and let them know your results.  If you are pregnant then you know the deal.  If you are not, then something else is going on to cause you to not have your period for 2 months in a row.  Good luck.|`|kdBhSqqfaa	Go to the doctor to get a test, he should know. Oh and if you don't want to be pregnant, use protection. SIMPLE PIMPLE.|`|dR2bqUixaa	Wait another week or so and take another one. If it comes up negative then get a blood test done to make sure. Good luck!|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	you should test again in another few days. You may have just had an irregular period, though! Its happened to me tons of times. If in a few days, your boobs hurt really badly and you start feeling sick, I;d test again. In the future, if you dont want to have a baby right now, I would suggest some form of birth control. If you're not into condoms, you can get cheap or free pills from planned parenthood and you can also use spermicidal films or sponges available in the condom aisle. they're really easy to use and dont change how sex feels. Good luck.|`|P8uh4joQaa	I'd probably take another test.
VwMkiLFPaa	Yes she has a set schedule but nobody sticks with it. Her mother will make excuses as to why we can't see her at such and such a time and then reschedules for a time that doesn't work for us. Or we fight over holiday schedules and our time is cut. She's always in control because she's her mother and doesn't care about the rest. <br>  <br>  My husband's ex doesn't answer her phone because she doesn't want to hear my husband's voice. But we don't call to talk to her, we call to talk to my 5 yr old sttepdaughter. We leave messages but then her mailbox gets full. And we can't get in touch. But then she says we don't try and says we don't care. I can't WAIT till that child is old enough to fend for herself....<br>  <br>  I always feel like a babysitter. My feelings and views are only taken into consideration if it's in my house. Otherwise, it's all about what we can do to cause less drama which in turn causes less stress on that 5 yr old girl. We only get phone calls from her mother when she wants something. Never to "just say hi". We get phone calls when she's going on vacation and needs a sitter. Which we're fine with because it's our "permission" to see that little girl. <br>  <br>  It gets old to be quite honest. Why should a parent have to go through this to see their own child? Yet the mother will cry deadbeat?<br>  <br>  Makes no sense to me. As a stepmom or the mother to my own child....|`|hKJIDdVqaa	My step son is 23 and I am 32 (yeah I know)  He never had a schedule, never had control issues, or being used issues.  His only deal was he would try and pit his mom and dad and me against each other and never realized we all communicated and discussed everything. LOL silly kids. But he is an adult now so, no worries.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Did.<br>  Custodial parent was/is a control-freak.<br>  Definitely.<br>  <br>  Step-parenting can be even more difficult than parenting.<br>  <br>  And it is big-business. Need something to change ? Then step right up, fork out thousands of dollars, not to mention your heart and soul, and the courts will put "stipulations" into order. Oh, they're ignored by the other party? Well, spend thousands more trying to prove it and alleviate it.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Yes- We (my husband and I) only get her on Wednesday nights and All day on Sunday.<br>  <br>  No- this isn't an issue anymore. Apparently it was when my husband was still single- he wasn't reliable or responsible, from what I hear. When he and I started dating he did a total 180 ('cause I was shocked to hear this about him- I do not see it in him. At all.) Now everyone is happy with the arrangement we have going.<br>  <br>  Very rarely. And it's only by my husband, not her mom. He only does this stuff to me when he has to work or gets stuck at work though. It's something I should get over too...I'm an adult, I'm a step parent, I'm his wife, and she is his daughter. I shouldn't feel that way about it, but I still do a little bit.|`|037gXpUvaa	1. Mine has a set schedule with both parents<br>  <br>  2. Her mother wants to control when we see the little girl and when she gets too jealous she would stop letting us see her.<br>  <br>  3. I do feel like she uses me, and I never get to have my word in it, and i know its normal.<br>  <br>  4. I got out of that relationship........|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	1. Yes!<br>  2. No!<br>  3. Well, they are 17 and 19 so no. But, I do feel like my ideas are not valued and from time to time they try to manipulate me.

Ccq8zEcnaa	Yep! I got my crib and bedding for around $350. That was the most expensive things... Then I got secondhand changing table from a cousin- in very great condition, a recliner from an aunt for free, and all the other things at my shower. You just have to bargain for what you want online.. Sometimes you can find things cheaper there. My crib in the store was like 499 and I got it online for 299, my bedding in the store was regular priced 220, and I got it for around 150, with free shipping too.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	hand me downs, consignment shops, garage sales, online stores, but with all of those you have to be extremely careful to make sure that you don't get cheated or get something you don't really want....<br>  good luck hun!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	The most expensive thing is the crib after that everything else its easy. I agree you can get a crib online and it will be cheper try e-bay or a wholesale store or warehouse your only pay maybe 50% of the real price. Make sure you register for things you need so you will get them for your baby shower...that will cut down more costs if you careful you can have a nursery for that. Not high tech but good enough for a baby.|`|hBBQZ6yDaa	Yes, it's possible! we were looking around in stores for discontinued or clearance furniture, and found a crib in burlington for $90, mattress for $25, dresser for $90, bedding for $45, and instead of a changing table we got a changing thing that you put on top of the crib, it takes up about 1/4 of the top of the crib space, and very convenient, easy to remove, only $15. Then we got a bassinet for $65 I think. And that's it, we didn't need anything else. So our total bill was approximately 350.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Easilly.

hbjbm3SRaa	My son is a year old and up until now has still been drinking 6 oz of formula three times a day. I've finally cut it down to 2 times a day. I would think that with the weight your son is if he was only getting formula he should be getting about 46 ounces a day but because you're giving him other things too I would say give him about 3 bottles a day with 8 ounces of formula or so. Seems like you're on the right track. Rice cereal is good but you want to try and keep him on as much formula as possible until he reaches a year old. I know it's more expensive but it's healthier that way. Since my son just turned one the doctor said I can try the whole milk now and try to weane him off the bottle and formula and try the whole milk in a cup.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	At 7 months old my son was supposed to be getting 32oz of formula. Ask the doctor what he reccommends for your child just to make sure he is or isn't getting the right amount. God Bless the both of you.

Yn6pM2Xyaa	technically probably only a few hours but depending on where the blood lab was versus your doctor it can take 2-3 business days.. so you should have probably asked when the blood was being taken how long the predicted because it can really vary!  perhaps call your doctors office and speak with reception or a nurse to see what they think as they will definitely be able to give you the best estimate..  also you can ask if they will call you to let you know to come in because the results are in (my doctors office does not call)|`|ROJans2Taa	it took my doc around 3-4 days to call me back with my results|`|dR2bqUixaa	If they scheduled another doctors appointment then they usually tell you then. That's when they told me.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Usually they say to you but I think its a week or 2|`|4XfjUcvDaa	usually about 3-4 business days
KAj7GfeDaa	I surely know how it feels to be in a financial bind at the worst time ever. (among other things) A month after I found out I was pregnant my fiance got hit head on by another vehicle on his way home from work. (he was not at fault) He's been in a wheelchair ever since. We're thankful he survived of course, but It's been one of the hardest times of my life! We were in the middle of buying a home so when that happened it left him without a job so we are now living with my sister and her husband. I'm thankful for a place to stay, but there's just no place like home. I'm working still, but it's just enough to pay the bills we have and get what we need. I'm 6 months pregnant and I've never been so exhausted in all my life. On top of taking care of my fiance I have a 6 year old wonderful daughter who I feel so bad for because by the time I get home I'm too exhausted to do anything. We do home work and I can't go on anymore! It totally sucks! I never get a break, even on weekends, because that's when I do the laundry and other household chores. Money is tight, my life sucks right now, but I can't give up because I'm about to have 2 precious little girls who need their mommy. I love being a mother just not under these circumstances. My fiance and I have a lot of pressure put on us and we argue more than we should. I don't feel appreciated for all that I do and second guess getting married to him constantly. God is the only reason I have not gone off the deep end. He is my well of strength that I pull from. Never ending supply. Life has seasons... some good, some bad, but things are always changing and progressing. I'm just taking things one day at a time. One day it won't be this way any more. Sometimes we're the one who has made a bad choice, sometimes the bad comes to us. No matter what God can not only pull us through, but cause us to thrive! Thank You Lord! (sorry this was so long, but I hoped it help you see you are not alone)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Our money situation is changing and its stressful.  Our rent is going up $300 and getting different things ready for the baby all adds up.  I make a little more than my husband and on top of that he's horrible with money.  I feel resentment all the time.  I hate my job but I suck it up because we couldn't make it with his check alone...we only make it because we have 2 incomes.  Then there's his family that causes major headaches and stress and he'll acknowledge it but doesn't do anything about it but look at me like an idiot.  He's the oldest out of a large family and so he assumes a lot responsibility I don't believe he should have (since his dad is a half *** father).  Then he's a messy person in general and I'm a clean freak.  I'm pregnant, tired and still working full time...its annoying to come home to a sink full of dishes and trash that needed to be emptied two days ago.  Even though my husband works...between his irresponsibility, his needy family and sloppiness...I feel your pain.|`|6G14WPhQaa	I am 13 1/2 weeks pregnant.  I am in my last semester of university and am flat broke.  I am due in September and I am conflicted about my ability to take care of my child.  I am kind of still with the father.  We started a break this last Sunday and it's seriously killing me to be doing all of this all alone.  My boyfriend is not going to leave me high and dry, but he is not thrilled about being a father.  I resent him for that, and I am mad at being pregnant.  We took the precautions needed to not get pregnant, and here I am, pregnant.  I know I will love my child unconditionally, but lately I have wondered if maybe the best thing for my child would be to give him or her up for adoption.  If that is the case, I will likely bestow temporary guardianship to my parents until I can get on my feet, but even this idea upsets me.  I completely understand how you feel.

MubTZUKXaa	Well, I tried clomid for at least 6 cycles (alone, not with IUI).  It was successful in helping me to ovulate but I never fell pregnant.  To be honest, I don't have much faith in Clomid.<br>  My Dr then wanted me to try Puregon injectables (again, alone and not with IUI) to encourage ovulation as it is much more successful than Clomid as they work in different ways.  <br>  <br>  We decided to just go straight for the IUI + injectables, this has been proven to have a higher live birth rate compared to clomid + IUI.  We got pregnant on our first go.  So in my opinion of the two meds, I would definitely go with injectables every time :-)<br>  <br>  Baby dust xxxxx

When you've slept enough you can then unpack, and then sleep some more. Soon you may be getting a burst of energy which is a sign that labor is coming. As far as getting energized I don't know that there is anything to take for that. Just get the sleep you want while you can and don't worry about unpacking. Call over some friends to help or some family. They will be glad to know you need some help!|`|T48smu01aa	Its normal your body is getting ready for labor and it needs all the rest it can get before the big day........just do a lil at a time and sleep even if its 5 min or 10 min :) but its normal :)<br>  Good luck and congrats!!

zRQmWC5saa	my daughter did this for about a month later and she become sicker and went to the bathroom and thought she was delivering another baby! it was scary, but it turned out to be some afterbirth the stupid Drs didn't get cleaned out all the way. she got an infection , made her sick to her stomach and dizzy.<br>  I think u should go to the Dr for a check up . Tell them what is going on. My daughter had to have a dnc. good luck|`|vXYQcixvaa	Yes! I was sick my entire pregnancy! I had hyperemisis. Basically mornin sickness that lasts 24-7. I even lost around 20 lbs from not eating. I had a feeding tube and all! Buuut that was due to hormones out of wack. So after the baby i did feel sick for an additional 3 to 4 months! Its just b/c your hormones are still trying to get back to normal levels. They say it takes about 1 years for a woman to be back to normal. Dont worry....it will be over soon!<br>  <br>  ps: i even get sick on my birth control bc of the hormones in it. Sucks for me! LOL <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Could you be pregnant? If not maybe its the stress of having a new baby and less sleep and everything causing you to have upset stomach. I know when I get stressed my stomach goes crazy.
AA12259102	This is something you need to tell your Dr. definitely.But a razor cut will usually bleed worse than others and being on your foot it will bleed more too.|`|nwWBddEnaa	u could have thin blood that doesn't clot, i would get this checked out before you have your baby or you could lose alot of blood during labour, i wish you all the best x|`|PHOyKsmPaa	contact your doctor. you can talk to the nurse practitioner and ask her what she thinks it could be.|`|4jW9rERFaa	I never noticed an excess amount of blood. But then again, I don't recall ever being cut while pregnant either. I would talk to your doctor. You could have the problem of excess bleeding. There is a word for it. I want to say anemia but I think that may be the word for lack of iron. I wouldn't say its not normal. My doctor has asked me a few times if I had that problem. I would continue doing things as you normally do and be sure to mention it at your next appointment.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i have cronic nose bleeds all the time ( had them before i was pregnant). ur fine as long as ur not bleeding vaginally then ur okay.<br>  <br>  it could have been just a pimple. ur body changes during pregnancy. but if u feel the need to call ur doc then i would do it.. I call my doctor and bother them with stupid questions all the time.
UcgWrGaAaa	You dr is ridiculous.  How much does your son weigh?  The amount I've heard is 2.5 ounces per pound per day.  So whatever the answer is you divide that by however many feedings.  Seriously, listen to your baby over the doc any day of the week.  You are the mama, you decide what is right for your baby especially if he is growing well and seems content.|`|rjVALevtaa	When my son was 10 weeks old he ate 4 oz about every 2 hours. Now he's 6 months old and eats 6 oz. every 2 1/2 hours. It really varies from baby to baby. If he's satisfied with 3 oz. then I don't understand why your doctor is telling you to give him 4 oz.|`|4GC0QJ8eaa	My baby will be 10 weeks tomorrow, he is 14 lbs, and he eats between 5-6 oz every 3 hours. He has had a lot of spitting up issues and has reflux but the doctor put him on Enfamil A.R. and it has worked wonders. He still spits up a little but not like he used to. Now when he does spit up it looks like cottage cheese.|`|EDiJe38Taa	Every baby is different. If yours is spitting up after eating 4 oz, then it is too much for him. He will tell you when it's time to increase his formula, because he will scarf down the 3oz and still be looking for more.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	My baby is 5 weeks old, on formula and he eats 5oz every 2-3 hours.  He's 11lbs 6oz
EyKJ737daa	For younger babies yes, they are definitely not a good idea because there is no support.  This is the very reason I have never bought one of those cheap $20 strollers.  You can actually see for yourself when you open them, they more hug the baby's back rather than support it and give them something solid (but soft) to lean against.  They are definitely not recommended for babies under 6 months because they cannot hold their head and body up usually before then.  Often a baby looks like they are slumped in strollers, another reason not to buy a cheap and nasty one because they are slumped in them and admittedly they look terribly uncomfortable in them but I guess babies know no different because they are so Flexible at that age.  Your best bet sweetie is to get a proper stroller that is actually supported.  You may spend a big more for it, (usually around $80-100) here in Australia but it really is worth the money to know that your baby's back is supported as this is the foundation for later in life and helping them care for their own backs and posture.  <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Umbrella-Strollers-Baby/b/ref=in_br_browse-box/?node=3579991" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Umbrella-Strollers...</a>  <br>  These types of strollers are much better for baby's back support than the cheap $20 strollers sweetie.  All the best and good luck with shopping for one in your price range.  Depending on who you go through, prices can vary drastically sometimes.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	go for it... the large travel systems are great when the children are under the age of one but after that they are just ridiculous.. at the same time the umbrella strollers are great for babies 9 months onwards and you will barely need one by the time they are like 2.  i went through a transition phase where depending on what i was doing, for how long and where it was depended on which stroller i used but altimately by 12 months was completely using an umbrella stroller.  i had to get one that was like $90 because I am tall.. the super cheap ones break easily.. try to find a good price but one with the right features for you and your baby.. like adjustable back for snoozing.. support slats in the back, sun canopy etc.|`|rAkWoweOaa	NO KIDDING! I am so sick of carrying that huge stroller and the carseat that hooks into it. I don't know about your question though. My mom told me that they look cheap, like you can't afford nice things for your baby. Can you even believe that? I have been using mine, and my son is only 5 months.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I prefer umbrella strollers once baby is out of the infant carrier/travel system.  Those strollers take up so much room and are so bulky and heavy.  The umbrella strollers are awesome!|`|qFmOuXMXaa	I just got a umbrella stroller I think it`s awesome. It was alot more money then I wanted to spend but I think it will last longer and be better for my daughter right now because she is only 6 months old.There is a little basket and you can lower the back so baby can lay down.....GRACO IPO, like I said it was $139.99 but I hope it lasts for a LONG time.<br>   Good luck|`|2ZcDkWaRaa	You can get some great umbrella strollers they recline so baby can sleep tilted back you may pay a bit more but in the long run its worth the extra few dollars.

I guess as long as she doesnt spend too much time in there... there are some other umbrella type strollers out there with a bit more support, of course they're a bit more expensive than the regular umbrella strollers.<br>  Also the downside of most umbrella strollers is the height. It's usually way too low.. Im just under 5'5" and I usually have a backache after pushing my daughter! But it's good for the airport, trips to the zoo or very crowded places where a small stroller is needed.<br>  <br>  Look at these ones...they offer support yet they're small and comfortable.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?productId=3152754&cp=2582975&parentPage=family" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?productId=3257679&cp=2582975&parentPage=family" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  These are a few strollers that I could find online.

ROJans2Taa	try saline solution with the nose sucker, also steam from the bathroom may help loosen the mucus, my son had 3 cold  each time it seems he has trouble breathing, best luck|`|SCY0bOr5aa	They have a saline solution made by "Little Noses" You spray it up there nose and then suction. Worked wonders for my 1 year old.|`|YFhNHzI9aa	You should definitely invest in a warm steam humidifier.  Vick's makes a one that puts out a lot of steam.  You can find it a Wal-Mart or Target for around $15.  Also use the nasal aspirator they gave you at the hospital.  Sometimes it helps to hold one nostril closed while suctioning the other nostril. Your little one will NOT enjoy this but it will help.  I wouldn't squirt breast milk in her nose at all!  She will just breath it in and it will just go down the back of her throat which will be even more uncomfortable for her!  You can also find Vick's Baby Rub.  It's just like the Vick's VapoRub from back in the day, but it's made for babies.  It's less harsh and has ingredients like lavender.  I swore by it for my little ones and still do even though they are all school-aged now.  Not only does it help with their congestion, it's very calming. Good luck and I hope your little one gets better soon.|`|AA10424047	Go to the pharmacy and try sodium chloride solutions. It's just salt water. It helps break up the mucus that is caught, and she'll either sneeze it out, or she'll swallow it, but it will help her breathe easier. Also try a humidifier.

3kydegQJaa	Well, it is very ruitine to have it done, ( a LOT ) during pregnancy.  But this early, if it caused you to miscarry before, then you may be more comfortable waiting until your second trimester when the rate of miscarriages drops dramatically.  And if you're doctor isn't understanding of this, and tries to pressure you to do something that scary then maybe you should try to find another doctor, it will be hard to find one that will be supportive of your decision, because it could cause a liability for them, not being able to perform routine checks on you, maybe tell them that you'll sign a waiver saying that you refused the pap smear?  You don't have to do anything with your body that you don't want to, but please, keep in mind that during the second trimester, it will be perfectly safe and possibly very beneficial to you and the baby to be checked regularly.  Maybe you could at least let them manually check you, with out the forceps, so they can at least make sure that you're not dialating.  Good luck|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Are you using the same doctor?  If you are, then she wouldn't routinely do another pap smear.  If you are seeing a different doctor, then she will probably want to do her own pap, but if you explain the circumstances then she might be willing just have the results of the previous pap smear sent to her.  You always have the right to refuse any medical tests.  They will just put it in your chart that they recommended it but you refused.|`|AA11542929	i would ask if it will happen again and get a head supervisor over them to answer that for u.. u dont wanna run the risk or that again.. itll be toooo painful..<br>  <br>  also i had one in may then sept then again like almost 2 months ago.. jus cause the one in may the stupid a$$ doctor ****** up on it and didnt say anythiing to me until i got a new doctor..|`|BcdbR6iSaa	They will probably still want to do one with this pregnancy, but if you're not comfortable with it, they can't make you do it. <br>  I would politely decline the pap smear, maybe explain yourself a little and stand firm on your decision. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|wWkfASTNaa	I would tell you doctor your concerns, they cannot force you to have one. I know they do one to check for abnormal cells and make sure its healthy for when you give birth and all. But if it caused you to miscarry, I would tell them you dont want to. Its your body.|`|3379beee21bd16119073619f31fef6d5aa	Yes you do have the right to refuse a pap but  the doctor will want to do one at some point. Discuss your concern with the doctor and make a well informed decesion.|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	I sure would ask.Explain to the doctor why.Maybe you could postpone it for a few months.|`|teptsmeKaa	Yes, you have every right to refuse any treatment you do not want to recieve from a medical professional.<br>  Even if it is in your best interest.<br>  <br>  I personally refused to get a pap smear until I was 21 because I was always afraid... I only got one now because I'm pregnant, and just wanted to make sure I had no infections, plus I know it's good for catching cancer early.<br>  <br>  Since you've already had one for this year and you feel uneasy about what happened last time... then don't do it if it just causes you worry and concern. You can say no, and they can't pressure or force you to get a pap smear. If they do, they are not being medically professional and you should switch doctors.|`|1kLCl7snaa	Most likely they will want to do one even though it has been less than a year. However I do understand your fear. You may be able to convince the dr not to do one, or atleast wait for a few more weeks.|`|0acF0y1Jaa	Pretty sure you can, since you had one within the year. Ask your Dr, talk to her aboutr your concerns.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	they are safe during pregnancy BUT i have always refused and the doctor was fine with my reasons<br>  they just do it at my 6/8 week postnatal check|`|s1utniuvaa	Yes you can refuse. It may not be a good idea but I understand your concern. Seeing as you had one a year ago I would think you should be ok. Good luck!|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You really need the pap smear. They're testing for much more than a normal pap smear does. I would think the fact that you lost your last pregnancy would encourage you to be sure you take care of this one--and get checked in any way necessary to make sure everything is okay. So, I guess if your vagina being left alone is more important than knowing if your baby is growing right, then sure, refuse the pap smear.|`|T48smu01aa	I am pretty sure you don't have to get one if you have had one in the last 6 months....and you can also refuse a pap, but in your best interest I would get one....but it is up to you and yes you can refuse the care. I didn't have to get a pap when I got pregnant b/c I had a pap 3 weeks b4 I got pregnant, but that's the only reason.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	They will want to do one at some point. You can talk to her and see if she will do it after the first trimester to avoid a repeat. Talk to her and express your concerns. I'm sure something can be worked out.|`|hBBQZ6yDaa	Yes you can!!!!
UDENYO4raa	Unfortunately yes... But don't lose hope.. There are plenty of miracle babies out there, and who knows... You might be the one to break the cycle! You're here, aren't you? :)|`|rjVALevtaa	No, they aren't. Actually most women will experience at least one miscarriage in their lifetime, although sometimes the miscarriage happens so early that they mistake it for a heavy period.|`|WR4zKwyWaa	possibly? my mother had 2 miscarriages before having me and i too had 2 miscarriages before having my first child
ejQ3yg9Naa	Depends on the 17 year old. I know some that are still practically baby's and couldn't do anything on their own but others that would probably be fine in the real world.|`|1fbac5d623b9757f6a5e6b9d7ba0b5c2aa	I'm 17, and i consider myself a young adult.. even though my mom likes to treat me like sh*t all the time just because she had a kid in Janurary. I hate asking to go somewhere. It's like im limited to where i can go.. I'm turning 18 in December, and i cannot wait!! I'm going wherever i want, whenever. But some 17 year olds are immature. When their teacher says 'vagina' or 'penis' they laugh. I just want to say "grow up! you're not in Jr High anymore'|`|115BfzMFaa	im 17 years old and i consider myself sort of an adult but still a child in some places. i couldn't last the real worls on my own and i still have alot to learn. I think this is maybe because i am an only child and my parents have 'babied' me. There is nothing wrong with that, just when i do leave home it is going to hit me very hard. I know my parents are always there for me thought|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	When I was 17 I thought of myself as an adult but as I age now - 17 seems so young. There is still so much to learn still. I wouldn't think of 17 as a kid but I would consider it a teenager still|`|hvghGmzAaa	well your not considered an adult until your 18 exactly.<br>  untill then your parents are responsible for you|`|BLEYaodFaa	Anybody under the age of 25 is still a kid to me.|`|lTsPX04jaa	no|`|H90uflbFaa	not a child, more a teenager or young adult|`|vy2x8khiaa	legally, yes.<br>  you're a minor still at that age.<br>  at age 18 you're an adult, man/woman..<br>  whatever. i'm 18 and i still classify myself as a kid.<br>  my friends and i refer to "kids" as age 24 and younger.<br>  i'm not sure why, it's just the youth in people sometimes.<br>  it also depends on their personality.<br>  if they're immature, they're definitely a kid.<br>  and child and kid are two different things.<br>  kid just means young, and child is literally from ages 14 and younger.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	I wouldnt say a kid..<br>  <br>  Id say, young adult..<br>  <br>  but it depends..if a 17 year old was pregnant..yes shes still a kid...if a 17 year old wants to go the mall alone..a date, movies..etc etc<br>  <br>  then he/she is  a young adult|`|AA11510145	More like a teenager not necessarily a "kid".  So a child that still requires some supervision and guidance but not as much as younger people.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	A "kid", at least in my opinion, is someone who is under the age of ten. Teenagers are young adults.|`|kd9caM9saa	I wouldnt say a kid. A young adult.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Depends on the 17 year old.<br>  how mature they are.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	If he or she's still a dependant, yes.|`|SbPUs8EGaa	yea u have to 18|`|zdGpaFlfaa	i dont consider anyone an adult until they r out of their parents/guardians house. have their own place and support them selves. i dont care if ur 40 in my opinion u r still a child if u still live with ur rents.|`|G4wDlSh7aa	no, in the state of Texas 17 & older is considered an adult.<br>  :)|`|0fQk2spXaa	At 17, you should have some of the responsibilities of an adult, however, you should have a "safety net" to protect you from your mistakes.  <br>  So, in that regard, you are still a kid who is practicing to be an adult.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Yes. But "kid" as in a young person still not part of the adult world, yet no longer part of the world of a child either.|`|8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	young adult. its not young but still growing young adult|`|1tLmTjBxaa	yes in India,adult at  18
P3OBb0vLaa	the answer is no, but when the woman tries to leave she gets her head beat in, and then gets gifts apologies-thus the cycle. <br>  <br>  Society always blames the victim, too. <br>  <br>  It is always harder than people who haven't been through it to even imagine.<br>  <br>  That said-of course , get out.<br>  <br>  It is just that....I heard of a woman who at 6 months pregnant got beaten by the bio. He made her promise not to call the cops by holding her cheeks tight enough to make them bleed and shaking her head. Then he let her go and she fled to a payphone (6 months pregnant remember) When the cops got there her mascara ran and she was hysterically sobbing. They put her in a squad car. Next thing she was being takin to jail with her abuser. He had said she fought him. (She was arrested for self defence, even though the man had no marks and was large) <br>  They stripped her naked, and exclaimed,"oh you sure are pregnant,' before putting her in a cell, where she bled on dirty sheets. When she got out, he ex was already in HER apt. <br>   Surrely he beat her again for calling the police and she didn't dare to call them and didn't have family, but when it got too bad she called 911, and the cop told her she shouldn't have slept with him in the first place. <br>  <br>  She got away. She got her child away. Her child never knew the man who turned out to be an addict. They live happier than she knew possible. She got away...she wasn't the villain.<br>  <br>  Recently the court actually tried to tell her she had no right to leave the man. Even after he had broken the restraining order and said he had a gun. They even gave him her new address.Sometimes no one looks out for you but you.<br>  <br>  Don't judge the victim. Help her. Sometimes she doesn't get away. Sometimes it is too late. What exactly is she supposed to do?|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Much as helping a loved one with an addiction is a noble thing to do my responsibilities would lie with my children, they don't get a choice about helping or not. I would leave and stay in touch by phone.<br>  BTW...violent tendencies would surely have to be there in the first place for an addict to react in such a way? So that is a no brainer...if there is violence I would be on my toes BEFORE I had children.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Hell no! If they are a drug addict, run and never look back. That is a sad yet perfect example of what those nut jobs can do. I would never love a man more than the well-being and safety of my child.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Nope its like cheating. One and done.|`|cnssh7v3aa	Well thats a hard one, Ive been with my husband since i was 15, we have grown up so much togther. Im pregnant with our first baby, and its a girl. Even though i love my husband to death, and would do anything for him, if i thought he was a danger to my child in anyway. I would be out of there. I would always still love him, but its not worth my childs life!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I have been in an abusive relationship before and I had no problem leaving him.<br>  <br>  I don't give people second chances anymore, they just end up walking all over you.|`|e22ae614e89bdf91f720595fcc752bd9aa	To be honest I can understand giving second chances and all that but if I thought for one second that my children were at risk from anyone, partner or otherwise then you honestly wouldn't see me for dust. The trouble is that in these situations you rarely see it coming, either people change so slowly or else its a one off thing. Its always easier said than done and you don't always have the means to leave etc but no mother will knowingly put her child in danger, the trouble comes when you delude yourself that there is no danger.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I would not subject my child to a bad situation, I wouldn't subject myself to it, after living through it once.<br>  <br>  For me, when they can't admit they have a problem or refuse to get treatment, that's it, it's enough for me to walk away<br>  <br>  I was in a relationship about 6 years when he had an accident and developed a pain killer addiction, he also started drinking heavily. He would turn the house upside down with his mood swings, throwing things, breaking things, etc. Then he started emotionally abusing me. I tried for 6 months to help him, he refused counseling and eventually, I left. He wasn't the man I loved anymore and he had no interest in changing.<br>  <br>  I found out I was pregnant shortly after.<br>  <br>  While pregnant and immediately after having our child, he tried a few times to convince me to move back in with him, even though by now he had lost the apartment. Although the pain killers were gone, he now transferred his addictions to pot and drinking. I refuse to put my daughter in that kind of situation, father or not.<br>  <br>  I'm glad I didn't because three years later, his life is still unpredictable and hard. He's still happily going along with his addictions and doesn't think there's any problem with how he treats others.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I am more of the momma bear type.  If you poke me with a stick or get too close to my cubs chances are the intruder would be the one with the problem.  Nobody can love that much, that they could subject themselves or their children to abuse or potential death.
vZwJyqc6aa	Yes I started feeling my baby around 15 weeks. Not exactly like a flutter but it's a very distinctive feeling that I never felt before I was pregnant. It's just hard to describe it.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	yes, 15 weeks is very normal to feel the baby move.|`|spo9KBRpaa	its normal to feel any movements at the stage your at now...<br>  and congratuations!! :D|`|qfuhHeDjaa	if its a twinge id think its round ligament pain from everything growing and stretching... movement usually does feel like flutters or bubbles at first, then when they get bigger and stronger it starts hurting!|`|jk6ayFUmaa	i am 17 weeks with my first and i feel the baby and its nothing like what people told me but i know its my baby|`|6yy0jtzDaa	don't listen to the women that say you can't feel your baby until 18 weeks they are idiots everyone woman is different i too started to feel my baby very early around 15 weeks and i am little overweight and its my first pregnancy everyone said it was impossible i thought back then i was just wanting it to be but its was now that i know whats kicks feel like its your body and if you pay attention you will notice them getting stronger and i don't not think that oh its just gas is excuse there is a big difference between the two
ZicollyMaa	im so sorry. i just miscarried myself on monday morning at about 1230 am. i bled for 4 weeks prior, but the baby was fine. even 24 hours before, i had an ultrasound and all was fine. it was very heavy the last few days and by the time it happened i had pretty much gone thru labor and was in so much pain. i had my entire sac drop still closed and all into the toilet. ( i was 11 weeks 3 days). i also have a question posted because i am in so much pain i cannot walk, still. yes right after it happened, i bled very very profusely. like more than a liter by the time i left the hospital. i had to go thru all this at home, then was rushed to the er after the baby was lost. please just go to the emergency room. they can tell you right there and put your mind at ease. i know how hard it is to go thru, so please dont hesitate to email me if you want to talk. it would do us bot good, i believe. wishing you the best of luck.|`|AA10742362	i am so sorry 4 what ur going thru.  i had 2 miscarriages last year.  the 1st i was "okay" with.  i just told myself we were meant to have a healthy baby.  with the 2nd i had a very hard time.i tried to explain to my hubby but not to sound cliche he just didnt get it as a guy ya know.  he didnt understand that on saturday i was carrying a life and on sunday i wasnt.  there is nothing thats right to say and no perfect words u will hear.  u can tell urself u r meant to have a healthy baby but it doesnt always help.  u just have to know this, when the time comes that u do carry to term u will cherish every sleepless night u have every tear u wipe(both urs and the babys) every stinky diaper u have to change, lol.  i think sometimes that women that havent miscarried dont understand how precious that little life is.  im not saying they love them more or less im just saying its different.  3 weeks after my 2nd miscarriage i concieved and was blessed with the most beautiful babygirl ever.  i know she will be a strong person in this world because she made it!  good luck to u and yours  i hope all goes well and if it doesnt go the way u hoped know that there are tons of little angels around us from women who loved them and think of them dearly and often!  i like to think they keep the little angels here on earth safe...|`|fKhjdqCGaa	I am so sorry. My miscarriages started with bleeding and the bleeding went on for seven days, just like my regular periods. They were a bit heavier, allot more clotting and yes you will cramp. If you soak your pad with in a couple of hours, go to the doctor because that could be too much blood. That is what the doctors told me anyway. I hope for the best, but if the best doesn't happen I am very sorry and you will have your perfect pregnancy soon:) Best wishes.
MAdl2tQjaa	i am also 17 weeks pregnant and i have experienced these same pains a few different times, so you're not alone! (=<br>  <br>  i've had pains so sharp in my lower abdomin that i could barely walk too, but within minutes of laying on my left side, the pain subsided.<br>  and it's defineatly normal for intercourse to triger pains. and it's also happened to me.<br>  <br>  i've read a lot in the baby books and around this time these pains are completely normal, they say as long as the pains come and go fairly quickly it's just associated with the baby and everything growing inside of you. if you experience any sharp constant pains for a long period of time [like say 20-30 minutes straight or more] without it letting up at all or if its accompanied with bleeding, then you should be concerned and call the doc or go to emergency room because it could be a sign of an actual problem with the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  i saw you are due with your first baby august 11th, i'm due with my first baby august 10th!! well, i hope my answer helps and everything goes well with your pregnancy!!|`|9icNsO6Yaa	Well I am 22 weeks prego and this is my first pregnancy and already I have experienced so many differ. feelings that might be very unpleasant congrats on your baby|`|0acF0y1Jaa	I would call your doctor & ask. They'll be happy to talk to you about any of your concerns. Don't worry about sounding foolish, they will not think you are. If you're really worried just call, it'll probably ease your mind.
UDENYO4raa	Ha. Any second.... I got mine IMMEDIATELY when I found out... When you hit the third-trimester though is when they are horrrrrrible... I'm 7 months, and it's just bad.. lol.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	for me it was like 4 weeks.. i wanted to ripp everyones head off.|`|dR2bqUixaa	Depends on the person. If you get mad easily then anytime. If not then it might take longer. I started mine around 14 weeks.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Mine didn't kick in until the very end, they weren't really mood swings, just more so pissed off at the world. All these girls that were due after me, were having there babies before me. I was working 40 hours a week up until I was 41 weeks pregnant and got induced. I'm a manager, and my employees probably hated me at the end of my pregnancy. <br>  If you haven't got any mood swings yet, I'm sure you'll have a couple towards the end when you're uncomfortable and just want the baby out.   <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|wWkfASTNaa	Anytime really. Some people it starts way early at only 3 or 4 weeks but for most no symptoms really start till 6 weeks. I am at 4.5 weeks and getting pretty dang moody.|`|mjd1qjy7aa	from the beginning of the pregnancy - I hated looking at my fiancee and didnt know why. Just seeing him made my blood boils - our 22 days old baby looks just like him|`|f8ed07139ed0b8e2bee89c46a751f7d3aa	I think it is different for everybody. I am 24 weeks pregnant and have not been moody at all. Also, I am never moody before or during my periods, so I'm not expecting to get mood swings while I'm pregnant either. I tell my husband he's the luckiest guy since I'm not trying to bite his head of constantly, lol.|`|qERAKF13aa	maybe a little in the begining but alot towards the end! im 36 weeks along and my younger sister(13) was over at my house, she got so scared cause i was moody, she hid in the bathroom from me. (i never yell at her or even tell her to do things cause im a softy with her) and my hubby said he will never get me preggo again!|`|vb1fIAuEaa	usually takes about a month to really start kickin, sweetie. caffiene helps the mood swings, but you're not really supposed to drink caffiene when you're pregnant.|`|kdBhSqqfaa	It all depends from person to person. As to the woman who said it was immediately... I have a feeling that was more in her head.|`|IKrJTzwcaa	anytime or not at all a lot of people just say they have mood swings cause they pregnant why would you wanna have mood swings you should be happy your having a baby
7SKVCPcSaa	she needs to be seen by a doctor to get a stronger rash cream. or her parents need to change her more when she isn't in your care.<br>  <br>  when she is with you, maybe you can start bathing her. just tell her parents that she got really messy eating some pudding or something she is allowed to have. they probably wont mind. and you should let her go as much with out a diaper as you can. let that get aired out and keep the moisture off of it.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I'm sure that rash needs to be aired out. Ask the parents what they suggest and what the doctor suggested. Tell them she crawls around all day crying in pain. That baby needs more medicine and it their responsibility to get it for her. <br>  <br>  Put petroleum jelly on it in the mean time or a really good diaper rash medicine.|`|rR4q2e9qaa	Try that butt paste cream or let her go around without a diaper if there's somewhere with no carpeting.  That's just horrible to do that to your baby...if there's any other chance or sign of neglet you should report them.  If it's that bad she probably needs an antiobiotic type ointment prescribed by the doctor.|`|IWinNj2saa	It might be a yeast infection, but I would not use diaper ointment, it dries out the skin. You should try using A&D ointment, it's healthier for babys sensitive skin, and works so much better. Obviously if you feel the child is being mistreated, you should let some sort of authority know.|`|NroZQN5vaa	She needs to go see a doctor. It might have turned into a yeast infection. Is it bloody at all? All I can suggest is telling her parents that she needs to go see a doctor because she can't stay in that amount of pain. It's not good for her.|`|J2glFOkhaa	If it is that bad, there might be yeast involved. I'd say she needs to get in and see a doctor. <br>  <br>  ps. if her parent's aren't taking care of it, that is neglect. Now you have to decide if it is something you want to report|`|Po2UqfvWaa	it sounds more like a yeast infection. i don't know if it's possible or not to let her go without a diaper and air it out. if she has been on any antibiotic, she could have a yeast infection. to me it sounds more like that than a diaper rash. also, cps has bigger fish to fry than parents who simply don't know this could be something serious. calling cps for that is outragous to say the least. some people just aren't aware of certain parenting, doesn't mean they need cps up their ars.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Why are you not having a serious talk with the parents?!  This is absurd to be happening for 3 weeks and you are absurd for allowing it to continue.  Sit down with the parents and tell them that they need to take her to the doctor TODAY.  Refuse to watch their child again until they get the proper medical care.  If they still won't do it, call social services.  There's no reason that something that bad should go on for so long unless the parents are just simply neglecting to take care of issue.  For today, leave her diaper off as much as possible.  Let her sit and soak in a warm bath.  It will most likely be soothing to her bum.  Contact the pediatrician that you use (if you have children) and ask them what ointment they recommend to use for something so severe.|`|4hSUePTqaa	Are they using  a cheaper brand of diaper? My son always wore pampers and just recently i decided to try somthing a little cheaper the white cloud from Walmart. Well his skin did not do well at all so i used Aquaphor it is miricle in a tube bought it for like 7 bucks a tube but my son was completly clear by applying only once.|`|xMTkyaRuaa	Sudocrem. I use this all the time on my 2 yr old as she's still in nappies. Its very thick and its water resistant. It will have the nappy rash cleared up in days.|`|7Nzvjkbsaa	Triple Paste is a good diaper rash cream that you can get at your local pharmacy (it is over-the-counter).  It contains a high amount of zinc oxide, which is protective and soothing for itch and irritation.  <br>  <br>  In addition to that, a trip to the pediatrician should be made by the parents.  Parents who do not take enough care of child to the point where the child is in pain are ignorant at best, or neglectful at worst.  If bathing, changing, and putting ointment on more frequently will alleviate this poor child's suffering, they should be held accountable to do so.<br>  <br>  Good luck--sounds like you really care about your charge.|`|860158682c2b7621907ad595c456bf5faa	Aww that sounds horrible!! My daughter has had some bad diaper rashes in the past, until I used desitin. The kind in the purple tube. It's like miracle in a tube! Change her every hour and reapply the desitin. I always put alot on her at night when she goes to bed b/c she sleeps all night. As for the non-bathing parents, maybe suggest to them that it would help her alot if she had a bath at least every other day! It may also help her too, if they let her run around in the nude for a while. We try to do that with our daughter b/c she loves it and the rash may just need some air to breathe!<br>  Hope this helped!! And good luck!!!|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Tell, someone. Maybe child services. They need to take care of the baby and if they aren't it's neglect and they are not fit parents. If the child is obviously in pain they aren't taking care of her. This is very sad to hear. Please tell someone though.|`|qHa4w8eyaa	Oh:(....that poor little baby. :(  <br>  <br>  She isn't allergic to her diapers, is she?  I had that problem as a baby, and it made things very difficult for my mom!  I've also read that diaper rash is often caused by candida and I know that applying plain yogurt eases itching caused by candida, so I'm wondering if maybe that would help. A less messy option might be aloe vera gel - it's very soothing and might provide immediate relief.  I'm not sure how old the baby is, but a wash of water and apple cider vinegar (maybe 1 tbs per cup or so) will help to kill any bacteria on the skin. This wash works well for any sort of itching on the body, be it from psoriasis, candida, or other rashes....just use it regularly.  Also, it helps to keep her skin dry and ventilated (i.e. breathable fabrics like cotton, or bare skin) between washings.<br>  <br>  Here are some websites that may be of assistance....I hope she recovers soon!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.morphemeremedies.com/homeremedies_diaper_rash.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.morphemeremedies.com/homereme...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/home-remedies-for-diaper-rash1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://health.howstuffworks.com/home-rem...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/alternative-medicine-articles/diaper-rash-natural-remedies-for-diaper-rash-365018.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlesbase.com/alternative-...</a>|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yes go to walmart and get some "bag balm"  it is miraculous ointment.  You should see immediate results.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's time to tell them to see the doctor, she could have a staph infection or just a simple yeast infection.  If they continue to neglect her rear it's a case of neglect and needs the attention of social services, which you are obligated as a care giver to report.  <br>  <br>  When she is with you let her bottom air out as much as possible, don't use Creamy Desitin, it's okay for regular bottoms for the really sore ones go to the old school stuff.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you have done most of your part - the next step is up to her parents and if they do not act you need to.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Call CPS. That qualifies as neglect... not changing the baby's diaper often enough or bathing her enough specially knowing she's got such bad diaper rash -and allowing it to get to this point also- is neglect and almost abuse. It's hurting that little baby... and the parents dont care...|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	If you have a pack n play, put down some plastic on top and then a sheet. Put her in it without a diaper for an hour or so. The best remedy for diaper rash is just let them 'air out'. If that doesn't help any, then it might be a more severe rash that needs to be addressed by a pediatrician.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I think you need to sit down with the parent(s) and talk to them.<br>  <br>  Tell them that you are concerned that this diaper rash isn't better and that you think that all of you need to "get on the same page" so that you can treat it and get it cleared up.  Then sort of feel out what they are and aren't doing and try to get a picture of what's going on.<br>  <br>  If it sounds like what they are doing is completely inappropriate then tell them how concerned you are.<br>  <br>  But if you think this is neglect, and not just ignorance, then you have a legal obligation to report SUSPECTED child abuse.  In many places you can actually go to jail (or more commonly get probation) for failure to report even suspected abuse.|`|nbWO3IANaa	Tell her parents she NEEDS to go to the doctor before they bring her back. Three weeks without improvement is the WRONG treatment.<br>  Can you put her in the tub/sink, with a little baking soda, to clean/soak? [ I don't know how many kids you are watching.]<br>  Also let her 'air out' - naked on the floor with a blanket, or in playpen. <br>  She could have a bad rash, or a 'yeast' infection. Those are really stubborn without correct treatment!<br>  Try downloading some info on stubborn diaper rash, and give a copy to the parents.<br>  Or report them for neglect...
QBZRtwH3aa	With my last pregnancy, my amniotic fluid got low.  I had gestational diabetes also.  My doctor checked me twice a week to make sure I had enough fluid to keep the baby ok.  I ended up going the week before my due date to be induced.  As long as your doctor stays on top of it everything will be ok.  My niece was born at just over 4 lbs and she is ok, today she is 8 years old.  Good luck and my prayers will be with you.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	my son was born at 37 weeks and he was 6 lbs i don't think your baby sounds too small...all babies are different...If you had to deliver early your baby has GREAT chances of minimal complications... He will just be soooo small preemie clothes will be a bit big... :) but if they can hold out 2 more weeks you are in the clear...no preemie baby! :)  I hope all goes well...sorry I didn't have any good advice but I just wanted to try to make you feel better GOOD LUCK!|`|AA10035322	If the amonotic fluid is low you want to deliever early. That could cause still born. But to clear your mind. When my mom was pregnant with me she said they only gave 36 week due dates. And now my sister goes to a doctor that says that he doesnt believe a woman should go to 40 weeks  because it puts to much stress on the baby.|`|Cah6nfV5aa	I had low amniotic fluid at 20 weeks. They told me the baby was also very small. They told me to drink a lot of water. I did this and came back 3 weeks later and it was better. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	I have no experienced this, but I do know the longer you are carrying, especially near the end, the more the baby will gain in weight. They tend to gain more weight right near the end. Just think positive thoughts! I am sure you and the baby will be just fine. Even if you carry another week the baby will be up to 5 pounds. Babies much smaller are born each week and even earlier. Just keep those thoughts in mind! I wish you all the luck in the world! Babies are much stronger than we give them credit for! They can go through so much and be just fine!
fboC1N7gaa	I really love the name Lucas.  Lucas Carter and Lucas Jayden flow really well.  I love all of you girls names.  I think that Isabella Nanette-Elayne, Madison Marie and Sophie Marie are lovely names.  Best of luck!|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like Lucas and Carter.  Lucas Carter.<br>  Isabella Marie.  Nanette-Elayne doesn't really go with the first names you've chosen IMO.  Sorry.  I do think Elizabeth Nanette-Elayne go well as well as Sophia (not Sophie).  You need that extra syllable.<br>  <br>  EDIT - It's ok.  It was only a suggestion and not to be used in real life lol.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	I like Lucas, Isabella and Sophie. <br>  Madison and Jayden are AWFUL, sorry...EXTREMELY overused.|`|t0OYbngBaa	i like christopher jayden and madison marie|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I like Madison Marie and Lucas Jay.<br>  <br>  :]|`|BiMeb75Gaa	Tyson is cool and I've never heard of it before. I love Christopher and if I had a son I would call him that! Carter would be cute for a boy's middle name and I think Madison, Isabella and Sophie and really cute! Marie as a middle name suits almost anything so it's a good choice!|`|OusNzihYaa	i really like Isabella Marie (but just to warn you that's Bella Swan-from twilight-'s full name) Madison Marie sounds great to.

syrh8J6Vaa	That's exactly how i felt the day before I had both of my children!  It should be soon hun|`|AA10230627	not me but my older sister did. you should call your ob or go to the hospital|`|mjd1qjy7aa	I suggest that you call your OB, she may need you to go to the hospital. I had my daughter at 37 weeks, that is 22 days ago.<br>  She came out an hour after the epidural, lucky enough, my ob was at the bldg.
AA10333002	I have one, evidenced by some slight spotting within the first 10 weeks.  I won't find out it it's gone until my next US at 20 wks.  My Dr. said they often "bleed out" and go away.  If something bumps your cervix that can cause the spotting, ie, an intervaginal US or intercourse.  Spotting should be brown, indicating that it's old blood.  It should only show when you wipe.  It was light pink twice.  If it's as I've described, it's nothing to worry about.  I only saw it a handful of times and haven't seen it since 10 wks and I'm 19 weeks currently.|`|v3LnJycKaa	my next door neighbor experienced this and tragically they did not catch it until she experienced cramping and bleeding, went to the hospital, they did ultrasounds, told her that the twins were ok, storng steady heartbeats, went potty and a HUGE gush of blood came out, they said that eventually the uterus filled with blood and waters broke, she delievered her beautiful still born babies at 15 weeks. This isnt awlays the case and luckily your dr has caught it early, please take care of yourself.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	My second daughter had a subchorionic hematoma.  I was diagnosed at my 18 week ultrasound.  They said it "could" bleed and it "might" bleed, but I was lucky and it never did.  My baby was born perfectly fine at 39 weeks and a handful of days.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best!
wWkfASTNaa	Sex when you are pregnant can cause some bleeding because your cervix is really sensitive during pregnancy. If you are concerned, I would take a test and see what happens. It can be a m/c if you only bleed for a day, and the rest just hasnt passed. I would take a test to verify or go see a doc.|`|f16N5QWKaa	It could be that the embryo has just attached to the lining in your uterus, that can cause bleeding since you are very early in the pregnancy. if the bleeding stops its probably nothing to worry about. if you are concerned tho you need to go see your doctor.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	well, if you're dry, you should always use some kind of lubricant to avoid pain! Lotion or something!! are you sure that what you passed was a blood clot and not tissue?? I would visit your obgyn for an exam, its the only way to tell unless you keep bleeding and have loss of pregnancy symptoms, The other cause of the bleeding could have been that during dry sex, it caused vaginal bleeding. use lubricant next time!|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Not necessarily but go to a doctor!<br>  Why are you posting on here?  Go to a doctor!|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	When I miscarried at 5 and a half weeks it started with one day of bleeding then it went away... I hoped that it would be nothing, but it did end up being a miscarriage. I bled more later, like four days later I got heavier bleeding. I hope it's not the same for you.<br>  <br>  Like you, it started to happen after we had sex. I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not - the doctor said no but sometimes I wish we hadn't.|`|fb7cf9f135155789f589f25b5c08b6c6aa	First off...let me just say that if you do go to the er...they'll tell you that you've had a threatned miscarriage...take blood..and do a sonagram. Do you have a regular ob doc? Call him or her. It is said that sex does cause bleeding. In my situation...I'm 7 weeks...and I passed a tiny pea size clot and that was it. I have to wait to get a sonagram next wednesday...but I think all is ok because I still feel pregnant. Anyhow...don't have sex until you know for sure what's going on and call your doc to see if they'll schedule u an appt soon.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	i bled for 4 weeks with my youngest (passed clots too). i had a subchorionic hemoragghe. dont google it, youll scare yourself. part of the placenta detaches but it reattached adn shes almost 6months now! <br>  '<br>  anyhoot, just stay away from sex til you see your doc! just wanted to let you know bleeding and clots dont necessarily mean miscarraige!|`|84b26tbzaa	YOU NEED TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IMMEDIATELLY
q4JMjvGLaa	I would think that it is probably September 17,2008 because my due date was supposed to be June 7th and I know I conceived September 14,2008 because that was the only day I had sex. And if our due dates were 3 days apart than our conception dates are probably 3 days apart as well. But this all depends on your cycle and how many days it is. Try this website.. it gives you a date range but not a specific date. I hope this helps! Congratulations! :)|`|AA10607821	Don't know, I wasn't there, sorry.  I don't think even the doctor could pin point it, just give you a guess because the due date is only based on info you give him and then the ultrasound.|`|mf3OOagMaa	This is easier than you think to figure out... just count backwards 40 weeks from June 10th.<br>  <br>  When you have sex, the sperm can live inside of you for up to 7 days, and once the sperm finds an egg, it can take another 7 days for the fertilized egg to become an embryo.<br>  <br>  So once you count back your 40 weeks you will find that the actual day that the doctor figured that you got pregnant on is not the same day that you had sex.<br>  <br>  The doc is going to count back - 2 weeks from the first day of your last missed period (the day you got pregnant) and then count 40 weeks forward to determine your due date.<br>  <br>  Another juicy tidbit, that most folks just don't "get" - if you count out 40 weeks...it is actually 10 months of pregnancy (or 9 full months) - docs use a lunar calendar - a 28 day cycle to determine the months...it's all so confusing...easier to think that we are only pregnant 9 months, than to explain all of the calendering!  <br>  <br>  Check out Babycenter.com for tons of info on this kind of stuff and lots more! Congratulations on your baby!|`|68lLAQnKaa	count back from your due date 38-40 weeks and that'll be around the time you conceived
bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	ive snored from infancy till the present.(48 years.)my tonsills and adenoids were removed at age 4,i still snored.my dr said its due to constant sinus troubles and allergies,not sleep apnea.ur son may just have sinus problems and so on.but,see another dr just to be sure.a deviated septum will cause this as well.i suppose i should have had mine fixed,but im scared of surgery.i figure as long as i am healthy(thus far)i wont worry.most babies snore at least occasionally,in my experience.|`|Cppi6kRFaa	He could also have enlarged adenoids (tonsils). You may want to bring him in and have him checked.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	My son is the same age and snores quite a lot a well. Then again me, and my parents are just the same. I don't think there is anything to worry about. To me, it makes me feel like I know he's sleeping well if he's snoring.|`|f15fae9678a173ccb0d1f8132c549bedaa	my 14 month old baby snores sometimes. Especially when she has a cold. I did ask the dr about it and she said it was fine. She has always been a snuffly baby though. <br>  You could take him to the Dr's to just get him checked out to put ur mind at rest.|`|LhV10HZcaa	Could be a sign t′hat he had a cold. You snore when you have s stuffed nose.|`|yilREYWGaa	My nephew is 11 months and I had him up to stay last week and he was snorring like a donkey... Thank goodness we live in an old cottage with very thick walls! x|`|06pm47Tiaa	he probably has a stuffy nose.|`|2bLEXHFEaa	my daughter snores sometimes when she has a cold its hard not to worry about these things but it is more common than people think
Wjdpm4xNaa	I think the real question is can you handle that?  I'm sure she will be fine, but if she's throwing tantrums be prepared to get weird looks....you may get embarrassed.   But just take some snacks w/you....toys.|`|X6as2nOAaa	How long is the plane ride and make sure that she has a lot of stuff to play with .|`|nuBRcuwvaa	We took our 18 month old son on a 24 hour trip.  We flew from PA to Hawaii with 1 layover. <br>  <br>  We were visiting family stationed out there in the air force.  Anyways - it was quite an adventure.  I'm pretty sure that 3 hours wouldn't be too bad.<br>  <br>  I don't care who says I'm a bad parent, in certain and limited situations, sometimes you have to resort to bribing and extra attention.  Pick a couple of her favorite foods and favorite (or even new) toys and bring them along.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	your child might have a few problems with balancing their ears but get them to chew some food and drink and it will help during take off and landing.  ask for the time being confined.. buy some new toys for bribes and surprises and bring along crayons and paper, books etc and be prepared to entertain them while awake..  also maybe try to sleep deprive them prior to the trip to ensure they will nap.  my dd was 24 months when we took her in a car ride for an 8 hour drive and she did just fine.  You'll survive :)|`|rjVALevtaa	I think so. When our oldest was 19 months we went on a 6 hour plane trip. He did fine, although he did get pretty antsy near the end. Just bring a lot of small toys. Maybe buy a few new ones. <br>  <br>  If you can, try to get her to sleep for at least part of the trip.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yes, or it'll be the worst flight of your life. My charming daughter Chloé screamed from Chicago to New York. Everyone on the plane hated us.|`|YFhNHzI9aa	Well, I am sure a 2 year old CAN handle a 3 hour trip on a plane.  But the question is can YOUR 2 year old handle it.  Considering I don't know your 2 year old, all I can tell you is to be prepared.  Definitely bring snacks and toys and books.  If your little one enjoys movies maybe bring a portable dvd player (with headphones as to not interrupt the other passengers).  If he/she listens to a cd at nap time bring that and a portable cd player with headphones.  Also I would really advise purchasing a ticket for your child.  My friend recently traveled with her 2 year old about the far and said it was horrible having her on her lap the entire flight.  She is in her terrible 2, throwing temper tantrums, wiggly, squirmy phase.  So for the trip back home she purchased a ticket for her daughter. Good luck.|`|jvFWNuiXaa	Yes he can. Just get some lolipops so his ears dont hurt. And buy some small toys or games like the ones at the dollar store, but dont show them to him ahead of time. Whenever he starts acting out tell him if he behaves fine you will give him a surprise toy. This always worked with my daughter. Yours is a short trip mine were usually 10-15 hour trips. Good luck.|`|f1Zhqlsaaa	all depends on attention span all children are different!|`|oDlDrjF1aa	just bring her lots of distrations and snacks
6yy0jtzDaa	i have used Biore face wash my whole pregnancy and never had a problem its helped with the breakouts i have! think your fine as long as your not eating it but talk to your doctor if it concerns you that much|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	If these products were known to be dangerous during pregnancy, they would have giant warning labels all over them saying so. As long as you don't drink them, you're fine.|`|4jW9rERFaa	I never read any ingredients on anything I used or anything I am using now! Is that bad?|`|iqz2tYEBaa	I don't know if it's dangerous while pregnant, but I have terrible skin as well and I use Cetaphil.  It is great for your skin.  But I am sensitive to salicylic acid and it burns my skin so I have to buy products that don't have it.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	I've read they can cause miscarriage. You should ask your doctor. Im sure there's something that would be safe for you to take.<br>  <br>  EDIT- well, it might be, look on babycentre.com and they list what uses of it are safe and which aren't.|`|v3LnJycKaa	i would think that as long as you are not drinking it, and using it in moderation you shoul dbe fine.
Yz2TvEMlaa	it depends on the woman. I've had morning sickness since week 6 and still have it in week 14, though, it's finally waning.. My cousin had it until her 7th month.. Every woman is different and every pregnancy is different.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	It usually lasts from week 6 to about week 12. but every woman & every pregnancy is different.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Mine only lasted a few weeks but I didn't start getting it til week 9 or so.
vZwJyqc6aa	That's tricky. Doesn't seem like the right time of the month for you to get pregnant but anything is possible. Even if you did get pregnant last saturday you couldn't take the test yet. You  may have to wait til your next period is supposed to come to get an accurate reading. But if you are anxious, go buy some of the cheap dollar store tests in a couple weeks and start testing.
WxQFe0GYaa	Before changing his formula, you should discuss it with a doctor.  Doesn't your baby's doctor have a back up doctor you can speak to?<br>  <br>  Does the spitting up seem to bother him?  Has he been spitting up all along or did it just start?  Is he gaining weight well?<br>  <br>  He might just have reflux, which is pretty common.  My son spit up constantly from when he was first born up to about 6 months.  But, he was happy, and he gains weight really well, so we didn't worry about it too much.  He's nearly grown out of it (at 9 months.)<br>  <br>  Spit up (or spilled) liquid always looks like way more than it actually is.  When my son was younger, we would burp him every ounce, and he would puke every ounce.  Literally.  It gave me such anxiety to feed him in public or for someone else to hold him, for the fear of the puking.  But, he has consistently been in the 75% or higher for weight.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Is there a Nurse Practitioner at his doctor's office that you could speak to? I'd be careful with changing him to soy b/c some baby's are actually allergic to soy. Try changing his bottle for now. Something like Dr. Brown's, Avent, Playtex Drop-ins are all the one's that I have heard that reduce gas. We used Dr. Brown's and they did great for us but as you know every baby is different. I would try changing the bottle before the formula and if that doesn't help go ahead and try a different brand of formula. But if you can talk to the doc. Good Luck & Congrats on your bundle of joy.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	get him check for reflux and lactose intolerance.<br>  <br>  also try some gas drops. that may help<br>   or baby just my be colicky.. <br>  <br>  go to the doc.|`|HiXZsAYAaa	This is what you need to do. Try him on a soy based formula like you said. Pro-So-be Enfamil, or Similac Isomil Soy is the best. Try it out for 3 days. If it doesn't begin improving, then try Enfamil Gentlease for another 3 days. Basically you need to go through at least one can with each new trial. Now, if that doesn't work, he could have a protein allergy and may need special formula like Similac Allimentum or Enfamil Neutromagen or even Good Start (by Nestle). <br>  <br>  Anyway, hope that helps some. The mylicon drops don't always work, I know trust me! Also try burping more often, that may help with the spit up.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 9 weeks old and she still spits up really bad. She's on Gentlease. Apparently, it's normal. She definitely has colic though. <br>  <br>  Sorry about the situation, hope things get better.|`|3a1GMOmLaa	try a piece of peppermint in a bottle with purified water. the peppermint helps the gas|`|NroZQN5vaa	Take him to a different doctor. Any doctor is qualified enough to help you make a decision.
2ZoUduoPaa	My little on was extremely gassy.  I wish I had switched to Dr. B's before we did.  I was using Playtex drop-ins when I switched.  The change was almost immediate.  I won't use anything else.  She still has some gas, but it's nothing compared to before the bottles.  <br>  <br>  Since the switch, my colicky, gassy baby is sleeping better and actually acts like she feels better.  She plays more because she's more comfortable.  <br>  They are expensive, so just start with a few before you buy up a whole bunch.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Yes, you still need to burp the baby afterwards.  Sometimes my little one won't burp right away, but when we're done I get up with her,she burps and sounds like a "MAN"...LOL|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I thought they were great, and definitely worth getting.  They helped my daughter a ton.  If you have issues with gas, then you should give them a try.  They're a pain to wash, but if they help, the it's worth the extra work, and money.|`|0F8hauikaa	I don't know about the bottles you refer to but I can share something I used to do with mine that sometimes helps. Lay the baby on it's stomach, either in your lap or on a bed, and rub it's back gently. The baby might resist at first but they will usually calm down when they realize that it feels good.|`|rAkWoweOaa	They really do help better than regular bottles. For the first 3 month I used them, then I moved on to the playtex drop ins system.|`|fWuN3TbUaa	i loved these bottles! they worked wonders for my daughter! i would say i saw results within a day or two.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	My girlfriend swears by them, she loved them... I could never afford them.
SSCaFfm9aa	i'm on the nuvaring. it's not gross. you put the ring in and every three weeks take it out.. etcetc.. read about it. it's only gross if you don't like touching your female parts... which... what the fu*k?? they're your parts... lmao ANYWAY... the patch wont fall off but it sucks it's itchy and gets dirty fast so don't do that. and the shot hurts and makes you fat.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	yeah they have a thing called mirana (I think its spelled right) talk to you OB/GYN bout it and they can tell you more.|`|4jW9rERFaa	Nuva Ring, its once monthly. I think it is a vaginal insert though. If you are looking for a long term method there is now one that can go into the arm. Its as thick as the ink stick in a pen and a few inches long. Its fairly new so it may not be available in your area. The patch sucks. I know you mentioned about it falling off. I was worried about it falling off but that's not so much a problem. There are increased risks of blood clotting with birth control methods other than the pill. Supposedly the shot makes you fat. There are stupid side effects for every method.|`|AE6Rap6vaa	Sorry to inform you but ALL FORMS of birth control are UN NATURAL and no good for your body, I went through this a while ago and opted out of all! <br>  Its a personal decision but hey, its working for us.....your man has to be really accurate....lol<br>  <br>  NUVARING is known to cause blood clots, yeast infections, painful sex, hormone fluctuations, stroke, Pulmonary Embolism, and lots of other issues....AS SO DO THE REST!|`|iP863XM6aa	theres this thing (i dont know what its called) but its something that the doctors insert inside you and it stays there for a while (its like a t shape or something.

Google it for lots of info.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	No sex... Lol<br>  They do have implant & the Nuva ring.|`|0iIDAHldaa	I am on the nuvaring & I love it. Some may think its gross, but I'd say its time to get over that! The only thing that could be "gross" about it is that you have to push it inside of you & pull it out. You leave it in for three weeks, take it out for a week, and insert a new one the following Sunday. Not only does it work great, but you can't feel it...my husband can't feel it...and it has really reduced my pms symptoms. I take the Nuva out on Sunday, don't start my period until Wed-Thurs..and its gone by Sunday. Its also pretty light. I wouldn't go back to anything else. Also...I'm not sure if it would be the same, but our local health department offers them for free. It really is easy though...I just set a reminder on my cell phone for every 3 weeks to remind me to take it out & another the following week to remind me to put a new one in. You should look into it.|`|sFN3iL1yaa	There is a diaphram, which only needs to be used when required, no chemicals or side effects.  An IUD is also an alternative, but more invasive than the diaphram, good point to this is it can stay in for 5 years with no chemicals.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Yes, it's called abstinence.

ft8t98Pnaa	Potent smelling urine is a symptom of a UTI<br>  <br>  Urine color and odor vary widely, but typically, healthy urine is light yellow with a slight ammonia-like odor. However, food, drink, and certain medications can affect the color and odor.<br>  <br>  Clear urine with a relatively mild odor, usually represents someone who is well-hydrated. When the kidneys have less fluid, the odor will be a little stronger and darker with a stronger odor. Therefore, when urine is dark with a strong acidic odor, likely as not, you're simply not consuming enough fluids|`|wqL84O8Naa	Healthy pee stinks<br>  <br>  true story|`|JWp9PMyRaa	it sounds like a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)..which is common in kids<br>  ask him does it hurts any when he goes...(sometimes it can be painful)<br>  <br>  even if it doesn't hurt, still take him to the doctor, b.c It really does sounds like a UTI..which is only cured by prescription meds.<br>  <br>  Best Of Luck|`|LXrBpthGaa	did this just start or has it always been that way?
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	She sounds small. My son is 9.5 months and 15lbs 10oz. He is below the charts for his age, so your daughter is definitly below the charts. He was a 34 week preemie born at 4lbs 4.5oz. Does she move a lot? are you and your spouse small people? That might effect her weight. My son does not sit still and my fiance's family are all tall and very skinny. He just takes after them and burns all his calories crawling.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Generally, they should triple their birth weight by one year of age.  Again, that's just average.

PeOCqztoaa	There's nothing wrong with a little encouragement and rewards. She'll get back into her groove. My 2 year old daughter is doing the same thing. She'll do awesome for a couple weeks then she just wants to play and go in her diaper. I have to encourage her to stop what she's doing and get on the potty. It's a process. Good luck! : )|`|XaVCCG3Naa	My friend and I have this common concensus:  Take the diaper off.  We have five kids between the two of us.<br>  <br>  Once she knows that she cannot be comfortable when pee and poop is running down her legs (and her first instinct will be to reach down and touch the wetness - so all over her hands too) it won't be long before she directs herself to the toilet!<br>  <br>  You may have to deal with some bare-bottom days, a lot of carpet and floor cleaning at first but it is well worth it in the long run.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Encourage her and ask her every so often if she has to go potty. Or tell her that it's time to go sit on the potty. Make her a chart that if she goes potty so many times that day then she gets a reward. I did that with my daughter and no kidding she was completely potty trained in a week and a half. Another thing that worked with her is that I took her to the store and she got to pick out her own panties. Doesn't matter what ones they are, even if they are boys underwear. If they pick it out themselves, they are less likely to want to get them dirty.|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	I think when she is ready, she is ready. I also do not see anything wrong with a little push in the right direction. I have a 4 year old.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Simply don't. Genital mutilation aka circumcision is a barbaric procedure of no real justifiable benefit. Unless there is a medical indication, circumcision is completely unnecessary. Here in the UK circumcision is not so common, in the US it was a common trend until recently. I am delighted to see that the circumcision rate is now declining in the US as more and more parents are now realising there is little need for this cruel and senseless procedure.<br>  <br>  I consider it to be child abuse, the child will feel some degree of pain. I suggest you watch a circ. being done before making your choice. The foreskin is a birth right and we do NOT have the right to take away a child's choice at birth. If when the child becomes an adult he decides for himself that he wants to be circumcised then fair enough- that is his choice.<br>  <br>  Apart from religious reasons, prevention of certain diseases is the second most frequently used reason for circumcision. Evidence that circumcision is beneficial for health reasons is indeed very poor.The practice is mainly based on cultural traditions. I always try and base my answers on fact and scientific evidence. I have spent a great deal of time researching the actual evidence that some pro- circumcision supporters use. I will address these areas. Cancer of the penis is indeed very rare, SOME evidence suggests that circumcision offers a little protection from penile cancer if done in childhood, however the main factor in penile cancer is exposure to the Human Papilloma Virus. The fact is that Circumcised men are MORE at risk from penile warts than uncircumcised men, recent studies show that the risk of developing penile cancer is now almost equal in both groups. In view of this latest evidence, routine circumcision is NOT a justifiable method to prevent penile cancer<br>  <br>  A common myth is that yeast infections are more common in uncircumcised men, this is not true. The same instances of thrush occur in circumcised and uncircumcised men. STIs such as gonorrhea and non-gonococcal urethritis and penile warts is more common in circumcised men. The best method men can use to protect themselves from STIs is to use condoms and limit the amount of sexual partners one has. In view of this evidence, circumcision is NOT a justifiable method to prevent STIs<br>  <br>  A recent review in the British Journal of Urology concluded that there is no link between having an intact foreskin and HIV infection, thus circumcision is NOT justifiable as an HIV-preventive measure.<br>  <br>  Circumcision reduces penile sensitivity by up to 70% and most of all there is no real reasons to cut off body parts that do not belong to you. The foreskin does have a purpose- it protects the penis, much in the same way the female clitoral hood protects the clitoris. If the foreskin had no purpose, men simply would not be born with it. Therefore I conclude; there is no valid argument for circumcision.|`|pXSKSS3daa	That's your decision to make, not the decision of strangers.<br>  <br>  If you don't know why you should/shouldn't circumcise your child then I suggest doing some research on it beforehand.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I think you should make an informed decision on your own.

My husband and I didn't agree about this at first - I did not want to cut him, my husband did.  A hour spent on the internet changed his mind.  Don't watch any videos though.|`|X6as2nOAaa	It is your choice, I have a little girl but I told myself to think about if I had a boy then I would need to start thinking about that so I thought about it and I decided that I wouldn't get it done and I have a lot of reasons why not.|`|twVyisGnaa	In the end, it's up to you.  My lil' bro was circumcised, but not me.  I wonder why.  Anyway, it's your choice.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|4arnbpUCaa	Assuming you live in a developed country like the USA, where we have warm running water and soap, and are willing to educate your son when he's older about personal hygiene, then there is NO reason to have him circumcised.<br>  <br>  I've researched it and it is a painful, irreversible procedure that permanently removes normal and healthy tissue. Circumcision have never been proven to be of sufficient benefit. That's why no medical organization recommends it.<br>  <br>  Check out Mothering.com's forums for more insight from other moms:<br>  <a href="http://www.mothering.com/discussions/forumdisplay.php?f=44" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/discussions/for...</a>|`|VmSKQ40Caa	These people are mostly idiots, it is not your choice, it is your son's choice, and if he wants to get cut, he can do it when he is older. It is your son's fu(king body, not yours!! Since it is your son's unit, he should choose what happens to it!! I am not circumcised and am happy about it. Your son deserves an intact unit. I am serious, do not do that to your son. Why would a person be born with foreskin if it was useless? Males are born with foreskin for a reason!!|`|Yb99bIdnaa	You said yourself that there's no medical need. We don't tattoo our kids, even if all the cool people are doing it. (And trust me, you need to retain the moral high ground so you can use the "would you jump off a bridge if all you friends did?" line when he's older.)<br>  <br>  Cosmetic surgery without the patient's consent is probably a bad idea. Especially as the rate is dropping, it was down past 60% in 2006, the last year for which I could find numbers. The trend line dips below 50% by now, so the conformity argument isn't even true anymore, even if it were a good argument in the first place.<br>  <br>  I think it's a pretty clear-cut case. (ha!) It's his body, it should be his choice. The Constitution is very clear that noone should be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures of their property, and if a person's body parts aren't their own property, what are they? <br>  <br>  The pain can't be denied, even with anesthetic, there are permanent changes to the way the boy's brain processes pain. You see this years later, it's possible to tell which boys are circumcised and which aren't, simply by measuring how long they cry when getting a shot. Read the last link below, "response" for the details.|`|K4zsztkRaa	If there is no need to do it then why would you even concider it?<br>  <br>  Would you chop off your baby's arm even tho you know it didn't need to be?<br>  No you wouldn't, so why would you chop off a part of his penis when you know he doesn't need it?<br>  <br>  Exactly.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to do it and therefor it shouldn't be done.<br>  I look at it from the standpoint where it's hid body, it's attached to him and therefor only he can chop bits of it off if he wants.<br>  <br>  I dispise being circumcised.

It's something that shouldn't be concidered unless it's for medical reasons.<br>  <br>  I would leave him a whole man.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

The foreskin will be fused to the glans leaving you with the simple task of wiping it off like a finger and wiping the opening tip with a wipe a baby wipe.<br>  <br>  If you didn't have your labia cut off from yourself and your daughters, then don't circumcise you sons... It's the same nerve group and the same result. More damaging however because the clitoris still won't rub on everything like the glans will...that too would be equal.<br>  <br>  Nature came up with the best design for a penis where the glans..(head) of the penis is designed to be an internal organ as with most male creatures, where the sensing receptors of the glans is protected and kept from becoming dried desensitized regular skin. The foreskin is designed to slide back and expose the most feeling full parts during sexual activity<br>  and cover then again after for protection. Just like the eye lid protects the eyeball from being damaged by environmental contact, so does the foreskin to the glans.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits to circumcision...only damage to future experiences to the male. I'm totally thankful to my parents for havin the wisdom to keep me the way that I arrived because of my early 22 year old marriage experiences that would have been far damaged otherwise.<br>  <br>  For an infant, it's remote to consider a sex life, but that is the total reason for having a penis. For peeing, a little hole anywhere in the body would work just fine.<br>  <br>  The reasons for circumcision and the tradition in the US was based on the warped Victorian aspect of hindering boy masturbation, and the idea of damaging male sensitivity to reduce their level of pleasure. Lame excuses have been made ever since to try to support it and the medical world declares that it's unnecessary surgery.<br>  <br>  Check ..the history of circumcision on the web and do so on You Tube as well....an eye opener.<br>  <br>  Circumcision a very negative and traumatic thing, yet someone here considers not being supportive of it as a negative attitude...."warped reasoning".<br>  <br>  The rest of the world aside from Jewish and Islamic people do not circumcise and the US is now down to 50 %.<br>  <br>  Tell your doctor no, and save your self his easy money which is another part behind this damaging torture.<br>  <br>  Your son will thank you like I thank my parents. The biggest point that keeps getting forgotten is that the penis belongs to the boy and he gets to live with the result for his whole life.<br>  <br>  People just somehow fail to get this, and the decision needs to his and his alone when he is old enough to evaluate what the difference would make for him! That's why it's molestation of a boy at it's worst with totally irreversible damage. His will is totally negated.    <br>  <br>  I see law suits in the future by sons who were damaged in their ..to them most important parts... while helpless and unable to defend themselves. It equates to physically damaging molestation at it's worst and the emotional or psychological consequences is still being determined.<br>  <br>  That's a bad site to send people to ? Kyleigh's Momma ?..it gives a bunch of false benefits to circumcision and tells absolutely nothing of the benefits to the boy by not being circumcised which 88% of the worlds population is aware of.<br>  <br>  That site is also bent on damaging the glans of boys that are natural by saying to dry rub the glans after a bath! Wrong! the whole idea of a foreskin is to protect the glans from the feelings receptors from being damaged by action like that. You NEVER dry rub the penis knob or the eyeballs. Clean rinse water can stay there with no problem at all. Dry rubbing can, aside from permanent feelings reduction, do micro abrasion to this sensitive membrane, causing an opening for infection. You also use baby shampoo there..not soap, and it's great for all your life. I question the intent of this site? <br>  <br>  I'm a bit pissed over the ignorance and am kind of ranting a bit...not like Me! :- )   <br>  <br>  Little girls are also far tougher to keep clean in that area, and someone mentioned little boys will be boys...now what is that supposed to mean? Do they take filth and put it on their penis? There is such a sexist disregard for little boys while little girls are the ones who are so guarded..While little boys.".Oh! whatever".."pigs"!!<br>  <br>  ( Watch out for "Mommy To Zoe and Isaiah" ..she's a pro-circumcisionist! )....can it get worse than when you see this kind of thing of people trying to negate others information just to support their bias?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I recommend no...it's cruel and unnecessary.

But then I googled it and looked at the way that they do it and I was horrified.  The baby screamed horrifically because obviously it hurt him so badly.  I  was adamant that I wouldn't get my son circumsized at all because I would refuse to allow someone to hurt my son like that.  But the doc came to circumsize Kingston when I was asleep, and his father gave them permission to do it.  When I woke up and he told me that they came to take Kingston away, I was enraged!  I was trying to track them down before they could do it!  But apparently it only takes like 10 minutes to do and by the time I had raised holy hell in that hospital, my poor little son was clipped and snipped.<br>  <br>  They brought him in right after and he was sound asleep.  They'd given him pain medication for it and he'd gone to sleep pretty quickly afterwards.  I thought he'd cried himself to sleep and I was raising hell, and the nurse said no, they gave him a local anestetic and he'd just gone to sleep.  <br>  <br>  So, he's circumsized and looks like daddy and they tell me that it's cleaner and will aid in his fight against infections of sorts, but I'm not so sure if I ever have another baby boy that I will let them do it.  It looked really icky for a few days afterward like it hurt... but he didnt act like it hurt... go figure.<br>  <br>  All in all, it's a personal choice.  Kingston didnt seem any worse for the wear because of it, so it's good I think that he looks like daddy.  That's who he will identify with so i want his self image to be a good one.|`|AA11987492	I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis.... they are the ones that are missing parts<br>  <br>  One of the worst things you can do as a mother, is give your child cosmetic surgery to make them "fit in". Basically, you are saying, there is something wrong with you, you had to be fixed, and you should base your self esteem on what others think of you". Actions speak louder than words you know. If you are doing it because "That is what everyone else is doing" All I am going to say is, don't ever say no to your kids when they want to do something that is harmful to their health and they just want to fit in. Kids come home drunk or high? No problem, they just wanted to be "normal", You don't want them to be teased do you?????<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Boys can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim?

There is also a small possibility that things can go drastically wrong:<br>  <a href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/cac_complications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a><br>  There is also evidence that the pain and discomfort of circumcision disrupts the mother-son bond and also breast feeding. Some evidence suggests the trauma of circumcision has long-term psychological effects.<br>  <br>  So why not keep him intact? There is no care at all for an intact boy. A few things you need to remember:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seel to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision )<br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it. It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced. The ability to retract it occurs any time up until the end of puberty.<br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.

It is an important part of the penis. It contains many nerves on it's underside. When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable. Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect. So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.

The glans dries out. It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.

mf3OOagMaa	First, let me say that I am sorry. I know this must be a hard time for you.<br>  Second, your doctor is probably letting nature take its course. He can't really perform a D&C - because there isn't a fetus, but if there is a "placenta" he might be able to do something.<br>  Perhaps you can talk to him about taking the morning after pill or some sort of stimulant that will help you release the lining of your uterus. The theory is if you have your period, your body will be tricked into realizing that it isn't really pregnant.<br>  Check out babycenter.com or webmd, both sites have a lot of information that may help you along...Good luck!|`|uLeg1Aniaa	What is a phantom pregnancy?

My two year old started having them around 11 months. She doesn't have them every night but when she does it's the same thing you are describing. She sits up in bed and just screams and is absolutely inconsolable. The best thing to do is not wake him. I will lay her back down and tuck her in and rub her face or hum or quietly shh her and that calms her down. Sometimes I will lay in her bed with her and she seems to be comforted by that. The more you try to talk to them or pick them up the more upset they get. Calm movements and a quiet voice will soothe him back to sleep. Good luck : )
s1utniuvaa	Look at some of these ladies bellies! I am 17 weeks and look about 6-7 months. People don't believe me until I tell them its twins. Also my 3rd pregnancy. I know I am gonna be huge. I wish I took pics to document the ever swelling belly lol...|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Wowzers!  My sister had twins and she wasn't nearly as big as you are when she was 19 weeks.  Maybe there's 3 in there!  My sister's girl were only 4 pounds when they were born, so she really didn't get super huge.  You might just have big and healthy babies in there!  :)<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	I was enormous when I got pregnant with my son, at 20 weeks I looked closer to 30, each pregnancy is different.

I was that big at 33 weeks and gave birth by c-section. Then again, you are having twins, so I would assume your size is accurate with the length of time you've been pregnant. Unless, there was an inaccurate calculation when you provided the doc with the date of your last menstrual cycle.|`|0iAGnjFvaa	well everyone is different, my mom was HUGE after only 3 months with me, she's very tiny so i overwhelmed her<br>  <br>  maybe you have very big healthy meaty babies =)<br>  <br>  i think you're normal, your body knows what its doing|`|sufom9OKaa	Wow!

BxrU8kUJaa	Mine was about a 60% abruption and it happened very quickly during labor.  There isn't usually a clear cut cause for it.  I had pre-eclampsia and was being induced and when they broke my water it wasn't long after I started bleeding out.  It's absolutely the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life and I went almost immediately into shock, but somehow still managed to have a rather calm conversation about not being interested in waiting for an epidural because I just wanted to be put out to stop the pain....<br>  <br>  Sometimes small abruptions happen during pregnancy and cause bleeding etc and they usually treat it with bedrest until it's safe to deliver.|`|AA10063059	you hemorrhage,you would know when it happened,you would need complete bed rest and lifting  heavy items can cause it but so can a lot of other things,just do as your doctor  tells you|`|xNkmK0SHaa	There is not yet scientific information to prove the cause or time of beginning.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask your obstetrician and/or see: <br>  <a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/placental_abruption.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Ato...</a>
zmM4u4qmaa	I also have an 18-month old son.  I know it's hard, but my advice to you is to offer him only what the rest of the family is eating, and if he won't eat it then let him skip the meal. Just put the food in front of him and let him decide whether to eat it or not, without pressure from you. Also, if he skips a meal don't let him graze or beg for food in between scheduled eating times. <br>  <br>  As long as you're offering tasty nutritious food for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and scheduled snacks he won't be hungry for long because if he skips lunch he'll have a chance to eat again at snacktime in a few hours.   He won't let himself starve, although at the beginning when you first start trying this you will have a crabby boy while the minutes count down to the next meal!  <br>  <br>  I have found the book listed below to be a huge help in shaping the way we feed our son.  The author's main idea is that all the parents can control is when and what food is offered, and the child is the only one responsible for whether and how much to eat.  Highly recommended!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	First, stop offering chicken nuggets so much.  Start having him just eat whatever you're eating.  Someone once told me that it's the parents' job to provide a variety of healthy foods, and it's the child's job to eat.  You can't force him to eat, and he won't let himself starve.<br>  <br>  Do not turn mealtime into a battle and try to force him to eat.  Just give the opportunity to do so, and try to enjoy your own meal.  <br>  <br>  You can make things fun, too.  You can give him applesauce, ketchup, or another dipping sauce to dip things in. You can give him his own plate/bowl/utensils to eat with. You can give him tastes of food off your plate. My 18-month-old likes when we tease him and tell him not to eat his green beans (or whatever).  He just grins and takes a huge bite.  Just keep offering, and try not to make a big deal out of it.<br>  <br>  Between meals, offer snacks of fruits and veggies, and he'll get used to eating those again.  Canned veggies (we get the no salt kind) actually work really well at this age because they're softer than fresh or frozen veggies.  If he doesn't want to eat, but is hungry later, you can either offer his reheated meal or a healthy snack (fruit, veggie, cheese, yogurt, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Kids also like some things that we might consider unusual -- for example, my kids love cold peas (if they're in the fridge from the previous night's leftovers).  I serve them as an "appetizer" with toothpicks to pick them up while I cook the rest of dinner, and they think it's really fun.<br>  <br>  I have a 5-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an 18-month-old, and while they've all gone through some phases of eating less and being a little picky, we've continued to offer a variety of foods and encouraged them to take at least a few bites. They're all good eaters with very, very few foods that they really don't want to eat.|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Stop offering those items he eats, and only offer everything else. It won't be long before his stomach takes control over his taste buds and he'll eat!! He won't starve!|`|9BsyKN9haa	My son is the same way and he is 5 now, What i do is make breakfast his biggest and most healthiest meal! I also cut back on snacks and by lunch and dinner he is pretty hungry.|`|r63DBSATaa	Okay.. That isn't going to keep your son very healthy. You need to feed him vegetables. Vegetables help his hair growth, his height, and his blood flow. <br>  <br>  You should try making a stew and mush up the vegtables with the meat and flavours. Like, chomp them up til theyre real itty bitty. Maybe he won't know the difference? You could try cooking the vegetables in a special flavoring. Teraki sounds good. Or, you should say you can't eat your desert until you eat your vegtables! And if he throws a tantrom just don't give him his desert and tell him this is the way it is. Either you eat you vegetables and you get desert, or you don't. But don't make the desert somthing not too unhealthy.|`|rMuBHXg5aa	By all means let him eat what he likes. My grandson is the same way.He is 7 now and just starting to try new things. I know how stubborn they can be. I always gave a good multi-vitamin daily.<br>  Keep trying to offer new things but don't get upset with him if he won't...you could try making different things look more appealing also like make him an octopus hotdog...you can find kid recipes online.<br>  I also found that if I let him help me prepare something there was a better chance that he would at least try it. Also, if you do succeed in geting him to try something, and he still don't like it, try again another time....I've heard that it can take up to ten times of tasting something before they acquire a taste for it.|`|1qHTk1Lhaa	Go pick up a copy of The Sneaky Chef by Missy Chase Lapine!!!  It's been such a helpful way to get my 18 month old girl to eat her veggies and the best part is she doesn't even know she has eaten any!!!  For lasagne (my daughter will eat this but not spaghetti for whatever reason...) I puree up 2 cups of cauliflower and mix it in with the spaghetti sauce and make the lasagne as usual.  The biggest thing is just to match the color of the veggie as close as you can to the color of whatever you're cooking so that the little one can't detect it's even there.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  Also, make a big salad or something healthy you will eat when he has a snack and a lot of times the kiddos feel pretty special to eat lettuce or whatever if it comes off of mom's or dad's plate.
aJLx0nhNaa	Does he have issues that have been diagnosed by a pediatrician?  If not, I'd just let him be a baby.  They have their own methods for learning problem solving and it's kept the species doing pretty well up to now.

You don't need him, he'll ruin your life.|`|Jgfvr05naa	Maybe it's best if yall are just friends.|`|xl7Ifj2Maa	Okay, so I'm going to be straight up with you. There is no such thing as perfect, especially when he doesn't trust you at all as you said. Trust is the most important thing in a relationship, and if you don't have that then I don't see why you're together. Talk to him about this, and let him know that if you're his girlfriend, there has to be some trust there. How long have you known each other? Do you guys have good communication? Why doesn't he trust you? Consider these things first off. You should try to open up to each other, and maybe he will feel more comfortable with trusting you. Otherwise, it doesn't seem to me like you guys are together. Also, I'm not sure what you think is sarcastic or what you would consider mean, but if it really is, then tell him to stop it because it bothers you. But if it's just little sarcastic comments, loosen up. Many people have a sarcastic side and don't mean anything by it. I suggest you rethink this "perfect" thing, because it seems to me that you are lacking the most vital component of a good relationship.|`|U1AFYGzZaa	he may be perfect in all other aspects<br>  but not where it matters<br>  u HAVE GOT to be able to trust him!<br>  thats the MOST important<br>  if u cannot trust the person your with, that person is not worth being with<br>  <br>  tell him how he makes u feel, and what it is that he does that makes u feel this way. if he decides to try changing, give him a chance [but also a time frame] if he is unwilling to change and scoffs at ur feelings, dumb that sry ***|`|n5URUEqXaa	Tell him to cut it out.<br>  Sarcasm is cute until it starts to hurt.<br>  <br>  Ask him why he is being so rude to you, and ask him why he can't trust you.<br>  <br>  "If you can't trust me or even be nice to me, you are going to lose the best thing that has ever happened to you."|`|wfGGIOLJaa	How in the world is that perfect??

dKTPewhTaa	I had a daycare in my home so there were things that the children were taught to leave alone.   It took a lot of repetition.  They are curious and that is good, but they must also be taught to respect things.  You have to try and let her get one book at a time and show her how to put it back and then get another.  It is a long repetitive process, but with love and patience you should be able to teach your toddler the discipline she needs.  You can't just allow her to continue that behavior because that behavior will spill over into other areas of her social development.  You must have patience and explain each and every time.

Board books go in there, and can be pitched in in a quick heap by you or by your 18mo, and then just slide the containers onto the shelves and you have your floor back fairly quickly.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	good idea from proud mummy! plus try the psych thing and make a big deal of her books and NEVER go near yours when shes around. as for anything with todlers, whatever you pay attention to is what they will go for. and when you say dont touch that is waht they will touch. make the effort to focus only on what she can have and do and you will see a difference almost straigt away. i dont believe in putting things higher as this just teaches them to climb at an early age however when there is somehing precious and you dont have eyes in your butt, so put them away or contain them or put them out of reach. better still out of sight. make life easier andbrighter for yourself and child. all our lives are full of temptation. not just for toddlers but for adults too. think about this. waht would you rather be done with the things that are most tempting for you taht you know you shouldnt have or do? afterall your toddler is jsut a smaller version of yourself!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I have a 17 month old, and we have the same problem.  Our concept though, is that as long as something is not dangerous we do not move it, but rather teach them not to touch it.  That is what we do with the books.  If she goes after the shelves that are not hers, we firmly tell her no, put those books back and then show her which books she can use.  It might be an instant fix, but eventually she will learn.<br>  <br>  Make sure those book shelves are anchored to the wall!|`|J6JFiNL8aa	theres your mistake......shes your sweet little girl with an obsession...<br>  <br>  <br>  she is also old enough to start knowing right from wrong and to start learning to respect things.....teach her not to and when you see her throwing them make her pick them up|`|PeOCqztoaa	I have two 2 year olds and I am constantly picking up books and toys all day long. They love to pull them all out of the bin and throw them on the floor. Can you move the bookcase where she can't get into it and just give her her books? I have a range of books too and anything that is not a board book gets torn up so I finally moved all of the older books to the top shelf in her closet and only left the board books down for her to play with. There's less of them to pick up and the other ones stay safe for later. She's just having fun, she doesn't realize what a big mess she's making. Maybe with less books to throw the clean up will be easier : )|`|t1fx6kXcaa	My son also used to take books off the bookshelf and throw them on the floor. Saying "no" and taking the book off him and putting it back on the shelf simply did not work when he was 18 months. He's now 23 months and has finally learnt not to do it. I put my son portable cot/playpen in front of the bookcase to stop him from being able to get to the books. I put a few of his books in is toy box so he had regular access to them. It may not look pretty but putting chairs or a playpen etc in front of the bookcase will prevent your daughter from accessing the books. <br>  Good luck.|`|zJamClb2aa	we stapled a piece of elastic to our book case in front of the books except the bottom shelf (which is where their baby books were) it keeps them up there! My MIL just id very firm at her house abut them not touching books. As my kids have gotten older we have changed the staples into snaps (which I just hot glued on) now the older ones can get ones down they want to read and it helps them keep the books tidy! good luck!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I was going to answer a glass door also. or a plastic door. Something to cover it upor if u can face your bookshelf the other way so the side of the books face the wall|`|AA12227599	Some of these answers are insane. Glass doors? How easy is that to put up ?? Not to mention dangerous. As far as putting them out of her reach that is also a very bad answer. what are you supposed to do ? Nail everything to the ceiling?  As well as hitting her with a stick. Are you serious ? She's a baby. <br>  What you need to do is stop her after the first book and tell her no. You may have to do it over and over again, but if you are consistent she will get it eventually and learn not to make a mess with them. Parenting is alot of hard work, but if you do it correctly, the rewards are endless.<br>  Just make sure the book shelf is attached to the wall so it can't fall on her. I did mine with big screws with circles on the end and really strong string.
dKTPewhTaa	Keep a diary to show to his pediatrician of what he has eaten and when he has thrown up.  This important information to help determine if it is a food allergy reaction.   Also, if it is something more serious, such as a disease, (my niece had a very rare cancer and they always told her it was nerves making her sick and throwing up.  She was just like 7 or 8 Turns out she had a rare cancer children can get and it almost killed her by the time she was in high school.)  This is not to scare you, but you have to pay attention to what is happening with your children because doctors need all the information they can get and not just base it on what's happening in the home life.  <br>  Also, my son was having a rough time in school in the third grade because one of the teachers was always making the kids cry and telling them terrible things.  He was not one of those, but he couldn't stand how she treated the other students.  When we removed him from her classroom he never had that problem again.  Good luck with your son.|`|sLkruqYVaa	take him to the pediatrician it's not a normal thing for a child to be thowing up frequently even if it isn t every day|`|dnEmjUkNaa	i have a three year old brother who does the same thing! except he usually does it later in the evening. has anything  happened that would make him upset or want more attention? the reason i ask, is because my parents are going through a divorce and the pediatrician told my mom that this is his way of reacting to his dad not being in the house anymore and stuff like that.|`|r63DBSATaa	Find out what he throws up and when he does. He may be allergic to a food. He may also be not chewing it down the right way. In case, you should try taking him to a doctor or ask someone else who has children about it. Do this check after you've seen what food he throws up. If it isn't a pattern, if it is different foods every time. .. Maybe he isn't feel well? It could possibly be the weather or the way someone treats him.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't eat enough vegetables that could also mean something!!|`|9BsyKN9haa	YES! My son was allergic to something he was eating!|`|2vBfY2ZLaa	probably being bullied
W9tWGUxcaa	Billy Blanks recommends that you actually increase your caloric intake while doing his workouts.  Take your weight and multiply it by ten to see how many calories you should be taking in daily.  10X180 is 1800.  If you continue to eat 1000-1200 calories a day you're going to be way to tired to do all this exercising.  I recommend you eat more healthy food and just cut down on the snacks.  You don't have to go hungry to lose weight.  I've been doing Tae Bo for a month now, one hour per day 5 days per week.  I only lost five pounds, but I was already close to my ideal weight so that was all I wanted to lose.  I lost that within the first week and now I notice that the muscles in my arms are noticeably larger and I can even see abs starting out.  It's a great way to get in shape, and lose weight, but I would recommend doing the Tae Bo for closer to an hour each day.
dKTPewhTaa	You should check with your pediatrician.  Something must not be right.  You didn't give enough information about what is preceding the episodes.  Keep a diary of the times and what the child was doing before and how you responded as well.  Like do you yell and scream back at the child.  It sounds tedious, but if you can write down and then have something to analyze what might be precipitating these episodes then your life can get some normalcy back into it.  Share your diary with your pediatrician.  Good luck|`|wqL84O8Naa	sounds like he needs some attention...maybe your other kids are causing you to not give him what he needs. instead of fighting him, try spending some time with him|`|3nuI4uK4aa	LEAVE HIM ALONE FOR LIKE AND HOUR AND HE WILL CALM DOWN TRUST ME ON THIS PLEASE|`|r63DBSATaa	That's tough. Babies scream because they want the attention or because some thing is hurting or bothering them.<br>  <br>  Best advice from me is to feed him, get him a toy and lock him in the room. As terrible as that sounds..<br>  <br>  OH. Maybe you should get a babysitter?
bHCssC0zaa	I had same feeling when I started working.my first and only son was 7 months that time,oh god!he was so small not even crawling and I had to leave him.<br>  I was latterly crying that time.<br>  He was missing me,but my MIL said he stays happy,<br>  I started work as we need it and I got good job<br>  More than that I m frm Asain family,my in-laws satys with us,so I just wanna get rid of spending whole day sitting on same couch where my MIL is!lol<br>  <br>  But I spend good time when go home  with my son who is 19 months now.<br>  Now I feel as he sats with 2 different people he enjoys more nad does not get bored looking same face all time.<br>  And u will see the everyday,of course.<br>  Morevover they will take nap in between and 8-9 hours goes like very fast.<br>  So don’t worry,the will b used to it and happy whrn they will go outside and play with their age kids.|`|97361e0bea1a7c814e1e0591ab668edaaa	First things first, Your children wont stop seeing you as their mother once you spend time to play with them, read to them and to continue doing the things that mother's do with their children. I know your gonna be tired but try even if its to go home and take a quick nap first but you can even put your kids in the bed with you and allow then to play or watch television while you rest.Its all about making time for your children , you going to work is for the betterment of your family and they will appreciate it, but also try to squeeze in some time when you get home in the evenings to play with them, ask the elder one about her day etc, talk to them and interact with them and let them know you appreciate them and love them.|`|SctVGkaHaa	You have no reason to worry Hun. I understand the apprehensive feelings you may be experiencing. But look at the pluses. Your children will make friends, learn comunication skills, & also other little things "school" may offer. Such as picking up new words, or leanring a new color. & there's nothing better than going to pick up your child at the end of the day, & having their faces light up & come running to you yelling mommyyyyy! See how excited your child is to show you what they've made or done that day. At the same time you know that she/he was in a safe & fun environment. While you were able to make money to provide for them & make sure they have the best in life. Don't not worry that your children will lose you as "mommy". They love you. & every evening they know that they can spend time with mommy & do all the things they love enjoying with you.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	No  hun it just makes your kids value way more the rest of the time they have with you! I was worried about the same thing i leave my daughter with my grandma and i work 8 hours a day mon-friday from 7:30am to 3:30 pm and I just loveeeeeee picking her up after work and seeing her get so happy yelling" MOMMMYY" and runnning to give me a hug.n the first few days are hard because she would cry and yell "mommy no!! sit!" she wanted me to sit at my grandmas like when we go visit but she got over it my little cousins are all there and she enjoys being there now and learned so much more from being there I am hispanic and I speak to her in spanish and now that she is going to my grandmas from being around all the other little kids she's picking up on English really fast. It'll all be ok hun trust me I know it's hard but you'll get through it! =] good luck|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	i don't think your kids will not think of you as your mommy anymore, just try and explain to the 2 and half year old that mommy needs to work so when moms at work they will be there at the day care with their friends and when mommy si done working she will come get them. Its not like you will be away from them for days at a time, you will see them every day and no one will be taking your place. I know it can be  hard but it will work out my 2 cousins spent a lot of their infant, pre school and grade school years in day care because my aunt and uncle both had to work full time jobs, but they never forgot who their parents were. Also look at the positive side of the situation, they will make friends and they will learn how to socialize better at a younger age and if they are learning things like ABC's.colors,shapes it usually gives them a heads up when it comes time for school.|`|379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	I stayed home with my daughter till she was almost 3 and then i put her in preschool 5 days a week and got a part time job at a bank. It was really hard at first but eventually we got adjusted. A few months later i went from part time to FT and instead of picking her up at 3:00 i would pick her up at 4:30. It really just makes the time we do have together more special. It does, however, leave a lot less time to cook, clean and grocery shop so unfortunately laundry piled up more than before. If you are okay with leaving things like that undone to snuggle up and read a book with them or take a trip to the park you and your children will be fine! They will ALWAYS know you are mommy and always know that you love them!
ksoMldqYaa	Sounds a lot better than having 19 real children... if it makes you happy, go for it!  I have two cats that are treated like kids.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	To attach human emotions to an inanimate object is a sign of emotional instability.<br>  Maybe you should ask yourself why you do this?<br>  Why not own a pet or even HAVE a baby.<br>  I'm afraid I don't understand the appeal.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'm not interested. I have a real life doll here who breathes and eats and poops all over the place. That keeps me busy enough.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No but I did have a game once where you raised virtual babies. I had about 27|`|qSmCA82Aaa	I actually seen this before!  When I worked for a cable company i  had to go into a bunch of different houses and there was a lady with about 17 dolls.  She had a very nice 5 bedroom house and lived alone.  One of the rooms was the dolls school room that had a bunch of little desk, one was there bedroom where they had a closet and drawers full of clothes then she had a play room I don't remember what the last room was but this lady was very serious she had them all named and they were her babies!<br>  <br>    But to answer your question No I could not I'm sorry but I do not see how they are like kids.  They do not cry, laugh, smile, grow or anything.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Dolls and kids have nothing in common at all.<br>  <br>  Collecting Dolls can be a great hobby, I own many myself, but there is no way you can compare them to a real child.<br>  <br>  How to you raise something that is not alive?

The rewards of raising children don't come along w/ dolls.  If I couldn't have children I'd be raising animals (not that I'm not already, lol).|`|hKJIDdVqaa	funny you mention it, for the life of me I cannot get my daughter to play with dolls or most things "girl".  Her brother and her use the doll houses for war forts and army men, perhaps toy dogs.  Dolls and barbies ar reserved specifically for pulling heads off and tying up with bungee cords to hang off the stair way for "booby traps".
SyuGWtq0aa	It must be heartbreaking for you when she does this but please try to not take it to heart because she doesn't know what she is saying.  Why not try saying something like "well mummy loves nanna too and she loves you very much". Hope this helps!.|`|xs3T8piqaa	You take no notice, at the age of three our emotional intellect is not nearly developed enough to understand all the complexities of love.  Smile at her and think: "Isn't she sweet and innocent!".  If she were 13 or 23 it would be very different, but she's just a babe.  Don't feel either upset or cross about it, that's a little childish on your part.|`|ODYrypwaaa	She only knows that it makes you mad.  She probably at that point in time was favoring nanna because nanna probably lets her get away with things like not taking naps, eating candy etc.  Your daughter totally loves you!  Sometimes as Mama we have to be the "bad Guy" because we know what is best for our kids.|`|r63DBSATaa	Oh, wow.. She says that? <br>  <br>  You should get Mummy to tell her she loves her alot and eventually the Mummy should ask "Do you love me too? I know you love me too!" then the little girl will say I love you too mommy.<br>  <br>  But seriously, at that young, she doesnt really know much. When shes older she will realize all that youve done for her and she will be very happy and youll know she loves you.|`|7IHMjy2caa	You stay calm and tell her, "well mummy loves you." Sometimes a 3 year old will think they can only love one person or will say it because they are mad at you. <br>  <br>  My daughter (3.5 years) says this a lot. I tell her whoever it is she doesn't love, loves her. It also builds trust because she knows that we will love her even when she is being ornery.|`|4LIbHFPpaa	Shes knows it will make you upset and (for example) get her sweets, so don't let her win. I know what she says is upsetting. But traits like this that se picks up young, will continue in life, and this will be a worse problem when shes older. Just be plain and simple and tell her this isn't a way to get things, and that even though she is saying these things you still love her.

As soon as I got my act together and toughened up she stopped saying it to me and I get more cuddles now - even though she does that to get something from me normally lol <br>  So when she does it just act like your not bothered, say "ok, fair enough" and carry on as normal.She does it to get a reaction and if she gets one she'll keep doing it..So chin up!! don't let these cheeky monkeys beat us down lol|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	my goodness,u dont worry or react at all!ALL children go thru this stage,sometimes preffering mom,granny,auntie,etc.if she sees it upsets u,she will use it to gain an instant reaction from u.dont let that happen,just quietly and vaguely say "oh,thats ok'.it will soon die out due to ut lack of concern/interest.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	My son says exactly the same thing.

In point of fact, what they mean is, "I love THAT my nanna feeds me sweets on a drip more than the fact that YOU make me eat my vegetables!".<br>  <br>  Rest assured that it is you she loves, you could respond by saying "oh really, that's a shame, because I love you very very much" and you will probably find that she will instantly come back with "I love you mummy".  Proving without a shadow of a doubt that she does not mean that she doesn't love you!<br>  <br>  She will grow out of it too, and in the meantime, try to take what she says with a pinch of salt, I know it's easier said than done, but it will not be long before she is able to say exactly what she means.<br>  x<br>  <br>  by the way a lot of stupid people who've never heard a toddler are answering you.

You are acknowledging how she feels about nanna and playing down her comment about you.  If you really want to respond to this head on say "That's OK.  I love you."  You will show her unwavering acceptance and love while teaching her that it's OK to express her feelings.  Deep down she loves you the best.

And kids will be kids.  I'm not saying its right, but everyone views things differently.<br>  <br>  We send our son to a private Christian daycare because they value and teach the same things we do.  You have to find a daycare that best matches how you would be raising your child.<br>  <br>  If you find your daycare to be incompatible, that doesn't mean its terrible, but perhaps not right for you.|`|BqIG9l5maa	Find another day care!|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	Is this  a day care center or a home?  Centers have way more kids than adults to have one on one time with them.  I grew up in a home that did daycare.  My mother had a max of 12 kids but rarely had that many mostly in summer and no school days.  She had a scheduled out day for them.  Learning abcs 123's colors, then story time, usually a walk around the lake before lunch outside play time and the kids took home a new craft every day.  It was a lot like a school or a learning classroom than a place where kids can just run amuck as they please.  I'm 41/2 months pregnant and I'm going to be really picky about my daycare because I know there are people out there that do this.  <br>  <br>  Side note: All the kids that went to her daycare were always a+ students because they had such a head start when they were toddlers.
hKJIDdVqaa	LOL, your child plays dogs too. Oh thank God, I thought my two were the only ones.  One thing I noticed at this young of an age children want there friend to do as they say while they are in their house.  they do not understand hospitality nor do they care.  We very rarely if ever allow sleep overs for this exact reason.  Mine do not like to go to their friends houses either.  So yes it is normal.|`|uP08b6K4aa	It's all very very normal!  Children like to state their place and are very territorial especially over toys and games and the best advice I can give you is to encourage them to play downstairs in full view so you can watch what they're doing, they're less likely to play up if they fear they're being watched.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	I'd agree with Anon, at that age they tend to think that as they're in their "territory" so to speak they say what happens.  It doesn't occur to them to be considerate and let their visitors make the choice. It's usually a little later when they begin to pick up the social niceties and be a little less self-centred.  It will come, quite normal.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I always listened in o my kids play dates. Before it got to the point your describing I would intervene and teach them how to compromise. There are a lot of different ways to handel each situation. Sharing,taking turns,and compromising are skills that need to be taught. The sooner the better.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Book a birthday party at McDonalds.<br>  No wrecked house, no tidying up, no washing up and plenty to keep them all amused.<br>  The McHosts will take care of them. <br>  Give yourself a break and sit back and enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Just an idea?|`|ROJans2Taa	my daughter is exactly like that as well, I had to explain if you cant take turns playing what each other wants then they arnt going to want to come back, it's hard when they've usually play what they want and then all of a sudden have someone telling them what to play. my daughter is 7 now and seems to be getting better, she mainly goes to her aunts house (her aunt is actually 3 weeks younger then her, long story) and they play great most times. it does get better, best luck|`|nfzQkvqraa	In our house we have a rule. If you want a friend to come over understand ahead of time that the guest gets to choose what to play.  If you can not agree to that, the friend does  not come over.  <br>  <br>  I think it's polite to let your company choose what to do as they may feel less comfortable than your child. I  also think it should be your child's choice when he's over at friend's houses.<br>  <br>  It cuts down on the tension a lot when you make that rule.|`|cYWzhcwoaa	It can be hard having friends round for a six/seven year old - it is so different from being at school because, it's all about welcoming someone else into your 'home' territory. Once he has had a few friends round it should start to settle down a bit. Try and see it from his point-a-view - it's his home and he has to share it.|`|AA11612508	he seems like the oldest child. your lil girl is probably just used to her getting told what to do by them,...hence they play well together so you say.<br>  <br>  he needs to understand social skills. honestly when my daughter has friends over the friend always chooses what game to play, i always make the friend go first etc. i am teaching my daughter that to be a hostest its about letting them  go first etc. <br>  <br>  you need to teach him some skills to play with other kids. nobody likes a person who tells everyone what tto do.|`|rUC7WHLVaa	sounds like he does not like to NOT get his way..my daughter was like that for a while untill I stopped letting the company come over and she decided she would change her attitude....she learned a little respect and give and take...we had many talks to her about ( being the kid that no one wants to play with) things are a lot different now! Good luck.|`|fEMuqDWbaa	I Don`t have any children but I raised my kid sisters <br>  video games I think have ruined many of life`s and brilliant minds <br>  You might want to take the game from him and tell him if he shares then you will let him play! And only if he shares!|`|2mla6m51aa	He might not be getting along with them in school or one of them is being rude<br>  but also he might be used to having family there and he is use to them
xif22nwoaa	They do an amnio at that point to check lung maturity before inducing.  With you already being 37 weeks, and having received the steroid shots, there is an excellent chance that your baby's lungs are mature.  I don't know that it's necessary.  The risks of an amnio are much less at this point in the pregnancy than they are earlier on, but there are still some risks associated with it.  If it were me, I probably wouldn't do it at this point.|`|ROJans2Taa	it depends on why they are inducing, if they are going to induce either way regardless of the results, then I persoanlly wouldnt bother, most babies are mature at 37 weeks, my daughter was born then naturally she was 7lbs 7ounces and had an apgar score of 9. I would ask the doc his opinion, most times they will let you know how much it's really needed. best luck|`|bqFk1du8aa	I wouldn't do it, they're dangerous and they give false positives.  Just patiently wait on your little bundle of joys arrival.  And 37 weeks is very close to full term. I had twins at 37 weeks and they went home w/in 2 days of being born.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	They are checking for air bubbles to see if the baby's lungs are developed enough for him to be delivered. At 37 weeks the baby is probably good, I wouldn't do the amnio, I've heard horror stories about them. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	Dont do the amnio. There is NO reason for you to have an amniocentesis at 37 weeks. Just be induced if thats what he wants to do.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I would never do it.  It is so risky!|`|aIgI0FOXaa	at 37weeks it is not worth the risk as the amnio can have complications im not saying it will but unless it is really necessary then i personally wouldn't bother
GWveqx61aa	the only advice i have is to wait a couple more days and re test, or have md do a blood test?~☆good luck☆~?
Pf9fyEyQaa	You've lost two babies, of course you and your husband are going to be sad.  You can order tests done to see if there was any abnormalities with the baby as well as tests on your progesterone levels and such to see if there was any cause.  Most of the time there isn't, but if there is you can prevent it from happening next time.  My mom lost two babies before having me.  She was extremely scared when she found out she was pregnant that she didn't even tell anyone for the first 6 months.  I came out at 9lbs 1oz, so very healthy that's for sure.  Grieve the loss of your baby and try again.  It's not going to be easy.  Give yourself some time if you need to and just enjoy some extra time with your husband.  It will happen!  The one quote I saw that would bring me comfort in this situation is:<br>  <br>  The angel looked down upon the baby and whispered, 'too beautiful for earth.'|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I know how you feel and you just have to remember it doesn't mean it will always happen. I had two also, and now I'm 40 weeks pregnant with a healthy little girl who will be here any day. I'm not going to tell you how to deal because I remember how hard it was and how much I was hurting. All I'll say is I am so so sorry and don't give up hope.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Oh I'm so sorry. I have never had any miscarriages so I really don't know what to say besides keep up faith you may have gone through this twice but eventually it's going to happen maybe your body just wasn't ready those last couple times. Maybe you should see a specialist and they might be able to recommended something to do so the next time you will have you baby. Again sorry for you loss|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I have had two miscarriages myself. I was younger but believe me the pain is really hard to bear. I am sorry that you have to go through this and I am sorry for what has happened. After my last miscarriage I thought the Doctors were right that I would never carry a baby to term or get pregnant. I developed a wicked infection at 16, lost my 1st baby. Then pregnant again at 18, lost that one too. The good news to all of this is that I am 33 and have 3 healthy kids. I can't say my pregnancy's were easy but there is HOPE. Give your body time to rest and try again. It is absolutely nothing that you did or did not do. Don't blame yourself. It is just Mother Nature's way. ***HUGS***|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I am so sorry for your loss.  I only had one miscarriage and that was painful.  The only thing that you can do is rely on each other for support.  Time does heal.  When I had my miscarriage I thought it was the end of the world.  I could not look at other pregnant women.  I conceived 3 months after my miscarriage and had twins.   My pregnany was so complicated that I thought I was going to lose them too.  My friend had 4 miscarriages before she conceived her first child and then she got pregnant again 3 months later.  So just give yourself time to heal and don't try to conceive straight away.  I hope things will get better for you.  Once and I am so sorry.  Take care|`|eD0MVJxUaa	I am so sorry you have to go through this.  My first pregnancy was a miscarriage at 8 weeks.  It was absolutely devastating to me and my husband.  The only way I could get through it was with friends and family support and love.  I came to realize it wasn't my fault and that things like this sadly just happen.  We tried again and now have 2 beautiful little girls and another baby on the way.  It will happen for you too.  Keep your hopes up!|`|ZnwKjH6waa	Im sooo sorry... i am goin through my 1st right now!!! it is very heartbreaking.. but i am tryin to come 2 terms wit it.... i just believe that our babies where 2 good for this earth... thats y god took them early!!! im sorry but dont give up hope... i kno i aint!!!  May God watch over our little angels!!!|`|8N4aPcpaaa	im so sorry my sisters friend had 2 miscarriages and like you was devastated very understandable but she went on to have  a healthy pregnancy which resulted in twins we always told her she got her 2 angels back...GOOD LUCK..!|`|H6GYZqHvaa	Wow, I'm very sorry to hear that.|`|8xrPFY3Jaa	I'm sorry, this must be absolutely awful for you. But i have some advice for you. My sister in law is a healthy young woman, 29 years old, with a healthy husband. Both were fine and well in the reproductive area, but she had experienced difficulty in getting pregnant and had two miscarriages, even after help from fertility clinics. To my surprise, they were determined to have the child they so desperately wanted, and deserved, so they pressed on, and today, she is approx 5 months pregnant with a healthy baby. I think sometimes things just happen for reasons we can't understand. Although it's hard and emotionally taxing, it sometimes pays to be persistent and faithful. Seeking some medical advice if you haven't yet, might also point you in the right direction. I wish you good luck in whatever you choose.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I am so sorry for your loss hun =(<br>  <br>  I have had 2 miscarriages...after my first I had two healthy pregnancies and my second was in Aug 2007.  I am now 23 weeks pregnant with a little boy so you can go on to have successful pregnancies.<br>  <br>  I know it's going to take time for you to grieve before you can even consider trying again but it's definitely having a chat with your GP to see if they can offer some kind of explanation.<br>  <br>  I know how you're feeling right now and my thoughts are with you x|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage! Im just going through my first one right now. This isnt your fault or your husband's fault. miscarriage is nature's safety net. pregnancy is one of the most complicated things in the world. if one little bitty thing goes wrong, a miscarriage happens so that you dont have a baby with developmental disabilities or serious illness. A second miscarriage just means that one little thing went wrong, probably on a chromosomal level. <br>       If you go to church, it might help you to talk to your clergyman or close friends. if you talk to people about this, you will find that most women you know had one or know someone else who has. Its VERY common. The best thing you can do is try to come to terms with it and try again once your body has had plenty of time to heal. Take your prenatals and keep yourself as healthy as you can. If you are concerned with your fertility, talk to your doctor and see about running some tests. You can also look into in-vitro fertilization, so they can choose the most healthy sperm and egg to minimize chance of genetic abnormalities. For now, seek comfort from your husband and family. Im so sorry for your loss.
Qo3zns1Caa	My daughter is the same way.  I make homemade Macaroni & Cheese, made with whole milk, real butter, and Barilla Plus pasta, which is enriched with protein and Omega 3's.  I make a double batch and freeze it into meal-size portions for her so I can heat them up on a daily basis.  She also eats a lot of whole milk yogurt, and I've gotten her to eat string cheese.  I started her on PB&J sandwiches when she was 1 year and she loves them!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2pypL9KRaa	My one-year-old is a vegetarian, so he doesn't eat any meat at all.  He has always loved beans, hummus, and tofu (we started young).  Try black bean burritos, soups with beans, cheese, yogurt, etc.  They really don't need all that much protein anyway and they get a lot of it from milk.  The general rule (for everyone) is to have 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  So, if your little one is 20 pounds, he only needs about 20 grams of protein per day.  Whole grain breads with some hummus or some graham crackers and fruit dipped in yogurt are an easy way to add a little protein.|`|jLppb1c2aa	one year olds can eat regular food cut up. give him cottage cheese, peanut butter, cheese, milk and try regular foods cut up...mine did not like baby food either...have you tasted it?

Give him vegetables NOT treats because then he will get into the habit of treats instead of those foods. Other then vegetables.<br>  <br>  Vegetables, meat, and carbs are the key to his growth.<br>  <br>  If you don't give him enough carbs a day that could be bad for him also.|`|06pm47Tiaa	just let it go or force him to.<br>  when i was 7 my mom nether forced me to eat or slap me if i don't eat it.|`|ZmzFiHc7aa	Give him a break from foods he won't eat and try again in a month or so and he just eat it then.  My son did that with eggs.  He's not much of a meat eater so I find it hard to make him meals sometimes.  Make sure to give him lots of fruit and veggies.  Avocados are a great fat for babies.  Have you tried perogies?  Also, what about pasta stuffed with a meat?  Meeting with a nutritionist might give you some suggestions too.|`|N7NJDvUPaa	Try different types of egg e.g. scrambled, boiled, fried if you have not already|`|1GxMGmkqaa	theres nothing wrong with not eating eggs ormeat. there are other foods which contain the same nutrients which will suffice for the moment. we dont want him turned off food so make a deal of different coloured foods and the textures of foods.1 yr old is just about a good age to start this and sets you both up for good eating havits later.<br>  even at one he owuld be taking notice of your every move. let him se you blend his food which is the same as the rest of the family. sit altoghter for the meal so he is not alone and can copy you. let him chew on your piece of meat or soft bone - there is nourishment in that.a lot of littlies cannot consume eggs safely at this age anyway as the white contains acids too strong for their digestive system. i swoulnt be concerned at this time about wha he wont eat. he will copy you as time goes by and eat anything! they generally taste the nutrient they need for their body.|`|cv0foxlTaa	Beans, yogurt, cheese, hummus.  Also, you can give him French toast and pancakes and other baked goods with eggs in them.|`|GT6396BDaa	Try getting him to eat other sources of protein, such as cheese, peanut butter(natural or organic if he'll eat it because it doesn't contain sugars, if not then regular peanut butter is fine), milk, yogurt, beans and bread.<br>  Some suggestions on ways to get your child to eat these foods are cheese pizza, tuna fish sandwich(if he will eat tuna fish), grilled cheese sandwich, peanut butter and jelly sandwich or on crackers, macaroni cheese, yogurt drinks for kids, green beans, etc..<br>  Some children go through phases of not eating certain foods.  For instance, if he doesn't like vegetables, try chopping them really fine and mixing them in spaghetti sauce and serve it over pasta with cheese.  My kids never knew they were eating vegetables, they just thought it was spaghetti. These are just some suggestions.  Your child will most likely grow out of this phase of not eating meat or eggs.  Best of luck.  Hope I helped.|`|95pvqcMpaa	Try giving him meat in small cut up pieces. By now he does not need it to be mushed up.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	cottage cheese, beans, yogurt|`|PeOCqztoaa	Beans and cheese are best.
QnJvJ67uaa	maybe a week?? Then take away the pants and make sure you have a good protector on your mattress.<br>  Good luck :)|`|Sn72zeBhaa	sometimes the nighttime pants are degrading to a child, making her feel worse about what is happening.  And the act of helping a parent clean the bed and wash sheets does more to instill a desire to make it stop.<br>  If you can manage, wake her before you go to bed to go to the bathroom.  Cut off drinks earlier (2 hours or more before bed) then you can allow a small drink just before bed without worry.  A thirsty child is just as likely to wet as one who has drank 3 glasses of water.<br>  <br>  Use a good mattress liner.  I have a 9 year old who still wets occasionally.  The more we stress about it, the more it will happen.<br>  It's not her fault. Counting nights is stressful.  Give her the benefit of the doubt and give it a shot.  Maybe it will clear up faster.  Keep the night time pants for sleepovers away from home if needed.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I would rather have a sound sleeper who wets, than a child who has sleep disorders, or other problems.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	365 nights|`|BRT2teSqaa	Ive heard that if a bedwetter stays dry for 60 consecutive nights than they are completely done wetting for good.
BcdbR6iSaa	I had a hard time catching my breath in the third trimester, and I still had alot of nausea. Everything turned out fine with me and my baby, but if it's getting to you really bad I would make a call to your doctor. They can hook you up to monitors and make sure everything is okay.  I wouldn't worry to much though, it all sound pretty normal to me. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|HvALvdc7aa	You're short of breathe b/c your baby is pressing against your lungs. That will get better once the baby drops. As far as feeling sick that's normal too b/c the baby is pressing on your stomach as well. I was really sick during my 3rd trimester and felt like I could never take a good deep breath. The Braxton Hicks are your uterus " practicing" for the delivery. Just hang in there, You don't have much longer. Good Luck!|`|AA10953561	Yes, nausea and feeling faint and short of breath are all pretty typical in the third trimester. The shortness of breath is obviously caused by your ever expanding baby bump. The faintness can be attributed to the lack of oxygen getting into your blood stream because your lungs are compressed or it could be that you're still trying to do all the same things you were doing when you felt great during the second trimester. Staying hydrated is important, but so is taking it easy. Try to prop your feet up for at least half an hour every two hours or so. If you can get away with longer than that, do it! You need all the extra energy you can get right now. <br>  <br>  I would contact your doctor about the severity of your Braxton Hicks. They shouldn't be hurting you quite so bad this early. I get them too, and they definitely aren't comfortable but the worst they do is take my breath away for a few seconds. If the contractions are lasting more than 45 seconds I would really bring it up with your doctor if you haven't already. <br>  <br>  Other than your Braxton Hicks being so painful everything sounds normal. To help with the back pain try these exercises. Get down on your hands and knees, arch your back up for about ten seconds, then drop your belly down so your back is arched down for about ten seconds. Then bring it back to normal. Repeat about ten times. Another one is to stand against a wall, then push the small of your back so it's touching the wall and hold that pose for about ten seconds (make sure your heels are touching the wall. These help strengthen your back muscles and will help during delivery. If you do these exercises twice a day for the rest of your pregnancy you'll reduce your chances of having back labor (which is so much more painful than adominal labor.)<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I would contact your doctor.  Feeling faint could be your blood pressure.  That happened to me.  The nausea is normal though.  It can come and go throughout pregnancy.  The braxton hicks, try to change the way you are getting up or bending when you sit or lay down.  Doing that can help you have them less.|`|yZkf3zFeaa	Morning sickness is normal, and the shortness of breath if from the womb pushing everything up so your lungs kinda get squished so to speak. Being dizzy or light headed when standing or sitting up would also be normal because your blood is going to be more around your uterus.|`|AA11542929	o yeah i went thru that.. it sucks but i gets better... trust me.. dont worry.. keep drinking alot of water and eat as much as u can.. good luck and congrats..|`|vqlA9QNdaa	Unfortunatly, everythign you described is normal. I'm 36 weeks with nasty reflux and nausea and couldn't keep water down for days. Had to go into the ER to get IV fluids. <br>  Even though what your going through is normal, there are ways to handle each one. Talk to your Dr. about some nausea meds, and maybe if you need them get some IV fluids. They help ALOT with both the nausea and contractions. I've been having actual contractions, not BH, for 6 weeks now, with out them causing me to dialate. Some get really bad, which is why I'm being induced at 37 weeks. Fluids help alot, and a heating pad helps with the back pain. <br>  Hang in there, it's only a little bit longer and soon you'll have a beautiful baby! If I can hang in for 6 weeks with contractions measuring over a hundred sometimes on the monitor, you can too! (I'm a wimp too)
g6fceeYraa	I live in CA but if you don't feel like you should be supporting her then why don't you have her find a job? Kick her out if she doesn't want to. She isn't your responsibility.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i think if this was like a child support thing, the parent who does not have custody has to pay until they finish school even if they are 18 years old, so i would think since she is still in school that she is still their responsibility.
xif22nwoaa	Different doctors do things differently, so it's hard to predict what yours will do.<br>  <br>  My doctor always does an ultrasound at the first checkup, from which he can get a more accurate due date.  But not all doctors do that.<br>  <br>  You also typically have a pelvic exam/Pap smear, bloodwork, urinalysis, and a medical history completed.  They usually give you some information about pregnancy and so forth, some brochures and things, and answer any initial questions you might have.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	You'll fill out a history page the doc will give you baby books and magizines or what not.  You get to pee in a cup, and you will every time you visit your doc so get use to it.  Usually they'll do a pelvic exam answer questions that you'll have tell you what to expect.  It's always the longest visit and every one after that will be 10-15 minutes MAX.|`|f8ed07139ed0b8e2bee89c46a751f7d3aa	Congrats! I'm expecting my first in June. :-)<br>  As far as the first visit: if you haven't had a pap in the last year, they will give you one, they do an abdominal exam and vaginal exam, you have to pee in a cup (you do that every time after too), and for us they did an ultrasound and measured to figure out the age and due date (but I don't think that was the very first visit, could have been the second).|`|dR2bqUixaa	They just go off the last day of your period. Also at the first appointment they usually just ask you health questions, like your families medical history. Just to know what to expect during your pregnancy. Good luck! Congrads!
WdvLcYaVaa	I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but that kind of looks like an evap line. Those are very very common in blue dye tests (esp if its after the time limit) Its kind of off to the side and not centered like a normal line. All I can tell you to do is wait a few more days and test again. I truly truly hope it is a bfp for you but try not to get too excited just in case. I would suggest getting a first response early result or one of the digital ones. good luck hun!|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I hate those blue tests...they always seem more confusing than helpful!  I would suggest going and getting a pink dye test and trying that tomorrow morning.  Even on POAS they don't seem to like the blue ink tests...as shown in this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com/hpt/+.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com/hpt/+.html</a><br>  <br>  Although those are the +/- tests the lines are still confusing.  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|mY19PPlIaa	I'd say your pregnant. Start celebrating. Just to confirm your pregnancy go to the doctors and get an actual blood test this is the only thing that will put you at ease, but I'd say your definetly pregnant.|`|D0oqTblpaa	I'd say it's a positive.  Best of luck.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	If it has been more than 10 minutes, then the results are not accurate.  The test from this morning is more likely to be accurate than the test from yesterday.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	well first off start looking for the second BLUE line silly!  :)<br>  <br>  The top test definitely looks pregnant.. but since it said bfn originally before you got busy and only now after so much time reads bfp i would not count on its results.. but it is certainly a good sign...  <br>  <br>  the lower test looks negative.  <br>  <br>  it is possible that you are pregnant, that the first test was more sensitive and that it turned positive during the time window and then remained positive until now.. they say on the packages a lot of the time that a positive result if acheived during the time window should remain positive for at least 24 hours.. but if it turns up after the window then don't count on it being true.  i have seem amazing pistures of completely convincing evap lines that look just like that online.  <br>  <br>  that all being said I would wait a few days until if you were pregnant your hcg levels would have risen greatly and then test again for a more conclusive result.  Best of luck to you! :)|`|285e8b302bc60e4817f5d45c744bdcfeaa	Congrats Mommy, Looks Like a BFP!!!!!!!!! Your early so the line isnt as strong. Test again in the Morning and watch the line darken.

vXYQcixvaa	Since all babies r different in their development....its nothing to stress about. Especially in a 9 week old! But my lil lady didnt really start really interacting with us until about 2 1/2 or 3 months. Try interacting with her when she first wakes up in the morning. That what i do. B/c it seems to be my lil ones most alert time.

He will smile and coo in his swing or bouncer but rarely does it for people. His sister on the other hand used to smile at everyone at that age. All babies are different. Some are more outgoing than others. Don't worry I am sure soon enough he will start smiling at people too.
BcdbR6iSaa	Could be your cervix starting to thin or dilate. The cramps are a sign of labor and so it's the back pain. <br>  If I were you I'd make a trip to the ER and get checked out. 33 weeks is still pretty early. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	it sounds like your baby engaging or moving into the birth canal. look and see if your bump has dropped at all.|`|AuHdNqmpaa	Yes I am 39 weeks pregnant and they are pretty bad now, especial when I go from a sit to stand position, or try to walk, or stand up straight from sitting down, or almost all the time.  It usually stops me in my tracks and I have to take a second and move really slow.  It also helps if I go empty my bladder, seems like they get a little better after that.|`|mjd1qjy7aa	Your body is preparing for labor. Make sure to keep yourself hydrated. If the pain/cramps increases and it gets closer to 5 to 7 minutes, call your OB to check your cervix.She can prescribed breathine to slow down the contraction.|`|qERAKF13aa	yeah, its normal. i started having that when i was about 32 weeks along now im 36, sorry to break it to you but they only get worse. its the baby pushing down on that whole area, not sure why its a stabbing/shooting pain though. good luck though.
hKJIDdVqaa	yeah, I do not ground, or time out, or spanking, or any of that stuff. My discipline of choice is lectures.  Children need to know, understand and rectify what they are doing wrong.  See my children have the fear of God with me, if they ever dared act like that in school or public they know, there would be a problem.  Rebellious behavior is to be expected out of kids age 5 and under, put at 7 that is ridiculous.  She can only use the mother excuse care for so long.  Attention at home  has nothing to do with it.  Persistence and consistency in parenting will be most effective.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Do not back down and don't let your husband either. If that has been one of the problems then discuss punishments before you give them out. Then you can always say you agreed to... Screaming and yelling want do anything but escalate the behavior. Don't let her know she's getting to you and continue to punish as well as praise for all the little stuff good and bad. The spanking won't do anything. I don't ground to a room. I have found without stimulus my kids would seek me out to read or play a board game or something along those lines. During that time a lot of talking and bonding can happen. Good luck.|`|flqAr30laa	I think you should change therapists.<br>  <br>  You can't give up on her, don't do what her mother did.<br>  <br>  maybe the whole family needs to go to therapy, not just her.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Do you actually like, never mind love, this girl?

I do understand, cause my 9-year-old daughter has ADHD, and had a listening/attitude problem... She's very sweet, but she doesn't always *get* that she MUST listen to her parents.<br>  <br>  If I were to keep her in her room, 'til she was good for a whole week, I'd never see her! We are considering following her neurologists' advice, and put her on medication, but, we're still not certain. I think most children would hate being grounded, enough to finally do as they're told, and if not, meds may help. (In cases of ADHD.) I know she *wants* to be good; she just has great difficulty.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to talk to her pediatrician, the neurologist, and see what they suggest... It's possible they will advise medication, to go along with her counseling, even if just for a while. It does not need to be permanent! My nephew also has it, and since taking his meds, he's doing so much better.

ebQJsYTxaa	You will be asked to sign a consent form.  You can refuse.  However, you need to make your wishes extremely clear.  Sometimes babies are accidentally vaccinated before the consent is signed, and the nurses take the consent form to be signed as a formality.  Sometimes the nurses don't notice that you checked "no" on the consent form.  They are busy, overworked, and get used to giving all babies the routine things.  You need to be extra careful and have someone who agrees with your decision watching the baby at all times, to make sure nothing is given that you don't consent to.  It doesn't hurt to have a sign on your bed saying "no hepatitis B vaccine for baby."  You could also have a onesie printed up that says "no Hep B vaccine."  Leave no room for mistakes or misunderstandings.<br>  <br>  Wow, you've gotten a lot of ignorant comments.  Hepatitis B is spread through sex and drug use with dirty needles, or from mother to baby if the mother has hepatitis B.  If you have tested negative for hepatitis B, there is nothing to worry about until your child is old enough to engage in such behaviors.|`|USoqyjaAaa	I would make sure I was fully informed on the topic- here is a good article from a pediatrician.  It explains the rationale behind hepatitis B vaccine for newborns.<br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyquestion/a/0408_hepb_vac.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyque...</a><br>  <br>  If you still want to avoid vaccines you will have to express your views to the hospital staff.<br>  <br>  I agree that if your child does not receive any vaccinations he should be kept away from other children.  Not all children are fully protected because:  <br>  1. they may be too young for a particular vaccine (example:  babies under 1 year are not immunized against measles, mumps, and rubella; babies under 6 months are not complete for pertussis vaccine but are most at risk). <br>  <br>  2. not all vaccines are 100% effective.  Most are in the 90-100% range.  A child could still be susceptible even after receiving all the shots- especially if the child is immunocompromised due to cancer or immune disorder, where the effectiveness is lower due to the inability to mount a good immune response.<br>  <br>  3. not all kids are immunized, whether due to medical or personal reasons.  <br>  <br>  Frankly I wouldn't want my children around kids that were not vaccinated.  Fortunately most parents do vaccinate their kids which keeps the unvaccinated kids safe.  I wonder if people would change their minds if the number dropped low enough to cause diseases like measles, polio, Hib, and diphtheria to run rampant again?  Would they want vaccines then?|`|PwHQSAxvaa	This should be left to the parent to decide, I doubt any are mandatory. If you want your child to be left vulnerable to preventable, deadly diseases, nobody should stop you.|`|AA10424047	Make up a birth plan and state that you do not want your child receiving the Hep B or Vitamin K injections. Give this to your OB or midwife, and bring a copy along when you go into labour. Make sure to keep stating it, over again. Or, if you are up for it, have your baby at home.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There are many parents who are VERY pro-vaccine and make rude and ignorant comments to those who choose to do delayed, selective or non vaccinations. Please do not listen. PLEASE do your reasearch. There are many unneccessary vaccines out there (flu, chicken pox, etc). If you'd like some reliable sites and resources, feel free to contact me and I'll happily send it along.<br>  <br>  Many of these diseases were already on their way out before the vaccines were introduced, and the biggest contributing factor in that was better hygiene.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Originalkippyj, autism was first recognized and diagnosed in the 1930's. This is the same time that MMR was introduced. I am not saying that autism is caused by vaccinations, but I do truly believe it is linked in one form or another.<br>  <br>  EDITL originialkippyj, you said that autism wasn't always recognized until recently, which is not true at all. There are more forms of autism being diagnosed these days, but it has been fairly recognized and diagnosed since the 1930's. Perhaps a little bit of research is advisable?|`|ozWi3TJlaa	You would be doing you both a favor to look up more information from several reliable sources, including the CDC,  regarding vaccinations.  Prior to the development of vaccines, kids still developed autism, but millions of kids died from diseases.  People think that more kids are developing autism these days, when actually there are just more kids being born, plus autism wasn't always recognized as such until fairly recently in human history.<br>  <br>  As for refusing a vaccine, talk to your obstetrician.  You can object, although being positive your wishes are followed will mean keeping your baby with you 24/7 and never sleeping.<br>  <br>  Mommy to Zoe and...I know when it was diagnosed.  I said it's been around since before it was ever recognized.  I guess that would mean it's been around longer than vaccinations, which is exactly what I said.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	WHY do you have a baby when you can't even spell "vaccinated?" And let me tell you something, honey -- if you are NOT going to have that child vaccinated, then you can NEVER take him out in public. EVER. Not to the grocery store, not to the library, not to the doctor's, not to school, not to daycare.<br>  <br>  Who the hell do these mothers think they are that they can expose untold hundreds of innocent babies and children to measles, chicken pox, and God-knows-what-all infectious diseases???|`|K2SOMH6iaa	well, you probably shouldn't leave your baby with a doctor who wants to vaccinate it--it's your choice whether or not to vaccinate your child. I have no vaccinations, because my parents didnt want to put a lot of drugs in my system, and they just told the doctor it was for religious reasons.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	You tell them not to do it.  If you say "no" than they have to respect that.  I would suggest doing some additional research before you make a final decision.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyquestion/a/0408_hepb_vac.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.about.com/od/weeklyque...</a>|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Vaccinized is not a word.

I have never had a vaccine in my life and the worst thing I've ever had is a mild flu. Getting vaccines is overrated and over-recommended, and it's unnecessary in most cases, I think.  Studies now show that vaccines can be responsible for most cases of autism, learning disabilities, asthma, etc.....<br>  <br>  I think there's some kind of form you can fill out to the hospital stating that you don't want your child vaccinated; and take a written statement with you when you deliver the baby.  Make sure to tell the doctors, nurses and midwife, or have your spouse tell them all.|`|NWTfFEuVaa	I have a baby that is being born in May as well, and I want him to have all of his Vac's. So many babies are born every day and receive the shots they need and they are all okay. Chances of something happening negative to your baby because of the shots in very very rare. Just talk to your doctor about your worries and ask if on the slim chance something does go wrong with the Vac, is there a shot or something that can reverse the side effects or what not. And the only reasons doc's give Vac's is because the risks of not having the Vac's outweighs the risk of having them. Fear not.|`|EDiJe38Taa	First of all, they cannot do it without your consent. You have to sign a form every time your child gets a VACCINATION. Second, why would you want to risk letting your baby get sick? The danger of a baby getting a preventable disease far outweighs the supposed 'danger' of these vaccinations. Third, why would you want to put other people at risk if your baby does get sick? You are an idiot. The end.|`|f1Zhqlsaaa	well u always want your baby to be protected from such disease like chicken pox and whopping cough etc the shot only is going to decrease the risk of your child getting these disease later in life! as much as shots hurt they are pretty protective from such things! i realiaze ill make him cry but its only best 4 him! just think about it ppl in africa r suffering and r babies and they have no vacccinations like we do here! so be glad!|`|AA11421521	In illinois you have to sign for it .They won't give it to your baby without you signing 4 it.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Hey, sing to me, are you really using the fact that this girl misspelled a word, as a reason she shouldn't have had children?  So you have never used a spell check in your life.?  I call bull$hit.  Get over yourself sister.<br>  <br>  Anyways, back to you.  Lots of woman choose not to vaccinate.  I myself had my daughters hep B done in the hospital, but she hasn't had any other shots done yet.  She comes with me everywhere. Even to work.  She will 13 weeks old tomorrow.  I chose to wait a while on everything else because what I learned in my Medical Law and Ethics class.  I will get them done eventually, just not this early in her life.  <br>  Don't let these people talk crap to you.  Vaccinating is a choice only the parents can make.  Just tell the doctors at the hospital that you don't want to have them done.  they should respect your wishes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And if all you people had YOUR children vaccinated, why the hell would it matter to you if this girl had HER child vaccinated or not?  How, if vaccines are so great, would YOUR child be affected by MINE or HERS not being vaccinated?|`|X6as2nOAaa	if it is that harmful then they wouldn't give it to them.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I have never heard of that agency, so I can not say since you did not give more details.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that yes, some money is involved (my oldest daughter acts/models).  However, it should not be an outrageous amount. For four and under, our agency charges I think about $100-this covers postage and the like.  Other than that, they should ONLY get commision when they book your son a job.  The standard is 10-15% depending on where you live.  Normally, the client will pay the agency and the agency will then cut you a check after they deduct their fees.  Thhis process can take up to 90 days.<br>  <br>  At his age, professional photos should not be required.  If they require them, it is probably a scam.  It should be an OPTION to have professional portraits done, adn you should be free to use whatever photographer you wish (though do be sure to get hints, because there are rules for comp cards/headshots).  But, at his age they are a waste of money because he changes so fast and snapshots are sufficient.<br>  <br>  Never let yourself be pressured into signing.  Take the paperwork home, read it over, let your husband read it over.  Hint to the agency that you are going to have a lawyer look it over (and consider actually doing so).  <br>  <br>  If they make any promises, it is probably a scam.  Even if it is disguised as "He is so cute/adorable/funny that I know he will get a lot of work".<br>  <br>  Know that it takes a lot more than a pretty/cute baby to model.  They have to be comfortable around strangers, and you have to be comfortable letting strangers be in charge of your child.  You also need to be able to go on sometimes short notice, without other children (never take other children that are not there for the job on a call).<br>  <br>  Check with the BBB.<br>  <br>  Also, if they throw around big names-do not fall for that either.  That big name might have been associated with them at one time, and after they went elsewhere that big name got their big break.  It had nthing to do with that agency, but they claim them as one of their successes.  There have also been agencies that have used names they were NEVER associated with at all.<br>  <br>  Most of all, be careful and make sure your son enjoys it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Did they ask you for money?  Read the fine print.|`|dKTPewhTaa	If you have to pay for your child to model, then it's probably a scam.  Read the fine print.  Why would someone pay to work?  Usually they get paid a percentage of whatever work their model is getting paid.  I don't know how to explain that, but a lot of these ask for a lot of money and they promise to find work for your child and they are the only ones who made money off of you the parent.  Beware.|`|220b695ab00eca1c536e15d2f68abdd5aa	I signed my son up for modelling.  The agency has a fee, but they get their fee on a commission basis.

kTu7UtS1aa	It could be both.  The signs of PMS are similar to the signs of early pregnancy.  I get dull backaches before my period.  That is my only symptom that my period is coming in a few days.  Well, it never came.  I took a test and it was positive.  Swollen breasts, cramps, moodiness are signs of PMS, but also signs of early pregnancy.  If you are concerned, I suggest buying a pregnancy test (I like First Response).  If you get a negative, then wait until your period is over a week late and try again. If still negative, then I would suggest making an appt with your gyn.  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|miOor5SRaa	That is what i am going through right now!

UDENYO4raa	There's always the possibility that you could be pregnant if Aunt Flo is missing from her monthly visit, but don't get too excited yet.. Wait another week or so... Sometimes thinking about it so much can cause your period to come late, or sometimes not at all... If it doesn't show after a week, I would take a test. You could even try taking one now.

The best I can do for you, is tell you to get First Response. It tells you a week before your missed period. Make sure you buy two! After that, a trip to the doctors/OBGYN is most likely your best bet. Anyway, if you're not pregnant, then start eating some red meat, and some iron. When you get your period, the blood drains you, and yes you feel miserable. A little iron will make it back up. Take a long hot bath, and shut off anything that bothers you. Relax, and enjoy the candles. That should do well with the stress. <br>  Basically, all you have to do right now is relax.

On average it takes a healthy couple about 1 year to conceive. If your over 30, its about 6 months. To maximize your chances of conception, you need to make sure that your not missing ovulation. Taking Charge of Your Fertility is a excellent book for people to read, who are trying to conceive. It will give you clues to look for, as far as your body ovulating, and will also tell you how to pinpoint ovulation(ovulation predictor kits, or charting). Once you pinpoint ovulation you need to have as much sex as possible before during and after ovulation. <br>  <br>  If i were you, i would go to my local dollar store, grab about 10 ovulation predictor kits (they work just as good as the 30$ ones), and depending on your cycle length start testing. For instance, if your a 28 day cycle, i would start testing about day 8 or 9 of my cycle.<br>  <br>  After you have consistently tried for another couple of months to make it a year, I would visit my doctor, and take it from there. There they will be able to check you, and he can have a sperm analysis to see if hes ok. <br>  <br>  Best of wishes with everything, and TONS OF BABY DUST!!!|`|mY19PPlIaa	Just because he has not conceived a child previously does not make him sterile. Maybe the timing was off with his previous partner or she was the one with the problem, I would not automatically assume its him. It's normal for healthy couples who are doing everything to conceive such as, OPK's, charting, temps, checking cm to take up to a year to conceive. If you dont conceive in a year after doing all this then you should see a fertility specialist. If indeed your partner is the one with the problem such as low sperm count etc. then there is no treatment for that whatsoever. It could also be that your cysts are interfering, that is something you should ask your gyno and have them removed. I would suggest making an appointment with your gyno having your cysts removed and making sure your doing the deed on the right days. If you still dont get pregnant after actively trying then see a specialist. Its very easy for you spouse to get his sperm checked so you might want to start there.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	Get married and go on a cruise, thats how I got pregnant. Hubby and I dated for 7 years before getting married, and never once got pregnant, then all of sudden after tying the knot and going on a honeymoon I came back pregnant. Not trying to be funny. But if your worried than you just need to go see a specialist.
Bw18seFqaa	most early pregnancy symptoms are similar to PMS symptoms.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I had symptoms weeks before I missed my period. Even my boyfriend noticed and teased me about being pregnant.<br>  Yet, somehow, it came as a shock to me.<br>  <br>  So, yes, you could be pregnant.|`|U1AFYGzZaa	you could also be pmsing<br>  or experiencing any thing else<br>  and u just think its cuz ur preggers cuz ur so worried by it<br>  if u are really unsure, go to the doctors and check it out
U522s6Nmaa	With my second child, I did not get a positive result until almost TWO WEEKS after missing my period.  Not all women have enough hCG (pregnancy hormone, as I am sure you know) in their urine to detect a pregnancy right away, and very few NEVER build up enough to get a positive urine test.<br>  <br>  I would wait another week.  If your period still hasn't come, test again.<br>  Or if you absolutely can not wait, go to the doctor for a blood test.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	you're testing too soon. I would wait until after your missed period.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	If you are buying the 5 days before your missed period, then they are probably accurate.  But, sometimes they can be wrong, so I would wait until you actually miss your period and then take another one.  I took a first response one day after I missed my period and it was a very clear positive.  Good luck!|`|a1uoxczTaa	my period is due tomorrow too and i took an EPT this morning that says not pregnant. i read about negative tests and it says quite a few women get them when they are pregnant. we could have taken it too soon if we coneived less then 14 days ago. i am still hoping for a positive, i hope you get one too!|`|0iAGnjFvaa	yeah you're testing tooo sssoooooonnn<br>  <br>  try in another week, sometimes you can get your period and still be pregnant|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	Depends on if you got the ones that say 5 days sooner.
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	You are a 26 year old woman. You do not need approval from your mom anymore. It should not matter how she reacts and frankly it is none of her business how you became pregnant. By telling her the circumstances you are still seeking her approval.<br>  <br>  Go in with your head held high and "act" like you are the most happiest couple in the world because God has blessed you with another child. If you do this there will not be any negative reactions to your news.<br>  <br>  You are right. It was Gods plan for you to have another child. God will provide for you and your family. <br>  God Bless you and may he give you peace.|`|AA11031068	You're 26 and married. You've already left mamas nest. Enough said.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	I say just come out and tell them.  You are both grown adults and they can be upset about it but thats about it.  I'm sure they aren't going to not love your new child.  Infact since you have come so far since your daughter and son has been born maybe she and everyone will be happy this time.  As to the 3 bedroom house its not that bad.  I am pregnant with our child and plan on moving into a 2 bedroom place if I need to.  Two children can share a room just fine.|`|AA11482488	You need to establish with your mother that you are no longer a child, that you are a grown, married woman who can make her own decisions.  She has no right to abuse you, if she does, walk away and tell her you'll be back when she decides to treat you as an adult.|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	I don't think that a restaurant is a great place to get yelled at either. I say you have a dinner party at your house. Then whoever cannot get over it can leave. I also think if his parents are more accepting of the idea that they could be a big help when you tell your parents.|`|pJ7icz0taa	First of all I know you said it wasn't planned, but I hope you want this child and keep it.   You could put the baby in your room until it's a little older or at least until you know if it's a boy or girl. Then you can put it in the room with whatever you have now. It will all work out. As for your folks  why not have then all over for coffee and cake and tell them all together. It doesn't matter what they say or think..you are an adult and they do not pay for your house or your bills, (I hope) All they need to do is accept it and be Grandparents. This happy event is between you and your husband and other 2 kids.<br>  Don't stress out..try to be happy and enjoy it and if you do not want anymore kids have your DR> do something for you when you have the child..they can tie your tubes right after the birth.<br>  I wish you luck and don't worry what the families think or say..get it over with......This is advice from an adult Not a teen.|`|SjrhuZQnaa	The only way you can do it is to do it now,  Get it over and done with, Good Luck :)|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I would just call your mom and let her know. This will give them some time to think before you met next week for dinner..|`|zM0ag4NLaa	well good luck|`|AA11868913	you use rubbers AND birth control!|`|YsGodD80aa	Personally, u ahve ya self together a man who accepts ya child as huis own n marrieed u I dont think ya mom would have a problem with it! She shouldnt! Ur grown n ur happy, n ur doing things right in God's eyes Jus be straight forward rather than prolonging it. The sooner the better. Good luck on both issues Ur a great mom!|`|liHpJvVfaa	I would just tell them straight up. You are a grown woman AND married so I don't see why it should be such a great concern of your parents. As long as you are going to be able to keep your child healthy and give it what it needs that's all that matters. Congratulations!|`|ocw4wxlmaa	A public place may be a good place to tell them because your mom probably won't make a scene in front of people. Then maybe keep contact to a minimum for just a little while to alow her to get over the shock. Hope I helped.|`|sXNtTETbaa	look, everyone want their parents approval and to some extant need it, but it seems that you are in a stable loving family enviroment, which is exactly what this child needs. So keep that close familt unit together and give the new one as much love as it needs, dont worry abot your parents, they will come round. Im sure they have your best interests at heart as you have your childrens.<br>  <br>  All the best|`|JJ16dVgWaa	good luck|`|AA12307066	Well, you are a grown, married woman and you and your husband pay all your own bills and care for the children you already have, so who cares what anybody else has to say or thinks about it? If you are too afraid to tell your parents that you are pregnant and feel like you need to have thier permission to have children, maybe you aren't really ready to be a parent. Man up and just tell them,I mean, what are they gonna do, ground you?! Come on, grow up. It's YOUR life, so live it.|`|H5rllREtaa	My dear, it is very nice of you to care about the feelings of your family.  However, you are a grown woman with a husband and two kids.  As long as the two of you are independent (living in your own home, paying your own bills and taking good care of the kids you already have) it really is not their place of complain.  <br>  <br>  On another note, life is truly a gift from God.  Apparently this egg and sperm had to fight to get together.  (smile)  This baby must have great purpose.  Perhaps he or she will cure cancer, apparently we (humanity) really needs him or her.<br>  <br>  Lastly, don't get caught up in "stuff" you believe you don't have.  The most important thing children need is loving parents and a happy household.  "Things" really don't matter, our kids need us.<br>  <br>  All the best!<br>  <br>  QueensMom - a work at home mother of one terrific boy and owner of www.royalnapmat.com|`|IfKTQME0aa	Not to be deceptive but why let on that you are stressed about the situation at all?  Since you have dealt with your situation and ready to love this child I don't see the need in setting the situation up for her to be upset again.  You could start out by saying "We have some exciting news to tell you!"  We are so happy to let you know that we are pregnant! (hubby and you smile and show your happiness).  The family you have together is your business and how you handle the stresses that come with it don't necessarily need to be shared.  Maybe if you approach it that you are excited your Mom will hold off on criticism.  If she brings up that she thought you were on the pill you could explain that its not 100% effective and you feel so blessed to have this opportunity again.  If she doesn't fall for it and goes off again well at least the cat is out of the bag and you can choose to listen to her or you can say at that point.  Mom, I didn't tell you so that you could judge the situation I really love you as a grandmother to my children and we want you to share in the excitement of the moment with us (smiling together again with a look of "poor woman, don't you know how to celebrate planted on your face).  Whatever you do don't look sad or stressed if she goes off because that will give her more fuel to criticize.  Good luck!|`|dKTPewhTaa	Wow, you and your husband need to realize that it is great to have respect for your parents opinions, but you are grownups and you will do fine.  You might have to tighten your belts and  sacrifice some, but as long as you guys are happy and know that your children are a part of each of you then you should relish in your love for each other and the joy your children can bring you.  You do love each other, right?  First, you should try to find out why you having kids makes a grandmother who is supposed to want grandchildren act like a fool when she finds out her daughter is pregnant.  It sounds like you have the type of relationship where your parents could cause the two of you to divorce in the future.  I don't mean this ugly, I mean this so you and your husband can start to focus on what really matters, YOUR FAMILY, not your parents.  You are spending time worrying about your parents when you should be focusing on each other and how wonderful your lives are.  Life is short and we are not promised tomorrow.  So enjoy and stop worrying about what other people think.  Let them live their lives and you live yours.  Your parents sound like people who need to get a life of their own.|`|qERAKF13aa	i think you should tell them at dinner, i dont think they would yell at a restaraunt. and i think its you and your hubbys decision on when and why to expand the family. youre a totally different family from them now and all decisions you make you shouldnt worry what they think. they can offer advise but they cant tell you what to do! good luck though.
FTFd3AQAaa	how long has this been going on? if she is just now regularly playing with other kids it may be something she will outgrow... but if that's not the case i still wouldn't worry too much i do think she will out grow it. also once she interfaces with a group of children she wont be able to act the same with all the children and maybe then she will be confident in her decisions
OQFd3pl5aa	The prenatal I take has 800 mcg of folic acid. It is from Target and is called Origin. 400 mcg is all you need, and there is no need to take anymore. 1000 mcg is not recommended, but taking too much folic acid can mask a vitamin B deficiency, so just stick to 400-800 mcg. Folic acid itself is not toxic. Good luck to you and lots of baby dust :)
zzaScg0haa	I'm sure everything will turn out okay, just relax
IKrJTzwcaa	well i don't think it was a miscarriage it could just be that your period was some how thrown off track and now it's trying to get back regular but if you feel something not right please go see you doctor take care|`|vb1fIAuEaa	that happened to my cousin RIGHT after she had her child, 3-4 months early. turns out her uturan wall was ripping off internally. You should really concider talking to your doctor..
8xrPFY3Jaa	lol... totally! i mean, i didn't go out and buy them after my pregnancy, but I certainly didn't stop wearing them!!|`|AA10230627	my mom told me not too as it was bad luck and would mean that you would get pregnant again. but i kept a cute black shirt that i've loved after i had my first daughter and gave birth to another little girl 22 months after she was born and after that pregnancy i wore the same black shirt and now i'm pregnant with my third baby due in june. so i'd say NO! lol unless you like kids. but it's an old wise tale. or maybe i should throw out the black shirt?|`|PpYBnxgpaa	Yes . They are cute . I wore my after I had my son for a while|`|b4463f9fb9ddf1c99713a3dcd35077dfaa	people might think youre pregnant.
Kl1h5dCaaa	I am coming off the biggest night I've had in awhile 12 violation within 24 hours.<br>  <br>  I think Yahoo is trying to psych me out. No idea how much longer this account will last.<br>  I usually get 1 or 2 ever couple of days.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of things I wouldn't share with my boys from my history, straight up, my history not theirs.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	Strangely enough, I only get a couple  a month, and I'm one of the biggest trolls, er I mean, top contributors on here. <br>  <br>  I don't have any kids, but if I did, I like to think I would be honest about everything I've done, once they were a certain age.  I had a wild past, but I don't really regret anything.   I doubt I would just bring it up, but if they asked me if I'd ever done something, I would be honest with them. Kids hate it when they find out their parents lied to them about something.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm not one of those "report" trolls your were talking about. I never report anyone. People need to learn to just suck it up if they don't like something.|`|QveBSjFSaa	woke up to my first this morning.<br>  funny, I think the same person who chose my answer as best also reported me.<br>  I didn't fight it, just put it in the trash.<br>  I think I have a few skeletons in my closet that I would like my children not to know.<br>  I shared much of my past with my oldest daughter, and it seems as if it may have inspired her to go out and do much of the same.<br>  With my younger 2, they so totally look up to me. I would hate to "fall" in their eyes. If they found themselves in similar situations, then yes, I would share my experiences with them.<br>  But my ultimate goal is to keep them from those experiences in the first place, and so far, so good. They seem to want to do the right thing at all times, and show no interest in going down the paths that I wandered about aimlessly on.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I get 1 or 2 a week. I really do not believe yahoo actually reads the questions or answer's that are violated and just takes the word of the reporter.<br>  <br>   I was violated for calling someone mentally ill. I told yahoo that I was not insulting them, I really do think they are ill and need help....if you read the question you will see that. It stuck, so I guess the yahoo person is crazy too then ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  to answer you, yes there is a few things. At least for now I do not see how it would benefit my kids in anyways to share  about them. I was the victim of a violent crime twice in my life. They will know about the events when they are older, but I will never tell them the details of exactly what happened.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I don't receive violations too often but it has become more since I have been using this website. I joined last January and I am guessing I had 15 violations total.<br>  <br>  There is a lot I won't tell my daughter that I have done in my past. I won't even say it here to you strangers on Y!A lol. One thing I will share is that I wish we were married. I don't want her ever think she was a "mistake" because she wasn't, she was a blessing and made us better people.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I have never had a violation.  I think it is because I am so friendly and I tend to get along well with others.  It's almost like that attribute of mine leaks out into all of my answers...<br>  <br>  Yes, there is more than one thing I will not share with my son unless, of course, he comes out and asks when he is much older.  My parents grew up in the 70's and as far as I know, they never touched marijuana.  I am sure they did, but they did not tell me about it!  I am not going to shield him from everything, but at the same time I think that the saying "you did that when you were my age!" can be thrown in the face of a parent who is too honest.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Let's see... One today, one yesterday, one the day before that... Yeah, it's ridiculous, especially when the SAME questions are asked on here (actually, they are rants), and when I respond with 'This is old,' it gets removed, but the post stays!

I was young & stupid and certainly not proud that I did that (simply because I was greedy and wanted a lot of money quickly instead of working at a place where I could at least not feel ashamed.....). Or maybe I will as an example of what not to do (chalk it up there with the rest of them). I don't know, I still feel sleezy about it all these years later.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	How many violations do you need to be considered a Y!A rapist?<br>  <br>  Well, if I don't feel comfortable enough to share it with my children then I probably won't share it with a bunch of strangers.

Today was 4.<br>  <br>  Today I contacted fraud and abuse and asked them to review the spike in parenting.  I told them there is (probably) one person with multiple accounts; to check the IP address.  So her reckless days are coming to a halt.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you all do the same.  I did this a few months ago and the next thing I know, one of my own contacts was suspended as well as all her accounts and every time she tried to make a new account it got oopsed.  What a coincidence.  Didn't surprise me, I knew it had to be a contact of mine.  I'm not saying I know who this is, I'm just saying it's a lot of lightning in one place.  <br>  <br>  I also asked them to review the legit violations I received today.  "How did you come up with the avatar name you chose?" for one.  Can't get more bland than what they reported.<br>  <br>  I also, also added that if they could limit a person's accounts to 1 per IP address, most reports/violations would be legit, since most of the time in most rooms it is one person violating the same thing several times.  Am I the only jerk with one account?  <br>  <br>  Here's the thing.  I will never go away.  Not until I want to.  No matter how many numbers are next to my name.  Level 6 or level 1.  Block me please, but other than that you're stuck with me.  I will decide when I'm leaving. <br>  <br>  Pardon me.  I'm in a real snit today.<br>  - - - - - <br>  No no, Don't leave this all up to me.  I don't even know if they'll read it.  But even if they overlook mine, they can't ignore everybody.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Surprisingly I haven't had any since January. *knocks on wood*<br>  <br>  I've been pretty behaved.

Some experts also say that only button mushrooms and enoki should be eaten raw for some reason.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/</a><br>  Yet experts say children over 6 months can handle most anything, with a few caveats: Be cautious if you have a family history of allergies; introduce one food at a time and watch for any problems; and make sure the food isn't a choking hazard.<br>  <br>  Parents elsewhere in the world certainly take a more freewheeling approach, often starting babies on heartier, more flavorful fare — from meats in African countries to fish and radishes in Japan and artichokes and tomatoes in France.<br>  <br>  The difference is cultural, not scientific, says Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' nutrition committee who says the American approach suffers from a Western bias that fails to reflect the nation's ethnic diversity.<br>  <br>  Bhatia says he hopes his group soon will address not only that, but also ways to better educate parents about which rules must be followed and which ones are only suggestions.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	My son is 10.5 months and eats them.

Interesting that there is no info on this though.|`|tX2giFynaa	Children under the age of 6 years account for a majority of these cases.<br>  <br>  Mushroom poisoning fungal poisoning caused by ingestion of certain mushrooms (fungal organisms), most commonly Amanita phalloides and Amanita muscaria and related species. Symptoms, caused by toxic peptides, may include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, cold sweat, diarrhea, and excessive thirst; they appear 8 to 12 hours after ingestion. Damage occurs largely in the liver and kidneys. Some mushrooms contain substances that produce hallucinatory states, e.g., Psilocybe mexicanaOccasional outbreaks of poisoning from eating canned mushrooms are not caused by poisonous mushrooms but by botulism resulting from improper canning methods.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Read this page carefully.<br>  <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/firstaid/kids/129.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a>|`|cbn16s58aa	As long as the kid isn't allergic, as soon as they can eat whole foods it is safe.|`|AA10615926	My son has been eating them since he was 10 months old.

koAaPXKQaa	I don't understand really why you have implanon AND microgynon. Usually if you're experiencing problems, they'd just remove the implanon and give you the microgynon to take on it's own, but it could be that you're experiencing symptoms from having too many hormonal contraceptives... <br>  I think you should go to your GP and ask about it though. Microgynon gave me some of the symptoms you listed but I can understand they'd be multiplied because of the Implanon aswell.<br>  <br>  Good luck x<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'd maybe ask for your GP to review this, as usually if you're experiencing migraines, the contraceptive pill is the last thing they'd want to give you because it is linked to migraines and blood clots. Most people are taken off the pill if they complain of migraines.|`|x1Jh7sCoaa	i get all those symptoms from about CD21 to my period day, they are strong some months and weaker others, they go away once i get my period.  i used to think i was pg, now i realize they are just my pms symptoms and they have gotten worse now that i'm in my 30s - could just be pms|`|8lR6OvB6aa	My suggestion is take another test and go talk to  your doctor. Because it sounds like your hormones are out of wack.
h93SVSxLaa	it's always a good idea to TRY to get him to have 8 oz a day with all the other milk based foods. Try making strawberry milk or chocolate milk. That way he still gets the calcium.|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	It is more than okay! What you really need to ask yourself is why are humans the only mammals to cotinue drinking not just milk, but the milk of another species long after weaning age? Your child could refrain from all dairy forms the rest of his life and be okay!! So if he chooses to not consume liquid cow's milk, it won't harm a thing, when as you said, he still has other forms in his diet!|`|s4aX6bF6aa	your mom and aunt are right...as long as he's getting the daily recommended amount of calcium he'll be ok...don't force the milk he'll be fine...besides juices are sweet and milk isn't...most kids will take juice over milk every time...good luck.|`|PeOCqztoaa	The milk may have made him feel worse. Milk causes more mucus production. He may think that if he drinks it he will feel bad again. As long as he's eating a good amount of protein I don't think it's a huge deal. He'll start drinking it again when he's ready.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	My daughter drank about 24 ounces of milk a day, until we took her bottle. She refused to drink milk out of a cup. Here we are 2 yrs later and she still doesn't drink milk. I buy everything that I can that is fortified with calcium and vitamins; butter, cheese, cereal. My doc said not to worry about it because she gets enough in the other things she eats.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	If you can ensure that he is getting enough yogurt to make up for the shortage of milk, then it is ok. The milk in mac and cheese is not substantial enough to compensate. Also, try string cheese, kids love it. You can also buy orange juice fortified with calcium. The cheese and yogurt are better as they also contain protein and you can get them fortified with vitamin D. Have you tried a mini milkshake with frozen yogurt?<br>  <br>  Also, milk does not increase mucus production, that is an old wive's tale. There is no scientific basis. Mucus is the body's way of lubricating and discharging unwanted elements.
5RvTXdmUaa	5 months pregnant is approx 22 weeks, but once you're past 22 weeks, you are technically in your 6th month. But I wouldnt call that being 6 months pregnant. Im a little over 22 weeks and I say Im a bit over 5 months.|`|46K4FtE0aa	Pregnancy is counted in weeks not months, because it can be quite confusing, being there are 5 weeks in some months and 4 weeks in others.

zwctZ812aa	No, but they may leak if your baby is crying because he is hungry.  They also leak when engorged.  I leaked a lot the first 2 months, but then my milk supply regulated and I dont much anymore.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	No.  <br>  When they cry they might.  <br>  Sometimes they leak only because they're filled up again - which means it's probably time for baby to eat.  Maybe that's why she thinks that.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	Mine did. I would get this tingly feeling in my nipples, then some dripping, about 2 minutes before my daughter would wake up hungry. Thank goodness for nursing pads!|`|8R2UMbNHaa	Yes, if you are lactating and the kiddo cries you will leak.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	No, your breasts leak when they are full or engourged.  They can leak if baby is crying sometimes though.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	They will leak according to the demands that your baby has placed on them.  If they've fed every 2 hrs. then expect leakage around this time if baby now wants feedings every 3 hours.  /  Milk "leaks" or "let-down" reflex also occurs w/ oxytocin production.  Oxytocin is produced during the female orgasm.  Warn dad!|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Mine used to only because they became full, meaning since they were full again, it was probably time for her to feed.  Once they started to leak she would cry to be fed within 15-30 minutes.|`|hWe8vhKKaa	i breasfeed on demand and mostly mine do. but when he is latched on to one breast the other one leaks|`|KYkoPHpsaa	mine sometimes do.. and tingle..|`|qFmOuXMXaa	When they cry your its near the time of your next feeding|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no only when they are too full but after a while unless you wait much longer than normal they don't leak at all. your body adjust to baby and makes milk ad baby feeding instead of before- i leaked when i went back to work at 6 weeks but after a few  days that didn't happen anymore
hKJIDdVqaa	they will call your child whatever name you put on the registration forms.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	On the legal paperwork, they will need to use his full proper name.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, most teachers ask a child & his/her parents what the child is called at home, then use that name.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I would find it absolutely absurd for a teacher to insist on a child being called a name that is not what they are called at home, and would insist that it not be done.  They might make you think they can, but if you push they can not and will not.<br>  <br>  In my experience, most teachers/schools are willing to call the child by whatever s/he prefers.<br>  <br>  My sister has this problem at Head Start with her youngest son.  His name is Trey Austin, and he is called Austin.  They absolutely refuse to call him Austin, though.  They finally agreed to call him Trey Austin, using both names.  Now, why not just call him what he is called everywhere else?|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	that seems stupid.. there are lots of children that don't answer to their name if you use the full version.. like Katherine and Katie..  and there are also lots of time where there are more than one kid with the same name and so they work out which child will have which nickname or calling them things like Lisa M and Lisa B.  I would insist with the school that they use his name as he and you see fit and make sure that he knows whats going on and teach him how to stand up for himself.  In future though, maybe namesake names should be middle names though! ;)|`|QnJvJ67uaa	when I filled out the applications for school one of the questions was actually what name does your child go by (after asking for a full name).<br>  My youngest is Alfred, but he has always been Alfie. Any good school should do its best to make a child feel welcome.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	In the UK they ask what name your child would like to be known as and respect and use this when calling him, and sign posting his drawer etc...|`|dWbNAiBoaa	My daughter's name is Abigail but she goes by Abbey (unless she's in trouble!...lol). They usually ask what their name is and what name that they go by. From my experience they will call them by the name they go by. The only thing I can say is that I was told by a teacher that they (the child) do have to recognize which is their first, middle and last name and how to write their legal name correctly. That it is a requirement.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I've never heard of them refusing to do so.  I would notify his teachers that he goes by his middle name and then take it from there.  When I was in school, during the first day of class, my teachers would go down the list and asked us to specify if we preferred to be called something other than what they had on their attendance list.  I don't think it should be a problem.|`|f2801105f13387bb7dc143c4f514a260aa	Okay so I used to know this kid who liked being called by his middle name and the school went along with it...<br>  I think that if he wants to be called by his middle name, he should be able to....<br>  I don't think the person I know needed a parental request. They should hear him out and listen to his request.|`|9c9kZePHaa	The teachers shouldn't call him by his firstname is he goes by his middle name to everyone. It's not like you're asking them to call him an innappropriate nickname or something.<br>  <br>  Talk with the principal or other staff members, it shouldn't be difficult. Good luck!|`|tfkBHH9eaa	It actually depends on the school. Look in the student handbook or go to the main office and ask. I'm not saying that in a strict way lol...but some schools do have different policies. Hope that helped!! :)|`|7XBoIgd6aa	My friends first name is Paul but he goes by his middle Corey in fact I didn't even know about his first name till our Jr. year in high school.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	All the paperwork will be done by his legal name.<br>  <br>  Teachers will call him whichever he prefers.|`|zGy3I03uaa	I don't think so.

It might be unaccepted in our culture, but it's very common in other parts of the world (and not just the "poor" parts) .  I think you should face them and just be confident.

But, if you go into it knowing that, I think it will help.

I would recommend going on the Attachment Parenting International website for support and validation.  My daughter is 11 months and I am already getting surprised reactions that I'm still breastfeeding, but I'm just very matter-of fact about it, I don't believe I should have to give a disclaimer or certainly not hide it from people - the awkwardness is their problem!  If anything, THEY should have to be the ones who have to explain and justify why they are so ignorant and feel the shame, not you!  You could try just saying that he's still nursing and that that is what is working for him and for you and just don't engage in any debate etc and ignore the comments - you could say your dr is recommending it or you could do some research on the website I mentioned so that you are armed w/ exactly why and how extended breastfeeding is a wonderful gift to be giving your child, physically and emotionally.  There are certainly plenty of medical experts and studies you could quote or even bring some reading material to help people understand that the benefits of breastfeeding are completely appropriate for older babies as well as infants.  In the end though you can't control how people will react so I would just try and be confident that you are doing the best thing for your baby and screw everyone else!
kTu7UtS1aa	I had implantation cramping and that is what it felt like.

Maybe some people get worse pains than others, I never knew what to think of implantation myself.|`|46K4FtE0aa	i have had 3 pregnancy's and never felt implantation pains. Not everyone experiences them and it is not common to feel it. This page explains what it feels like for women who do get it.<br>  <a href="http://www.babyzone.com/askanexpert/implantation-pain" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyzone.com/askanexpert/impl...</a>|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Yes I had cramps. They were like period cramps but not quite as painful (my period cramps are normally killer).|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i did not feel anything,nor did i bleed. some women do and some dont. if your still a week ahead,then just try to be patient(i know thats hard) and wait it out. dont stress and let nature take its course.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	It feels like a PMS cramp, but stronger and doesn't last long at all. A lot of women don't even ave implantation bleeding at all. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

9hggEdf1aa	My son hated the bottle since day 1.  I no give him the bottle when he is really hungry, like first thing in the morning and after naps.  At 8 months you sould also be feeding him baby food so that will help him get more calories.  You could try giving water in the bottle to see if he would drink water if you fear dehydration, he should be wetting the diaper at least 6-8 times a day.  Also you can make a transition to a sippy cup, he might like that much better. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I know how frustrating it gets, my 10 month old does not take the bottle much, and spits up when I give him baby food so I give him foods like soft rice, but he is still fussy when I feed him.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	you can try a sippy cup. maybe something new will entice him to drink his formula. try giving it to him cold if its usually warm. sometimes when babies cut teeth it can be painful for them to drink bottles. give him water if you're worried about dehydration. hopefully when he wakes up he'll want his bottle.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Maybe he just isn't as hungry.  You shouldn't force him to eat when he isn't hungry.  He may be ready for a big boy sippy cup.  As far as the teeth go we gave our son tylenol and sometimes orajel on them|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My daughter did this at about 9 months and I just kept trying to force the bottle and (for once) my mother-in-law new best and told me to introduce a sippy cup.  Once I did so, she took it with no problems.  She would even take breast milk out of it, I would try the sippy cup.<br>  <br>  While he is cutting his teeth put some Baby Orajel on them and let him chew on warm, damp washclothes.  That always soothed Giada when she was cutting teeth.|`|iFDye9RMaa	Try a sippy cup. I know it sounds crazy but most of the sippy cups have hard mouth peices... <br>  <br>  My cousin had this problem with his son at 8months too, and he just introduced the sippy cup and didnt have anymore problems..|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Try using a sippy cup.  My sister had a similar problem with her daughter at ten months.  Sippy cup solved her problem.  It seems she was weaning herself from the bottle.  Maybe your son is doing the same.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My daughter is 14 months and has 10 teeth ( including to molars ) there would be times whens she refused her bottle/food flat out when she was cutting teeth and other times it wouldn't bother her.  I would strongly suggest pushing the sippy cup.  I had a very hard time w/ the sippy cup for my daughter..she didn't even take one till 12 months but now drinks fine.  You should still put the formula in the sippy cup but he just may be done with the bottles for good.  Also it's okay at this age to let him have some water in the sippy cup to if your worried about dehydration.
bXRuC1ASaa	I wanna think the shots didn't come until 8 weeks, but I'm not positive.  I hate when they get shots, it makes me cry!  They will weigh him and check his height and head.  They'll ask you how much he is feeding and how often, they'll check if he's starting to hold his head up, and you can ask any questions you may have. Good luck and enjoy your baby before he grows up!<br>  <br>  Edit-Just tell the doctor that then. As newborns, things aren't always consistent. Also, sometimes they ask how many wet diapers and bowel movements they have a day. So try to keep track of that or just give a guesstimate|`|zwctZ812aa	No, shots come at 8 weeks (2 month check).  At my son's 4 week check they weighed him, measured him, talked to me about how breastfeeding was going, and answered any questions I had.  They also looked in his ears and listened to his chest.  It was very routine.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	More than likely check his weight, his umbillical cord and his penis (if he was circumcised). No shots unless he did not receive his hep vaccine in the hospital.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	If I remember correctly, they will just check him and all his body parts, they kind of squeezed on my son a little bit to make sure all of his inside parts and growing properly. Then he pee'd on his Pediatrician...haha...They will tell you how much weight they hope he will be at on his 8 week well baby appt. What you should probably expect with his development etc.<br>  <br>  8 week is when they typically give shots...I believe :)|`|u1DDrXO2aa	Its just a well child check up...shots will come at 8 weeks...Babys eat when they are hungry my son is now 5 months and still doesnt have a general time sometimes he goes 3-4hrs without eating and sometimes its 2hrs just depends on when they want to eat and when they don't...suggest talking to your doctor though when you go as long as they have kept there weight up and not down more than likely perfectly fine...just remember every baby is different!!!|`|KYkoPHpsaa	i just had mine yesteday, they just checked her weight and length and her hips and heart and ears. no shots yet until they are 2 months|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	My son got shots at his 1 month checkup.  They will take all his measurements and just make sure he is healthy.|`|jvFWNuiXaa	Yeap he is gonna get a shot. HepB.<br>  They check the weight the height, the head circumference. And they will tell you which percentile he falls in. Mine didnt cry much with one shot. Wait till you go to 2 month checkup there are 3 shots. It is heartbreaking. Good luck...
2amysNtyaa	If the girl is old enough to understand the real reason why no-one has told her about her dad, then she has a right to know, Anyone does. <br>  Even if the mother did bring the girl into the world without having a father, the girl should hopefully understand and accept the fact that she will be different, but sometimes different is good.<br>  The girl will soon have to realise no-one can help her find who her father is, if her father was a sperm donor, then even the father will not know which child is his or not. When the girl gets older, and begins to ask more, the mother should sit her down and talk about it. Maybe the girl has a few un-answered questions she wants answers for, which is understandable. But the mother needent worry about the girl being mad at her. The mother should take it slow with her daughter, and try not to start of a arguement over her father. This will only make matters worse. <br>  Good luck.<br>  Millieeee xox|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Are you asking because you genuinely want to know, or because you cut and pasted an answer someone else gave you from that link? Not sure on that one ...<br>  <br>  If you raise your child well, they'll eventually understand where their father 'came from.' If you're untruthful to your child and hide things from them intentionally from them, expect for things not to go so well.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	nope|`|AA11206135	Are you kidding me????

hSJnaysiaa	I am hesitant to even answer this because I know I will get a thumbs down and probably be bashed for my choice, but I'm just trying to be honest.<br>  <br>  I am due with my first baby (a boy) on March 29th and I plan to give him formula only from day one. <br>  <br>  There isn't just one reason for my decision, but I have many reasons. For one, I only get two weeks off from work once I have the baby (and I am working until I pop) and even though my job will allow me to bring my baby with me to work, it won't allow enough time to have a baby constantly on my boob, and I know newborns nurse a lot and due to the nature of my job (I'm a nanny for a 3 month old girl) I have to be busy with their child who is also very young, not nursing my child all day.<br>  <br>  I also don't want to spend the money on a breastpump. Again, I won't have time to pump at work and I think that even if I tried it would just be money wasted. The idea of being engorged at any time doesn't sound comfortable either.<br>  <br>  And I think through formula feeding I will be more able to leave my child with a friend or family member (or daddy) to get some alone time. This isn't most important, but I don't like the idea of feeling like I'm on a short leash because baby needs to eat.  <br>  <br>  And I've heard formula fed babies sleep better at night- which I'm all for. The girl I nanny for is breastfed (she's 3 months old) and she sleeps with her parents because she nurses so often and they don't want to keep going back and forth to her crib. I am also not ok with baby sleeping in my bed, he has his own bed and that's where I want him.<br>  <br>  I'm not comfortable with breastfeeding in public. Granted, I have never done this personally, but I don't like it when others do it and don't see myself being even remotely ok with doing it, and also don't see myself trying to feed my baby in a public bathroom stall. Ick.<br>  <br>  And here comes the part that will definitely get me the thumbs down- I find breastfeeding repulsive. Its just so gross to me. I've seen women breastfeed and their breasts don't look normal, lumpy and the thought of my baby drinking my body fluid is just nasty to me. To me, its sort of like feeding my baby urine, its all liquid that I "produce". And I'm just disgusted by it.<br>  <br>  So yeah, I know this isn't normal to feel this way, and I know breastfeeding is natural, but I don't want to do it, and I think I have plenty of valid reasons to not breastfeed as well as some reasons that aren't "good enough" for the lactivists.<br>  <br>  I catch a ton of grief about my decision from my husband, we wants me to breastfeed. So does my dr, but its my choice. I have heard all the facts about anti-bodies and whatnot, and that's fine and great, but its not an important enough reason for me to feel like breastfeeding. And I don't believe that breastfed kids grow up more well adjusted or anything either. <br>  <br>  Its just my preference though. No one needs to feel sad for my baby or mad, its my choice.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	I think many hospitals/healthcare providers do not stress enough the importance and ease of breastfeeding.  Even the hospital I delivered at claimed they were totally "pro breast" but they ended up putting a pacifier in his basinett (even tho I requested they not give any pacifiers or bottles) and when I needed help from a lactation consultant, it took time to get info.  <br>  <br>  If you choose to formula feed you also get all sorts of free samples, etc, etc. but what many women don't realize is that it is SO MUCH HARDER to formula feed.  You always have to make a bottle (perhaps with a screaming baby in your arms), you have to clean up afterwards, you have to carry one with you if you leave the house and somehow keep it cool, you have to pay for it, etc.  There are so many reasons NOT to formula feed but I think women jsut don't realize how easy and natural it is to breastfeed.  <br>  <br>  I don't even have to think about feeding my baby till he starts whining.  No planning ahead, just feed him on demand wherever and whenever.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i would think its really none of any ones business. <br>  <br>  i breastfed and formula fed for the first year because i wanted to.<br>  <br>  my best friend has a 2 month old and she struggled with breastfeeding, ended up with mastitis 3 times and couldn't get the baby to latch properly. she tried getting help, but nothing was working. she decided to give him formula. its better to have a healthy formula fed baby, then to have a breastfed baby who is not getting what it needs and is not growing. which is what happened to my friend. <br>  <br>  i reall however, don't htink anyone needs to give anyone else justification on why they chose to do one over the other. <br>  <br>  it baffles me how people think it is their business and right to tell formula feeding mothers that they are wrong.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	This is a argument on the NB&B page everyday. *sigh* Let it go. No matter how another mother chooses to feed her child the point is they are being fed and cared for. There are so many other things out there that make people bad parents like child abuse, neglect, ect.. I rarely see that as a focus of people. It is always the same thing day in and day out on this page" if you don't breastfeed you are some how neglecting your child! " Get off it. It is stupid questions like this that make me not even want to come to this forum.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You may not have been "trying"  make people angry by posting this question but you are not a new person to this section and you should have known the response that you were going to get. Sorry all these questions do is start fights and stir people up for no reason what so ever.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	Breastfeeding can be very demanding even if you pump, and for some people they just don't have the time or for whatever reason they can't commit.  For others I think it's lack of education, they may think that formula is just as good.  I know some people that are really just uncomfortable with it too.  Not even because of the suckle part of it, but because they are uncomfortable talking about or be so involved with their breasts.<br>  <br>  I think I have to defend this asker.  She understands that people have problems when they try.  She stated that above.  She is curios and I think she is asking a genuine question.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I attempted to breastfeed for the first month and then I decided to formula feed. I was a new Mommy and I didn't have a lot of breastfeeding support. My daughter always had a hard time latching and would scream in hunger. I had lactation consultants come to my house and help me but it never seemed to work when they were gone and I was left alone. I was so exhausted that I just decided to formula feed. Looking back I wish I tried harder but at the time it seemed impossible to me. My goal for my next baby is to breast feed. Formula is expensive!|`|u1DDrXO2aa	I think that it is a personal decision if a women choses not to thats her choice...I chose not to breast feed my son because i probably had one of the worst experience before he was born i have wic and i went to get set up with it and a women talked to me about breast feeding and it totally grossed me out that the whole time she talked to me she was breat feeding her daughter i am sorry but some women dont take offense to it because they see it as natural thing to do but i just dont agree with breast feeding in public thats why they make pumps just my personal opinion.....but i had already made my mind up that i was not prepared to breast feed...they make formula for a reason so you have a choice and i think now i might have changed my mind and breast feed because it is better for your child and you so you loose weight faster but i could careless as long as my son is happy and healthy then it shouldn't matter if i choose to formula feed and some people just dont understand that you have a choice and i think i made a perfectly good one!!!|`|J3yUXKiyaa	I think that it's a personal decision that should be left to the mother.  I know two people who had such a horrible experience with breastfeeding with the first, that they knew that formula was a better option for them the second go around.  If someone thinks they were wrong in their decisions, which were both for different reasons, they can go back and walk a mile in those women's shoes.  Easy for some to judge when it went off without a hitch for them.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I don't breast feed because my son has a poor sucking reflex and after a month - we decided (my doctor, LC and I) to switch. Why does it really matter to you why someone would "choose to use formula before they even attempt to breast feed."?  They're feeding their baby - that is what matters.|`|AA12243380	Some of my friends were uncomfortable with the thought.  I can't answer for myself because all of my kids have had a drink on me lol but I did switch to ff when my twins were 3 weeks old because bfing and pumping was a pain w/ twins and having a job.  It's way easier now w/ a single baby and staying home!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Some women have to go back to work right away and it might be easier.  And for some women it is just weird to have a kid attached to  your chest and not to mention the feed more often when it's breastmilk.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I had a terrible case of bronchitis when I had my daughter. The dr put me on meds with codeine and he said not to breastfeed.

The bottom line is the baby is eating a balanced diet. Sure, breastfeeding is a lot better, but...<br>  <br>  How many of the breastfeeding mothers who stress on a daily basis how much better breastfeeding is continue to buy organic hormone-free food for their whole family on a regular basis? How many of them bake cookies and treats for their family at home to avoid all the preservatives in packaged snacks? How many of them never take their child to McDonalds or Chuck e cheese for lunch? You can't have it both ways.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I would like to know the same thing. It breaks my heart when I see newborn babies (still in the hospital!) being formula fed when the moms didn't even try to breastfeed.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	Honestly, my own lack of education on the subject. When I had my first, I have never known anyone who breast fed. Formula was the norm for my family. It also hurt that in the hospital, the nurses just asked which formula I was planning on using. The subject of breastfeeding never came up. I had a difficult labor, and at the moment, I couldn't really wrap my head around anything that was going on. Within a week, I really started to regret my decision. With my new baby, I've had a lot more support, and so much more information was available to me. I breastfed her for the first 6 weeks, but unfortunately had to stop because of a medical issue. If I knew with my first how easy and how wonderful it could be, I would've breastfed her. I do plan on trying again with my next.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	well i didn't choose to do it before i breastfed <br>  i did not want to breast feed for a whole year <br>  <br>  i wanted to do it for at least six weeks at the most 6 months and after he was born i decided four months would be great and it was but i combination fed from day 3 <br>  <br>  i was not into me nursing in public <br>  <br>  and when i went back to school <br>  when he was six weeks he got formula from 630 - 330 <br>  because i had no a clue of how i would pump and still have enough milk to feed him it confused me to much and at 4 months it was the best time for both of us <br>  and well my son would starve if we did not have formula so that's why i formula feed|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Why do people have to stir up crap about the same tired topic every single day on this website?

You knew exactly what you were doing.  How could you not, your on this site EVERYDAY!!!|`|zwctZ812aa	Why does it matter?? Their baby is getting fed, no matter what the method, just let it go.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I don't know about "some moms", and frankly I don't care.  It's none of my business.  So long as the kid is being fed!  <br>  <br>  I hate answering these questions, because it always comes off as an excuse why I could not breastfeed, and although it's no one's business, I'll explain again:<br>  <br>  6 years ago, I had a breast reduction.  I had to no plans to get pregnant, so a lot of my milk ducts were severed in the reduction process.<br>  <br>  I have hypothyroidism, and have had it for 4 years.  <br>  <br>  So, when I got pregnant, I knew it would be a longshot as far as breastfeeding, but I planned to do it anyway.<br>  <br>  The baby is born, and I start breastfeeding.  The problem?  She hardly got any milk, and very little colostrum.  The first 5 days of her life, she breastfed around the clock, and still cried because she was hungry,  I slept in a chair in the livingroom for 3 days.  <br>  <br>  Did I mention she had ZERO wet diapers and ZERO poop diapers for 3 days?  Not a good sign.<br>  <br>  Then, the baby just stopped crying.  In fact, she stopped doing much of anything, but staring at me with sad eyes.  <br>  <br>  I took her to a lactation consultant.  The baby was weighed.  She went from 8 lbs 1 oz to 7 lbs!  The lactation consultant told me to supplement with formula, otherwise the baby was going to die (turns out she was right-when I took her to the hospital, the doctors said her vital organs were shutting down due to lack of nutrition and dehydration).  <br>  <br>  As soon as I supplemented, the baby's health dramatically improved (how's that for "poison" lol).  <br>  <br>  I tried to continue putting my baby to the breast, but she just didn't want to breastfeed. She would suckly for comfort, but she wasn't getting any nutrients.  Slowly, she just wanted her bottle of formula.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I have to agree with ebey.  This subject is a bit played out.  Yes, some mothers choose not to even try.  I myself, could not.  We tried and tried and actually fought with the baby, but with flat nipples and a colicky baby with a bad suck reflex it was nearly impossible.  She's fomula fed now.  We started it in the hospital.  Asking this question is just like a formula feeding mother asking, "why in the world would you breastfeed?".  It's all a matter of what's right for YOUR baby.  You feed yours and worry about yours and leave the formula feeding mothers alone!!!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I can't answer for myself, becauseI did try, but didn't have the support/knowledge to try other things before giving up, I really do kick myself for it now.<br>  <br>  My mum didn't try at all, not with any of the four of us, apparently at that time bottle feeding was "just what you did".  I can't really get my head around this.  And I think she still thinks this was TBH.<br>  <br>  I've made a promise to myself that next time I'm going to research nipple shields, breastfeeding groups etc when I'm pregnant, because  the support isn't there in the hospitals themselves.|`|x647LeB2aa	I formula fed my second child.<br>  <br>  The reason I made this choice is because her older brother was in isolation in hospital having had a stem cell transplant the month before his sister was born.<br>  <br>  Erin was being foisted off on various family members and friends (but mainly my mum) at all hours of the day and night because her brother's need was greater and I needed to be at his side caring for him.  If she needed feeding a bottle was easier and it meant I didn't have to worry about both my children and could dedicate my time to James.<br>  <br>  He died when she was 4 weeks old and again, as I needed a lot of help and support at that time, bottles were easier.|`|k2heQRKFaa	i say to each their own, but for me personally had latch problems BF for 2 weeks--hope to do it longer next time. but i think if possible women should try to BF at least in the begining to get that important colostrum...but we shouldnt judge a mom who chooses formula from the get-go-----becuz really who cares what they feed their child its such a stupid petty thing to get all irate about.....|`|rAkWoweOaa	People will thumbs down me, but I really find it easier to formula feed than to breast feed. I am very modest and the thought of publicly breastfeeding makes me nervous. It is sad, but true. I breastfed for the first month only and I knew from the start I would formula feed. That is just my personal opinion. I also hated pumping.|`|eeee2f2fbb78961fe66b645a046c24b0aa	I wonder the same thing. God gave us the ability to provide nutrition naturally to our child. I understand some women try and can't, which is fine, but alot don't even give it a chance! Why not AT LEAST try!! If it doesn't work out it doesn't work out.

I will admit I am a breastfeeding activist and think that people should not formula feed however I generally only provide facts, I don't attack.  The only way to reduce the amount of formula used is to change the culture and the medical system.<br>  <br>  I'm also sure many of my contacts circumcise their boys and I am certainly on the other side on that.  I believe it is child abuse, I also am sure that the current law violates the Human Rights laws and constitution of Canada where I live and I occasionally write my MPs about it.  No matter what your view of male circumcision its not permissible to have different laws for males and females under Canadian law.  So either female circumcision must be legal, or no infant circumcision without true medical need should be legal.  It simply isn't true that a clitoredectomy or hoodectomy are vastly different from male circumcision.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I do recognize your name but I don't know your story. <br>  <br>  Sorry your other account got deleted.

They'll get stronger and eventually turn into kicks.  I started getting kicks at 19 weeks when I laid down at night...maybe one or 2 but now at 20 weeks and 2 days I feel them randomly thru the day :-)  Its just going to get more exciting from here!|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Dat a widdle bouncy baby!

Dey to tweet, dey go boing boing fump fump all day wong.<br>  <br>  Of course, by week 35 you're just about kicking them back, but hey, when dey just butterflies, dey just lovely.  <br>  <br>  in short:  aaaaaaawwww.  make me go all gooey.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I felt flutters at 14 weeks and kicks at 16 so it's not uncommon. You can be feeling a mixture of flutters and gas and once they feel stronger, you will realize which ones were which.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	That is your little one. I first felt my little girl at 11 weeks and that is exactly what it felt like! Congrats on your baby!!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	That seems early but it very well could be. I didn't feel it for sure until I was 19 weeks.|`|5puE2Qfpaa	May be hiccups. It is so amazing how they start so young with all the movement. I did not feel mine move until around week 15 -16. Have fun!!!|`|dU0ibtU1aa	normal i felt it at 14 weeks|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	That's not to early at all just enjoy it wile you little on is still little lol the kicks start to hurt sometimes. My son fractured my rib TWICE!!! Congrats.
r7q8LW7Aaa	Wow, what a berk!<br>  You'd think he would know better, working specifically with babies! <br>  I would complain, he ought to know better.<br>  ETA - lol, anyone else think that the 'let it go' answerers are not parents??<br>  ETA again - To the answerers who seem to sympathise with the doctor - instead of 'think about it this way - he has to deal with squirmy babies all day...' How about, think about it this way - they had to tackle London public transport (a mission in itself), navigate through a large hospital to find the right department, probably had to wait in a crowded waiting room, all with a squirmy baby, he was then proded and poked, then they got patronised and scolded by the man that we TAXPAYERS pay to deal with it in a professional and polite manner.<br>  I think I sympathise with the baby more.|`|DDFSITiYaa	Well, he certainly could have been more patient and understanding. I'm sure your son isn't the first to move during a scan. When my son had his, the tech let him play with her ID badge that she had all sorts of little stickers on.  Worked like a charm. <br>  <br>  They do have to have minimal movement in order for the DR to get an accurate scan but there are many ways to do this or to engage the parent to assist.   Unfortunately   a lot of dr's have a god-complex.|`|vRodocjcaa	Wow, what a jerk! Definitely time for a new office! Before reading the whole question, I thought his comment about breastfeeding was because he felt it was wrong in someway, which is absurd, but after reading the scenario, I believe he said it solely out of impatience. No excuse whatsoever for treating you that way!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	No!  I can't believe he said that to you!  Seriously, there is no way to make a 7 month old lie perfectly still, even with toys, bottles and pacifiers...they're curious.  I would definitely complain.  <br>  <br>  I hope everything is ok with your son!  :)|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Even if you can't choose your health care I would still file a complaint because that was extremely rude.  It's your choice to breastfeed and a doctor of all people should be respectful of that.  Especially one who works with young babies.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	I would file a complaint about that guy and NEVER go back to him! Idiot.|`|5aJ6E3JFaa	There is absolutely no excuse for that, I don't care how busy dr's are - they get paid enough to suck it up and deal if they are aggravated about something.  I would complain!<br>  <br>  Also: people are mentioning that maybe he had something horrible happen etc - true, but everyone still needs to be accountable for their behavior, especially in a highly paid position!  I'm sure there's nothing in their personnel handbook that says that drs are allowed to be rude if they're having a bad day!  You are perfectly entitled to have been upset by what happened.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	DO you think he forgot to look up the definition of 'pediatric' before becoming a pediatric cardiologist, LOL? It doesn't seem like he has a problem w/ breastfeeding per say but was a) impatient in general and b) too impatient to wait for you to nurse him. Again- a dictionary may be in order?<br>  It's too bad you can't go elsewhere- I think I'd have become rather abrupt with him. To be short with not only a baby (who realistically probably couldn't care less about his 'shortness') but with the mother of an infant who is in an obviously high-stress situation just by merit of having to take her infant to a sub-specialist's office is unprofessional. Yes I'm sure it can get tiring dealing with (other people's) infants all day- that's why he had the option of going in to adult medicine instead of peds.   And I hope the little one is okay. ?<br>  <br>  If wriggling is SUCH an issue then it seems the trest would be done w/ twilight at least- so maybe the wriggling is just an issue for Dr. Cranky.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	You should file a complaint to the hospital and say that it was disrespectful and rude of him to comment. It's the normal thing for a young baby to wriggle and move. My son is 2 and a half and he would be impossible to sit still. <br>  <br>  He obviously doesn't have kids.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Wow!  What a jerk!  I hope you spoke up!! I would definitely go to another specialist.  You do not deserve to be treated that way.  I am assuming that "dummy" means pacifier??  You threw me there for a second.  I thought the doc was calling you a dummy, you know, stupid!  OMG!  <br>  <br>  Hope your day gets better.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	I would have wanted to walk out!!  That is horrible, and not to mention rude!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yeah what a jerk- you should see my son at his doctors apt. i'm sure the doctors are glad when we leave lol. he screams whenever they touch him and fights against them. Also, he starts running around like a maniac getting into their cabinets and ripping the paper off the exam table and what not. i try to keep him entertained but there's not much you can do in a doctor's office with a toddler except blow up exam gloves lol<br>  <br>   they understand i guess. when i was like 4 i had an exam and to get shots- the doc went to give my the shot and i kicked him in the nuts like 10 times lol- my sister takes her kids to him now and hee said that's one reason why he doesn't give vaccines anymore lol<br>   my son had to get a chest x-ray before and he was moving all over the place but the tech was so nice and even laughed.<br>  <br>   you would think since your son's doc deals with babies he must be a pediatric cardiologist so he MUST deal with it all the time and be use to it|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Do you know this man personally? Maybe he is having a bad day. I know people aren't supposed to bring their feelings to work but that is easier said then done. Maybe his wife was just diagnosed with a terminal illness, maybe his dog died, maybe his wife just had a miscarriage or his mom passed away. Who knows!!! But maybe he is just having a bad day, which people are allowed to have every now and again. <br>  <br>  When I was in college my father was killed. I went to the trial of the guy who killed my Dad and the man was only sentenced to a year in prison. I didnt tell anyone I went and I was in a pissy mood for a good week. The only one who knew what was going on was my roommate. After all my friends called me a b*tch and other names for avoiding them and not going out . My roommate finally told them what happened and they all felt bad for speaking badly about me. Maybe he is in a situation like this? I would let it go. If he is a good Doctor otherwise, just brush it off.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	You think him being a Pediatric dr he would be used to this by now. Giving a baby a bottle or dummy doesnt always solve the problem. He was real jerk. I would be sorta squirmy took with all that going on. Tell him to get the corn cob outta his butt and if he cant take a baby wiggly around TO GET A NEW JOB! lol|`|M9M6nTZeaa	You must see this from the Doctors point of view. He has many other patients to see and doesn't have time to sit and wait while your baby squirms all over the table. I am sure that he was just tired of having to deal with squirmy babies all day. Really, its not a big deal, its over now right?|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Jeez, you'd think doing his job he'd be used to wriggly babies?!  Some doctors need to get over themselves.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	*lol* My friend took her baby to the mayo clinic because her local docs were not listening to her concerns.<br>  <br>  The first doctor at the mayo clinic (he was err a pediatric Gastroenterologist  I think?) said that she should wean because her baby had breastMILK jaundice.  So she told that doctor he shouldn't have a license and she wants another doctor in there pronto.<br>  <br>  Then they get a second doctor in who proceeds to tell off the first doctor for suggesting it, saying that they don't do that anymore because its has no benefit.<br>  <br>  You get idiots in every profession.
xHKRGEg4aa	Theres nothing wrong with you sweetie. Its extremely common, I'm 12 weeks & still get occasionally depressed. So scared I'm gonna lose the baby, or mess the child up, etc. Just relax, you will do fine. Don't stress so much, & the upset stomach should go away soon.|`|AA12192310	it is because of hormonal changes in your body . you need to get outside and walk or go shopping do anything that will get you moving you will feel better in you second trimester    good luck|`|hNIof0lbaa	You can get put on depression meds while pregnant, you may want to ask about it.
deIzFnV8aa	At my shower they got white onsies in various sizes and let the guests decorate them with fabric markers. We love the unique (which is def the word for some of them!) outfits we got as a result, and everyone had a great time. Plus our friends love seeing pics of baby sporting something they had a hand in making.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	We played a game at my sisters where we passed around a roll of toliet paper and you guessed how big around she was and at the end when everyone had guessed we would take turns wrapping our peice around her and whoever guessed the closest got a prize.|`|AA12131454	Maybe you can check this website out for some ideals. Good Luck!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyshower101.com/baby_shower_games.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyshower101.com/baby_shower...</a>|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	How big is mommy using toilet paper.  Also Don't Say Baby...whenever someone says baby or the baby's name they have to put change in the baby's piggy bank.
3OP1YIXCaa	I used to self harm. I went to the nurse because I thought my cuts were infected. I learned then that not only is she required by law to tell your parents, but when you tell the nurse that you are cutting, she has to file a report and you can not return to school until you have a signed doctors note that says you are mentally sound to return to school. <br>  <br>  Some parents get angry. But you might be surprised. There are some parents that are proud of their kids for telling someone.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You wouldn't get kicked out .You can return the minute you have a doctors note. I don't think it would go on your permenant record, mine did not. They just do that so that the school will not get in trouble if you cut at school and get really hurt. It is a safety precaution. Also, they want to know that you are mentally stable enough not to commit suicide. You wouldn't be in trouble. <br>  <br>  If you want to talk to someone, you can email me at anytime. I check my email 2-3 times a day at least. I am willing to help. You can reach me through my profile.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CANDY: YOU ARE A B*TCH FOR SAYING THAT! THAT IS SOO HORIBLE! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THAT TO HER! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	The school nurse may tell them depending on how much of a danger she believes you may be posing to yourself. It is the law for her to tell your parents if she believes you will kill yourself or cause yourself serious harm.<br>  <br>  If you no longer see the school nurse as a viable option maybe you could try another trusted adult? A parent of one of your friends or a teacher maybe.<br>  <br>  You probably wouldn't be kicked out of school, self harm issues are not strong enough grounds to expel someone. You would probably be offered the help of an educational psychologist or counsellor.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	yes the nurse can tell. but also your parents shouldnt react that way they should see that you need help and they are just making it worse by putting you down. talk to your nurse and tell her how THEY make you feel and that you are scared for them to find out bc they will put u down even more and tha'ts wats causing you to be like this in the first place hun. good luck|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Yes, the nurse can tell your parents. If you do not want her to tell your parents, just ask the school nurse. However, you really should tell your parents; self-harming is a very bad and dangerous habit, and your parents really need to know about it.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Yes they could, if you are a minor.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your parents have any sense, they won't shout. The best way to deal with your situation is to find out why you are self-harming, and then address that problem.|`|lTsPX04jaa	yes|`|1EHX6fQ7aa	Why don't you call something like childline? I know it might sound silly but they can help and not tell anyone. It's also over the phone so you don't have to look at them face to face. <br>  I know what your going through, trust me. But seriously cutting isn't the answer. Try and stop or at least be careful. The last thing you want is another scare.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Candyflood, people who post hateful answers on Yahoo are usually doing it for attention, so yeah, you got your 11+ thumbs down, you happy now?|`|veeC7Rvvaa	You know what sweetheart, I just have this awful feeling.. (partly because i'm paranoid) that these medical staff don't take teenagers privacy seriously.. In an ideal world, they shouldn't tell your parents, but they probably will because there is blood and cutting involved!<br>  <br>  If you feel like you need to talk to someone, e-mail or phone the samaritans.. I've contacted them a couple of times, and they are non judgmental, very calm and really rational and non patronizing people.. please give them a ring.. they will never ever tell your parents, they only tell the police if you're a terrorist or if you're dying they'll call an ambulance, other wise they never tell.. and you can request a call back!<br>  Please give them a try, they're there for you and most of them are volunteers who have trained with the samaritans after losing someone very close or been there in your very position..<br>   <a href="http://www.samaritans.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.samaritans.org/</a>|`|pPUzkbtGaa	if you freeze up when u talk to people then i would write it all down on paper before you talk to the nurse/ teacher. then you could just read it off the paper or hand it to them to read for themselves. <br>  <br>  i hope that you feel better after you tell them about how you've been feeling. it's always better to talk about things that to keep them all bottled up.|`|mt7fqVSKaa	I think that she would have the right to tell ur parents.  <br>  <br>  Now, maybe if u do tell maybe she can help you and ur family.  Also when i was in high school i had some issues and i talked to a school councerlor and they talked to my parents and made them realize that i had a problem and that i needed their help.  sure, i wasnt fixed the next day...it took time...u know?  <br>  <br>  i'll keep u in my prayers.<br>  and i hope everything turns out ok for u.|`|mHSwQa7Naa	Yes. Any teachers, counselors, nurses, etc. must inform someone if someone is harming you, you are harming yourself, or you are going to harm someone else.|`|sN8Lycx9aa	No. Doctor patient confidentialty applies to nurses. Anything you say to her cannot be told to anyone else unless you give your permission.|`|qvYTw3JHaa	yes they will tell somethin like this happen to a girl in my skl n they told her parents but she gt help. but b4 they tell ur parents its better 2 telll them ur self|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yes she can tell and certainly will tell. You are a minor she has no choice. If you are injuring yourself you need help. It is best your parents know.  Turn to the Lord and pray.:)|`|AA11210211	yes they can and they should.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Yes she can, and she should.  Telling the nurse is your best bet, so that she can be your gateway to telling your parents, it's good you trust her enough that you can tell her, cutting too deep is a very big problem and I am glad you have the presence of mind to stop yourself and get help.  Don't knock your parents though, everyone thinks their parents are the worst when they are growing up, they may not be as angry as you think, they may be concerned, scared, worried things like that just as much as angry.  Don't count them out just yet.  Good luck.|`|QGP930C6aa	i'm sorry about all that --- it cnt help if your parents aren't there for you and i know self harming isn't always for isn't for attention. <br>  <br>  But, i think if you went to someone you trusted then they would be able to help you and make sure your parents dnt know. if you have troubke tellin someone something you could write it down and give it to them to read so you don't get lost for words and they know whats goin on.<br>  <br>  p.s 1 of my friends talked to a teacher they trusted when they were self harming and they weren't put out of school or anything the teacher was just there as someone to talk to and their parent s weren't involved at all <br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps :) try and ignore the people who bring you down and stick with the people who raise you up :)|`|YkD4Pf2Raa	go to your doctor/gp instead. they have to keep patient confidentiality, but self-harm is a serious issue and your parents shoudln't get angry, they should help you. one of my best friends self-harms, and now her parents know she is able to get support at home and see a counsellor and everything.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	You must tell someone,you need help and you won't get it by trying to keep it secret...............
aI4wgxRFaa	No, you're like me, I also have irregular periods. So sometimes I don't know when is my period is going to come. Have you try using protection or go on birth control bills? It will help you have a regular period and plus you won't get pregnant fast. I myself am late on my period, 6 days late to be exact. Good luck. :-)|`|IAzCsvaNaa	try drinking a herbal tea. you can buy it at any grocery store. i have the same problem as u but i still have not had any luck on conceiving a child. can you give me some advice on how long it took u to conceive. email me at patriciaperez_2008@yahoo.com|`|DgXmTJzYaa	Try Clomid my dear. I am on it. No luck yet but I have heard lots of great things. My doctor prescribed it to me because I have irregular periods. I only have them every other month. Clomid regulated them and I had my period ever 32 to 35 days. I am started 100mg of clomid next cycle. Clomid is used to make you ovulate. Good luck!!
bYhqPOtwaa	When I was 6wk pregnant I woke up one morning with light spotting. I called my dr and he wanted me to come in. After running what seemed like a million tests and an ultrasound, they determined that my hormone levels were low. I was prescribed progesterone for the rest of my 1st trimester. After that I never had any more spotting or any other complications.<br>  <br>  Many women have light spotting early in pregnancy, and most of the time it's nothing to worry about. However, it wouldn't hurt to call your dr, he may want to check it out.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And congrats!|`|OyBuEpOTaa	I have. I found out that it is very common. In fact some bleed all the way through the 9 months.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	i had a very small amount of red spotting when i was 8 weeks i was scanned and everything was fine my daughter is 3 years old now, but previous to that i had blood and miscarried (with no pain at all). I would really go to a doctor and get checked out sooner than the 18th.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I did after my pap smear but that's about it.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	My son loved sweet potatoes and pears also.  He actually ate everything we gave him but those were his favorites.  If she won't eat squash then try mixing it with applesauce to make it sweeter and to fool her basically.|`|yCwPxulYaa	My baby loves avocado.  She also likes sweet potatos and peas.  She will not touch green beans and HATES fruit.  I have never known a baby not to like fruit but she gags and cries when I try to give her fruit.  She has a mind of her own.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	His favorite is sweet potatoes. He is 9.5 months so I cook them and he eats them as finger foods. He has always hated peas.|`|nmwdQ6bQaa	dont have one|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My daughter is now 9, but at 5 months old she loved pears, applesauce, and sweet potatoes.  She wouldn't do peas though.  She refused, lol.  I used to mix her peas in with her sweet potatoes though, and she never even noticed.  Made it sort of a vegetable medley also, and mixed things up a bit.|`|iFDye9RMaa	Pears. she would eat her weight in them. She Also loves sweet peas. <br>  <br>  She eats squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, green beans and pears and peas...<br>  she hates prunes and meat and regular peas.|`|1TXRqT26aa	haha my 11 month old loves all those too...she also likes the turkey dinners, chicken and sweet potato dinners, and actual bananas. She loves when I make sweet potatoes or mashed potatoes from scratch too.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	My baby loves bananas, applesauce, pears, and sweet potatoes.<br>  She hates peaches, she made the funniest face. I haven't tried squash yet, but I did buy some last night. lol|`|OmJfYPptaa	She likes all of those to. Lol. Ya she does not like the turkey and gravy at all. It also smells bad.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My daughter just started solids recently. So far she LOVES sweet potatoes and avocados. But HATES peas. It's so funny to watch her face as she tries new things!|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	Definitely bananas!!

Second favorite is anything he can stick his hands in and then mash into his face or whip across the room.  Third favorite is yogurt, which sometimes doubles as number one and number two.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter refuses to eat anything we try to feed her, so she eats table foods instead.

3DZDT4VIaa	you should have your iron levels checked, i felt like i was constantly drunk and falling about the place mixed in with some sickness, and my iron was really low. i went on iron at 29 wks and its still quite bad and still isnt going up much, but there is a slight improvement. you should try and take it easy, as it will cause you to faint. gd luck x|`|3K7ffKn2aa	im only 29 weeks but i've had that happen also, dizzy, hart racing type thing. my doc said its normal ask someone to come over and watch him for an hour or 2 and just rest. call your doc if you are really worried but you probably just need to lay down.|`|qfNK5aDEaa	I am 34 weeks pregnant and I get the same way when putting clothes away and just cleaning. You feel like that because your body just gets tired faster now. I usually lay down until it goes away but you have a baby so i would recommend that you call a friend or someone in the family to watch your child for a while so you can get some rest because you dont want to fall and hurt yourself..Hope I helped..
DDYwnut6aa	A solid red line means FF is sure of the ovulation date.  Dashes mean it could be wrong.
ByoYmFsBaa	You're entirely right in your assessment of this woman being disrespectful and rude. And yes, it IS an unwritten rule that you make the effort to go to see the grandparents, not visa versa. I (reluctantly)  spent many Sundays at my grandparent's house while growing up and we all gathered at their house because that's the way that it was. Looking back, it was a tradition I'm glad was in place.<br>  <br>  And the funeral bit? Unreal. Your brother is in for it. You don't see women like this changing out of the goodness of their hearts. :-(|`|gBxVEUMmaa	First of all I am sorry about your grandmother and the nasty direspectful sister in law has got to go......but idk about the whole childten thing I guess u guys will have to sit down and talk to your brother and parents when that wife isn't  around.|`|mHSwQa7Naa	Well see I understand what your saying, but a baby should not have to be brought to anyone. If people want to see the baby they should go to them. It is hard to take a baby out especially because you have to make sure the weather is okay and they are bundled up. You have to keep to their schedule, make sure you have everything in a diaper bag. I personally think that the baby shouldn't have to be dragged out to see other people because they want to see the baby, the baby doesn't even know whats going on. Thats my opinion coming from my experience, with my 15 month old and my in laws.|`|TBNaPkl6aa	Your sister-in-law doesn't sound like a princess, but we're only hearing your side of the story (and honestly, what does the funeral story have to do with what you're asking?).  Regarding the "unwritten rule" saying one must go visit grandparents, I have never heard of that, although that may have been acceptable in previous generations.  Change takes place over time, and in today's world, families live farther apart and it is more complicated to travel with a baby with all the car seats and safety standards (thank goodness for those!).  <br>  <br>  I hope you don't think I'm trying to be mean here.  I just think it's equally rude of you and your family to assume your brother and his family must travel to see grandparents or anyone else.  It also sounds as if you're blaming your SIL for everything, when your brother might be just as much to blame for not seeing the baby's grandparents.  How often do they travel to see her parents?  Your brother is certainly capable of putting his foot down if she really is the problem and making sure they visit the grandparents.  Either way, it's really not your business, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  If you're not a parent yet, you'll realize that you'll quickly get very tired of hearing family's and friends' opinions on how you do things with your child(ren).  It gets old fast.|`|T52u1DVXaa	I'm not entirely sure.  My husband's parents drop in more often than we go over there, but that's because they want to see their grandchildren and their son.  But it seems like a kindness to take your children to see their grandparents, especially if they're old or ill.<br>  <br>  But if she's that rude and disrespectful I don't know that anything would please her.
aJLx0nhNaa	I went back 3 days a week after three months.  After four months of that I cut back to one day a week.<br>  <br>  The two things that affected my decision the most were 1)the way I felt - I just wanted to be home with my baby 2)the ridiculous cost of childcare in my area.|`|ROJans2Taa	im in canada so we get a year paid, I have to go back though when he's a year, I need the money, ill probably do evenings so my husband will be here for him instead of a babysitter, it's a hard decision sometimes|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I thought I would go back to work after 4 months but it wasn't worth it to us at the price of child care and not seeing my baby and missing his milestones.  We had to make a few changes as far as how we spend our money but it is definitely worth it.  He never gets sick from being in child care and also he gets the attention he needs and is actually ahead for his age because I do get to spend more time with him.  We also have play dates with my friends babies and we will always let the other know if playdates aren't a good idea because one is sick.  But he still gets interaction with other kids.|`|W3jC6Pwhaa	i wanted to go back to work full time actually...and decided against it until my daughter is in pre-school. a few reasons made me decide this...<br>  <br>  one. money. even the job offers that paid really well were in turn only covering for gas money and child care. not really worth it, when you look at it that way. <br>  <br>  two. sounds cheesey, but i really cant leave her! i always get antsy and bored when im home, but the minute i do get a chance to get out by myself, i miss her and want to be home again!<br>  <br>  three. just my opinion, but i really dont trust daycares/care providers all that much anyways. i have three family members whose kids are in daycare, and all three have had bronchitis, rashes, scratches, picked up bad habbits (biting, hiting, spitting), etc. plus, the stuff you see on the news nowadays is pretty insane, so i just dont feel comfortable with dropping my kids somewhere while i go make money. <br>  <br>  i do realize im lucky to be in a position to stay at home with my daughter, and again, those are just my opinions.

a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Yes I do. I am on Paragard IUD and I still take a pregnancy test every couple months just to be sure. I get a bit paranoid I guess. On the birth control I have you spot for a few days then get your period and I always think it is implantation bleeding.|`|18ba725ea0f0d8c565485a0b8048d9b9aa	yes girl I feel your pain. When I am about a week from starting my period I get nausea feel tired sluggish, I even have sore breast sometimes & oh my goodness when I start its like Im in labor sometimes but I have fibroids on my uterus and my doctor assures me this is the main cause of my unfortunate monthly pain...|`|1VdgsZPoaa	No, and I guess that is a good thing.  In the beginning I think my periods might have been a bit more intense just getting back to not having them but it has been so long they went back to just being normal period pains.  They never felt like pregnancy.|`|Q6euzOmVaa	nope felt very different - I've got 4 children, all grown|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	I use the Nuva ring continuously for 3 months, then have a period, and then on again for 3 months, and this time I was supposed to get my period, I felt the same way and I was only spotting! So, I freaked out and took a pregnancy test, but it came back negative. I'm not going to go back on the ring though, just in case I really am pregnant (my kid was conceived while on the Depo Provera shot)  and I'll test again in a week.<br>  Anyways, I think I'm going to stop using it continuously since it now scares me since I don't have a period for a few months.<br>  Anyways, I am always paranoid I'm pregnant because of how I got pregnant the first time. Sometimes I have all the symptoms, and sometimes not.|`|AA11210211	Yes almost every period.The symptoms are almost the same.
a1uoxczTaa	i think both are very nice. Avery sounds more 'sturdy' but it is alot more common then Sidney.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Damien Blake is fine for a boy. Avery and Sidney are masculine boy names. And Paige is masculine. Pages were young boy servants.<br>  <br>  You can give you little girl a sturdy name and it does not have to be masculine to do so. Audrey, Abigail, and Charlotte are very sturdy names yet they are feminine and wonderful for a girl.|`|sU60NqWWaa	I like both Avery and Sidney for a girl.  I'm not crazy about Paige for the middle name.<br>  If you ever watched the movie "The Omen", I think you would find it hard to name your boy child Damien.  I know I never could.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Like Avery Paige a lot, but Damien gives bad vibes...sort of like <br>  Dennis the menace.....Damien the Devil<br>  Might you like Gabriel?|`|AA11080680	I'd have to agree with the answer about Damien, devil child is what I think of when I saw that name. However Blake is a strong boy name! As for your choices of girl names Avery reminds me of a boy name. I like Paige and Sidney just not together. <br>  If your wanting strong sturdy names here are a few:<br>  Boys: Magnus~~Marcello~~Ethan<br>  Girls: Ava~~Isabella~~Emma<br>  Good luck to you and I hope I have helped you!|`|3orAFoiXaa	my fiances cousin her name is avery its a beautiful name and it goes so nive with the middle name paige damien is also a cute name=]|`|Xu4x19y6aa	Damian makes me think of that evil kid from the "Omen" movies.  <br>  <br>  Avery Paige I love though!  <br>  <br>  Hate Sydney, sorry.|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I think both are cute.|`|AA10325228	They are both very cute names. I want to name my daughter Avery Kate (when I have one)|`|sGP6s7uraa	Damien makes me think of demons and the movie Damien.  I don't like it.  Blake is good and love Avery Paige.  I'm very fond of the name Paige and I think I like Avery with it instead of Sidney.

I started to eat healthy and cut sugar out of my diet, lost 30lbs fast and got pregnant immediately.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	i have self diagnosed myself with pcos recently.. lol  pending doctors approval of course!  but until then ive been reading up on it and it says that if you have it and are overweight then losing 5-10% body weight can help things.. especially a low-carb diet apparently (which sucks because those are the worst diets to stick to) so I'm working on that myself right now while I wait to go to fertility specialist in 3 months.. also exercising and trying to get fit in that way as well.
pT7jrsAgaa	My son is 12.  He has Tourette's, OCD, and anxieties.  I would love for there to more activities/groups closer to my area.  Same for neurologists/counselors familiar with this disorder.  We have to drive almost 2 hours one way for his appointments.  A support group for parents and siblings would be wonderful, as well.  There is a camp for kids with TS but it is SO expensive and SO far away that he has no interaction with other kids with his disorder.|`|xQnkYyocaa	My son is 8. He had been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, ODD, and Anxiety at age 5. Now his neurologist, which he see's because of a new diagnosis of Tourettes, thinks he may have Aspergers or Autism Spectrum Disorder. I think our community needs to have a Pediatric Occupational Therapist, closest is half hour away, we also need to have "advanced" classes at school from grade 1, not grade 4, as my son is bored already with the slow pace they go. Also, a play group, or social time, for parents and children with all special needs.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i know so many people with a mental disability and i wish that there were more people that cared about them and not just for them. there are way too many getting taken advantage of.|`|lcXMNGCjaa	To answer your question if I could wish for a service for my son it would be to have full medicaid benefits from the state so that I wouldn't have co pays for all of his medical equipment and appointments and could maybe get some respite! My son who is 2 years old has an undiagnosed metabolic disorder which affects all areas of his development. <br>  <br>  Another thing I wanted to mention is that I work for The Arc of Snohomish County as a Parent to Parent Co- Coordinator we just put together a list of Camps and some have camperships available and we have support groups, special education advisory groups and a ton more. As far as a parenting Coach goes...we do have a Helping Parent Program here in which we set a trained Volunteer Helping Parent up with a Parent who is requesting this sort of match. I am not sure what county you live in, but I encourage you to check out our website www.arcsno.org or you can email me for more information Jessie@arcsno.org and I can get you what information you are looking for<br>  <br>  Take Care,<br>  <br>  Jessie Atkins|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My little sister has Down's Syndrome. The only thing I've wished our entire lives is that other little children wouldn't be so rude to her. They take one glance at her and push her out of the way or stare at her. She's almost 30 but functions at a 5-year old level, so if you take her to Chuck-e-Cheese or something she'll climb her big butt right into the big pen with all the balls. She doesn't even care :) But I hate when other kids stare at her or go screaming to their moms, "There's a grownup playing on the swing!" And so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  She lives in Iowa with our mom and they have some *great* programs there. She's in Respite, goes to fun activities weekly with her special groups, she even has a job. She went to a special-needs school in Des Moines (they graduate the kids when they're 21) and she learned everything from how to put on a pad to making beds to sign language. If Iowa has these resources, I'm sure wherever you're at has the same. Keep looking and good luck!|`|FTFd3AQAaa	my daughter has spina bifida and hydrocephuls, as she is only 3 months we dont really know how much the hydrocephulus has effected her but as for the SB, i wish we had a better idea of what to do with her, we just started PT this week but it seems like we didnt get much direction so i guess i wish for more help from the PT. i am also already thinking ahead to her life as an adult, what i would like is to see her beable to live apart from us... maybe a group home type thing so she can be independant yet still have the help she needs, and i also want her to never have to worry about health insurance or medical bills
92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I like my prescription prenatals - which are expensive, and we do have good insurance - but they only cover part of the cost - but I have never been able to keep over the counter prenatals down, and flintstones just did not have enough folic acid in them (or iron, even the flintstones with iron).   These prescriptions ones do not make me sick (very important to me - that's one reason my ob prescribed them), plus have full 1 mg of folic acid in them - which is very important to me as our first babe died of heart defects, and folic acid can help prevent heart defects.   You can't buy over the counter vitamins with that much in them.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	There are several over-the-counter prenatal vitamins that you can take that have all the same ingredients as the prescription ones. Target brand prenatals are excellent. You can also ask the pharmacist if there is a generic version of the one you are getting or find an over the counter one that you think is a good price and ask the pharmacist if it is equal and they will be happy to tell you.|`|AA10015577	Check Wal-Mart or ask about a cheaper generic brand.  Prenatals are prenatals and all do as they are supposed to.<br>  <br>  Answer my baby name question please, just a quick click away!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmHfrmjttxTaOGUqNGayGNfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090305092443AAIh93K">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|v0596BTeaa	Next time you are in the pharmacy ask if there is an equivalent generic medicine - they are the best people to tell you.|`|YUiDqXaTaa	I am guessing that you are in USA, well here in the UK the doctor/midwife prescribes us only one thing and that is FOLIC ACID. You should be able to buy them over the counter at a pharmacy anywhere in the world as the are classed as a vitamin. either that or consult your pharmacist as we in the UK can buy other things over the counter there is one popular one that you can buy here called pregnacare. Good luck. i have included a link that i think you will find very useful|`|4XfjUcvDaa	The prenatals that I was taking were very expensive as well.. They also made me very sick. And I tried like 5 different ones.  Finally my doctor told me that I can take 1 and a half chewable flinstone vitamins with a folic acid as well.  If you compare the vitamins that are in both it is the same as taking the flinstones, and alot cheaper.|`|qHa4w8eyaa	Maybe you can check out your local health food store - they tend to have a lot of variety in supplement types and price ranges.  You should easily be able to find something that's less than $20.  Knowing how long each bottle will last you will help when comparing prices.  Try not to go too low, though - you want to ensure that the vitamins are of the best quality you can give your baby when or she does arrive.  Best of luck....lots of baby dust!|`|dY5fM2vTaa	yes you can by OTC prenatal. I get mine at Wilmar in the vitamin aisle|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Definitely ask if there is a generic next time you're at the pharmacy, but also talk with your doctor and tell her you just can't afford these and ask if there is something over the counter she recommends. I used a store brand prenatal (Longs brand) and my daughter came out perfect. Her APGAR scores were 8 and 9.<br>  I personally think you should look at the ingredients in your prescription bottle comapred to a store brand. They really aren't that different. It's important to have lots of Folic Acid (800 mcg), Thiamin (B1) (1.5 mg), Riboflavin (B2) (1.6 mg), Niacin (B3) (17 mg), Pyridoxine (B6) (2.2 mg), Vitamin B12 (2.2 mcg), Vitamin A (800 mcg), Vitamin C (75 mg), Vitamin K (65mg), Calcium (1000 mg), Iron (30 mg), and Magnesium (320 mg).<br>  Here's a great website that tells you what each is for:<br>  <a href="http://www.thedietchannel.com/Importance-Of-Prenatal-Vitamins.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedietchannel.com/Importance...</a>|`|o72Ng7IRaa	Prenatal vitamins are nearly all the same. However, there are some that standout amongst the rest. I would recommend you try some all  natural vitamins which tend to be a little bit pricier BUT you take fewer and they last longer. In other words, you save money in the long run.  For instance, you may make a purchase costing $60 but the doses may last over 90 days = $20 dollars month. Of course you won't be able to use insurances, but it's still cheaper. To take it a step further, try using liquid vitamins instead of pills. The absorb much better which often lead to requiring even smaller doses. Try health food stores or websites like vitacost and vitapal. They offer MASSIVE discounts if you order in bulk. That may be the way to go if you plan on taking prenatals before, during, and after(breastfeeding) pregnancy.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	I took One-A-Day brand prenatal vitamins available otc. My dr said they were fine.<br>  <br>  Ask your dr or pharmacist if any there are any comparable otc vitamins.|`|T48smu01aa	That's outrageous....I took prenatal vitamins 3 months prior to getting pregnant but I bought the best brand i could find at wal-mart....I think there just as good....45$ though that's crazy for prenatal pills!
elqkReHuaa	EWWWWW Don't eat smoked salmon in your sushi... smoked salmon belongs on your bagel, not your sushi rice.<br>  <br>  EW.  <br>  <br>  Okay, so if you really want sushi, go for a shrimp tempura roll or ebi nigiri or unagi nigiri or tamago....<br>  <br>  Just something not raw!  But not smoked either!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	California rolls. They are made of crab and not raw fish. Or there vegetable rolls or ones that have cooked fish (i forget their names) are good.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	The rules are for sushi containing raw fish or seafood. You can eat the cooked varieties or those that are vegetarian. :]<br>  <br>  I linked an article about it, but also I asked my OB because I am a big sushi lover. People have the misconception that sushi=raw fish, which isn't always the case.|`|MLPzeOtOaa	Not if you are craving a roll with no raw fish. That is the main thing to stay away from. Now if you are craving nigiri or sashimi, then, yes ma'am. You are pretty much out of luck. I'm almost 18 weeks and I try to stick to the tempura roll with imitation crab. It is a cooked roll and is SO tasty!<br>  <br>  Good luck, hun!|`|SnanuNKiaa	they tell you not to eat raw meat because of the risk of bacteria to the fetus. it might not harm us, but if it gets past the placenta, then yes it can reek havock on your developing baby|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I crave sushi all the time!

Sushi is healthy and very good for you.. you just have to be picky about what you eat.<br>  <br>  Everyone that says .. "absolutely no sushi" doesn't understand the vast amount of sushi that is either cooked, or doesn't contain any fish to begin with.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Cooked sushi is fine.  and California rolls have IMITATION crab in it.. it is FINE.. like I said.. anyone saying "no sushi" doesn't know much about it..|`|nQyJFOMZaa	No raw fish! You are probably craving it so badly because you know you can't have it. Try a california roll or something with no fish or some cooked tuna in it. Might help the craving. But Tuna isn't supposed to be eaten that often while prego either so watch out. My OB/GYN told my only 1 tuna sandwich per month if i absolutely had to have it. It's the mercury in the fish.|`|EnBPpbcHaa	No sushi!<br>  <br>  No crab sushi either! There is only one type of crab safe enough to eat COOKED during pregnancy, due to high mercury content.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	First, I would write a letter to her detailing your observations.  Send it to her via certified mail, and be sure to keep a copy for yourself.<br>  <br>  If she does not respond in a satisfactory manner then file a formal complaint with the guidance counselor, principal and school board-again, in writing and sent via certified mail.<br>  <br>  Can you put him in another classroom or school?  <br>  <br>  And have you considered homeschooling?  Homeschooling is an awesome way of life for our family.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	DEMAND a conference with the teacher and principal now.  Don't let this fester.  It's affecting your son's school and probably his self-esteem.  The quicker you fix this, the sooner life will be back to normal.  Most schools take on a "no bullying" policy and don't tolerate such things.  Take action now.  That's ridiculous!<br>  <br>  As a mom, we don't want anything to happen to our kids.  It's so hard to see it first hand.  Sometimes you feel like you're overreacting, but in this case, it's serious and warranted.  Good luck!|`|NTln9ULUaa	Bullying of any type is not permitted at our school. If the teacher is turning a blind eye to it, make sure to tell your concerns to the principal. Document everything! (because for certain they would be documenting it if it was to report you)<br>  <br>  If the principal refuses to deal with the issue, you can of course go over their head and contact the superintenedent of the board or the school board directly. <br>  <br>  Our kids are not angels, but there is always something that is going to flick a switch in them. Teasing by the other students is something my youngest deals with daily and it breaks our hearts too.|`|edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	You already know this woman is crazy (I'm sorry to tell you this but allot of people who go into child care are crazy).  She's jealous of you and trying to pull a power trip on you.  You have to stay as cool and aloof as you possibly can.  It would make me incredibly angry if I knew my child was being picked on and the person in charge ignored it.  If it's possible move your son to a different class or school even.  I always let my kids know that I believe them and that I'm always on there side.  I'm sorry I can't help more but I do know that if you lose it it will look like she's right.  If you can't move your child out of the class keep track of things that happen and are said with the date and address her superiors with it; it may be that she picks someone to do this to every year and someone else has brought it out before.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	talk to the principal about this she has absolutely no right to say that about your ex! bring that up to the principal or the school administration. I wouldn't care how crazy i looked if someone insulted me that way and allowed other kids to pick on my child and then claim my child is the one with the problem|`|28QPS6V9aa	I would sit in the classroom to observe for a day and see what exactly is going on. Look at how she handles conflicts in other kids, find out if she is playing favorites. If you notice she's singling your son out then confront her about it in private. If she doesn't do anything to correct her behavior, take this matter to the principal.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Talk with the principal and demand your child be moved out of her class.  You DO have that right and do not let them tell you different.  I have nothing but the highest regard for teachers, but some of them can be just out there!|`|tfkBHH9eaa	Shoot forget the school go to the Board of Education and guarantee you they will do something about it..|`|iFDye9RMaa	Can you not have him transferred out of her class?|`|mx3gFmIKaa	You may not like this answer but my suggestion is to ask the school psychologist to evaluate him and ask for a behavior plan.  Although this seems to be pre-maturely labeling your son and opening up a can of worms it is preferred to the alternative of your son 'assaulting' the teacher and her pressing charges, having him expelled, or psychiatrically committed all of which do happen.  If you get a behavior plan before an incident it protects him, he will be labeled yes but probably OHI (other health impairment), or ADHD neither carrry any weight really but a label of SED-severely emotionally disturbed will put a negative connotation on him and be hard to lose.<br>  <br>  If you choose to go the chain of command, put it in writing, ask for a meeting with the principal.  You want it to appear that you are willing to go to a due process meeting with the BOE.<br>  <br>  I think having him temporarily labeled would be the lesser of two evils and it would  be better than a worst case scenerio of being committed, arrested, or expelled which is more traumatic for the child.  I have seen these situations, and this would be better, its hard to predict if things are going to spiral that far out of control, but schools rarely handle situations well and thus far they haven't handled it well.  Tread cautiously, and don't trust them.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion I have is to ask for a district representative to be at the meeting, and tape record it.  Let them know in advance you want to do this.  The district reps act as mediators.  You have to appear like you are willing to play hardball.  I have been through these meetings for 6 years now.  Another suggestion is to study up a bit on wright's law.  Maybe look into a 504 accommodation.  If you ask this type question in special ed. you will get more moms like me who have been through this.  Having a degree in clinical psychology is certainly to your benefit, be sure to choose the seat in power at the head of the table.  As you know what you learn in school is hardly applicable to reality unfortunately, its just how things run.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	just go tell the principal about it.
qBFojHLMaa	I stopped giving my son a bottle as soon as he turned one. But before that I had given him milk or formula in a cup along with water too. So he wasnt just instantly not allowed a bottle and forced to drink from a cup, he was used to both. And he didnt miss the bottle for one second. I never went back to it and he never asked for it. Easiest thing I have ever done with him.|`|Z1AIE6yVaa	My son didn't want a bottle around 7-8 months. We started him on a sippy cup and he loved it. At about 14 months he started drinking out of a cup with no top.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I think by 9 months my son was solely on sippy cups and baby food.|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	My daughter refused the bottle early....at 8 months she was done with it and we were on to sippy cups!|`|hJoB7VR1aa	My daughter threw her bottle in the trash and said "I don't want this anymore"; when she was almost 2. She never asked for a bottle again.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, I'm sure he'd still take one but we weaned him to sippy cups around 10 and a half months. I wanted him to be completely off the bottle by a year and he's 11 months now and is.<br>  <br>  Try giving him a sippy cup for daycare and see how he does with that. It will probably make weaning easier.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I never let my kids have a bottle at night to sleep with so they never really got emotionally attached to one.  So when I introduced a sippy cup to them, they just didn't want a bottle anymore.  For both it was around 8 months.<br>  Red|`|jYPeis3Saa	if he doesnt want it, then try a sippy cup.<br>  <br>  my son is 16 months and we try everyday to get him to ue a sippy cup, but he refuses. he loves his bottle to much. i wish he would refuse it.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter stopped taking the bottle at 6 months|`|DNygQdmVaa	He just doesnt want it anymore.<br>  <br>  My son hasnt refused the bottle yet, hes almost 15 months old.

XaVCCG3Naa	First of all, I don't agree with a light tap on the breaks.  Most kids think this is FUN and will further aggravate the problem...  <br>  <br>  What they really need some sort of gadget to make it impossible for kids to unbuckle themselves.  I've seen kids as young as 18 months who can do it.<br>  <br>  Does anyone know of such a product?|`|f2LM5eO1aa	Okay now i know this may not seem like parent ethics but my mom did this to all three of us kids and it worked like magic. If he comes unbuckled in his seat warn him to get back in seat. if he does not, tap on the breaks and he will start to fall forward and tell him if you had your seat-belt on this would not happen if he does not understand tap on a little harder the worse that is going to happen is him bump his head on the back seat and him start crying and he will realize the seriousness of staying buckled give it a try if your not to scared to do it.|`|SWbiblvPaa	tighten the harnest|`|r63DBSATaa	That's a tricky one.|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	how old is he? and what kind of car seat do you have now? maybe try a different kind of chest clip they have different kinds out there. make sure you make a big deal about stying buckled in and make sure if its safe pull over right away and tell him he has to stay buckled in when the car is moving at all times. good luck|`|IRFbj0G9aa	HE MUST BE 3 YEARS OLD OR OLDER CORRECT?  I CANNOT IMAGINE A YOUNGER CHILD BEING ABLE TO UNFASTEN A SEAT BELT.  ANYWAY THERE IS THIS CLASP THAT GOES ON THE SHOULDER STRAPS FROM GRACO IT IS AN EXTRA LOCK, YOU KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.  HOWEVER, IN THE MEANTIME SHOW HIM YOU MEAN BUSINESS.  HOW?  BEFORE YOU START YOUR CAR RIDE, YOU EXPLAIN TO LETS CALL HIM " TOMMY" UNBUCKLING THE CAR SEAT, PULLING DOWN STRAPS, AND ANY OTHER UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR THAT PUTS HIS LIFE AND YOURS AND OTHER PASSENGERS LIVES AT DANGER WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED.  IF HE DOES IT, YOU WILL STOP THE CAR UNTIL HE SITS TIED UP IN THE CAR SEAT.  AND THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL HAVE TO DO.  IT MAY TAKE YOU EXTRA LONG TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION BUT REALLY THIS IS ABOUT HIS SAFETY.  KEEP DOING IT TILL HE REALIZES YOU ARE NOT MESSING AROUND ANYMORE.  YOU COULD ALSO USE WITHDRAWL OF PRIVILEGES ALONG WITH THIS.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE UNTIES ONCE, YOU STOP TILL HE ACTS ACCORDINGLY.  ONCE HE FALLS INTO LINE YOU PRAISE HIS COMPLIANCE.  BUT REMIND HIM THAT IF HE DOES IT AGAIN THEN HE LOSES SAID PRIVILEGE YOU FILL IN THE BLANKS.  BOTTOM LINE HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND  CONSEQUENCE.  HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF DANGER, BUT TRUST ME HE WILL UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCE.  BE CONSISTENT AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT THROW EMPTY THREATS OUT THERE, WHAT EVER YOU DO ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH.
AA11220327	deffinitly not. my son was born at 35 weeks and was 8lbs 4oz. my family has a long history of very large babies, up to a cousin that was 14 lbs at birth (that cousin is now nearly 7 ft tall lol) so there is deffinitly nothing wrong with that size.|`|AA10230627	no i have two daughters the first one was born early at 37 weeks at 6 pounds 3 ounces and the second was born at 34 weeks 6 pounds and 3 ounces no joke! so no your baby is just healthy.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Nope, he's not too big. <br>  And those things can be way off, at 38 weeks, they told me my baby was 8lbs 14oz. They said she'd be an 11lb baby at birth. I didn't deliver until 3 weeks later, and she came out weighing exactly 8lbs 14oz, and there's no way she didn't grow in that 3 weeks time. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|1VdgsZPoaa	No, you are almost full term and most babies who are full term weigh 7 or so pounds so he is at the right weight right now.  I was born at exactly 37 weeks on the dot and weighed 6 pounds and 2 ounces.|`|dKTPewhTaa	No that's not big.  Good luck!|`|AA10693194	no thats not too big.at 37 weeks my second was 6 lbs 3 oz lol and he was born 9 lbs 6 oz
oWAUb6vpaa	Something that would remind him of his new "big borther" status would be nice. I thought about getting my kids engraved tags with something that states "I'm big brother / sister to -----..." or something else that they can wear anytime that makes them feel proud of thier new status.*  : ) <br>  <br>  If not, the t-shirts are always nice or simply something that the child really likes. <br>  <br>  Good luck - be nice to see you post up what ever you decide: might help other parents decide on a simlar issue. <br>  <br>  Congratulations mom and big brother!|`|MW3Br5V8aa	what is he into?? <br>  my friend was having a baby and her son was mad about power rangers and she got him a power rangers sword that was not available here (ireland)  she got it from Ebay and he adored the baby from the very start because she had got him such a cool present & all his friends were real jealous!! was pretty good idea!|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	<a href="http://www.toysrus.co.uk/index.jsf?fh_eds=%ef%bf%bd&fh_view_size=10&omitxmldecl=yes&fh_refview=lister&fh_reffacet=categories&fh_refpath=facet_1&fh_location=%2f%2fbrus%2fen_GB%2fcategories%3c%7bbrus_brus%7d%2fitemtype%3dproduct%2fcategories%3c%7bbrus_brus_babiesrus_bruclothing%7d" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.co.uk/index.jsf?fh_ed...</a><br>  <br>  I am trying to send you a link to Babies R Us, United Kingdom.

deIzFnV8aa	I second the answer that at this age babies are both more efficient nursers and more distractable. She will eat if she is hungry; you don't need to worry anything is wrong with your supply. If she starts waking more at night to eat you might try encoraging her to eat more at each feeding (when DD gets distracted I wait until I get her attn and then offer again), but otherwise don't worry.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	she's probably getting better at taking milk out. also, she's becoming more aware of her surrounding and may be getting distracted. even if your milk supply were low only nursing can bring it up. formula would make it worse|`|9hggEdf1aa	My son used to do this.  He liked to take breaks while breastfeedin.  Keep her in your arms and let her look around for a while and keep on offering it to her. Usually if you try to pump, not much milk will come out. Your supply is not going down, if you daughter starts drinking more milk you will produce more milk.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I agree with the first response you got.  It's probably one of two things.  Either she's much more efficient at getting the milk she needs (typical for this age), or she's more distractible and just doesn't want to nurse very long each time.  If you think she's just getting distracted, you may want to try nursing her in a dark, quiet room with no distractions.  It's also possible that she'll start waking up more at night if she's not getting enough to eat during the day.<br>  <br>  My best guess is that she's just more efficient, though.  Oh, and also note that she may decide at some point to start lingering at the breast again.  Some babies get very efficient for a while and then go back to leisurely taking their time so that they can snuggle longer and gaze up at you.  Almost everything is normal when it comes to nursing.<br>  <br>  Don't offer formula.  Just keep nursing and watching for plenty of wet diapers, and all will be well.|`|n9hPQhbOaa	i breastfeed too and my son(3months too arnt they wonderful  =D) has done that b4 hes getting all he needs when hes on your breast he will eat when hes hungry and not eat wen hes not i dont think u have anything to worrie about and then he went through a growth spurt and eat all the time but hes getting all he needs from you dont give him the bottle it makes your milk go down and if you want to maintain a good supple pump after he feeds so you dont loose milk or get engorged|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	She may not be that hungry or it could be something in your diet that is coming through your breast milk.  Try expressing milk to see how your supply is.

rhPCJfeuaa	I answered your other question as well.  I just think that since her own mother is smothering her and too overprotective, she has chosen you to fill that need for a mother figure right now.  You have shown you care, stepped up to take her in when she needed you, and have since continued to help her.  She needs encouragement, and you seem to be supplying it and are even patient enough to deal with the language barrier and needing an interpreter.<br>  <br>  Feel honored and take it as a sweet compliment from her.  Unless other family members are all up in arms over your closeness with her, I would just continue doing what you're doing.  Unless she becoming too much of a constant in your daily life.  then I would just gently try talking to her about becoming more independent and encourage her to find her own way slowly.<br>  <br>  She's your husband's family, right?  what does he say or feel about this?|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	You might want to ask her about it, maybe she does not have many friends, be there for here. She is 19 after all , an adult therefore you might want to help her get independent, help her enroll in a community college or something.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	When you ask a question it helps if it makes sense.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	dont encourage her<br>  <br>  sounds creepy|`|NDU36H4Vaa	Stephen Covey's book 7 Habits of Highly Effective People talks about our circle of influence (in your case this includes this young women) and our circle of concern. It can be found on Amazon.com used for a few dollars plus $3.99 shipping. <br>  <br>  There are some free programs on how to teach English, I knew a lady participating in one who worked as an office assistant. She taught migrant workers how to speak English as a volunteer. And she could not speak their language. There is lots of stuff available on the web & at the local universities & career centers for free <br>  <br>  Heather from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/heather_inks" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/heather_inks</a>|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Well its up to you to decide, if you're ready for the responsibility and want to take her on, then by all means encourage her if not, be friendly and polite but not any more to avoid misleading her.<br>  <br>  Personally, i feel you're rather scared of her yet feel guilty and dont want to be rude.....<br>   because the way you just spoke about her is rather negative..thats gotta tell you something!|`|T7Xn2SQyaa	She saw you as the one who saved her, your kindness and charity was probably something she hasn't witnessed before and wants to be the same way.  it is a good thing.  maybe try to teach her or show her how not to be codependent.|`|tfkBHH9eaa	Im sorry but I can't understand what you're saying. One minute its a girl next minute its a boy MAKE SOME MORE SINCE SPEAK PROPER ENGLISH WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND U!!!|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Show her the way, the one that leads her to her true home. Give her freedome!|`|WOHc22Xiaa	She feels comfortable with you.|`|3sWAdwcfaa	so lost|`|DZzBfzVeaa	She is obviously looking for a female role model and you seem to be the only one to give her the time of day. Although i know what you mean when you say she is smothering you, but you should be honered that she is looking up to you. Someone needs to guide her. Talk to her and give her advise, she needs it. You dont have to hang out with her everyday and be her best friend but you should at least pay attention to her so she knows at least someone loves her. She seems a little confused in life right now.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	She's looking for a positive female role model. Take it as a complement.
uxItOSkmaa	Hmm... good question.  We burn incense (Dragon's Blood is a really great scent) but don't allow smoking in our home.  We keep the burner well out of reach so our 2yo can't get at it.  I've never considered that the smoke from them could be harmful.  I've just thought of them as the same way candles are.  It's not like we burn them constantly either.  Maybe 1 or 2 per week.<br>  <br>  Plug-ins are really dangerous in general (cause tons of house fires) but especially around toddlers.  They smell almost edible & if a toddler takes one out it would leave an outlet uncovered.<br>  <br>  Could they really be more dangerous than an aerosol air deodorant?  I'm going to have to research this now.  Shoot me an email if you come up with anything more than an opinion; I'll do the same. Thanks!|`|zmM4u4qmaa	If you're concerned about it, I'd stay stop burning incense and find another way to make the room smell nice. Incense does create smoke, of course--you already know that--and smoke could cause irritation to your little one's respiratory system, eyes, skin, etc.  even if it's just a little bit still in the air from a time you were burning it when she was out.  <br>  <br>  I've burned incense while my 18-month-old was in the house a few times with no ill effects, so no need to overreact too much, but since you're looking for advice I'd say better safe than sorry.  Even scented candles would create less irritating smoke than incense.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Hmm I don't really know, but it doesn't seem like it would do any harm. Just put it in a different room away from her so she wont breathe it in and so she wont touch it and burn herself. Something that I found that works really well to make the house smell pretty, those AirWick spray pumps, they have a timer that you can set to spray every so often, and the house always smells yummy.. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|CR9e9p4Gaa	AS LONG AS THE KIDS OUT THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBS<br>  ITS NOT LIKE SHE IN THE SAME ROOM.GIVE THE ROOM A NICE SMELL  YOU HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN SO IT WONT GET ON THE BABYS CHEST SO I WOULD SAY ITS OK I MIGHT GET SOME LOVE THE SMELL THANKS 4 REMINDING ME ALL THE BEST.<br>                                  PRESTON LAD!|`|h93SVSxLaa	to be safe not knowing what exactly is in them i'd say no don't burn them. There is actually a wickless flameless candle by scentsy... i have a few of them and i love them. no worries of smoke they plug in though so youre limited to that.|`|2vApjgIKaa	Why not just open the window! Fresh air smells much nicer and is alot healthier than flipping hippy sticks!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its not good..some are made from chemically laden industrial perfumes<br>  and the smoke isn't too healthy either|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	who knows what chemicals are in those insense sticks so I would say no don't burn them while child is around or at all if you can help it.  perhaps switch to scented candles instead.  but that being said I would not do anything in my childs room to make it smell better other than cleaning the sheets, vacuuming, opening the window when weather permits, cleaning the diaper pail and other general maintenance things..  maybe scented lysol for garbage and what not but generally a child does not need to have their bedroom smell like anything.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	You shouldn't really burn one-year-olds at all. Incense won't cover up the smell.<br>  <br>  OK, I'm sorry, that was a stupid joke. LOL<br>  But no, I don't think it's good, she could have a reaction. Those lungs are pretty new yet. And if you did it all the time you could cause asthma or such.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I'm not sure it would be a good thing, what might appear a mild smell to you might be overpowering to a small baby. Besides, many of these Insense are for specific ailments, they may well be dangerous for your little one.|`|PeOCqztoaa	I definitely wouldn't burn it in the same room with her. Plug ins or soy candles would probably be the safest as they don't emit a steady flow of smoke.|`|e55a3a8ef76525a0dd8c93f03f529e48aa	I don't think it very good for your child for your child to breath any kind of smoke, so no
5aJ6E3JFaa	First of all I'm so sorry for your loss.  I would suggest going to your dr and seeing what they advise, there's lots of different ways to help you become pregnant if you're having trouble and a dr can help you figure out what your options are for your particular situation.  Also know that your feelings are so perfectly normal, especially since having a miscarriage!  Good luck, and don't give up hope yet - you were able to get pregnant once which is a good sign for the future!|`|S5n5Za78aa	doctors want you to try this method for at least a year b4 seeing a fertiltiy specialist but since you havent concieved yet this long it may be time to look into a fertiltiy specialist to see whats going on and run some test on both you and your hubby but i just though i would share a little bit of advice on ttc.....<br>  you should look into the book (taking charge of your fertility) you can prob get it from library and start charting your temps  on fertilityfriend.com but the book will teach you everything as far as pinpointing ovulation<br>  or you can wait for ovulation which can occur anywhere from 10-24 days after the first day of you period (fertile period ) its different for everyone and start using ovulation predictor kits till you get a positive between the days i just mentioned and go from there  but you have to make sure whatever you do your having sex on the RIGHT days it can get tricky!! good luck|`|stRWElvPaa	A woman in her 20's has got to try for a year before the doctors will start doing tests to find out if anything is wrong. <br>   So since you have been trying since around February last year they should start investigating if you book an appointment with your doctor.<br>   As for my advice, I would ask you, are you overweight or too underweight? Ideal weight for conception is between 20 and 24, with an ideal being around 21. <br>    Also, diet is quite important, for example folic acid has been linked to a slightly higher chance of conception and also avoiding processed foods like white bread and sweets etc is important for healthy ovulation.<br>    Try to find a relaxation method, because you sound depressed and stressed and that can in fact delay ovulation and make the time of ovulation unpredictable. <br>    Good luck, and don't be shy to tell the doctor your problems.|`|d1d4c5e328a7037abb8a347932651124aa	As a rule you should wait up to a year after a miscarriage before trying to get pregnant. You had a miscarriage for a reason, your body was not able to go through with the pregnancy for whatever reason. Listen to your body, wait and let it recuperate, eat healthy, take vitamins, exercise, relax for a year, and then try again.|`|aI4wgxRFaa	just take your time. you just had a miss carriage. just wait at least 1-3 months.|`|lkRhFxfNaa	how old r u? if you're underage just wait for a few more years to have a baby.|`|nwv2rwdAaa	Have you considered seeing an infertility specialist? Even an infertility counselor? There are MANY different support groups and resources that provide you with low cost or even free emotional support and advice on how to conceive. <br>  <br>  I do suggest that you and your partner see an infertility specialist if you haven't already. They will be able to identify the problem(s) for you, as well as give you advice, medication or whatever else may assist you in conceiving. <br>  <br>  Keeping track of your ovulation is very important. There are websites that can help you figure out when you are ovulating based on your cycle regularity.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  Manda
uFrqC4Y2aa	It drops a lot when you see the heartbeat and can see that it's strong and healthy. It drops to a 1% chance at the end of 12 weeks.|`|i8Ch743Laa	They don't reduce until 12 weeks,and even then don't go away,it's always a risk. I lost a son at 20 weeks,and everything with him was totally healthy,saw/heard the heartbeat multiple times,got tons of ultrasounds,so it's never 100% gone.|`|jvTgqdaiaa	depense on how old you are.<br>  10-19 about a 1 % chance of miscarriage in the first trimester (lowers percentage evry day)<br>  20-35 about a 3 % chance of miscarriage in the first trimester (lowers every day)<br>  and 35+ about a 10% chance of miscarriage in the first trimester. (lowers every day)<br>  <br>  congrats!! your baby is very healthy (:|`|aTRMObTZaa	Each week you maintain the pregnancy slightly reduces the chance of miscarriage, but it doesn't automatically go from NOT SAFE to SAFE when you move into your second trimester. Everyone's body is different. It does get better and better as each week progresses, so just keep yourself healthy and focus on being happy until then, and until you deliver! Congrats!|`|kTu7UtS1aa	I DO NOT want to alarm you, but I saw all of that at 6 weeks too, but I miscarried a week later.  Keep in mind that EVERYONE is different.  Once you past your first trimester, your chances are reduced.    Good luck to you!|`|mCDopsLEaa	Not until 13 weeks. Out of your first trimester is when your miscarriage changes decrease|`|SQpjHOzVaa	Your chances of miscarrying is more likely in the first 3 months of pregnancy. If you can get to your 4th month, you have a less likely chance of miscarrying. But the less stress you are under the first 3 months of pregnancy the less chance of miscarriage.
0BC2WTyoaa	I was 18 weeks last week as well and had the same issues when I woke up on Wednesday.  I called the Dr and the nurse talked with her and called me back and told me to go to ER.  It turns out that it was just from being pregnant and everything moving around (this is my 3rd baby) and that I just needed to go to physical therapy or a chiropractor but they wanted to make sure and check several things to make sure it wasn't something else to do with the baby.  Your best bet is start with calling your Dr.|`|vcxdTXbraa	Better to be safe than sorry as they say. The worse that will happen is they will send you home.|`|mCDopsLEaa	If they are suspicious of you going into labor early, then yes you need to call your doctor. Not to be rude, but you should have called them first instead of asking on answers about it. It is something that shouldn't be taken lightly. It's not a normal sign of labor but you already have complications so you should call. Good Luck and congrats on being a first time mom!!|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	first- DO NOT stress out. I would call the doctor. Let them know what is going on. Just see what they say and if they tell you go in just be calm and and if it is early labor I'm sure they can stop it. <br>  <br>  ***good luck|`|lOJ4VIPfaa	I would go to hospital just to be on the safe side or at least phone your mid wife.|`|xgXzTWa5aa	hospital|`|d7f0d7a6388dccc03f8dea2fa7397d82aa	call your doctor<br>  it may be your child pushing on a nerve, i don't think it's labor signs.<br>  <br>  also, staying calm will keep you from entering premature labor!  try not to always panic at the first sign of something.  stress can be bad for both you and the baby.<br>  <br>  best of luck :)|`|jvTgqdaiaa	18 weeks? sheesh.<br>  i think the minimum a docter will put your child on life support is 25 weeks i think.

YFhNHzI9aa	Well when my little one turned one I really wanted to have birthday parties be a big deal.  We never had big celebrations when I was a child.  We decided to keep it really simple and intimate.  We had the party at our house.  The decorations were very simple, white and pink.  Each table had a small vase of white daisies on it.  I made a small cake just for her.   We invited family and only the closest of friends who had been involved in her life since she was born.  Since our family had to travel over 2 hours to be with us we served a simple lunch.  We made 2 larger cakes to accomodate the guest, and lots of pink punch.  The night before her party my husband rocked her to sleep in the living room while I was in her room running pink and white streamer back and forth across the ceiling!  I added balloons tied to her changing table and decorations on her closet doors.  (I didn't hang any streamer over her crib for safety reasons, and as much as I wanted to have a million balloons floating around her room, I made balloon bouquets that were tied down for safety reasons as well.)  It was a great idea, because my husband laid her in her crib that evening once she was asleep and when she woke up the next morning her room was very festive and a big suprise to her! :D Make sure you schedule the party when she is the happiest. Really work the whole day around her schedule.  You should designate someone to run a video camera for you and someone else to take pictures.  As a mom we tend to be the ones behind both of these things, therefore we don't get to really experience and enjoy the day.  Another personal touch I added, since all our family lived so far away, was a little clothesline of pictures.  I found some really great ribbon to match the decor and little tiny baby clothespins.  I tacked the ribbon along an empty wall in our living room and attached pictures to it with the clothespins. I put them in chronologic order of her first year.  I added silly ones, great candid ones, and all important milestones and events. First steps, first holidays, etc etc.  I hope this helps.  And to answer your last question...I was extremely sad.  It does go by so fast!  But each and every year from here on out is exciting and new in a different but enjoyable way.  asdlkjf|`|WdvLcYaVaa	My son is 14 months and we had his party at our house. We had all our family and friends and did like snack foods and stuff. It was a lot of fun and I think my son was more comfortable since he was in his own house. I felt the same way as you when he turned one. I was so excited but really sad and nostalgic at the same time. That first year just flew by.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I have until May 21st to figure out what i'm going to do. It will either be at home or at the park. With this being his first I don't want to go all out. I'd rather wait until he's a bit older. There isn't much for babies at Chuck E Cheese so I wouldn't do that this time around. If there are plenty of kids that would be able to have fun and make the expense worth it though why not? We will be going to the zoo around then to. I have the same feeling as you about it. It goes way to fast.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	have it at your home.  what in the world would you think your 1 year old could do at chuck e cheese other than sit in a high chair watching other children having fun.  do it at your house, don't overwhelm your child with the party being too long or too many people.  have fun, get a super cute cake, yummy foods, pretty dress, cute decorations.. take lots of photos and have fun.  they party at this age if for yourself and not for her, she will not remember it as you know and will not even know it is for her while its happening because she is used to begin the centre of attention anytime there is a family gathering.. this will seem no different to her than that.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would do the first and maybe 2nd at your home because believe me you will need as many ideas as possible for future parties.  Besides save the good places for when she will remember it.  It was bitter sweet for me because I was glad he was getting older and experiencing more but he also wasn't my little baby anymore.|`|oDlDrjF1aa	im have my son 1st birthday party at peter piper pizza its a game place|`|jYPeis3Saa	my son is 16 months and we had his party at our house

Ive never had the glow either and my skin has been blotchy. I was always told this was because girls take your beauty when your pregnant with them.  My friend had a boy and looked really nice, almost glowing.  Maybe you just get glowing skin and lovely hair depending on the person and not the actual sex of the baby.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i was like that at first, im now almost 17 weeks and my skins awful but my hair and nails look fab, im not sure what im having yet, find out april 2nd|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	My nails were shiny smooth and strong and my skin had become clear with both my pregnancies and i have a girl and pregnant with a boy now.

Njx3roeDaa	Chuck Wood, <br>  The age of 19 is between a complete adult and teenager. A 'kid' would probably be considered a younger age then when your available to drive. At 19, you're on your way to adulthood, as well as the drinking age. By age 19, you are mature enough to realize you're not really a kid anymore. 19's a very independent age, though some people consider being 21 starting your adulthood, as if that's when everything starts. 'Everything' starts not at 21 because it is The United States' drinking age, though once you are mature and independent you are considered yourself as an adult. I hope you understand, and that I'm trying not being Wishy-Washy. <br>  <br>  -Julz|`|9IcEfsbyaa	That is based on the individuals maturity.  At 19 you are legally an adult but you have not had experience at so many of the important things in life that Truly force you to "grow up" and know yourself.  The word "kid" is a reflection on your decision making abilities and your actions.  Here is a thought for you:  Think about how different a 19 year old is compared to when they were 16.  That is only 3 years.  That 19 year old has matured significantly because of experiences and life lessons they've had.  Think about how different or more mature the 19 year old will be in 3 years to come.  If the 19 year old wants to get married - from experience I say, WAIT!!  You will grow and change so much in the next 6 years.  If it is privileges that are wanted - you get those when you can support yourself responsibly.  You don't live at home or off of parents money and expect to be treated as a full grown adult.  P.S.  I am 35, on second marriage and have 3 step kids. Moved out at 17 1/2 and first marriage was at 23.|`|rwPc39vTaa	i think it depends on the person. im 18 and i think im pretty mature, not fully of course, i still have my little spoiled side. <br>  <br>  then i know someone who's my age too and she's very very mature, kind of scary hanging out with her, makes me feel like a kid LOL. <br>  <br>  <br>  lastly, my ex bf, his 20 this year and he's NO WHERE near being mature, i repeat, no where!|`|YNZmk8fZaa	no. I am 19 so i might not be a good person to answer this question. age really doesn't matter though, it's the persons maturity level. I know 19 year olds that act like they are in middle school and i know some that act more mature than their parents. That's what I have to say.|`|bUOOat3taa	well when i was 19 i thought i wasn't a kid and it may feel like your not a kid anymore but in reality you haven't gained the wisdom life teaches you yet. now i am 33 and when i look back at myself ,yes i was just a kid and none to smart either. maybe its just a matter of prospective. good luck|`|a1uoxczTaa	if i am a kid, u r a goat, u stink and i dont!<br>  <br>  i think some 19 year olds could be considered a kid depending on how mature they are. i believe i am mature for my age at 18 but i believe i act like a kid sometimes.|`|WX0cPoEbaa	i would think its in the middle stage. You are legally allowed to move out and do whatever you want, but you can't drink and do other stuff yet. So ya, i would say its still mostly "kid" status. Don't feel bad, I'm eighteen and i still feel like a kid.|`|YQeZ9LL5aa	at 19 you're responsible for any trouble you get into with the law. Soooo in that sense you are an adult. But my friends have older brothers in their twenties that are so much fun to be around(: in a kid sort of way.|`|mHSwQa7Naa	No. I am 19. It depends on your maturity level. I have a lot of responsibility for my age. I have a 15 month old baby, I work part-time and going to school part-time for nursing.|`|xWoJooeMaa	depends if you act immature or mature if you act immature people might still call you kid but if you act mature they will think of you as an adult i dont know if any of that made sense but i said it anyway|`|TZfDvyshaa	no because you are legally an adult after the age of 18. but 19 year olds are often described as "students" not kids.|`|Hjo3lN7zaa	Well...my mother is 54 and she's still a "kid".<br>  Don't pay attention to physical ages...|`|OzM5P1TIaa	no 19 is full adult.can becme father/mother. having full awarness if not mad or stupid.|`|oU3DBNWXaa	no they are very much an adult... however it depends on their maturity|`|T95c191eaa	it depends if your mature or not<br>  and you legally become an adult at 18|`|wd9EPcGWaa	For Parenting?  In most situations yes|`|tfkBHH9eaa	it depends. and not unless you think so.|`|Yn80qqX8aa	Yes.|`|dbGhqLDUaa	Nope i don't ! I think 19 is the entrance to Adulthood !|`|HBYW6w8haa	as long as there at your house if not 18 is adult.|`|CIDRKJUMaa	I am 21 and still feel like a  kid!|`|CfvgcYMhaa	no.<br>  just young and somewhat foolish :)|`|Lo7BrhPeaa	Hmmm sorta i think it is untill your 21|`|d8Ray5uKaa	yep|`|skouLKBjaa	yes|`|POHWTDPRaa	Yes. At 19 a person is no longer a child, obviously, and legally they are an adult. But they are still pretty inexperienced and usually not completely independent. Yeah, a 19-year-old is still a kid.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I had my first child at 19 and was definitely an adult by any definition. Getting up multiple times a night, feeding/clothing and caring for a baby by myself definitely earned me the title of adult.|`|cQL31oJaaa	It depends how you put it. If you want the realistic answer 1sec to 3 is a baby. 3 to 5 is a toddler. 5 to 13 is a kid. 13 to 19 is teen and 20 and + is an adult.      <br>  <br>    so i guess 19 is not a kid but a teenager.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	deffine how he acts<br>  is he mature is he imature is he hyper is he sdtupid is is smart ec t<br>   well no not really a kid is  4-11 years old then 12 pre-teen (tween)<br>  <br>  then 13-17 your a teen that is how i learned|`|8j7FCEOraa	Depends on the person.<br>  Allot of people take their entire life time to figure out who they are and what they want out of life.<br>  Some dont.<br>  It all depends on their maturity and emotional state of mind.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Over 18 is an adult here.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	it's all in your point of view, i would say yes, i'm 32... i would also say if you are referring to the 19 year olds parents then definitely yes... most parents have trouble allowing there children to transition to adults... some parents don't see their kids as adults until they get married or have their own kids|`|M9M6nTZeaa	19 is the transitional stage from Child to Adult. I think that at 19 you still have a lot of growing up and emotional development to reach. Maturity level still isn't as adult as it could be, and decision making skills are not fully rational.|`|w4ksNNJWaa	No, at 19 you have finished compulsory education, have the ability to legally get married, drink, have sex and leave your parents.|`|l3MED8Itaa	it usually depends on how the person acts. so its a yes and no. if they're already independent then no they're not.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I think it depends on your maturity level.<br>  i am 19 and raising 3 kids, Ive been through stuff that has made me mature.<br>  but most people wwo are my age that i know are nothing like myself.|`|jgedIY8taa	Chuck, when you have "kids" of your own, you will realize that they will always be "kids," even when they're 50.|`|Fa6eAG6Taa	age is just a state of body, mental age is what counts.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Yes|`|jd4MzIYtaa	in a lot of cases YES<br>  most 19 year olds are still trying to figure out what they want to do with thier lives let alone take control of thier lives<br>  It has a lot to do with maturity as well<br>  <br>  See I myself was very grown up at 19<br>  I had my own place A full time job as an accountant making 30000 a year(which i still have) a car i paid for and all the independence i would want. I grew up very quickly and know exactly what i wanted out of life. Although i would love to be a kid i know i am an adult with many responsibilities that i wouldnt trade a thing for<br>  <br>  Now i am expecting my first baby with a wonderful bf and ready to experience more of what life has to offer<br>  <br>  So with all that said it really depends~it isnt a cut dry yes or no answer..it has to do with factors in your individual lives|`|1HBjCZr9aa	not technically once your are 18 you are an "adult" though depending on who you are talking to and how old they are and how you act may still qualify you as a kid if you are talking to a elderly person then anyone with color in there hair is a kid any parental figures you may have will probably still think you are a kid for many more years or even the rest of your life you are always there kid a police officer or judge will qualify you as an adult without a question|`|peQGGFPYaa	I believe it depends on the person. For example I am 19 i have two children and I am married living on my own, and my hubby and I are responsible mature adults now. However, some of our friends or people we know are not mature at all and i would say that they are kids because they are soo childish. <br>  It just depends on the person, the situations their put in and the decisions they make.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	When I was 19 I would have said "no way!" and meant it.  Now, at 35, looking back, maybe not kid, but man oh man, do they have soooo much to learn!  I wouldn't be 19 again for anything.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I think someone is still a "kid" until they're living on their own, out of school or college, and supporting themselves. This is usually between the ages of 23-25.|`|AA10236694	im 36 and i think 19 year old of today are less experienced then 19 year olds of my day so yes i still think 19 year olds are children .But the law and government does not see it that way.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Legally, you're an adult....but by life experience and lessons, definitely still a "kid"!|`|AA10447677	Yup...my son is 21 and he's still a "kid"...he has a WHOLE BUNCH of growing up to do.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	heck i think 30 is still a kid.|`|AA10529198	No.  You are an adult at 19.|`|EYAWCgHbaa	nope, there adults.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Yes I don't think people are really grown up until they are about 25|`|Hks9xbJDaa	19 is by no means an adult|`|sU60NqWWaa	Yeah, pretty much|`|5CtCgbENaa	Yep|`|bQ0PpuSyaa	depends on how you act

LKu4YQZuaa	Just buy a pregnancy test.. Nobody has to know! It will be the only thing to calm yourself down and put your mind at rest.. Also if you are pregnant it would be good to find out sooner rather than later so you can get your little one the proper pre natal care it needs..<br>  <br>  good luck hun! xx|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Just take an HPT.  With a missing period you need to kind of see whats going on.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If it's negative no big deal. Better then going into labor in 5 months without being prepared.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Ok wouldn't you rather feel stupid and be sure and not have to wonder anymore?  Just buy a test and get it over with.  Also if you are not pregnant you need to go to the doctor because it is not normal to not have a period for four months.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	how u going to find out if u dont go out to get a test|`|nISYAHkfaa	Just take a test, you're not being silly or overreacting.|`|YzCPY48qaa	take a test to clear your mind x.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	go and buy a test and you can do it in the privacy of your own home and if it comes out negative then there is no need to ever tell anyone about the test. If you are not pregnant see a doctor as no period for 4 months is not normal it needs to be checked out.|`|DHGrfdBWaa	I'd go get a pregnancy test.  If you are pregnant, ignoring it could lead to a lot of complications.|`|R1zUIh7taa	Go and get a test and stop being silly!  If you are indeed pregnant, you have to make sure your baby is doing okay!!|`|DDT5LEh8aa	It doesnt have to be pregnancy it could just be stress causing you to miss your periods. But i would go buy an test jus in case. hope this helps|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Just go to the drugstore and get a home pregnancy test|`|NwTXJdbbaa	I agree with everyone...get a test. If it's negative you should still go to your doctor to see what's going on.
28QPS6V9aa	How many tests showed negative? If it shows negative you're probably not pregnant. It doesn't really matter if you take it in the morning or not. If taken after a missed period the tests are usually pretty accurate. I'm guessing your body is just stressed from worrying about being pregnant which is causing you to be late. It's very common. If you still don't have a period in a few days take another test. But from my experience first response is one of the best, so I would be really surprised if it were wrong.|`|a1uoxczTaa	you should take a test in the morning or at least take it after not peeing for 4-6 hours. i would try again in a few days and with a digital one.|`|IAzCsvaNaa	maybe u are pregnant you should do a blood test|`|8x7rFddHaa	I was 10 days late for my period due to late ovulation one month, not from pregnancy. That had never happened before, I'd never been more than a few days late, it was just a fluke. I'd say to relax and see your dr. if you're concerned, they can do a blood test which is most accurate and could show a complication, like ectopic pregnancy (please don't worry), which might delay a positive test. As far as tests, buy the cheap dollar store ones, they are just as accurate and far less money wasted. You could have enough tests to check several different days for the same cost.<br>  Good luck!|`|5ZVsl4fAaa	I would retest with a digital and use your first morning urine.  Sometimes you can just be late and because early pregnancy symptoms mirror PMS symptoms its hard to say.|`|xoQxDGAlaa	When was the start of your last period? Maybe you have the week wrong? Just a thought. I hope you are pregnant though and it may just be too early to tell. Otherwise, the only thing you can do is wait if you're not going to go to the doctor now. Just relax.|`|ce8COixxaa	Most tests say on the box that they are most accurate with the first morning urine. You will get more of the hormone built up that way, However, as late are you are, I would be on my way to the Dr by now to see if something was wrong! Pregnant or not! I can't tell from your question of you are hoping for pregnancy or just very nervous about possibly being pregnant, but I wish you the best of luck either way!
r0KNCfdRaa	I think that is awesome that you're so close to earning your degree, and you were smart to adjust your work hours to be eligible for insurance, that will make such a huge difference in your prenatal and birth experience!<br>  <br>  The thing is, regardless of how $hitty the economy might be right now, it's going to get better. And not only that, you're not going to be making $11 an hour forever, you have an education! Once you get your degree a lot of doors are going to open for you, and having a baby is only going to push you to work that much harder to get that much further. Just in reading your question it's obvious that you're a mature, confident and intelligent woman who is capable of taking care of yourself and your future. If I am able to gather that from one paragraph, then I know that YOU know that you should keep your baby.<br>  <br>  Everyone has this idea that there is a certain process involved and steps that need to be followed in order to be a parent worthy of having a child. In reality though, it doesn't always work out that way, and things don't always happen in the order that they "should". I say, if God decided you should have a baby now, then who is ANYONE to argue with that.<br>  <br>  Best wishes and congratulations!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The economy has control over many aspects of our lives right now, but one thing is for sure, so matter how crappy the economy or your situation might be, it doesn't change the fact that you can be the best mother to this baby.  Good luck to you!|`|23bgwpD1aa	What does the the countries situation have to do with your choice to have a baby? <br>  <br>  I think if you want the baby you should keep it. You only have 4 classes left of school. It will be hard, it is not easy, but it is very rewarding. Lots of single moms become successful. You can too!|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	basically, yes you are.  If  you can barely pay your bills as it is, then you will be in trouble when the baby comes.  The economy isn't going to be fixed in 7 months, maybe it will be even worse.   I don't know if you are asking for a solution but its still early enough for an abortion and adoption is an option to.    If you wish to keep it, then maybe try to knock out those 4 classes over summer school so you can get your bachelors before next fall.|`|f8ed07139ed0b8e2bee89c46a751f7d3aa	Congrats and good luck! If people let the economy determine reproduction, then there would've been a lot less children born during the Great Depression! As long as you take the best care of and love your child, then that is what matters. I would encourage you to complete your degree a.s.a.p. because that will give you an advantage, and it will be harder to do the longer you wait.|`|ttaUGzWAaa	In my humble opinion... I don't know if having a babeh when you're already having trouble paying your bills is the best idea for you and your baby. I don't doubt that you would be a wonderful mom but if you're gonna be by yourself it's gonna be even harder. Perhaps if you have family in the area things would be easier.<br>  <br>  Doing things the right way isn't always how it happens. One of my friends from college was born to a 19 y/o mom and it totally changed her life. She didn't end up going to college or anything and still works for a low wage. I just hope a baby wouldn't prevent you from finishing school and doing what you want to with your life.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! =)|`|wl7tlYOYaa	you are not being ignorant at all. thigs dont always go the way we want them too you know even if you were protecting yourself you could of still gotten pregnant it happens when its going to. I would try to finish the 4 classes over summer school so you dont have to worry about how to do it after the baby. It would of been more ignorant to get an abortion over it. Your going to great. I was in a similar situation except that I already had a child. I decided to have an abortion and it was the worst decision of my entire life. Until this day I still regrett it. Be brave have your baby and will do great.|`|4DoXomHZaa	No, you are not ignorant for knowing this is a bad time for a baby, nor were you ignorant of this fact when you got yourself pregnant. So what is to blame here?<br>  <br>  Life "just" doesn't seem to work out the way you want it when you fail to plan ahead and protect yourself. Now you deal with the reality, not the coulda shoulda's.<br>  <br>  Now you are a mother, and now you will have to find a way to support yourself and her until you can finish school and provide more. You put yourself here, no one else. Time for responsibility and accountability.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your little baby. Her heart has been beating for 3 weeks now and she has brain waves!!
AA11220327	deffinitly the labor. its the long, long wait, added to the pain of contractions that makes it much worse. By the time that the baby is being delivered, there is more anticipation and excitement and the end is in sight.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Labor, because if you have an epidural you will not even feel the baby come out.|`|AA11538461	For me it was the crowning when the baby comes out.  However, the pain only lasts for a couple of minutes.|`|AA10693194	cant compare really its two totally different pains. the labour  gets SUPER intense!!! and if you are a good pusher that part can be quik! and that burns.|`|NwTXJdbbaa	I guess I'd say labor bc you actually feel that (if you're not having a natural childbirth) but the truth is, it's actually after the baby is born. (I know that wasn't your question..but if you're worried about pain...that's it...and noone ever tells you about that). Once the baby is born everything has to shrink back to normal size and that feels like labor all over again. (At least in my own experience) <br>  But it's so worth it all.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	I have two words for you: walking epidural. - lol.  This natural childbirth lark - who invented that?  Some bloke, I'm convinced!  Some bloke with womb envy.<br>  <br>  Ha ha.  it lowers the pain to perfectly tolerable and can be put in in stage 1 labour, but leaves you with enough pain so that you can feel  when to push.  Full epidurals often lead to caesarian sections. - well, don't cause them, but I've had both things happen and a full epidural was really confusing, and I think messed up the labour and had a lot to do with the emergency caesar.  The walking epidural with Elizabeth was really the best way to go, and easy to get over afterwards.|`|L8eNBQelaa	i delivered my son naturally in  1 1/2 hrs my contractions were continuous one on top of another so that was the most pain for me. i pushed him out in about 10 minutes and i only felt alot of burning. once i was able to start pushing the contractions became alot more bearable.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	when the baby starts coming out. my daughter was face up and i gotta say that little nose she has felt HUGE coming out but after that it was all good|`|ROJans2Taa	I had my first naturally and I was maintaing some composure until she started to emerge. then I thought I was dying,lol. second baby had an epidural, so only the first half of labor was torture|`|uuHPneEcaa	think of it this way ur pushing a thing the size of a watermelon out of an opening the size of a lemon.. Yeah your body will make the changes.. but its still going to be painful. labor is painful too due to the contractions and all that stuff but the pushing him out is whats gonna get u..
963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I have had two children, both by natural childbirth.  It is painful, but not unbearable.  I have never broken a bone, so I can't really compare that.  I thought that the pushing was more painful than the contractions, but the pushing didn't last very long for me.  I personally didn't think it was as bad as some people make it sound. Just try to relax about it.  I think that having a positive attitude is the best thing you can do.  If you expect the worst, then that's what you'll get.  Good luck.|`|0tFQVe6Laa	Depends on the person. The first childbirth ussually lasts longer and is more painful than the 2nd time around. My personal opinion labor is worse then deliery because you can be in labor for hours or even days. Delivery (sure it hurts but) a few pushes and its all over. Its a great choice to have the baby natural though. I really noticed a diffrence in alertness with my second child as opposed to my first (the first child I had the epidural) and labor wasn't prolonged (as it was with the first) Dont let the pain of childbirth scare you. Once you're holding you're baby boy in you're arms you forget all about it. Dont let everyone scare you. Im pregnant with #3 and guess what? Im having her naturally without any drugs (and Im a big baby when it comes to pain)|`|6gT5kJIDaa	I haven't had any children yet but I've been researching natural child birth for about a year now because I do plan to have children in the next few years.  From what I've read, the women who have the most successful and least painful natural births are those that have them at home, or who refuse to have an episiotomy and some refuse to have the doctor check their level of dilation or basically to interfere whatsoever unless there's an emergency.  Here's a link to a website I found with TONS of excellent information, including stories from women who had both natural and other kinds of birth experiences.  Its a pro-natural birth website, so it is biased, but if you feel natural is better (which makes sense, why not let your body do what it was designed to do?) then I think you'll find this website really helpful and informative:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturalbirthandbabycare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalbirthandbabycare.com/</a><br>  <br>  Whatever you choose, do as much research as possible and find what's right for you and your baby and I'm sure you'll be happy with your decision!|`|qJBMdL7gaa	Hi...I was 17 years old when I had my first baby. I was so scared! I had him natural and yes...it is bad. That was my labor though. Other people claim that they didn't think it was that bad. The worst part are the contractions. They hurt really bad! I also had to push for 2 1/2 hours. That sucked too. But just remember-you will survive and labor doesn't last forever!<br>  My second child-I had the epidural and that was the best decision I ever made. I was scared about the needle and everything...but it is nothing compared to the hell I went through with natural child birth. I enjoyed my labor with my 2nd with the epidural b/c I was happy and numb!<br>  If I were to have another- I would definitely go with the epidural!!!<br>  But its your choice, and if you can do it with nothing-kudos to you!!!|`|8xrPFY3Jaa	i went through 42 hours of natural labour. I was 21, first time pregnancy, and after all of that work, i ended up needing a c-section. I was so mad that i worked so hard only to have that happen. Now i'm pregnant, and I'm gonna do it natural again. Your body was meant to do do this, and it can handle this (unless complications arise). It doesn't feel like feathers tickling you, of course, but if its your wish, it's worth it!! And you can always change your mind during labour, or opt for lesser of the pain releivers (laughing gas for instance). You'll do fine hun! Good luck!|`|1kLCl7snaa	Natural child birth in my opinion is the most amazing miracle in the world. I am not going to lie it is the most painful thing I have ever experienced. However I would do it again. For me, after I held my baby, I had forgotten all about the pain.|`|My93XR2Maa	i was happy the hold time i was n labor it not as bad as u think it is i was going 2 go Natural bt his hart beat was getting low that when i had to get the drugs bt it all good i had fun with my deliver i hope u hav a good one to|`|EDiJe38Taa	It hurts. ALOT. I have never broken a bone but I would imagine that is a piece of cake compared to childbirth. Good luck though ;)|`|78zLeWLSaa	well, pull a bowling ball out of your @ss, that's what it felt like to me|`|uCnmYEPBaa	It depends on how well you can manage your pain. I had natural childbirth with my son 15 1/2 hours of it, but the worst part was the last 3-4 hours.  With my daughter I had a 6 1/2 hour labor, the last 4 were the most painful.<br>  You have to concentrate on your breathing, focus on something other than the pain.<br>  Its difficult to do but it is possible.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I had my daughter with an epidural,and that actually caused more issues than childbirth itself would have naturally,because not only did it not work,I felt all of the side effects such as headaches,etc from it. The next one,I'm going to attempt to go to other pain alternatives,and not the epidural,so I wish you the best,and hope all goes well!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It's different for everyone - some people are able to control their pain more, or master their fear, I couldn't personally. Everyone has different levels of tolerance for pain, and they all have different ideas as to where their limit is.<br>  I have done it naturally - not by choice. I wouldn't choose to do it again as i found it a hundred times worse than breaking a bone, and yes the contractions were worse to me than the actual birth. I honestly can't think of words that describe enough how painful I found it.<br>  Getting an epidural does not make you any less of a parent - people just have different ideas of what a good birth is. If you can do it natural, it's worth a try.|`|hBBQZ6yDaa	Well, some say it hurts like HELL, but it's not deadly, our parents and past generations all did it natural. It's totally up to you, I've had epidural births 2-ce, and planning on having it this time too.I have a friend who wanted natural, and when she was in labor the pain got so bad, that she couldn't take it, and asked for an epidural. The from the time that you start pushing, you can get the baby out in 5 minutes, or you can get it out in 3 hours, it depends on your body, I would probably be able to stand 5 minutes of pain, but definately not 3 hours of it.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It all depends who you ask and their tolerances for pain. My sister had 7 kids all of them natural. I was there for one of the births and she just closed her eyes and never even made a face or anything through any contractions or through the birth. Her kids weighed as follows 1 girl weighed 8 lbs, the other 3 girls were in the 9lbs range and all 3 of her boys were in the 11 lbs range. The best thing you can do is educate yourself on the processes of both natural and with drug births and decide which one you think you can handle. I am going to try and prepare myself for a natural birth but when contractions start happening if I feel I can't handle it I may change my mind!|`|dWbNAiBoaa	I have two kids and can't tell you how bad natural child birth is. I never made it past the contractions when they got too intense for me before getting my epidural. The contractions with both of my pregnancies really hurt 12 hours into the labor before I gave in. My epidural did start wearing off with my second child so I could feel some when giving birth to my second child. I felt like if I could just go potty (feels intensely like you need to have a bowel movement) that I would feel so much better. Intense relief sensation when the child finally makes it and I can't put into words the emotions. Kudos to those who do do it naturally!|`|AA11538461	I have had four natural births using the Bradley method.  Muscle cramps and arthritis hurt more than labor.  I actually enjoyed my births.  The pain was only 5 1/2 on a scale of 1-10.  The Bradley method teaches total relaxation to prevent uterine cramps.  Usually the majority of the pain women feel is because the uterus is cramping.  Prevent the cramping, and you prevent the worst of the pain.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Well, I've never broken a bone so I couldn't compare the two.  I had natural, but did get an epidural to take the edge off both times.  The first time, the epidural didnt work at all, just numbed my leg, so I did end up feeling everything.  There was a burning feeling but the urge to push kind of overwhelms every other sensation your feeling at the time.  I honestly can't remember any pain immediately after. During the stitching up (if you tear) they use a local, so you don't feel it.<br>  <br>  I think the labor part is the worse, considering it can go for any length of time. Both mine were roughly 8 hours total, with about an hour hard labor.  To me, it was like a megamega menstrual cramp,and it comes in waves.  Breathing helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LKu4YQZuaa	Well ive not had a baby.. But im wondering the same things as you!<br>  <br>  I was in the room whilst my mum was giving birth to my sister and it looked like the most painful thing i had ever seen!<br>  She was on gas and air and completely out of her face but still in so much pain.. It was so heartbreaking to see her like that! But it was mainly because she was on gas and air i didnt like it.. But she was still screaming in agony..<br>  <br>  Once they told her to start pushing she was ok, she had gone off the gas and air and was still in pain but she looked so much better!<br>  <br>  So my advice is dont have gas and air no matter how painful it is, go for something like an epidural.. It cant harm the baby and you will stay sober during the whole experience...<br>  <br>  Good luck with labour and baby :) xx|`|1VdgsZPoaa	No, it isn't as bad as they make it sound.  People have given birth naturally since the dawn of time and survived to deliver even more babies.  Childbirth and labor are among the same things.  I always thought the pushing was harder then the labor in my opinion.  It is worse then breaking a bone in your body but totally worth it in the end.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	with my second i fully intended on getting an epidural but as they were giving me the shpeal on what to expect i said PRESSURE! I FEEL PRESSURE and she was born without pain meds. didnt hurt NEARLY as bad as i thought. in fact only the last two contractions before i started pushing hurt enough for me to moan a little. in between pushes i felt nothing, i was staring at the ceiling thinking this is not happening... seriously, it does NOT hurt, and i wanted the pain meds so you know im not just gung ho about natural birth and sugar coating it. i think we all build it up in our minds so that when it really comes down to it its not as bad as we imagine... at least thats how it was for me... nice surprise i gotta say.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well it is painful...no way of getting around that.  It also depends on your pain tolerance.  The contractions feel like the worst menstrual cramps every and the birth is indescribable.  But there are drugs if it gets too bad and the pain eventually goes away and you will barely remember it.|`|2A6xFP81aa	I found natural childbirth to be a breeze, but I was in my own home with my hubby and midwife. I was relaxing in a water tub. <br>  <br>  The most intense part was when his head and hand came out, but that lasted less than 2 minutes. <br>  <br>  An ingrown toenail, and it's removal caused me FAR FAR more pain than birth. <br>  <br>  Congrats on your choice to go drug free!|`|AA10693194	I had a natural with my first and i will tell you it does hurt like hell! and when the baby is coming out it burns BAD! but when you are holding your baby the pain is gone!!!<br>  I also had a c section with my second and I preffered the natural child birth pain over the section recovery!
Z1e3Cxjoaa	He may be trying to find a thumb to suck on.  He may be teething early.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Your baby like all newborns have a need to suck. If he's now sucking on his fist soon it'll be the thumb-once he finds it! LOL So I strongly suggest you get him a pacifier ASAP!! My oldest son used to do that, I thought it was cute, and he ended up sucking his thumb-also cute as a baby but now we're having a hard time with it!! He's 4 and still sucks his thumb when he's tired or for bed time. It's right there so it's hard to wean him of it... with my daughter I was determined to use a paci, and now were slowly weaning her off it :))<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ftrFpwKAaa	Give him a dummy! he will never stop sucking his thumb coz you cant take that away but you can with a dummy. and my 8 week old has always done that  when hes hungry try a bit more milk. but mines still on 5oz? xx|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Some babies suck their thumb.  Some babies suck their fingers, and some babies will suck their entire fist.  He just needs to suck.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	They suck their fingers and mouth their fists and whatever else for comfort.  It is soothing for them.
GtEfBBwAaa	Your mistake is relying on websites instead of your body.  The first part of a woman's  cycle will change from one woman to the next and from one month to the next based on stress, illness, etc.  Taking your temperature at the same time every morning before you get out of bed, you will notice it is relatively low.  As you approach ovulation, you will notice your cervical mucus changing from thick and white to clear and stretchy.  Ovulation is right around the corner. When your cervical mucus goes back to nothing or faint and your morning temps have jumped (there is a way to calculate that), you have ovulated.  From this point on, the days are set.  All women will get their period 12-14 days after ovulation. Look into Natural Family Planning, which uses the sympto-thermal method(also takes into consideration your cervical position).  Even if you don't want to go natural, you learn a bunch about reading your body's signs of fertility and can guarantee you know when your next period is coming|`|a1uoxczTaa	one may say 28 just because if u did not change the default then it will automatically assume you have a 28 day cycle. from when u had your period you could the first day u started until the first day u start ur next period. the period u showed us shows u have a 21 day cycle.
0lnamekJaa	Because in some areas the contract is seen as Illegal because you are selling your body...<br>  <br>  In some areas, some people feel that the poor are being exploited by surrogacy contracts...<br>  <br>  In some places, the surrogate has actually refused to hand over the baby... And the legal system hasn't caught up to the problem as of yet so no one is really sure whose baby it is... LEGALLY...<br>  <br>  It is a complicated issue that has not yet been figured out in the legal system|`|AA11210211	wow I have never heard that???...<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  oh okay I researched it it is illegal to have a Contract,meaning you get paid for it.I see.Which really is wrong I think because you are buying/selling a human.
BcdbR6iSaa	I was paranoid my whole pregnancy. Then the doctor told me my baby might have spina bifida, and I was flipping out. Then they finally said she didn't have it, but they couldn't find all the chambers of her heart. And then they said she was going to be an 11 pound baby, so that freaked me out.. <br>  Doctors just love to stress you out.. But after all that, I had a perfectly healthy 8lb 14oz baby girl, and they were wrong about everything!!<br>  So don't worry too much, there's not much you can do but let the baby grow. I'm sure you'll do just fine!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Its normal specially for first time moms. I dont even have that excuse I already have a daughter and I am very paranoid which i wasnt with my daughter. I guess its normal specially when you read on so many things that can go wrong.|`|uuHPneEcaa	everyone is like that with there 1st pregnancy. I was and i still am.. its normal.. just have to think positive about things and stop worrying. if u have questions yeah u can call ur doctor (i do it all the time)  just wait until u get closer to ur due date. I am 33 weeks and some days now and like every lil pain i feel i call my doctor!!! so its normal|`|90zcKChJaa	I am 16 weeks in with my second pregnancy, and I was thinking thins morning on how I would always worry about my baby. Is he/she doing ok in there? Is it still alive? Is it growing normally? There were so many days were I wouldn't even feel pregnant, and those were sad days, but I have a beautiful 2 year old daughter now, and I just look at her and it reminds me that everything will be perfect with this pregnancy too.<br>  <br>  It's better for you to go hear the baby's heartbeat just to put your stress/ worry level down. Everything will be great with you and your baby! ;)<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	i was very paranoid in the beginning of my pregnancy but now im trying not to worry so much anymore...it is a hard thing to overcome sometimes.. but think of this, your going to do alot more worrying when that baby comes out and gets older lol so might aswell save yourself from doing it now lol|`|AA10230627	yes i'm pregnant with my third baby and i am just as paranoid about this one as i was with my first two and they were perfectly healthy. it's just in our nature to worry.|`|nISYAHkfaa	You'd better believe it, I get so paranoid even pooping makes me nervous that I'm gonna miscarry sometimes. XD I hope everything goes well for you!|`|MUEsS8tYaa	I'm the same way. I'm almost 29 weeks along with my first, and I have been freaking out over every little thing. So far its been pretty smooth. My doctors keep telling me everything is fine, but I'm still really really nervous. I think its pretty normal, especially with your first baby because you don't know what to expect, and its an entirely new experience. Good luck with your baby!!!!!! :)|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I am the same way! I am always calling the doctor's office with my little symptoms of anything going wrong!!! I have also had friends that have lost babies and had stillborns, so as soon as I pass how far along they were when it happened to them, and my baby is fine, a little relief comes over me.|`|bo4MguzVaa	No I've been paranoid too.  I haven't scheduled a bunch of appoitments, but I worry about the baby all the time and think about him all the time.  I'm glad I scheduled to have two 3d ultrasounds, that way i can peek in on him two more times to check him for myself.  :)|`|vxoWXVLKaa	I think that it is normal to be so concerned, especially with your first.  I'm not sure how far along you are, but once you start to feel the baby kicking all day, it is easier to trust that he/she is doing fine.  Good luck!|`|dKTPewhTaa	Some people would view that as paranoid, but you are just concerned.  Don't let that worry take over all your thoughts or that would be paranoid and stress and worry are not good for your baby.    Remember your hormones are kicking in, too. Good luck!|`|dR2bqUixaa	I think it's normal. I have been calling my doctor over every little thing. They say that it's all normal. Lol!
mLbydsVIaa	your never supposed to life anything that seems heavy to your body...<br>  my doctor and other doctors say the limit is 20 lbs. which i think is about right. dont lift anything that feels uncomfortable also...even if it is under 20 lbs.<br>  i heard a story from my obgyn about this girl who was 5 months prego n carried a tv up lots of stairs and had a miscarriage so b careful<br>  hope this helped :)|`|FjGeKhY0aa	You should've stopped already! I can't really tell what's the weight limit, but if you feel that you're making an effort to pick something up, don't, it is too much. You're not suppose to put any pressure on your abdomen.|`|kcGFK36Waa	I stopped carrying heavy objects since i found out I was pregnant. The doctor never told me anything about not carry heavy objects but better be safe than sorry.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	If it is the same things you have been lifting for a while before you got pregnant you are probably fine. Granted, you don't want to be lifting something that's 50 lbs. But they generally say that it's safe to continue doing what your body is used to doing before getting pregnant. The problem with lifting is the risk that is poses to you, not the baby. As pregnant woman, our muscles and joints aren't the same as they were before. So when we lift we have a greater chance of pulling muscles and hurting our backs. I have a 23 month old son that weights 40 pounds. I have continued lifting him since I found out I was pregnant, I'm 37 weeks now, and I haven't had a problem at all. Just use your best judgment and listen to your body! Good luck!|`|HeE2jTLdaa	You really shouldn't be lifting anything heavy at any point during your pregnancy. You don't need to be putting stress on your body, especially your abdomen. The baby comes first. I know it's hard to not do as much and let others help you, but it's all for the baby! You don't want anything to jeapordize your pregnancy. You're also still really early in your pregnancy...be careful and take it super easy.|`|wJDfFutBaa	Ashley is spot on. If you're job required lifting before you were pregnant, then you're fine to keep lifting. I asked my doctor because we are moving this week and she said that I should not lift for hours on end, anything over 35 pounds. <br>  <br>  It's not WHAT we lift that poses a problem, it's HOW we lift. Whenever you lift you really need to do it properly. Bend knees, etc.... Your sciatic will thank you if you lift properly!|`|ZvkX9uNraa	At 8 weeks pregnant my doctor said that nothing over 20 lbs should be lifted during pregnancy. So I am hoping you have not been lifting heavy objects, but unless you have had pain or bleeding I am sure you are fine. I would just make sure from here out, everything was under 20 lbs.
4SKIE1C8aa	I don't really like Ashton but I adore Nicholas...I don't like the way they flow together either, since Ashton ends with an 'n' and Nicholas begins with one...they seem to run together. Nicholas Ashton has much better flow in my opinion.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve it :o)|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like it alot.|`|heC9aQ18aa	They go well together which is odd because the first name ends with n and the middle name starts with n. Usually that causes the name to sound clunky but in this case it's fine. I like both names. Nicholas more than Ashton.|`|ZxJw85hfaa	I like Ashton but not Nicholas...too common.|`|t0OYbngBaa	I really like that name...|`|5a2fd8ac3c0590f023739ad6937953a8aa	nicholas ashton goes better!|`|ioGfuwOPaa	I like the name Ashton Nicholas. It's a nice name.|`|Zzi5xJSraa	Very cute! Ashtyn is a cute girls name as well.|`|47M20WOUaa	YEAH I like it :)|`|gCCkDLMHaa	i like the name gage nicholas|`|iyEYXiq8aa	It's ok, not my favourite but they go well together|`|NtiflVn7aa	aww so cute! I love it!|`|JWp9PMyRaa	Ashton is very cute...(my name is Ashley!)<br>  <br>  but Nicholas...nah...I dont like it..|`|OyKrB63waa	I typically don't like names that will always make me think of someone specific like "ashton". As in, I don't want to think about Punk'd when I see a baby.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, they're both pretty names and especially "nicholas"
StiIpLFoaa	Your child is much smarter than you think at this age. With my son I would give him a sippy cup of water - especially if the heat was on. then if he continued I would look at him and say "it is night night time you need to go to sleep" and lay him down and leave the room. If he continued I would go back in after awhile 10-20 minutes depending on my patience and tell him "it is night night time, you need to go to sleep. You are not coming into our bed and I am not coming back in here." The first night he cried a long time after that it wasn only a few minutes. If it happens now (he is 24 months) I still go to be sure nothing is wrong and do the same thing I just listed.|`|rOFteEdlaa	your going to hate what i have to say but you have to let them cry it out if they think or know your going to come get them they will keep crying, i have 3 kids under the age of 5(4 year old twins and an almost 19 month old) and my youngest still tried to cry for us to go get her and we wont bring her out after bed time, bed time is what time they go to sleep no ands, ifs or buts, my twins also tried this at the same age and it didn't go to well past the first week of doing it so i just stopped taking them out after bed time and they got over it, by this age they know what to do to get what they want an d they will manipulate you 24/7 if they want and then they grow up and get everything and they hit the real world and fall flat on their face, trust me|`|3cf60782957e3628df5724f763ad9464aa	The experts say that you must let her cry until she stops.  I also had trouble with that, so I would bring the baby into bed with me and once the baby fell asleep, I would move her to her own bed.
kTu7UtS1aa	My story:  Last Friday I used First Response and Clearblue Easy.  First Resp gave me a faint BFP and Clearblue Easy gave me a BFN.  I thought that the First Resp was faulty, so I purchased another First Resp, and it too gave me a faint positive.  The next day I went to Walmart and purchased their brand (Equate, I think) and it too gave me a faint positive.  So, on Sunday, March 1st (the day my period was due) I tried the Walmart cheapie and again, that it gave me a stronger positive.  Finally, on Monday, I tried ClearBlue Easy, and it said "Pregnant."  I read on "www.peeonastick.com" that First Response and Equate are very sensitive tests, so it doesn't require a high concentration of hCG in your urine.  Oh, also, since you are testing early, do it in the morning, with your first urine.<br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck to you!!!|`|aI4wgxRFaa	DOn't use the Early response Hpt. I tried it and it keep showing up negative, eventhough i'm like 6 or 10 days late! I'm thinking that i don't have enough HGG in my pees, so I'm going to wait for one more week and get the digital pregnancy test.|`|S5n5Za78aa	i think the dollar store brand is just fine thats just my personal opinion all my friends detected all there pregnancies with $ store test!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I used a first response and got a positive on my first test so I prefer them.|`|dY5fM2vTaa	well i found i wanted alot of proof that i was pregnant. the clear blue easy brand has a 5 pack so you dont have to keep running to the store thats what I always bought.|`|D2Xam3POaa	Go for the digital!!!  It says "Pregnant" or "Not Pregnant", no confusing lines.  Good luck!|`|2SOUZuDxaa	The ones that I have always used is ClearBlue and EPT, I trust them the most.Best of luck to you!! :-)|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I am going to start testing tuesday also! My af is due the 14th. I really like First Response Early Result or the Answer early result. They use pink dye and can be used 5 days early. I really don't like the blue dye (EPT) b.c they have a higher rate of evap lines. Good luck..hope we get our BFP's!!!|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I like the Clear Blue easy, the one that says pregnant or not pregnant. How clear is that. No looking for lines and wondering.
4Bgw5xs8aa	Nope. Never did that. BUT if she had eaten within the last hour, I tried to extinguish all other possibilites. I would change her, rock her, walk with her, give her a paci, make sure she didn't have gas...and after that, I'd offer more food. Sometimes she took it because she was hungry, but other times she just wasn't consolable. So I'd continue trying everything over and over again til something worked.<br>  <br>  I would never make her wait to eat, but I don't think everytime you baby whimpers you should stick a bottle/breast in their mouth. I know parents who do this just so they don't have to listen to the kid. One who did it and her baby was always overweight and always throwing up mass amounts and bloated cause he was sooo stuffed with formula.|`|18ba725ea0f0d8c565485a0b8048d9b9aa	I have 4 children & I never made my baby wait. Some babies need to feed more often than others especially if your breast feeding there is noway you can know for sure how much your baby has had. If my baby wanted a bottle they got it & my kids are all healthy & none are even the slightest bit over weight. I say your baby knows what it needs & he/she will let you know. But I would not force my baby to wait if it was hungry.|`|WirFwirLaa	Our 3rd night home with our son he cried uncontrollably for an hour straight an hour after eating. We did everything we could think of to help him but nothing worked! My husband kept saying 'Feed him!' and I kept saying 'He just ate, he can't be hungry!' I ran to the bathroom and came back out and my husband had given him a bottle, 2 ounces in he was out like a light! Of course, I got the 'I told you so!!' look!|`|qImMwhUHaa	Some babies just like to nurse and use your boob as a pacifier and some babies do overeat (my first did) which causes tummy aches and spitting up. Two hours between feedings is legitimate in my opinion but if I had been up with my child during the night for an hour I would have fed her to just to get her back to sleep again so I could go to sleep.|`|8lR6OvB6aa	No, I feed my baby when ever he is hungey. That way I know that he is being fed and that being hungry is not the reason for his crying. It helps eliminate why he is crying.And as for the woman on the show someone needs to make her wait to eat or go to the bathroom and see how she likes it.|`|SZ33qLeraa	I wouldnt make my baby  wait either...i have had 5 little cousins and nephews to take care of before and they all eat at different times! it really depends on the baby of how often they want to eat...some may eat every 2 hours yet some may eat every 4 it just depends...Babies tend to make their own schedule...and i believe in the never wake a sleeping baby method....babies need lots of sleep and if they get hungry then they will let you know!!|`|qJBMdL7gaa	Alot of Drs will tell you to only feed your baby every 2 hours or 3 hours...or whatever. Keep them on a schedule.<br>  Me- When my baby was crying and hungry, I fed him. That's all there is to that. They know when their hungry, I dont see the need to starve them for an hour just to be on a schedule. Thats my opinion.|`|n9hPQhbOaa	i dont think she meant to do that. the 1st night can be scary mine was not i did good i tryed to wake up and feed him b4 he stared to cry but now i just feed him when he shows hes hungry only tha baby knows when he/she is hungry i hate when they give u a time to feed he should feed @ this time its stupid see what happ the baby was hungry i think i saw that episode too|`|bn0axDktaa	If this was within the first few days after delivery the mother might not be producing enough milk, therefor spacing out feedings to conserve enough milk to keep feedings regular.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Yea that is silly, obviously if that baby was hungry they should have fed it. <br>  People are crazy, if they were hungry I bet they would eat, but make the baby wait?!  Wow.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I never made my child wait if he was absolutely frantic but if he was just wimpering I would try and put space in between feedings just to get him on a schedule.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i don't think i would have waited either, but hey i guess they didn't know. im sure someone will inform them soon enough once their friends and fam watch the show.|`|mvqfIjEVaa	Some people are set on getting their baby on a schedule. Others feed on demand.  I chose to feed on demand.  I figure my baby knows when he is hungry better than anyone else.|`|AA10615926	Nope I always nursed on demand with both my boys.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	As a new mother I also tried to heed advice from "experienced" mothers.  I was breast feeding & they were raised on bottle advice.  So it occurred to me that they might also be wrong about setting feeding times.  My 1st child nursed every 15-45 min.  (Maybe that's why I was so willing to accept advice!)  But I think that you are right in that a child's metabolism knows how much nutrition they need.  My 1st child grew tall like here daddy.  My 2nd nursed every 6 hours & he's short like my side of the family.  /  My 1st also had an abrupt change in feeding at the 3 mo. mark. / I'm firm believer in letting nature take it's course unless some obvious sign that it's out of whack. / Starred for Interesting Question!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I think that SARAH M is right that those feeding schdules were made more for parents than child needs. / Also, as for wanting breast as "pacifier," I see no problem w/ comforting newborn in this fashion b/c they knew nothing but comfort for 9 mo. in the womb.  It's a bit scarry to face all the bodily disconnect at once.  To me, feeding & comforting is positive for newborn to help them adapt to life outside the womb.  It doesn't last forever.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	It irks me too.  Some parents are so firm in setting up an eating schedule that they'll only feed the baby when it's close to the proper scheduled time.  Honestly, at that young of an age, I feel the schedule is more for the parent than the baby.  In my opinion, a newborn should be fed on demand...even if he only ate an hour ago.  My parents did scheduled feedings with me and my four siblings and did turn out ok...but I don't have the heart for it.  Even when I had my children, my dad tried to convince me the schedule was the best.  Don't get me wrong, I think schedules (for other things) are fantastic for children and babies, but a feeding schedule (especially for newborns) doesn't need to be so structured.|`|CL0Ee4D5aa	Yeah, that's ridiculous. Newborns need to be fed on demand. Especially breastfeeding in the beginning - they get only small amounts so they should be fed as often as they want! (I have 4 kids, the youngest is 5 months)|`|pXSKSS3daa	I think I remember seeing that one. You cannot schedule a newborn, it's just silly to think you can.<br>  <br>  I have never made my son wait to eat. Now, there were times we were out driving and I couldn't prepare a bottle right then and there but I don't see that as forcing him to wait.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think we all had our clueless moments when our baby was first home.  I never did that deliberately, but I'm sure I did it by accident.  I am reasonably sure that on at least one occasion I changed his diaper a few times in a row before it occurred to me to feed him.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	The only time I ever made my babies wait to eat was if we were in the car and I couldn't stop at that moment in time.<br>  My daughter was one of those that ate every hour on the hour for the first 3 months of her life. I don't believe in putting a newborn on a feeding schedule.  Because they will tell you when they are hungry.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	NOPE- besides it's not recommended to put a breastfed baby on a feeding schedule- feed on demand<br>  <br>   mithaniel- spacing out feedings will cause you to have LESS milk- breastfeeding is supply and demand|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Not at such a young age at about 3 months I started to get my boys on a schedule|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I never made my daughter wait, I still don't make her wait and she's seven months old.|`|ROJans2Taa	I saw that episode and was saying to the TV "feed her!" I never waited, there were times early into breastfeeding when my left side was so badly engorged and it had open sores on it, that I started to dread feeding him, and it would take me a few tries to actually latch him on because without meaning to I kept backing up, cause I knew the pain it would cause,lol. I|`|u00IalCZaa	Here is my take on it. I follow what the doc said. I do the schedule.I get on one hand what others think but you dont want weight problems with the baby and the doc knows best. Also, it makes me cringe when people say let the baby tell you how to do it... ahhhhhhhhhhh its a baby. you are the adult.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	only if I was driving and had to get to somewhere that I could pull over and feed him.....otherwise NO, never. Jacob was always fed as quickly as I possibly could feed him. (still is)<br>  <br>  I've seen that one before on TLC and I swear I wanted to smack her. lol|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I thought that was pretty old school thinking.  I never made him wait, feed on demand is what we were told, babies know when they're hungry.|`|vcxdTXbraa	I hear ya...I never made my son wait to eat even if he ate every hour. If he was hungry I fed him. The don't just cry for nothing|`|3dSCbIcEaa	no, thats neglect.  its difficult to feed on demand, thats why i only had 2 kids.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i never made my son wait to eat .|`|QzWHMGHJaa	It may not be her fault!  My first IDIOT pediatrician told me the same thing when I had my first.  Only feed her every 4 hrs and not one minute sooner.  We ended up at the emergency room because she wouldn't quit screaming and what did we find out, she was hungry!  We got a new Dr the next day!  As a new Mom you try and do what the Dr tells you and trust he's right!  Then you find out he's not, that he's an idiot and you do it the right way!
XYBHM8aSaa	Louie Armand sounds like a joke of Louie Viutton.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	My name is Victoria, its annoying cos everyone calls me Vicky. But if your not gender sure then just let people call you Vic, its masc and fem.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I would keep Victoria, have people call you Vic :o)|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Louie Armand simply sounds male to me.  It may be "gender-neutral" in Sweden, but in most places, people are going to assume you're a guy, and if you're not quite 100% sure, I wouldn't think you'd want to have a guy's name any more than you'd want to have a girl's name.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should just keep "Victoria," but go with something like "Vick" for everyday usage?|`|zgXpomfCaa	Louie Armand just seems very masculine, and not feminine at all. So, I'll have to be say I prefer Victoria... Sorry!|`|iyEYXiq8aa	What about Louise Amanda|`|BdbieVyvaa	Well, I don't think you should completely change you name. Just don't go under Victoria. Just use Vic. It is totally gender neutral! It could also stand for Victor! But it is totally up to you! Tell me what you decide!! :)|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	well in america louie and armand are both man names
uCnmYEPBaa	If you have an indoor pool that is open in your area I would recommend going and doing some aqua aerobics. The water will take the pressure off your hips and back. I too am suffering mild-medium symptoms of SPD.<br>  Yoga, I have heard also helps.<br>  good luck and just be careful
uFrqC4Y2aa	I'm also 29 weeks and the baby is kicking and turning all the time. It hurts me when I get kicked very low in my uterus. I wouldn't think massaging or pushing lightly would hurt. <br>  <br>  Also maybe there's more room in the right side or it's more comfortable. Who knows.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Do you have a bicornuate (heart-shaped) or septate uterus? They can see it on ultrasound.<br>  <br>  My uterus is heart-shaped, and the baby is always on the left side of my uterus because part of the right side is walled off. It feels EXACTLY like you described. It's lopsided and does hurt a little.<br>  <br>  Really, I can't think of any other reason why the baby would be only on one side. Pushing and massaging lightly won't hurt the baby.. but in my case, it causes her to go lower and tranverse (horizontal) which is even more uncomfortable because she's kicking my sides.<br>  <br>  I would ask your doctor. If you do have a bicornate uterus, you need special care (perinatalogist) because it is a high-risk pregnancy!|`|3DZDT4VIaa	i have the same prob my baby was breech then aswell, and he did turn. although he is all on my right side still and him bum is up at my ribs, i found it a horrible feeling. some days its worser than others but i just try and change my position. its horrible tho you can see his back and his bum sticking out my right side, but i guess hes comfy lol.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	my baby favors the left side. i push him out of it all the time (especially when he thinks my ribs are play things!!!!) doctor still says he is perfect.... i doubt the pushing him away will hurt him at all =) congrats and sorry for your pain|`|46K4FtE0aa	baby is constantly on the move and is twisting and turning all the time, sometimes doing a complete somersault. Very often it will press on a nerve or push on a rib causing pain, it is quite normal so don't worry.|`|mCDopsLEaa	Yes it does happen to others, it happened to me, but it was my left side. It may hurt because the baby may be in a tight area, it may be smaller so he/she is sitting on a nerve or moving too much, etc. I doubt anything is wrong with that side of your uterus. sometimes babies just feel closer to mom up high, and thats where he wants to be. Pushing your baby out of this area is not going to hurt the baby. Being breeched at 29 weeks isn't bad, the baby has plenty of time to turn head down befor eyou deliver, if he doesn't then you will have a c-section. I hope i answered all your questions.|`|059a9b55284608546a32f5eabf3402eeaa	In addition to the above poster, maybe it may also have something to do with the placement of the placenta. Perhaps your baby does not feel comfortable being near to the placenta, or it may be the other way around and he/she is more comfortable laying against the placenta.
rMP9BCyGaa	Have a go with a 'Good Behaviour' Chart.  Set it up so that he can see quite clearly where he is going over his boundaries but when he does do something good praise him and mark the chart accordingly.<br>  When he has been a good boy over a certain length of time.....eg. 3 days, give him a small reward, when he has a whole week of good behaviour with no 'black marks' a larger reward could be on offer.<br>  I used this method with both my daughters and it worked really well, in fact quite a few friends took it up too with their children and found it worked a lot better than anything else they had tried.<br>  Having a chart shows your son what is expected of him and exactly what his boundaries, rules and your expectations of him are. At the age of 10 he is only a short time away from going to secondary school and after being amongst the eldest at Junior school to then be the youngest at secondary school can bring behaviour that is unacceptable.  <br>  I found that by having certain things in 'black and white' my daughters went on to give themselves boundaries of their own.<br>  If you would like to know more about how to set up the Good Behaviour chart please email me and I'll be more than happy to help you with it.<br>  Good luck. x<br>  Edit:  In the UK it is illegal to smack our children. Any form of physical punishment would instantly result in serious problems for the mother. All it would take is the boy to mention at school that his mother hit him and Social Services would be involved and the mother in court on charges of assault!!|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Take things away from him.  Take everything except his schoolbooks if you have to.  Lock it all up or hide it somewhere.  Then make a list of everything you want to change.  Explain to him that he must now earn the privilege of having them again.  This can only be done by making the changes on the list.  When he complies and does what you ask of him, give something back.  If he breaks the rules or goes back to his bad habits, take the stuff away again.<br>  <br>  It also helps to have a similar system of rewards.  Like a cash incentive for getting good grades or the promise that you'll take him somewhere he really likes to go if he keeps his room clean without being asked for two weeks in a row.<br>  <br>  You can even make some kind of chart so your system of rewards and consequences are very clear.|`|AhNkKIMlaa	boundaries, i don't believe in spanking but when it is needed you do it once and hopefully they learn after that one time that it fricken hurts and he wont step over the line.<br>  <br>  i always watch how my mum keeps the "devil children" as i like to call them at bay and shes just really calm... but then she does work in a hospital she has to put up with allot worse.<br>  <br>  Be calm stern, dont shout (just makes the situation worse) and if need be dont ever give his electrical equiptment back, we suvived quiet well with out all the weird stuff they have out their now.|`|qAGeCYVlaa	Depending on what he's doing the best thing to do is take away ALL privileges except reading or homework. It gives the child time to think about what they've done and let's them know you're very serious about this.|`|7j8VqylNaa	bily.org is a great site for this kind of stuff.

He plays football, basketball, baseball, and martial arts I could careless.  My 6ft 7in step son quakes in my sight.  You must DEMAND respect in order to receive it.  This usually starts at a much younger age.  Further more taking away his stuff won't work? Will running it over with you vehicle work? How about giving it away to unfortunate poor kids who listen to their parents.  I do not ground any how.  I am more for lectures and hands on labor punishment such as racking, shoveling, running, picking up rocks-it builds character and burns energy.  *EDIT* to the "know it all" named NEO above, my 10 year old is quite stronger than me, and I am sure he is stronger than you.  Please do not insult people by the fact of their strong children.  My child happens to be so strong from intense physical sports work outs and training all year.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you need self defense classes ..you need to learn to retrain a kid who exerts his strength ..I can flip a big man and keep him on his stomach|`|daaf98fda077fbcf980e059669c29f08aa	Hey you people telling this single Mom to beat her kid,<br>  <br>  Since she's a single Mom the CPS is probably watching her<br>  already, and maybe interviewing her son in school to see<br>  if she's a good Mom.<br>  <br>  The CPS makes money on every kid they "steal" away from<br>  the parents for the gov't.<br>  <br>  If you research this you will find documented FACT that the<br>  WORST place for a child to be, where they are apt to get<br>  the most abuse, is with Child Protective Services.<br>  <br>  Your son is 10, and as strong as you. It's time to involve<br>  him in your situation as your partner and helper. Perhaps<br>  if he knows how much you NEED him to behave and <br>  gets to realize he's not just the spoiled baby boy now,<br>  he could take hold of himself and do better.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work you can't beat it into him. At 10 he<br>  will just resent you more and maybe even run away. Boys<br>  that age need a man; not to beat them but to LOVE them.<br>  But if you don't have a caring b/f or older male relative to<br>  mentor him you're gonna have a hard time.<br>  <br>  I looked after an apartment building and several years ago<br>  a girl moved in with 2 kids age 7 and 9. The 9 year old boy<br>  was a terror, getting kicked out of school and screaming at<br>  his Mom. He started hanging around with me when I was<br>  doing chores and I let him help. He talked and talked for<br>  hours after school, and I listened and told him how it was<br>  when I was 9.<br>  <br>  His behavior improved so that he started respecting his Mom<br>  and he began getting better grades in school. I did nothing<br>  but LISTEN, and explain the situation that he wasn't a baby<br>  and it was important to help his Mom. I really feel for you.<br>  Incidentally the boy is now 19 and works for me sometimes,<br>  and still helps his cute little Mom, (who is my friend).|`|1HfLkTrdaa	I was a single mom, too, so I undertand how you feel.  Nevertheless, you have show him you are the mother and the buck stops with you.  Millions of mothers have done this, so can you.<br>  <br>  The key here is to establish the boundaries and stand your ground. Don't let them manipulate you.  If the father is involved, then you two need to show a united front. Otherwise the kid will try to pit you against each other.<br>  <br>  Here are some useful tips at the link below. Good luck.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	To be honest if you haven't set firm ground rules before the age of 7 then he is going to be hard work. Ive been a single mum and I have a 10 year old daughter. My daughters know that if they step out of line they are in trouble. Can you speak to his teacher or father about your concerns? Maybe have a word with your dad. Take away his privileges and make sure that you stick to them. Tell him for every day he is naughty something will be taken away. No matter how big he gets make sure you never let him see how  smaller than him you are.|`|AA11570236	Take things away don't return them until he complies.
9Irzj4MCaa	If she was on her period, it is highly likely she cannot get pregnant. Women are only fertile during ovulation, which is 2 weeks before your period. <br>   As for the mental pain, comfort her, and try to convinvce her to report it, don't let the same thing happen to someone else.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	The incident does not fall under the accepted definition of "sexual harassment".<br>  <br>  Secondly, she had the choice to allow it to happen or get up and move away.  What position was she in?  Did she make an attempt to disallow removal of pants/ panties?  Why did she allow a male with exudate on his hand to touch her?<br>  <br>  Sounds suspiciously like one of those incidences where female under the influence wakes up and cries "rape".  That is, assuming the entire story is not a pipe dream.<br>  <br>  A person whose Q's & A's are hidden is rarely being truthful.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i don't she can get pregnant that way..infact its damn near impossible.  but she needs to report that.. u need to be there for her, let her know u will be there when she reports it.. no one should have to go through that. and i am very sorry to hear that.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	The odds are in her favor for not being pregnant.  She really needs to report that guy and if she won't, maybe you should call in an anonymous tip to the police.  What if he rapes the next girl?  You and your friend are going to feel awful for not doing something when you had the chance.|`|N6XTcGejaa	very very unlikely. as she was on her periods and he did not penetrate in her. i dont think she has more than a 1 % chance of being pregnant.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Very very not likey to be pregnant.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	She should take a test and report it because if she doesn't it might happen to somebody else just like her!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It is very unlikely that she is pregnant, but to make sure she isn't she should consider the morning after pill aka Plan B.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can support her by gently coaxing her to go to the police. Listen to what she has to say and don't rush her. She will feel very up and down with this, so it is paramount that she doesn't feel pushed in to doing anything. Ask her if she would like you to attend counselling sessions with her, she will need counselling and it may be tough-so having a friend with her will help a lot.<br>  <br>  It is important that the police are told, otherwise this guy may do it to someone else.|`|SQpjHOzVaa	She could possibly get pregnant on her period with precum but it's a matter of how much precum and if she was to be pregnant it will take 2 weeks to show up on a pregnancy test. She needs to report the harrassment either way, she doesn't have to be public about it. She can talk to a counselor or the health department or someone but needs to tell someone before it happens to someone else.|`|5puE2Qfpaa	I would support her by telling her to report it and that you will stand by her. The person and people that did that and that were all cheering it on, will eventually become rapist or be caught up in serious problems.She needs to show them they can not get away with such terrible things. I was raped at 6 yrs and then at 31 yrs of age.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	She's probably not pregnant. From what you say happened, It would be very unlikely. You can support her by listening to her when she needs someone to talk to and let her know you're there for her. And encourage her to tell a trusted adult.|`|erjMAQcAaa	No she wont be pregnant, she was on her period so not ovulating, she had a tampon in that would stop sperm getting to her cervix and your not sure it was precum.<br>  <br>  I would encourage her to report the scumbag.|`|jvTgqdaiaa	she is probably not pregnant. sperm can only live for a couple seconds in air. plus she was wearing a tampon, so it would have trapped it. tell her not to worry, and she really needs to tell an adult. talk to the school counselor about it. they will help a lot!|`|dR2bqUixaa	I don't think that the pre-*** would have survived on the guys hand.

BcdbR6iSaa	You might already be having Braxton Hicks, but when I was pregnant I could never really tell I was having them. I didn't feel any contractions until they started my induction at 41 weeks. I would take the painless or natural contractions over the forced induction ones any day.  <br>  I wouldn't expect you to start having labor contractions for at least 6 more weeks. If you do have them sooner, make a trip to the ER so they can monitor you. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Forty, forty-two.  You've got ages to go.  That first child was early.<br>  <br>  don't worry about this: I was induced with my first so had no idea what to expect, but when labour arrives it's quite unmistakeable:  you double over and it squeezes like God thought you were a tube of toothpaste.  You really cannot be confused, it's intense.|`|ROJans2Taa	it varies, my second I got painful braxton hicks from around 31-32 weeks, by 35 weeks they were making me double over, I gave birth at 39 weeks after getting my membranes stripped, my first pregnancy I delivered at 37 weeks with no previous braxton hicks, good luck|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	There is no way to tell...every woman and pregnancy is different.

jd4MzIYtaa	ewww i dont like that idea at all. It just sounds funny with any middle or last name. That is as bad as naming your child after a season, or month it is born.

xoQxDGAlaa	I think it's your body still trying to become normal again. Do you remember what your periods were like before the IUD? Are you in good health i.e. exercising regularly and eating balanced meals? This spotting will probably start your period. I would just keep having sex every other day and start charting your cycles so you know exactly when you ovulate. If you are not ovulating this could be causing your irregular cycles and that's when your dr can step in. But they need evidence so start charting your basal body temp and CM every day.|`|1dNBZFPbaa	If you're trying for a baby, bc isn't really recommended.. :)<br>  <br>  Stressing about it probably doesn't help - it could be what's causing your longer cycles.

Im always stress in case I die and who will look after my kids better than me. There is no one. Im 100% sure of that. Its called irrational fears and you can have counselling to help.

It's an irrational fear that I literally can't control.  If I feel it coming on and I know I'm going to have an anxiety attack I take a pill.  I have got it down to a science now.  Just having the pills makes me feel more relaxed knowing that there is something that can take the fear away.  I rarely actually take the pills.    I would talk to your doctor.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	to a degree what you are feeling is perfectly normal... however if it get so extreme as to impact every moment of the day or alter the way you interact with people then i'm thinking you may want to speak to a psychologist/psychiatrist you may have an anxiety disorder and a professional would be best to help you overcome these feelings|`|T52u1DVXaa	I think that it's more the health issues.

I have a terrible family health history and am always worrying about dying before I have the chance to see my children grow up.  I often think I'll have to come back and haunt them because I don't think I would be able to never see them again, even in death.  (yikes!)<br>  <br>  But I have learned that enjoying every moment I have with them is the only way to keep myself from freaking out.  I give them hugs and kisses on a regular basis and I always try to make as much time with them as I can.  Getting up early on the weekends suck but when they come running into my room to say good morning with their own hugs and kisses, the fatigue magically disappears.<br>  <br>  Try to live every day like it's your last.  I know it's a terribly over-used cliche but there is so much truth and logic in it you have no choice but to do it.<br>  <br>  Stay positive and worry only when there is reason to.

I know it seems like a huge deal to you, but believe me, millions of people feel just like you do right now. Stress comes with children and it can make your anxiety symptoms worse.

Good luck to you!|`|cYm3qQn2aa	I know how you feel, I've been in a similar situation.<br>  <br>  I have two kids, I'm a single mother and I wouldn't call their dad an active participant in parenting so I've always had this fear that if something happened to me what would become of my children.  I've noticed over the years as my kids get older (now 10 & 12) that I'm less worried about myself and more about them.  I think of all the stupid things I've done and how lucky I've been to survive.  I don't go on school trips with them anymore as I will just be a wet rag with my constant warnings of "be careful".<br>  <br>  This may not be of much help, but maybe a source of encouragement -- we are not in control of our lives, no matter how hard we try and I think the answer to finding some relief from your worrying lies in letting go and accepting that God is in the drivers seat.<br>  <br>  Be prepared, talk to your kids, and then just enjoy!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I do the exact same thing...lot's of us mommies do!  It mostly hits me at night when I can't shut my mind down, then all kind of scenarios play around in my head.  If it's not about something happening to me, then it's something happening to one of my children.  Horrible feeling!  I always say that being a parent is the most painful kind of love you will ever feel.  But you can't let those moments of panic affect all the joy you are getting day to day from your life.  Enjoy all those little moments and soak it all in.  If you let the anxieties take over you are going to miss it all.  A good prescription won't hurt either! LOL
S5n5Za78aa	When i was diagnosed my doc started me on metformin to treat my pcos cause of irregular periods which is pretty common with pcos and  not ovulating which will be the reason i couldnt  get preggo but there is medication out there that can induce ovulation like CLOMID but some woman do just fine with just metformin and a regular diet and exercise|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	It's possible, but it usually takes a few months for Met to start regulating your hormones.
5RvTXdmUaa	Yeah if it says you are and you're within the time frame, then you most likely are. They rarely give out false positive results.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|q4WtQvSZaa	Evap lines are usually colourless, but the only way to know for sure is to wait a few days and test again I'm afraid.  The levels of HCG increase very rapidly in early pregnancy so a few days will make a difference to the readability of the test.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Pregnant.  Happened to me on 4 days before period was due...so I took a digital and it confirmed it.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	wait a few more days and take another test. or you could go to your doctor and get bloodwork its more accurate than the home tests|`|4XfjUcvDaa	most likely are pregnant.  I would take another test on saturday morn|`|qfuhHeDjaa	if it was taken in the time frame its a positive...|`|kTu7UtS1aa	Most likely your are pregnant.  False positive are rare.  Wait until your period is due and use the ones that say "pregnant" or "not pregnant", that way you will know for sure.  <br>  Good luck to you!

I do not dislike it, though, because it brings back fond memories of my grandmother, and my husband's aunt is also a very nice person.|`|heC9aQ18aa	I pronounce it I-da. I think of it as a very old lady's name because that was a very common name back in the early 19th century. I would only use it as a middle name if I wanted to honor someone with the name Ida.

L8eNBQelaa	tell him the truth. he can't do anything legally if you choose to have an abortion. it is your body, and your choice.|`|i8Ch743Laa	You just need to be honest with him. It's part his baby too,not all yours. I understand you want an abortion,but you need to tell him, don't lie about a miscarriage,because you'll regret it and someone somewhere will tell him. Just be honest,it's not hard. It's your body,your decision,not his to make,but you need to be honest with him.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	For a start, yes I can confirm there is such a thing as an 'abortion pill'. You take a pill, it causes the loss of the pregnancy, it's a medical abortion.<br>  For seconds, this is the PREGNANCY section, full of happily pregnant women, and you putitng this in here is insensitive.<br>  Thirdly, you need to be honest with him - lies usually get caught out.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Lying is not a good idea. Why not just have the baby and adopt it out? Being irresponsible is not a good excuse for having an abortion.<br>  <br>  As far as him/her having a bad life, my husband has never met his father and was pretty much abandoned by his mother and he has a wonderful life.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	just tell him you had a miscarriage be crying and you don't have to explain anything. tell him you went to the doctor when you started bleeding and they told you the baby didn't make it.|`|a1uoxczTaa	call up crying and say you had a miscarriage. i would look up what a miscarriage is like first and all that to make sure u got ur facts straight.|`|SQpjHOzVaa	Abortion is not the way to go. There is always adoption. Give the baby a chance at life with parents that can afford the baby. If he is a marine, just explain to him that neither of you are ready to be parents and can't afford the baby but wish for the baby to have a life and talk about adoption. DON'T PUNISH THE BABY FOR YOUR MISTAKE!|`|rwPc39vTaa	the pill works like ur having a miscarriage, u'll be cramping and bleeding for days.. so just skip the pill part and call him saying ur bleeding a lot and think ur miscarrying. <br>  <br>  i'd say think twice, u dont need him in ur life to raise this baby. my bf walked out because he wanted me to get an abortion, SH*T who is he to be telling me what to do with my body?!?! im happily 23 weeks pregnants now with a baby boy coming my way (((: im so excited.|`|1kFyzPUjaa	just tell him that you miscarried, many people do not even tell people that they are pregnant until they are 12 weeks because up until then miscarriage are more frequent.|`|jvTgqdaiaa	you cant take a pill and have an abortion. Your body is going to protect that baby with your life. You could end up hurting yourself.|`|83wa3X0iaa	just tell him there was complications <br>  and make sure ur safe|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Sigh.  You're actually in a really bad section for this: this is for the women who are happy to be pregnant, you may hurt and upset them all.<br>  <br>  But I'm well beyond that, and I've seen enough of life, so of course I'll help.<br>  <br>  What you'll have to do, is take the abortion pill, and then fall off something.  Fall down some stairs, fall off a ladder.  Just organise to fall in some way, not too hard.  then you're not lying.  Youwon't be able to maintain a lie properly because you're scared of him.  Do you see?  You have to be able to tell him, under interrogation, that you fell and then the blood came, and then you went to the doctor.  He'll be watching to see if your irises dilate.  He's a marine for God's sake, you've really screwed up.<br>  <br>  Sorry:  you can do this.  It's awful, it's a shame, but sometimes girls know they really can't have this child, and when we see the abused, unwanted, betrayed children roaming the streets knifing people:  we know that some things need to be done.  The crime wave expected in the nineties, which was increasing in the eighties:  the reason it didn't come was the legalisation of abortion in the seventies.  Suddenly these unwanted children weren't there at that stage of adolescence where they wreak havoc.  it's been proven.<br>  <br>  I have my fingers crossed for you.  All the best.|`|oHWglLZwaa	It is your body, therefore, you make the decisions.<br>  <br>  Abortion is one of the HARDEST decisions you will ever have to make.  So please, think it all the way through!  Adoption is always an option and there are plenty of women who cannot have children (my sister being one of them along with a close friend) that would give their right arm to adopt.  <br>  <br>  To all the people reading this...this is NOT your decision to make.  This person is asking for help, not asking to be ridiculed by other women.  Until you walk a day in this person's shoes, please do not judge.  <br>  <br>  Make the best decision that is rigtht for you, as you are the one that has to live with it for the rest of your life.|`|tfkBHH9eaa	DO NOT GET AN ABORTION. You're gonna regret it so much. It's like killing a person with a gun. You're taking an innocent person't life|`|9Irzj4MCaa	One of the most common misconceptions with women in your situation is that abortion is the only way because if you raised it, it would have a bad life. Life is difficult and bad most of the time, and to kill the baby because of this difficulty is not good. Life is naturally difficult, its not a fluffy, yellow brick road :]<br>       Adoption is always an answer, and it is a wonderful way to let your baby live. There are millions of couples who cannot conceive and they would be so grateful to raise your baby for you. Please, think over all the alternatives before taking that pill, make it your last possible resource. The baby deserves to have a life, it deserves to meet you and smile at you :]
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	You might get a result, if you were pregnant, this early on a very sensitive test.  The most sensitive are teh test strips, and they are unavailable at the stores.  Of course, if you tested now and got a negative, you still might be pregnant.<br>  <br>  You need to understand how pregnancy tests work.  For instance, First Response claims to let you test five days before your period.  However, not every pregnant woman will get a positive five days before their period.  The percentage would go up the closer they got to the day their period was due or beyond, and some might be able to get it six days before their period (or more).<br>  <br>  Try <a href="http://www.PeeOnAStick.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.PeeOnAStick.com</a> to learn more about pregnancy tests and how they work, and which ones are more reliable and most sensitive.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	i have heard that some tests are as sensitive as 12.5 hcg BUT BUT BUT you don't have any hcg until implantation so if you had a really long luteal phase then its possible but not likely.  best to wait until missed perios anyway.. do you really want to know about chemical pregnancies all the time?  its just depressing.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can try a blood test but as far as hpt's the earliest is 5 days.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	No, the odds are you couldn't get a positive that early because the fertilized egg is most likely still implanting.  The earliest you can test is 4 days before your period is due (with an early result test, like Answer).  But you run the risk of getting a false negative.  According to the companies, pregnant women only have about a 60% chance of the test reading positive that early.|`|BaXruEcqaa	no, but there are ones that you can take 5 days before missed period.  So just wait the extra day! lol.
uFrqC4Y2aa	When you go to the doctor they will be able to determine the date you conceived. I would talk to your doctor about that. I've never heard of that happening so soon. Maybe you just have bad circulation.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Sciatica?|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	You should get checked to make sure it isn't an ectopic pregnancy.  What your describing could also be caused by a fibroid.  They are benign growths that some women have and don't even know it.  when you get pregnant and things start to get tight they can hurt.|`|BDWC87FRaa	Could be sciatic nerve but be safe and see a doctor.
hKJIDdVqaa	the first thing I would do would be to run too the first OBGYN for STD tests and send him to a DR too. While at the OBGYN they will provide you with appropriate birth control.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	First off, condoms protect you from STDs as well as pregnancy. Using condoms is extremely important and before a couple stops using them, both people should be tested for STDs.<br>  The pill is 99.9% effective in protecting against pregnancy, it does nothing for diseases. You can go to a Health Clinic for an exam and then they will be able to prescribe you the pill. Depending on your state, if you're under 18, they will need your parents' consent. You will still get your period on they pill. As far as the patch: I tried it and hated it. You wear one patch per week, you can't take it off or move it.|`|0haWIfVMaa	They have a thing called a female condom which you could try, and you can go to a planned parenthood to get on the pill but it requires a trip to the gynecologist, so I don't know if you can pull that off without your parents finding out. Another alternative to the pill is a shot, which is administered once a month.|`|NrH787NZaa	with the patch and bc pills, u get less periods. it affects ur health u should see a doc b5=4 going on one. IF HE HATES CONDOMS, THEN STOP HAVIGN SEX WITH HIM|`|R8bXuLbTaa	Well, I hope you are in a committed relationship because without condoms you are at a much higher risk of contracting std's.<br>  <br>  Anyway, some types of pills will make you miss a period and some do not. It depends on what type/how much hormone is in it. The patch is very high hormone and so is the shot. i dont recommended it. <br>  <br>  You can get them for free confidentially at the local clinic.<br>  <br>  You really should tell your parents though because you may need their support if you should have any bad symptoms from the b/c. <br>  <br>  Its a little awkward but at 16 I told my mom the deal and she took me to the doc to get the pill. Its better to talk about these things|`|hGY08GjRaa	You should get on the pill. COndoms aren't foolproof by themselves.<br>  <br>  The only way to GUARANTEE to prevent pregnancy is to do ALL THREE<br>  <br>  be on the pill (or patch)<br>  Use condoms<br>  Use spermicide (or spermicidal condoms)<br>  <br>  Sorry.. but you can not have everything you want in life, it's better to accept that fact now. I  WANT to make 1000 a day without working, but it ain't gonna happen<br>  <br>  you may WANT to have sex without a condom and not get pregnant or STDS, but the fact is it is NOT safe to have sex without condoms unless you are married and don't mind terribly if you DO get pregnant. That's just the way it is. Only married people who won't be put off by a baby can afford the luxury of having sex without condoms. Deal with it. Both of you. <br>  <br>  How do  you know your b/f has never been with anyone else. Cuz he says so? LOL.. I've known TONS of guys who have lied to their gfs about that. And if he HAS been with anyone else, having sex with him without a condom is like sleeping with all of his past partners.. and all of THEIR partners.. NOT SAFE<br>  <br>  You can try the female condom instead.. <br>  <br>  Oh, "the patch" has the same hormones as "the pill"  it's the same thing, does the same thing. Only, instead of taking a pill every day, you put the patch on and only have to change it once a week, and wear no patch 1 week per month (which is when you have your period).. It's more convenient in alot of ways. My friend (married) likes it.<br>  <br>  With the pill, yes, you get your period because one week a month you take "sugar pills" They look similar to the ones you take the reset of the time (except the color) but they do nothing. The purpose is for you to have your period, but to have a pill to take so you take a  pill every day.. the habit lessens the chance of you forgetting..<br>  <br>  I take the pill, but it's for hormone replacement therapy, as my body doesn't make the proper hormones. I've had no problem with it, and I haven't bothered with the patch or anything because I have to take another pill once a day anyway, so I just take both at the same time.  I take it first thing in the morning, after I get up, go potty, and weigh myself.  The trick to not forgetting is routine. Keep them by your bed and bring a glass of water to bed each night and just make a habit of taking it last thing before you turn  your lights out.. or first thing when you wake up.. something..|`|veeC7Rvvaa	You both need to be tested for STI's before ditching the condom unless you're 101% that you were both virgins when you started doing it and that you've never slept with anyone else ever.<br>  <br>  On the pill, you still get your period though it will be a bit mad and irregular for the first couple of months, and you need to be at least 2 weeks on it before you ditch the condom.<br>  <br>  ''Contraceptive patch<br>  Over 99% effective. A small patch (flesh coloured) is stuck on the skin (by yourself), once a week for 3 weeks, and then you have a break for 1 week before starting again. It contains the 2 hormones oestrogen and progestogen and works like the pill ''<br>  <br>  If you're in the UK go to a GUM, they treat young people and they don't tell your GP nor your parents as its all confidential and annonymous. They can give you free contraception and they will respect you for wanting to know the right info and taking responsibility over your body..<br>  believe me, you do not want to get pregnant because abortion is horrible and traumatic!! also, its easier for the guy to say that he'll be there but it's your body that will be stuck with a baby.|`|sIv9gaolaa	The pill is good if you can remember to take it. There are many versions of the pill, some you will still have a period, some you will have no periods and some you will have irregular bleeding. You can get it from your GP or local family planning clinic and it's free. Don't know much about a patch but you can have an injection, implant in your arm or coil in your uterus. You should make an appointment with your GP or family planning doctor (and it's completely confidential) and discuss with them what contraceptive suits you best. If you are definitely ditching the condoms please have an STI test done, and make sure your boyfriend does too! It's just a urine sample so nothing too bad.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	you can take the depo that's every 3 months its $100 each shot and u dont get your period at all . you go to your doc and they give u kind of like a prescription to go buy it at the pharmacy and u take it back to them and they put it in you and that's it. other than that i'd say take yaz it gives you shorter light periods. maybe your local health clinic can help you out without them finding out|`|TJrRPIFLaa	The pill sucks, in my opinion.  I took it for a year and it gave me wicked headaches (I'm not a headache person).  It also made it hard for me to sleep.  You get your period on schedule with most of them I think.  Your boyfriend should grow up about condoms though.  For my husband and I right now, it is our only option because I can't take anything with stupid hormones in it.|`|ZxmyAQZvaa	Ok if you and your boyfriend go to the doctor and ask to be put on the pill then they might give  it.  You take the pill for three weeks in a row then stop it for a week which will make you have our period then start the pill again after that week.  The pill is free from the doctors.|`|YaC0mpXPaa	you can get a shot every 3 months called depo. Thats what I'm on and i have about one period very light during each 3 month cycle. its quick painless (in the butt) and you only have to think about it 4 times a year.|`|qY9svA3taa	Abstinence. You are too young for sex.<br>  <br>  When you get pregnant and get kicked out of your parent's house, don't go crying about it!|`|r8hBvWEQaa	Tell him to go on the man pill. There are many things men can do to stop you getting pregnant. I bet you one trillion % that he will point blank refuse to do this, as he just wants you to do it all. <br>  <br>  You'll have to go on the pill.<br>  or the injection. Google it.<br>  <br>  The pill is great. It's all on google so i don't want to right it all out. I loved being on the pill (medical reasons, i dont know about pregnancy etc as i didnt use it for that) <br>  <br>  Injecton SUCKS don't go for that. I HAAATE it with a passion i've been bleeding constantly on it.|`|twft9R3Yaa	There's several different things you can do. Yes there is the patch that you can wear but it's really finicky about when you put it on and it stays on you for pretty much the month. Yes you still have a period. It's side affect and this is the same side effect you'll have with the pill is your sex drive will significantly decrease. I'm speaking from personal experience. There's also spermicide strips that you can get which work pretty well, but are not guaranteed to be as effective as a condom or birth control if I remember correctly. You should be able to go to a clinic and get birth control without your parents, you just need to find one in your city. Only the condom is going to protect you from diseases, and I recommend using 2 different forms of birth control.|`|Qtgrx3Ywaa	The pill does not stop your period (unless you get one that specifically does something like that).  However, if you are underage, the only way to get the pill is through your doctor and I believe your parent(s) have to sign off on the prescription.  If you really feel uncomfortable using condoms and want to continue having sex, tell your parents (your mom would probably be best), and say that you're periods have been really heavy and painful.<br>  <br>  The pill is used to help alleviate heavy periods, as well as prevent pregnancy.|`|n3wTiKFqaa	You take the pill for 21 days then you are off for 7 days. In the 7 days you have your period. I'm not sure if you live in America, but here in England you go to your GP to get it. Alternatively you can go to a family planning clinic.<br>  There are lots of other methods of contraception too, you can talk to your doctor to see what is best for you. <br>  Also, you don't mention how old you are, but could you definitely not talk to your mum about it? Mine provided lots of help and even came to the doctor with me to get the pill. <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|wxTg0Qy3aa	I'm on the pill. it's pretty convenient. you still do get your period on the pill but it does lessen the length of it and the flow.  one thing I love is that I know exactly when I'll get my period.  I've been on it for about 7 years now and I don't have any kids, so it's working.<br>  <br>  you can get it from planned parenthood. if you go to college, you can also probably get it from your health center.|`|1dNBZFPbaa	I've never tried the patch, but I was on the pill for a while.<br>  <br>  You do still get your period while you're on the pill (in fact, some people take the pill just to regulate their cycle). I'm not sure what the cost is exactly, I live in Canada and other than the last two or three dollars it's always been completely covered. But I don't think it's that expensive to start with. Good luck!|`|wEfjE2uPaa	I use the pill and it works good.  You just have to remember to take it everyday (at the same exact time everyday.  I take it at 5:00).  You get your period the same time each month and you know exactly when your going to get it (there are 3 different sets of colors of pills to take).  It works well with me.  Maybe you should try the depo shot.  Its a shot you take every 3 months.  Simple as that.  Or you can try the nuva ring.  It's a ring you put in your vagina.  You replace once a month.  Call your local planned parenthood.  You may be qualified to get birthcontrol for free.  And your parents don't have to know. =)|`|h3jGPrAHaa	Go on the birth control pills.  I've been on them for five years and they are great.  They regulated my periods, cleared out my skin and since they have the mild diuretic ingredients, they actually keep you slim.  I used Yasmin birth control and its the best out there.  <br>  <br>  Trust me.  I've taken several birth control pills and patches and all of them had horrible side effects.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	Even if you take the pill you can become pregnant. And yes, you get your period when you're on or off of the p ill after. You can go to a Planned Parenthood, if you have one around where you live. And if You're younger than 18 you get it for free.|`|a8tCObqraa	hi my name is stacey and i'm 14 take a look at these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/contr_index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.contraception.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.contraception.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.brook.org.uk/content/M2_1_Contraception.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.brook.org.uk/content/M2_1_Con...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.avert.org/cpills.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avert.org/cpills.htm</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps good luck x|`|RMaEeZssaa	You could see your doctor and go on the pill but seriously your better off and safer with the condoms, not just against pregnancies but sti's|`|9mw2AY97aa	Consult your doctor. There are injections and pills about but may have side effects.|`|9sUsqvzHaa	you should stop doing the nasty|`|M3x0quJsaa	get the implant<br>  lovely times<br>  they will never know unless they feel your arm|`|23F70N1Raa	Well, for now you will need to keep with the condoms.  You will need to be on the pill for a month before it begins to work.  You can go to Planned Parenthood and I think that they keep everything private as a way to help young people be safe (with out their parents).  I think this depends on how young you really are.<br>  <br>  Yes you will get your normal cycle every month... it may be lighter and you may spot for a while in between until you are regulated.  It should also help you with acne (especially in the teen years).  <br>  <br>  As far as the patch, this is something you need to place on your body, your parents may see it and you will always be aware of it.  Also, I had tried it and was alergic to the adhesive (I never had these problems before).<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is give your local planned parenthood a call and see what they can do for you.  If nothing else, while you are searching for a solution... they can give you free condoms.  Just be aware that you are only preventing pregnancy not STDs on this form of contraception so please make sure that you are tested often if you choose not to use condoms.  <br>  <br>  I support you for being open, honest and wanting to be safe.  If you need any more info on condoms or the pill please feel free to e-mail me.  You can also research different "pills" on the internet to find out a little more about them and what they do to your body.  For example if you have phlibitis (blood clotting... I got it at a young age because of an accident) you can not take them or if you are a smoker, this will increase your risk for other issues down the line.<br>  <br>  Good luck... and be safe!|`|ld14iRCeaa	first off, every time you have sex with someone you have sex with every sexual partner they have had. especially when there is no condom. so unless you two were virgins when you met, you are sharing everything. i hope you two are openly talking about sex both the sexual history you have had and the sex you have now. and sorry, but not to many people like condoms, its just what we intelligent people use to avoid pregnancy and stds. No matter how uncomfortable it is, unless you are married and plan to stay with that person forever, you should wrap it up. Besides it does not matter what form of birth control you use, condoms or pills, NOT one of them is 100% effective. so do the healthy thing and use condoms.....and as a side note, there are stds that men can carry having no idea they even have them, you need to be mature and make the right choices. i thought woman were finally getting smarter about this stuff??!!<br>  <br>  have you tried other condom brands, they have thinner condoms that are suppose to feel more real, there is so many other options to just going with out.|`|nvHAjQzkaa	oh, wow.  don't they have sex ed at your school?  it's a bit distressing how much you have to learn, but it's GOOD that you're asking.<br>  <br>  first of all, a condom is your BEST BET (actually, it's the only option) for preventing STDs(sexually transmitted diseases)<br>  <br>  the pill is good for monogamous relationships when you are 100% that your partner is not cheating on you and has no STDs.  You have to take it every day, and you DO get a period, but it's typically a lighter period with less cramps.  Some women use pills to delay their periods.  This can be done in a couple of different ways.  <br>  <br>  The patch works the same as the pill (it has the same effects) but you don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill every day...and I don't think you can manipulate the timing of your period with it either.|`|9rr76rQkaa	Really, really, really reconsider condoms.  They're the best protection, other than abstinence, and the only protection that's proven to protect against both STD's and pregnancy.  It's the safest for both of you.<br>  <br>  But if you can't stand the thought of condoms, the pill is a good option.  No, if you get the right pill it will not negatively affect your period.  Again, depending on the pill, you can chose to get your period every month or every four months.  Both Yaz and Yasmin will keep you regular and only make your periods shorter and lighter.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, there's the Nuva Ring (you may have seen them in the "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday" commercials) that's very affective.  There are also IUDs, like Mirena that are equally affective.  <br>  <br>  Always talk to your doctor before starting birth control of any sort.  They can help you chose what's right for you and tell you accurate prices or if your insurance covers your method.  Yes, this means you're going to have to talk to your parents.  If you REALLY don't want to tell them you're having sex, tell them you were looking at the pill to control your acne or to relieve pain from your period.<br>  <br>  Stay safe!|`|HqyRYdCoaa	1 do not use the patch.  It causes blood clots and is dangerous.<br>  #2 If you're not 18 yet, then there is NO WAY to get contraception, other than condoms and spermicide, without your parents consent.  If you're under 18 and you don't want your parents to find out you're having sex, then you are taking a lot of risks, because Condoms alone are NOT 100% effective. <br>  <br>  DO NOT have unprotected sex because your boyfriend doesn't like condoms.  90% of women having unprotected sex get pregnant within one year.  If you are under 18, you CANNOT get the PLAN B pill without a prescription.<br>  <br>  As for the types of pills: There are three basic kinds, on some, you get your period once a month like normal, but for shorter time and with fewer PMS symptoms.  Others allow you to have your period 3-4 times a year (called seasonique pill) and the third kind eliminates your period all together.  <br>  <br>  Risks of the pill include high blood pressure, decreased sex drive, and bleeding and spotting, <br>  <br>  The pill IS NOT 100% effective and needs to be taken at the SAME TIME every day.  <br>  <br>  You should STILL USE a condom on the pill to prevent STDs and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  AGAIN, if you are under 18, you CANNOT get the, even from planned parenthood, without parental permission.  You should not be having sex without your parents knowing, it is risky and dangerous.<br>  <br>  check out these websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.healthywomen.org/healthtopics/birthcontrolpills" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthywomen.org/healthtopics...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a>

That is one of the worse names i have ever heard!|`|M9M6nTZeaa	We named our son Logan, as per thinking about wolverine on X-men. We were both secretly comic book nerds when we were younger ;)|`|bMyq2nOTaa	No, but people think I named my son after Julian Lennon... I didn't. I just liked the name 'Julian,' when I saw the movie 'Less Than Zero.' :)<br>  <br>  If I'd had a boy, this last time, I would have named him after a celeb fave of mine, who passed away, last year... I would have used his last name, for my sons' first or middle name.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	My son's name is Tristan and everyone thought I named him after Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall....didn't even see the movie until after he was born!  It didn't help that his middle name is Tyler and Brad Pitt's character in Fight Club!

I didn't name her AFTER Audrey Hepburn but when considering any name, you should look at famous people or mean nicknames that might come from the name. Anyone named Mariah people automatically think Carey...anyone named Mona people automatically think, Lisa for example.  I decided on Audrey because the only famous person I know with that name was about as classy as you can get. Also, it's not overused (like everyone her generation will have the name "Grace" or "Aiden" :D|`|OXrPEa3Yaa	Yes i named my first kid Shrek and my second kid Pluto
RT8LZy7gaa	Consult your OB/GYN first to see how detrimental it would be to carry the baby full term.  There's always adoption if you talk to your boyfriend and you and he decide that another child at this time would not work.  If it's too physically overwhelming, abortion may be your only option.<br>  <br>  If the OB says it could harm you than an abortion may be your only choice as well. Also, if you were on birth control, there could be birth defects.<br>  <br>  Make a medically informed decision as well as a heart felt one.  No, I'm not pro life OR pro choice and I won't be preachy.  Just some ideas for you to consider.  But make sure to explain it all to your bf and see what he says. It is his child as well.  He may offer to help out more, etc. in order for you to carry it full term then give it to a childless couple if that's what the two of you decide.|`|1kLCl7snaa	Just my personal opinion... but i do not believe in abortion, mainly because I know that there are many family's out there that can not have children, maybe adoption would be a good option for you to consider. I would talk to your boyfriend before you make any decisions. I can understand how you are feeling.|`|KVEGzknvaa	If you doubt the readiness of your body for a pregnancy, it would be in the best interests for yourself and the fetus to abort.  If you wait, you risk complications that could put a further-term fetus and yourself in danger.|`|e9DOgGSAaa	i know its not easy to make a choice like that. i would have a abortion. your right about your body, and you have to be able to take care of the two you already have.<br>  <br>  congrats on the twins and good luck in school|`|9ASrrw7paa	Before you abort...speak with your doctor. No one knows how your body works. My dad was  2 months before my grandma became pregnant with my aunt (everything went well). Please go visit your Oby. You don't want to regret getting rid of your baby. If birth control doesn't work, get the shot or the oval ring. <br>  <br>  P.S I'm not judging, just dont make a mistake..Take care of those sweet twins ok...stay bless|`|rMEJI8u5aa	Well... personally I would abort... your health isn't up for having another child...pregnancy is hard on your body.<br>  <br>  Talk to your boyfriend though. Figure things out together and I wish you luck.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Dont have an abortion. My daughter was 5 months old and I got pregnant again...I was also 19 but doing it all alone. I decided to have an abortion and it was the worst mistake Ive ever made. It is something very hard emotionally and no matter how much time passes you will feel guilty. Its been about 3 years and am now pregnant again. I will definately be keeping this baby but I am so paranoid that something will happen. And a few months ago I was more than likely pregnant and miscarried. So I would think about it and consider adoption instead.|`|AA11220327	i got pregnant with my son when my daughter was 5 months old. It is do-able, but not always easy. However I never had twins, so I am not sure how different the toll it takes on your body is than a single birth. I was also married, done with all schooling and had established my career, so i did have a little more time than you have. It does sound like your life is very busy, but i think that the best thing to do at this point would be to talk about it with your bf and decide together what is the best thing for you both to do, and what is best for your family.
uuHPneEcaa	she could be stressed. stress can cause u to miss ur period.<br>  the doctor gave her a pregnancy test and it was negative so its negative. and plus she is on the pill and the only way she could get pregnant while on the pill is if she is takin a meds that can affect the pill <br>  <br>  after my father died i didn't have a period for 3 months. the cause of that was because i was stressed out.|`|46K4FtE0aa	It could be stress, or could be that her hormones are slow to build up. Did the doctor only take a urine pregnancy test, if so ask for a pregnancy blood test, as urine tests rely on the hormones in your urine being a certain level, to show positive, if your hormones fall a fraction below the required level it will show negative even if she is  pregnant. It is also important to use the first urine you pass when you wake up in the morning, as the hormones in the urine get diluted as the day goes on and you drink fluids. I would get her to ask the doctor to take a blood test, that should show if there are any pregnancy hormones present. My daughter only used urine tests from the chemist and the doctor, she only got a positive when she was 4 months pregnant, because her hormones were slow to build up, this also happened with her second pregnancy.|`|stRWElvPaa	has she put on weight or lost a lot of weight? that can make your periods go haywire. <br>   Also, does she have some acne, excess fat around stomach, excess hair on face and body? these as well as missed periods are a sign of pcos.<br>    If nothing has changed, I would ask the doctor for a blood test. Or at least investigate further.<br>    Also, has she been very stressed lately? this can throw off a period as well.|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	Sometimes birth control can cause you to not have a period. why didn't she ask the doctor? thats something only theu can really answer.

If she's really worried, then she should talk to her doctor.|`|jvTgqdaiaa	sometimes birth control will make you miss a period.|`|1dNBZFPbaa	Stress might cause her to miss her period.. or if she's lost / gained a bunch of weight, that could do it too.|`|3F4nCjyEaa	Stress It can cause her to miss it|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	It could be stress. I would have her take a blood test to make sure she is not pregnant because if she was the pills could have a very bad affect but i doubt she is if she is good at taking her pill every day on time.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	When I was pregnant I would go by this. Take your due date (mine was June 24th). Go back a month (May 24th) and that is when you are 8 months pregnant. April 24th I was 7 months pregnant. You really cant divide by 4 because there are 52 weeks in a year divided by 4 weeks in a month and you get 13 (52weeks in a year/4 weeks = 13 months). Everyone knows there are 12 months in a year so you cant go by the whole 4 weeks thing. Just do it by your due date to be more accurate.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You're "in" your 6th month...congrats!!!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	There are more than 4 weeks and 2-3 days in a month.

FgAPXhVRaa	Congrats you are pregnant!!! I would talk to your parents at this point! Make an appointment for the doctor and decide what you want to do, then tell the baby's father. Personally I would not say anything to him till you know for sure that you are pregnant and talk to him about what you have decided what he wants to do. Remember it's your choice. When my ex told me to choose him or the baby... well that is why he is my ex and we don't talk unless we have to. Anyway, I wish you and your little one the best of luck!!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Your pregnant...you can get false negative but false positive are very rare. Try talking to your mom about it...dont get an abortion you will regrett it consider keeping the baby or maybe adoption.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i would consult with a doctor and have them do a pregnancy test.  usually with home pregnancy test u get ur best resualt with ur 1st morning pee..

There are free clinics if you don't want to tell your parents, but eventually they will find out, so the safest thing to do, is sit your parents down, talk to them, and tell them you need to see a doctor. All the things you listed makes it seem you ARE pregnant, and being so is a BIG responsibility. Talk to your parents. Go to the doctor, and BE SAFE. Good luck!|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	ur pregnant|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Get a blood test done...that will eliminate any doubt either way.|`|teptsmeKaa	There is rarely a false positive, but there can easily be a false negative if the test was improperly taken, or it just didn't pick up on it.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to go to the doctor to get a pregnancy blood test, which is never wrong.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Some pregnancy tests are more sensitive than others and sometimes, depending on how high your hcg is, a test won't test positive unless you use your first morning urine.  Getting a false negative is fairly common, but getting a false positive is not.  I would say you're pregnant hun.  You need to talk to your mom about what's going on or go into Planned Parenthood or a Crisis Pregnancy Center and talk with them.  They can help you figure out what's going on and have some great resources to help you figure out what to do next.   Good luck!  (((hugs)))|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I have heard of false negatives but false positives are very rare.  Usually if you get a positive you are pregnant or there is something wrong with your HCG levels that you need to get checked out.  I would speak with your mother if you can or go see your pediatrician or your OBGYN if you have one.|`|AA10693194	if you had a positive test then you are pregnant. you have to have an hcg level in your body for a test to be positive.you only have an hcg level during pregnancy :)|`|Brqd1YcDaa	you might need to talk to your mom, so you can go get a blood test. and if it is negative get on birth control pills. and if it is positive be the best parent that you can be.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Your pregnant hun.

But the best thing for you to do is to go to your doctor's office or planned parenthood. Trust me, I know how you feel. Two said no, three said yes, and the last one didn't end work. (But that was because my mom had it from a long time ago.) And if all fails, just talk to your parents.|`|dKTPewhTaa	Go to a doctor or the public health clinic.  Stress sometimes delays your period.  But if you want to know for certain, make an appointment with the doctor or wait for another month.  But if you think you are pregnant, you need to start getting prenatal care.  Good luck.|`|1kLCl7snaa	HCG is the only way a test can be positive. However, testing at different times of day can result in the negative tests.

Yes, I don't play soccer, but obviously, you have got some nerve just randomly criticizing other people's advice.

hgaNxhoaaa	Your son needs to be placed in a different classroom and the teacher's behavior needs to be reported to the principal and/or the school board. If your child has no history of bad behavior, this teacher has something against him and is not going to let it go.<br>  <br>  Her behavior is totally inappropriate--you have already put your child in counseling and she has no right to threaten you with social services simply because you won't put your son on meds.<br>  <br>  The only thing that should stop you from switching is if your son has had some sort of emotional trauma this school year that may be causing him to act differently in school. If there is nothing you know of and nothing he can think of, you would do best to resolve this problem as soon as possible, for your son's well-being and also your own.<br>  <br>  If you have a mediated meeting with the principal, you should be able to straighten things out. If you want to give the teacher the benefit of the doubt, request a mediated meeting with her and the principal to hash it all out. <br>  <br>  If she still insists that your son needs meds, even with no evidence of this behavior ever happening before, make the switch. No one should tell you that your child needs medication when there's no history! There are enough children on uneccessary meds as it is.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|cg7MKVf1aa	Ok first grab your kid get him another teacher if the other teacher calls you like this then talk to your son tell him whats up. But if the other teacher likes him i suggest reporting her!! Good Luck!|`|FfNjsqGvaa	My daughter's teacher tried having my daughter diagnosed with something. I not only refused to put her into counselling, but I told the teacher that I have no such issues at home and that the doctor said she was fine so stop coming to me with your concerns. I talked to the principle, but she just stood behind her staff and acted like this teacher was 'just amazing'. If you have the option of switching, than go for it. We are in a small town and there are no other options. Anyway I made a huge stink about how this teacher is such a disappointment compared to her other teachers and I went on about how her classroom felt unwelcoming to me, as a parent, and such (I couldn't come to her with my daughter's concerns because she just contradicts them and makes me feel foolish for coming to her). I didn't think that I was THAT hard on her, I thought that is she was blunt and harsh with the kids, than she would respond well to other people speaking their mind with her.... but apparently she can dish it out, but not take it. Apparently put the teacher into tears (so the principle told me when she called to tell me that I should not have been so hard on the teacher). Since that day I have not seen nor heard from the teacher. I have carefully watched my daughter's grades to make sure that the teacher did not mark her lower because of the conflicts and she did not, so I have not spoken to her since. Parent teacher interviews should be interesting though, lol.|`|SsZfWYcwaa	Does the counselor says he needs to be on meds? Have you talked to his regular doctor? If the counselor and his doctor both say no to med s the teacher can call social services and you can fight it with written notes from the counselor and the doctor. Have you ever considered calling social services on the teacher? You also need to call the principal. If the principal will not move the child to another class then you need to call the super. You need to be more vocal in trying to solve this problem. Social services will respect you more if you contact them and ask what to do before the teacher calls and blows things way out of whack. Some teachers shouldn't be teaching. Are you sure she is only doing this to your son? maybe she has a problem with other students as well. Call someone and do something and if no one other then the teacher says meds for your child then get it in writing and show her that she is nuts and the ppl who write RX say no. AND REPORT all of this to the principal, the school board, the Dr's, the counselor, and social services before it gets out of hand|`|zoD71BuKaa	I was not even aware that second graders had detention. I DEFINITELY think you should ask for a parent teacher conference, and possibly contact the principal or guidance counselor to sit in. Also, maybe you could have his first grade teacher sit on the conference... You could also maybe ask his first grade teacher for her take on his second grade teacher... Maybe she has a history... Maybe she is just impatient and in the wrong profession. It is not a teacher's job to diagnose her students with ADHD or anything else. That is a doctor's job. Also, he is a second-grade boy!!! Most normal boys are active and have a short attention span. I really think you should take this to a higher level, such as principal, and even though the school year is almost over, I definitely think it would be in your son's best interest to be moved to a different classroom. If the new teacher makes the same observations, maybe look INTO having him TESTED for ADD, but I don't think it will be a problem once he is moved. :) Best of luck, I'm sorry you have to deal with a teacher on such a terror against your son. Kind of gives the rest of us teachers a bad name when someone is in the wrong profession, you know?|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I'm sorry that your son has gotten a teacher that isn't helping him with his problems  but instead is punishing him and treating him like it's his fault.  She should be a teacher with older students not 7-8 year olds.  I would contact your child study team, you can call your principal, and see if you can get a study done to see if he has ADD or ADHD.  If he does, he doesn't necessary need medication, but the teacher won't be able to treat him as she is.  He will be pulled out for certain things or maybe he will be eligible for an aid.  I would speak to the teacher and ask for a conference with you and the principal to get down to the problem.  Good Luck|`|CxCigxZIaa	Ok first of all I can't STAND teachers that try to say our children need to be on MEDS just because they might be a bit 'more' active than the others in class! <br>  WHAT does his counselor say about him? <br>  This happened to me in kindergarten. My son's kindergarten teacher said, "take him to the Dr. and tell him that he is HYPER to the highest end." Well...I did take him to the Dr. and the Dr. said, "your son is a very active, normal 5 year old boy." I went back to the school and let the teacher know what the Dr. had said and also that the Dr. had NO CLUE what "hyper to the highest end" was. As I was standing there talking to her I see a young boy walk in (like a zoombie) holding a book and telling his teacher (the one I was talking to) that he forgot to put it back (very monotone voice). She smiled and said, "thank you"<br>  I then turned to her and ask her, "what medication did you recommend for him???????" She didn't smile after that. I then let her know that his DR. told us that he was normal, so she needed to find someone else to try to get medicated! Period.<br>  <br>  First step you need to do is to request a meeting with his teacher, the principal, (now the principal normally sides with the teacher) behavior specialist if one is on staff at this school, guidance counselor as well, AND the counselor that your son is seeing. <br>  <br>  Find out WHY your son is "acting out" and getting detention. There is a reason..it's not just because he enjoys detention. Sounds to me like she is trying to bully him and that's simple UN CALLED for.<br>  <br>  Make sure you bring up the THREATS that this teacher has told you. Social services especially. That can be very serious. <br>  <br>  Let us know how your meeting goes.<br>  Wishing you the best.|`|AA11104649	Maybe the teacher has a point? Maybe your son doesn't like the teacher and misbehaves in that class?<br>  I don't know.<br>  What I do know is that people don't go in to teaching because they dislike people - they do it because they care and want to help.<br>  So maybe you should listen to the teacher? What about getting a second opinion? Like you say - it could be a clash of personalities.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	see if you can get him into another room. let the principal know what is going on and you want to switch him to another class.|`|OLHiZ045aa	You need to go and speak to the head - sharpish.|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	Have a meeting with the Principal.  If the counselor says the kid doesn't need meds and that something is happening in the classroom that shouldn't, ask the counselor to join the meeting.  <br>  <br>  I would also ask if it's possible for you to observe the class without your son knowing.  ie standing outside the room and looking through a window in the door, etc.  <br>  <br>  If the counselor agrees with the teacher, do whatever is needed to get your son to not disrupt school.  <br>  <br>  It could be the teacher, but it could also be that your son really is disruptive.  The further along in school, the less activities happen that mask disruptive behaviors and the more sitting at a desk happens.
PeOCqztoaa	Sounds like he's testing his limits with you. Try getting down on his level and tell him face to face what you would like him to do.

My kids were doing the same thing until their father told them that they had to listen to me as much as they did him. That seemed to help.|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	I guess my question is... why do you repeat yourself?<br>  <br>  If he knows that nothing is going to come from his ignoring you other than you sounding like a broken record, why should he listen to you?<br>  <br>  Say it once. If he doesn't do what you tell him, there needs to be a consequence.

So don't say it! <br>  If you say things clearly and explain the consequences of not doing it then follow through - every time. By not following through people teach their children that they don't mean what they say and then the child plays up because they know they can!<br>  So the parent may say - 'don't do that, or I'll throw your toy in the bin' then the child does it and the parent throws the toy away (but can't bear to part with it, as it was expensive) and so gets it out of the bin a day later - child thinks - 'I can do what I want - they'll give it back in a day!'<br>  The other thing I would suggest is have you thought about a good quality fish oil supplement. After two weeks I have seen a remarkable change in children - so much so that I take it myself now -- its not cheap but its really worth it. There are several brands, but it has to be a high dose one - the one I have is on the link, and an article to explain how it works in the brain. (and that other fats will take  up its space if not supplied and this can cause problems)<br>  Don't forget to take a prenatal dose yourself for you new babys brain!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that it's not working out well. I can only guess that your child's behaviour is due to anger and resentment over your family's situation. I wouldn't be surprised if she hates your current partner or even trys to blame the break up of your previous partner on you.<br>  <br>  I know how frustrating it can be, as i've been in your shoes, however you must remember that you shouldn't let her get you over the edge.<br>  <br>  I think she feels threatened and does it for attention. Try to spend 1 on 1 time with her doing girly stuff like painting nails or restyling your hair, and whenever she misbehaves, act like the supernanny advises and completly ignore her while firmly and briefly ordering he to go to a certain corner of a room where there aren't many distractions or toys, but explain to her before the next fit happens that this is where she will stay for 9 minutes, each minute to the years in her age.<br>  <br>  Give her responsibilities and award her for any progress, such as cleaning her teeth or doing her homework or simply dressing her self.. some parents still do it all for their children at 12 !!<br>  let her have a role, and maybe let her earn a pocket money through doing tasks.. keep her busy with clubs and activities, somewhere to run and play to vent all this anger in her !<br>  Also, try to involve your past and current partner some way or the other because men come and go, but you're her mom and you're the only one she's got in the world.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and stay strong! I recommend watching supper nanny episodes online on channel 4 website
E7MgO2pZaa	I agree with Independant.<br>  <br>  Most kids with myspace tend to add anyone who friend requests them because they want to have a huge number of friends.<br>  <br>  Tell her your whole story. Just tell her that you are searching for your daughter, you know it's confusing, and that you will answer any questions she has.<br>  <br>  My sister's fmom found her by emailing her on myspace. She sent a simple letter that said she was looking for her daughter and the resemblance was too close too ignore.|`|rTtIKOmpaa	Wow what a story! It seems very likely that she has no idea about you. If your letters were getting returned that could be because the parents instructed the social worker to do so.<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd ask her a few personal questions like about her family and see if she opens up to you. try and get to the question of her being adopted. She really may have no clue and I don't know if you want to open that can of worms...|`|y0DYwomYaa	i really dont think she knows she was adopted, and as a teenager i would find it creepy if a raondom person was talking to me, i would try getting in contact with the parents... talk with them first .. you did give her up for adoption, and it might not be a bad thing, but dont go tlling her and freaking her out, you new to her, try your hardest to speak with the parwents before you go telling her, you dont want her to feel alone, or given up...|`|JPBh5WT3aa	Whoever gave you advice to go through the adoptive parents to talk to your daughter.....don't listen!  Clearly, they have rejected your attempts at openness by returning your letters.  Plus, your daughter is old enough to make choices for herself.<br>  <br>  I think your daughter knows who you are, but doesn't want to go out on a limb until she is sure.  She has probably fantasized about you for so long that she is afraid that this could also be a dream.  <br>  <br>  I think you should send her an email and tell her who you are, then leave the ball in her court.  Don't make it heavy, just gently let her know who you are and that you always thought about her.  <br>  <br>  Let her make the choices from that point on, as she has not had any choice in the adoption to begin with.  Best of luck!  How exciting for you both!|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	"Does she know? I know for sure it is her now because she put her birthdate on her profile. Should I say something about it, do you thinks she knows & is not ready?"<br>  <br>  <br>  ? ? ?.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tell her your entire story and that your searching for your daughter.  If there is any doubt she is not your daughter tread lightly.<br>  <br>  She may not know.....kids like to build up as many friends on Myspace as possible.....its a popularity thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have met the Aps of your child then describe them to her. Give her as much details as possible. <br>  <br>  <br>  I think you should let her get to know you with pictures etc. before telling her so that she at least has an idea of who/what you are like.
90zcKChJaa	You need to see doctor. There is something going on.|`|dSSFrYUxaa	Go to the health clinic then and get a blood test yes i have met people where the pregnancy hasn't show up on pee tests|`|DHGrfdBWaa	If you can't afford to go to the doctor you can go visit your local planned parenthood.  It's completely confidential and they do pregnancy and std tests for free.  They also offer pregnancy care and birth control if it turns out you're not pregnant.|`|dR2bqUixaa	Schedule a doctors appointment and get a blood test.|`|zREDczgjaa	Get a blood test..
PeOCqztoaa	The toddler formula is fine. The transition to milk is sometimes difficult for them. It tastes completely different. I would use the toddler formula until he is 2 then start adding a little bit of the milk to his formula in very small amounts and then gradually increasing them each week. Our daughter drank soy formula then soy milk and it was very hard to get her to drink regular milk. I still have to add a little bit of vanilla milk to her regular milk. A gradual switch works best.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	There is nothing wrong with toddler formula. If you want to pay for it that is your choice.<br>  <br>  Your child needs the calcium from somewhere and at least with toddler formula you don't have to worry when your child is a picky eater.<br>  <br>  You are the parent. Do what you feel is right.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	First of all, one miserable day does not mean it will not work. It may take many miserable days before your child makes the total switch. That being said, as the other write indicated, if you are willing to spend the extra money, that is your choice. It just is not necessary.<br>  <br>  You will find that many changes that are necessary for your child are not easy. But don't give up! As parents, we have to work through it. I always love the parents that allow their kids to pick and choose what they eat as if they will starve. Believe me, it is against nature for a childto starve oneself. If you provide regular milk steadily, he will get thirsty. All of us need to remember that we are the adults and the children............they need to learn! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck, I understand it can be stressful.|`|i8NOVfm0aa	i never had my daughter on formula she was breastfed but i did just wean her to whole milk and she hated it at first. try mixing 1/4 whole milk with the formula.. do it week by week, next time put 1/2 milk.. then the next week 3/4 and hopefully he will adapt. My doctor always seems like they just want to "re adjust" something and it drives me crazy because they are always wrong. but if the milk thing doesnt work out keep him on it... good luck!|`|FTFd3AQAaa	i dont see anyhing wrong with it, my ped did try to get us to switch to whole milk when my son turned 1 and i just ignored her, we have since switched him (he's 19 months now) but the main factor behind that decision was we had twins so we were trying to cut down on the formula expense.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You ar supposed to start doing the mixture like at 10 months so that they get used to it. Just keep offering it to him. Quit giving him the formula. Eventually he will take the milk if he's thirsty enough.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	Just because he's a doctor doesn't mean he knows everything there is to know. His opinion is just that, an opinion. Go with your child's needs first.|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	The reason this formula was made, was to continue being beneficial for those children no longer or not ever breastfed. The reason being that breastmilk changes his nutritional contents for the growing child while formula does not. For you to give your child the second stage of formula is optimal. You might also be wondering if your doctor is against breastfeeding past the first year!! Honestly, since i had to stop breastfeeding my first prior to a year, I also chose to go the second stage route with formula, and have since breastfed my second child past one year as well. Doctors might have more knowledge than the everyday citizen about overall health, but he does not always have the absolute best opinion on every matter when it comes to your baby that you see more often than he does!!|`|6ZjoX2Akaa	Yes the formula has more nutrients but they also are in business to make money. The longer parents keep kids of formula the more money they make. Both my kids hated milk at first. But they got used to it. Try warming it up a little bit and remember you don't have to go by what the doctor says or the books. You are the parent.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Could you maybe give him an ounce of whole milk in his formula and slowly start to add more each week until he's entirely on whole milk?  If you transition him slowly he probably wont even notice the change. I bet he will start to like the whole milk too, formula tastes pretty bad. But that's what he's used to so he doesn't know any better. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|uxItOSkmaa	It's just not the norm to continue using formula after age one.  There's nothing wrong with it though.<br>  <br>  Do you heat your son's formula?  He might need the whole milk heated too and slowly tuned down to cold.  My son refused cold milk at first and would only drink it from a straw sippy cup once he began to like it cold.  You just have to keep trying things until you find out what he likes... good luck!|`|oVCzsUlXaa	My son would only drink whole milk if it was warmed up.  I put the milk in his sippy cup and put the sippy cup in a bigger cup of warm water.  It took about a month or so for him to go to cold milk.  He didn't have much formula to begin with though.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Tha pain isn't close to your belly button. It's far into your pelvis. You can take a test now and find out for sure. You would see a positive result by now. You would see a positive result about 14 days after you had sex.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Have you missed your period.You could test now. If its negative wait for your period and test again.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You could test now and get an accurate result.  That's what I experienced when I first got pregnant.|`|nISYAHkfaa	Take a pregnancy test, hon. Any time you have unprotected sex you have the possibility of becoming pregnant.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	wait 2 weeks after missed period to take a pregnancy test|`|1VdgsZPoaa	You could be and you could take a pregnancy test now because it has been 4 weeks :)|`|qJBMdL7gaa	You could take a pregnancy test now!!!
aLkCxq5aaa	You sound similar to how I was 2 weeks ago.  My baby was back 2 back at 39 weeks and I panicked, same as you midwife didn't seem to care, offered no words of advice and when I did ask what could I do to help she sighed and said 'lay on your left side'! err thanks I thought.  Thank God for google thats all I can say.  Found the Spinning Babies website which shows you how to map your baby's position so you know how to help try to turn him/her.  I done the usual tricks like rocking on all fours for half hour twice a day, never lean back when sitting, keep hips lower than your bump, and pelvic rocking a lot on my birthing ball.  Seems to have worked as baby is now in a better position, not completely anterior but half way or sideways, which different midwife said is a 'lovely position'.  <br>  I must add that my 2nd baby was born posterior, although nobody knew until her head popped out looking up at me!!  Established labour was 6 hours, same as my first, and I had no back labour, and she was 8lb 3oz! <br>  It's not too late to start doing some of the excercises I mentioned and if you havent already, take a look at the Spinning Babies website, it's brill and really interesting and helpful.<br>  Good Luck xxx|`|758cDKEFaa	when i went into labour they notcied my son was back to back and thats why my contractions were more painful than they should of been!<br>  they give me a birthing ball and told me to rotate my pelvis on it and it wasnt long till he moved around and the pain eased a bit! so you might wanna try that.<br>  also when i went to me 39 week midwife appointment the midwife said she thinks my baby is 4/5 engaged instead of 3/5 engaged like my normal midwife suggested (she was on holiday that week!) and said that i wouldnt go into labour for weeks but after a day of non stop squatting i went into lbaour and he was born two days after my midwife appointment!|`|Nnw9XM8Caa	he was layed same postion ur baby is in,i was 4/5 at check up and 1 week later he arrived dead on due date 2nd and hes beautiful. i had back pain my terrrible heart burn ( rennies ready) and baby turns right postion when coming out as has to turn<br>  dont b scared i wasnt hes 8 week old now|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	2/5 and 4/5 what the hell does that mean? <br>  Please use English terms.|`|jIfUuSVoaa	Hi, i was 2/5ths engaged from 32 weeks and my daughter didn't come until her due date! I had been advised to use a birthing/gym ball from about 34 weeks to encourage baby to get in a good position and to engage. My daughter was in a great position until i went into labour and then she turned back to back. Quickly got onto to the ball again and managed to turn her before i was ready to push.<br>  During the time my daughter was back to back this was more painful.<br>  Try not to worry and enjoy the last few days of your pregnancy. <br>  Hope all goes well

Im feeling the same way but right lately i've been trying to stay occupied with other things to get my mind off this pregnancy.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Sigh.  There's nothing you can do to get out of this.  I think being pregnant is the first time you realise you are stuck in the mud and there's no getting out.<br>  <br>  I had a split pelvis by 20 weeks, and was actually a total cripple by 32. I remember I spent about 15 hrs in bed a day, lying absolutely exactly on one side or the other.  It drove me beyond up the wall:  it drove me round the bend and back again.<br>  <br>  It's amazing what the human body has to get used to, but what's more amazing, is that the human body does.  I had gone through all the 'slowing down' a woman has to go through before she has a baby, and I was operating at exactly the right speed when he was born.  I've seen mothers frenetic after the child, because they never had to slow down when pregnant and they chafe horribly at staying home with a baby when he/she's born. They boomerang back to work at six weeks screaming that staying home is for idiots.  What's happened is that they're stir crazy.  They don't know it's a phase you get through.<br>  <br>  It's good that you're hitting it now.  Doesn't feel that way to you but it's great.  Getting it over with when pregnant will stand you in really good stead when the baby's born.<br>  <br>  As to a crap pregnancy, all I can say is thank goodness it ends. I remember that first pregnancy was terrible: the split pelvis, the shocking sciatica, the gestational diabetes, the all-over-invisible-rash, the 6 months of nausea, just awful.  But boy, you should see my son, he's 13 now and he's sooooo handsome.  And my daughter didn't do it to me at all!|`|My93XR2Maa	you can do something to take your mind off of the baby

LKu4YQZuaa	Well if you're not sure then dont get an abortion.. Wait until you completely know what you want to do.<br>  Leave it for a couple of months, have a talk with your fiance and then decide.. If you are still unsure about what to do.. DO NOT have an abortion because you will live to regret it! And once the baby is born, if you feel you cant cope, put the baby up for adoption!<br>  <br>  Please try not to make a drastic decision such as abortion before you are really sure what to do.. Its the sort of decision you cannot take back once you have gone through with it.. So have a talk with your family and try to work out whats best for you and the baby!<br>  <br>  Good luck hun! xx|`|T48smu01aa	You should have it....a life can never be taken back but your eductaion can always be redeemed....you should feel so lucky that your man is excited!|`|JWp9PMyRaa	KEEP YOUR BABY..<br>  <br>  DO NOT ABORT..<br>  <br>  THINGS WILL WORK OUT|`|uVXfuZSvaa	If your mind is set that you don't want the baby then there is no answer that will change your mind.

Often they gain weight more slowly as well *lol*<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/growth/weight-toomuch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gro...</a><br>  Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?<br>  <br>  By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC<br>  <br>  It is normal for breastfed babies to gain weight more rapidly than their formula-fed peers during the first 2-3 months and then taper off (particularly between 9 and 12 months). There is absolutely NO evidence that a large breastfed baby will become a large child or adult. In fact, there is good research to indicate that breastfed babies are less likely to be obese children or adults than babies who were formula-fed.<br>  <br>  Babies who gain quickly during infancy often start to slim down once they become more mobile; ie. rolling, crawling, pulling up, walking, running, etc. Often toddlers are very picky eaters and/or become almost too "busy" to take the time to eat. The fat laid down in infancy ensures that there are ample stores to pull from during the active toddler years.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, too, that breastmilk is a perfect food. There are NO empty calories or fillers. The amount of fat or calories in breastmilk is not affected by mom's dietary fat or sugar intake. However, mom can change the types of fat in her milk by altering the types of fat that she eats. (See Can you affect the amount of fat or calories in your milk? What we know from research.)<br>  <br>  Do not try to limit your baby's nursing by stretching out feedings, limiting time at the breast, using a pacifier to "hold baby off" until a specified time has passed, or offering water so that baby nurses less. It can be dangerous to limit your baby's growth by limiting nursing, as your baby needs the nutrients and fat for proper growth and brain development. Only by continuing to feed your baby on cue will you ensure that his needs are perfectly met and that your milk supply is maintained.<br>  <br>  A recent study (Stettler N, Zemel BS, Kumanyika S, Stallings VA. Infant Weight Gain and Childhood Overweight Status in a Multicenter, Cohort Study. Pediatrics 2002; 109: 194-199) has gotten a lot of press coverage and has worried some parents. The researchers concluded, "A pattern of rapid weight gain during the first 4 months of life was associated with an increased risk of overweight status at age 7 years, independent of birth weight and weight attained at age 1 year." However, the study data included practically no information on how the infants were fed (including the length/exclusivity of breastfeeding and when solids were introduced). The study looked at data for over 19,000 children who were born between 1959 and 1965 in 12 U.S. cities. These children were born at around the height of formula feeding in the US, and also at a time when very early introduction of solids was recommended. Both formula feeding and early intro of solids have been shown to increase the chance of childhood obesity. Per La Leche League, Dr. Nicholas Stettler (who headed up this study) "said that there is an easy way to prevent this obesity; simply follow the American Academy of Pediatrics' guideline -- breastfeed the infant exclusively for six months, followed by the slow introduction of solids and continued breastfeeding to one year or beyond."<br>  <br>  What can cause faster weight gain than the norm in an exclusively breastfed baby?<br>  <br>      * Genetics. Did your older children gain quickly as infants? What about Mom & Dad - are you large in size, or were you large as babies? What about other family members?<br>      * Overabundant supply can result in more rapid than normal weight gain (over an ounce per day). However, oversupply is not a concern unless it is causing problems for mom or baby.<br>      * Rarely, too-rapid weight gain can be related to health problems, such as congestive heart failure, renal anomalies, and/or endocrine disorders. If baby has health problems, continued breastfeeding is even more important.|`|zwctZ812aa	That's a pretty big baby and definitely gaining weight rapidly, but if your doctor isn't worried then you shouldn't be either.  My son was 3 days late, is in the 91st percentile for weight, and weighs 15 lbs 15 oz at 4 months.  Every baby grows differently, I'm sure your son is fine.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	all babies are different. my daughter was born at 39 week and was 5 lbs 15 ounces and now at 12 months she is 18 lbs. since your guy was a preemie, i'd say the gain is good, but speak with your peditrician if you think it's too much too fast. preemies have different needs than babies born on time.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	My daughter also born 4 weeks early and she weighed 6lbs 4 ozs and drop a few ozs at first, she is now 6 months old in 3 days and she weighs 15 lbs. She just started to slow her weight gain about 6 weeks ago, after she started moving alot more.|`|iFDye9RMaa	Ignore that idiot. .  .<br>  <br>  My daughter was 7lb 3 oz when she was born<br>  6lb 9oz when we left the hospital by the end of the first month she was 9lb at her second month she was 14lbs. lol I think they just hit growth spurts. <br>  my doctor jokingly told me if I kept feedin her so much he would have to put her on slim fast formula... or jenny craig... <br>  <br>  we got a big laugh out of it, but he said overall she was a happy healthy baby and not to worry about it.|`|jvFWNuiXaa	I think it is good that he is gaining weight. Dont stress over it it will balance itself out as he grows older.
zzaScg0haa	Natural birth isn't easy no matter where you do it
uFrqC4Y2aa	Does that mean he broke up with you or you think having sex with him last night made you pregnant? <br>  <br>  Confused. Have you taken a pregnancy test?|`|DNygQdmVaa	He finished you last night?|`|OmJfYPptaa	Im 17 and have a 2 month old daughter. Her father was arrested and I am raising her alone. I love her so much and do not regret it one bit.<br>  I think you can get the support you need by family and friends this is what I did. This baby is a blessing. I think you should get a job and let him have time to settle down and think about it all. That is allot for him to handle especially if he is a teen also. Teen boys are usually not ready to support themselves much less you and a baby.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Oh blimey, you poor darling.  I take it he dumped you because you told him you were pregnant?  Or doesn't he know?<br>  <br>  Firstly, you have a moral obligation to the child to tell his father he exists (children have a right to this, I think.)  this might bring the two of you back together, but it might not.<br>  <br>  I have a girlfriend who just went ahead and had the child.  she did it alone, did end up going back to work and not raising the child herself - ie creche - but she found a really nice guy (actually, a really yummy guy, but I'll never tell either of them THAT lol) and they have actually lived happily ever after.  <br>  <br>  Do you have family or friends?  Join an ante-natal group, other women your age.  I don't know if you have Barnardos where you are, but a child support group.  You have to hook up with other mums in your position because this is a really big job to do on your own.  You will need someone to anchor you unless you are an incredibly brave strong and clear-headed person.  When the baby is born it's really hard to learn how to look after them when they cry, you need an experienced friend to teach you.|`|91SFoU14aa	ok for 1 .. what does the "he finished you mean " Im lost lol ..but word from someone who's been there done that ... Just forget about the guy until after you have the baby.. trust me .. you need to be as relaxed and calm as possible through the whole pregnancy because I read up on some studies about being pregnant and stressed.. and they all talked about how when a mother is stressed through her whole pregnancy it can be very possible that when the baby gets into its adolescence years it could have gender confusion problems which means he or she could be GAY..but Im 19 yrs old and I am 39 weeks today pregnant..I went through most of my pregnancy by myself bc my fiance decided to ditch me ..honestly it was best for me because I had more support from my mother which made us closer ..but any ways .. Look After the baby's born go take the father of the baby to court and get a DNA test done for court purposes and slap CHILD SUPPORT on his *** and if he wants to be difficult about it they can throw him in jail ... So don't stress over money issues he will be paying if you stand your ground..|`|3K7ffKn2aa	you mean he broke up with you? if so then just think about your baby and soon you'll realize that no guy will ever be able to get to you b/c you will always have someone more important in your life.|`|EnBPpbcHaa	He finished you?<br>  <br>  If that is some sort of lingo meaning he broke up with you, um get a job and then make him pay child support.
OQnRP6xVaa	If he thinks he is the father he has the right to be involved with the decisions about his child. He can contest and fight any adoption plan. <br>  <br>  A man does have the right to parent a child he believes is his child and if he is the biological father he has to relinquish his rights for anyone else to have the right to adopt.<br>  <br>  If he is going to take this position eventually the testing will be done or not and everyone will know. You only have the decision of being pregnant, once the baby is born the mother and the father have rights. If he wants to exercise his rights he can. If he is the father he would have to voluntarily relinquish or be found unfit to parent. <br>  <br>  He may not Have to Do anything or Pay anything or even see the baby--but, he may actually Want To!  This baby is as much his child as yours.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	tell her "listen, if you want the test then you can pay for it. i am in no way shape or form paying 250 dollars for something that i believe isnt needed and that i dont care about having done. if you want to blow 500 bucks then that is your decision"|`|QzWHMGHJaa	They have a right to know if it's his child or not.  IF it is, they may want the child and you won't need to adopt it out!  It would be better for your child to remain with family than to go to strangers!  Do this for your child and what's best for it, not them!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	She can not force you to do it, and it is not necessary.  If she wants it, she can pay for it all.  However I would not let her have that kind of control anyway, unless the purpose is to determine whether she or another family member will take the child adn then I would let her pay for it-IF you are willing to place a child with that family member.<br>  <br>  Like another answer said, it is NOT always better for a child to remain within the family.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	its not about what she wants its about u and him if he doesn't care and hasn't signed the birth certificate then you can do what you want.|`|rTtIKOmpaa	If she wants it done she needs to pay for it all. Plain and simple! Tell her that straight.|`|xreWOKBYaa	If she wants the DNA test, she can pay for it, not you. But, if it turns out to be his - she may want to adopt it herself (thats just a big MAYBE) because I can't think of any other reason why she would want a DNA test.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Whoever said "it is better for a child to be with family and not strangers", that is NOT always true.<br>  <br>  Btw, I just wanted to say it sounds like you are making a very smart decision. (don't let "ericlunacy" make you feel bad) <br>  <br>  But, though you know it is his 100% - she doesn't have the proof you do (actually being there and such), so just because you know doesnt mean she will believe you|`|E7MgO2pZaa	It is unethical for you to relinquish your child without the father's consent. If he and his family want to parent the baby, by all means, surrender your rights to him. But do NOT give the baby up to strangers when there are biological family members that want to parent it. That's immoral, unethical, and hurtful to your child.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	SHE WANTS A TEST...THEN SHE SHE SHE SHEEEE WILL PAY FOR IT..<br>  <br>  Dont worry about the cost..and make sure you tell her that..<br>  <br>  Say, you dont have the money for a test..but if you want the test you can pay for it..<br>  <br>  and let that be that...|`|AA12127693	Please know that open adoptions are NOT enforceable and that as much rainbows and ponies the adoptive parents have promised as soon as you sign your rights over to them - they can vanish without a trace.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	find a way to pay up
ay8tXLD2aa	These worked wonders for my son - from the first use! We switched from Avent and instantly noticed a huge difference in his gas and wind.  Friends of ours laughed at us for spending the money when we had just bought a set of Avents and only used them for a week, but then when their son was born a month later, after about two weeks they went and bought Dr B's as well and experienced the same improvements. <br>  <br>  Yes, they are a pain to clean, but add 30 seconds more per bottle, and I'm surprised someone said she doesn't have the time -- it's 4 minutes extra to your day!  They can be difficult to fit into the steriliser as well but you start figuring ways out to pack it all in, or gets used to running it twice. <br>  <br>  You can't shake them, at least not when the milk is warm, or they will leak EVERYWHERE.  We mastered the art of swirling them for ages until the formula was dissolved. But, if you are living in a place where you don't need to use boiled water and can just use room temperature water, it's not a problem.  Also, you can't heat them up with the lids screwed on tight - you have to loosen the ring so that the air and milk isn't trapped in the valve. But all that is is remembering to unscrew it a bit - and then tighten it before using!<br>  <br>  Definitely worth the money.  I don't know anyone who has used them who disagrees. <br>  <br>  Side note - are you sure all of the screaming and pain is from trapped wind and not something like milk allergy?? Not my business, just thought I would mention it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2ZoUduoPaa	There are 6 parts to a dr. b's bottle.<br>  <br>  The actual bottle<br>  The cap<br>  The nipple collar<br>  The nipple<br>  The vent<br>  The straw<br>  (then there's the optional travel cap)<br>  <br>  The vent and straw cannot be washed with a regular bottle brush.  They come with a small brush (looks like pipe cleaner) to clean inside the vent and straw.  If the vent and straw are not cleaned properly, milk could become trapped inside and sour.  <br>  <br>  Yes you can warm them the same way.<br>  <br>  Yes, they helped with my colicky and gassy baby.  I was hardheaded and didn't want to try these bottle because I didn't want to deal with all the parts, but I'm glad I did purchase them.  They are definitely worth the money and time it takes to clean them.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I think they are a pain in the butt and there are plenty of bottles that do the same thing.  The best bottles I found are the playtex drop ins and the NUK bottles...my kids never had tummy problems with either.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	yeah there's  a few more parts to clean but they work really well. my sons been on them since a week old and its the only bottle he likes.|`|FmrI5ApUaa	I don't really know if I would say they are more work, they just have some additional parts to clean and put together before each use. I also did not see any change in my son after using them (despite their higher cost) so I am not a huge fan or believer in the claim that they help with colic.|`|AA10035322	I would try the cheap bottles first. I spent a fortune on bottles and ended up she like the cheap ones better. i could tell no different from Dr Browns and they are alot of work there are extra pieces.|`|zwctZ812aa	The bottles have lots of pieces so they are kind of a pain to clean.  The bottles reduce gas, but I think the playtex drop ins work just as well to eliminate gas.  we used both and I much preferred the drop ins.  They are so much more simple.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to how the bottles work to prevent baby from swallowing air. <a href="http://www.handi-craft.com/products/bottles-howitworks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.handi-craft.com/products/bott...</a>|`|EmYNUZcXaa	its because of the tube that vents the air into the bottle...its a bit more time consuming to clean it...some mothers don't have the time (like me) to clean them properly, so i use a different kind.
2ZoUduoPaa	Colic is labeled as crying that lasts for 3 or more hours for 3 more more days a week.  Most colicky babies have gas but it's due to the crying.  When crying they gulp air which in turn makes them gassy, and being gassy they're uncomfortable, thus they cry more.  My doc described it as being out of their comfort zone.  They've been taken away from their safe place and just really don't know what to do with themselves.  If you are going through this, just know it gets better.  I thought I was the only one going through it at the time, but realized many people deal with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yes, Dr. B bottles can help.  That's what we switched our little on to.|`|nmu6coapaa	Well actually colic is defined as long periods of crying in infants for no apparent reason!|`|GNLYxY7kaa	its gas trapped in their entire digestive system. the track is too immature for them to be able to fart it out easily and sometimes the baby doesnt burp easily. try laying them on one knee with their head not facing too much towards the floor. my son usually lets out some farts doing this.|`|CjySz62Haa	it is still not known if colic causes the gas or gas causes colic<br>  <br>  try gripe water, it really has soothing effect and helps to calm down|`|HWiL3YtPaa	yes it is. GAS
WXIoUwIBaa	Yes.  You can have a shower for your second baby and it is perfectly okay.  Traditionally, most people only had a shower for the first baby but that has changed over the last several decades. Remember a baby shower is a celebration of your good news and the baby to come. It is just as important to celebrate the first as it is to celebrate the second.<br>  <br>  Generally, when you are having a baby shower for a second baby it is often called a Baby Sprinkle.  This is because it is less about gifts, since you have many of the items already and more about sharing in the wonderful news.<br>  <br>  To have a Baby Sprinkle, I would just mention that that is what it is and say something like, "A baby sprinkle is a great time to sprinkle a new mom with stories, advice and heartfelt congrats."<br>  <br>  All the best and don't hesitate to have a shower for your second. If you are worried about what people will think, simply tell that you would love to see them and gifts are optional since you have so much already.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	First, you are not supposed to give a shower; friends/family do that.<br>  <br>  Second, there is no tradion or rule that states that you are only allowed one shower per family or one shower if all successive children are the same gender or within a few years in age.<br>  <br>  Third, if all you want is a party with games, etc, then CALL it a party and wait until the baby is born to have it. Let it be a sort of not-birthday party not only for the new baby but also for your now older-sister daughter. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to appear as surfing for gifts, don't register at any store, adn if anyone asks, repeat it is just a happy party for a new baby and just having fun and making new memories are presents enough.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Is someone throwing the shower for you or do you want to throw it yourself? If someone is throwing it for you, then I think you should not decline, however, throwing it yourself is a bit tacky, even for your first pregnancy. If you want to have a celebration for the second child, throw a party and have everyone bring a pack of diapers instead of going through making an expensive registry. I have a baby girl and I would be grateful if I was having another girl next time around. You should have everything you need from your first child because I know I would. Diapers is really all you need so throwing a diaper party would work.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My daughters are 8 years apart, so needless to say I had a second shower. I felt a little odd about two showers, so we changed the name to a "baby sprinkle". I had a great turn out. I think that if people don't want to celebrate a second baby then they can opt not to come!|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	Have a second shower with your friends over to have good food and drink.  When you invite them say you don't need gifts but if they want to give anything it will be appreciated.  <br>  <br>  Also, you will need more diapers, etc. with the new baby, suggest those as gifts.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I think it is really tacky to have a second baby shower especially when they are less than 5 years apart and the same sex.  You should still have all the stuff you need from your first girl.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	I only had a 2nd one because I was having twins.  My first child was a boy and was 3 when they were born. Having twins i needed a lot more of things.|`|4984ec7c500143b872a90c83bb3fa419aa	I think asking for a second shower would be rude.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Traditionally you are only supposed to have a shower for the first baby.  It was acceptable to have a second shower if there was a big age gap or if the second child was a different gender from the first.  Nowadays though, most people just do whatever they want.  Since your two girls are so close together and you don't want to look like you are just after gifts, you might just have a "party" not a shower.  You can even put "no gifts necessary" on the invitations.  Some people will still bring them, but at least they won't think that that's all you're after.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Some people might think of it as greedy since, they being only 18 months apart, you still should have all your baby stuff.  Plus, they are both girls, so it's not like you can't use the hand-me-down clothes.  I wouldn't do it if I were you.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Well you shouldn't throw yourself a shower, wait and see if someone offers to throw one for you. I didn't even have a shower for my first baby, but my best friend had three showers for her first baby.<br>  She kinda threw herself the showers, and I thought that was pretty rude. It's like "hey come buy me stuff"  <br>  If you do want some kind of get together, just tell people it's not a shower, it's a pregnancy celebration. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|f3pu5FAFaa	I know people have had them because it was years later that they had the child or that it was a diffrent sex and the had like lets say all boys .But honestly i think it's tacky  you already had your family and friends over for one maybe they think it's an inconvience to go or they won't rsvp  . my sis in law did for her son ( her other son was born 3 years before him) had baby showeres for every one  of her children , she invited 40 people only 15 showed up and alot of them were like um no we went to both your other ones . so  you may be in the clear but if need be just throw a friends and closer family like 10 people or sooo.|`|KBfW5A8Kaa	Of couse it's fine.  I think it's a great opportunity to get to see relatives and spend some time together with the women you care about, since with a baby that time gets cut in half or even more.  Go ahead and have fun!|`|nCtJisCvaa	You really dont need a second baby shower because you already have a child and they are 18 months apart its like whatever your oldest child has im sure it will fit your youngest girl. And if you are a supportive mother you shoudnt need 1 <br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|be68e6d198f3f9ac69efb2146c8d907eaa	You usually only have one baby shower and that is it...But just have a party not a baby shower!!!  Invite friends over for a get together and have fun!!|`|G2auAv1Saa	If you're using the same stuff I have heard of people having a 'mommy shower' where you come together for a little party but don't really bring gifts you do makeovers and stuff like that. <br>  If you don't want to seem like you are asking for gifts, don't register anywhere and don't send the invite out as a baby shower just call some friends to come over for snacks and fun.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	most people don't have them unless it is with a different sex of baby. but you could just make it a different kind of party like #2 party harder or something. Put a cute name on it and if people don't want to come they wont lol<br>  Tyffannie|`|mCDopsLEaa	Some people think it is not coshure to have a baby shower for second babies, however, my opinion is you shouldn't have to give up those fun memories and fun times just because it's your second child. This is part of the reason why (i think) there is sibling resentment. I think you should have the shower.|`|rTtIKOmpaa	You should totally celebrate the 2nd one. Maybe you can add in the invite that you don't need gifts but if they want to bring something special for the baby that's fine. If not bringing themselves to share in this special celebration is a big enough present.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	Since you are having your 2nd child so close I say no and since it is another girl I say No because you still have all the stuff that you can be used fro your 1st Daughter.You could have it just be a family thing and invite them.Congrats and Best of luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I don't think I would do a 2nd for a baby of the same sex, but if you want to have one, just put on the invitation no gifts allowed. That way no one gets the wrong idea.

For average people, there is no choice. For Buddha, Saints, Christ, they have a choice. They consciously chose their parents, date of birth, place of birth and date of death, of leaving the world. They were conscious before they came to the world. They came by choice.  But other people are compelled to reincarnate by their own deeds, their actions throughout past lives. Our thinking and habits form themselves into an energy, and this forces us to come into an environment to fulfil and to eradicate, if necessary. This already-formed concrete energy has to be diluted.<br>  <br>  Long explanation short...when you choose.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	A donkey|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	HHHHHUUUUHHHH!!!!!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I have no idea.

mCDopsLEaa	Dont' feel dumb. When it comes to the health of your baby, do what you got to do to make sure everything is okay. You have a history of going into labor early and your doctor knows or should know this, so I would call, and I know it sounds impossible, but try to take it easy for a little while, don't lift the 21 month old so much. He can walk. :) Good Luck|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Perhaps.<br>  When my mom and I both went into preterm labor (3 years apart), we both bled. Gushed blood.<br>  Just call the doctor, and see what they say.<br>  But when I did, it came on very suddenly.<br>  I went for a walk, and my vagina was kind of cramping, and then when I got home and sat down, I started bleeding. My mom called the doctor, and then she noticed I was having mild contractions. All of this happened in a space of about an hour.<br>  I hadn't been cramping for a week.<br>  But, it could be. If you feel that this isn't right, then call the doctor.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	If it's your third child, do you mind me asking why you don't know what labour feels like?  First stage certainly does feel like menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  Braxton hicks is not the same, varicose veins not the same: menstrual cramps definitely sounds suss.<br>  <br>  And also: do not waste your time worrying about feeling dumb.  You'd feel dumber if the baby died.  Go with your gut.  Obey your mother instinct and call.  The worst that can happen is that you are fine.  The best that can happen is that they save the baby.  Come on sweetie: this is what mothers have to do, feel silly but persist in demanding 100% satisfaction for the sake of theeir child.  You may as well start now!
hKJIDdVqaa	*sighs* 17 years old is too young to have had ANY sex OR boyfriends.<br>  Not ok, in any way.....|`|N24wkFROaa	No, GTFO off Y/A! you troll.|`|i8Ch743Laa	As long as she's protected and safe,those are her decisions.

The easiestt way to find acceptance from men is to offer sex.  It is empty and temporary acceptance so the woman is looking again.

If you have good insurance the cost of prenatal and actually giving birth will be less money out of your pocket.<br>  Maternity clothes can be inexpensive, I get most of mine from Old Navy and Target<br>  Whenyou do baby check ups, you will most likely just pay your Dr. visit deductible, usually between 5 and 20.00, but if you have a PPO, you pay a percentage of what they do.  Can be 100.00 or so per visit.<br>  Like I said, all depends on what kind of insurance you have.  If you can get an HMO through work, that is what I recommend.  If you have to get private insurance, you will end up getting a PPO, WAY less expensive.<br>  As far as child care, that also depends on what kind of care you want.

If you have insurance, you might pay nothing or at least a deductible. If you have a vaginal delivery, it's less costly than a c-section; factor in any pain meds (epidural or spinal block) plus any incidentals ... you could be high risk and need more ultrasounds and tests than the average woman ... or your doctor might charge more or less depending on your income ...<br>  <br>  Child care and day care - that totally depends on where you live. As does most of the other things you're asking. The only thing I can give a ballpark figure on are prenatal vitamins - you can get a bottle of about 100 for less than $10. Clothing - that depends on what you want and where you get it. It varies widely by brand and style. <br>  <br>  No one can really tell you much except that it's damned expensive. Sorry!

Some parents and doctors decide to cut off the skin on the end of the penis.  Without the foreskin (the skin at the end of the penis) the glans (head of penis) is revealed.<br>  <br>  This pages shows the babies penis at birth:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a><br>  <br>  You can see the foreskin being retracted on an "intact" guy here:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is fused to the glans at birth by a membrane.  In order to perform the circumcision, they have to pull this membrane apart.  They then insert the circumcision device, such as the plastibell.  You can see the circumcision operation here:<br>  <a href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell.html" rel="nofollow">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell....</a><br>  And here is a more painful one (very distressing to watch):<br>  <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-6584757516627632617&ei=QhWxSaOYIZ7OqwLi9bGYBA&q=circumcision&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  The foreskin also has a role in sex.  Women and men enjoy sex more when the man still  has his foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Why is it done?  Initially it was done as a rite of passage in primitive cultures thousands of years ago.  The Egyptians used to do it.  the Jews are thought to have copied it off them.  the Jews however transferred the day of circumcision to 8 days.  This is when Jews believe God told Abraham to circumcise his son Isaac.  When Jesus came along , circumcision wasn't needed.  Jesus was the new covenant (connection with God) and what matter was circumcising your hearts , rather than a meaningless mutilation of the flesh.  And so, most Christians do not circumcise.  <br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/christianparent.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/christianparent.h...</a>  <br>  The Catholic church sees it as mutilation:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/catholic/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/cat...</a><br>  <br>  Non-religious circumcision was introduced in the late 1800's in English-speaking countries.  The main reason was to prevent masturbation.  Though there were other silly reasons such as preventing insanity and epilepsy.  You can read a full history at this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/</a><br>  <br>  It was never that popular in Britain and fell out of favour by the 1950's.  Today less than 1% of British boys are circumcised.<br>  in Australia and Canada it fell out of favour in the 1970's.  Today less than 10% are circumcised in those 2 countries.<br>  In the USA it has been the most popular.  Though the newborn circ rate has declined to 55%.<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/USA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/USA.html</a><br>  <br>  There are no medical reasons to circumcise .  Men in Britain, France and Germany do fine with all their penis intact.

And if you are pregnant right now you aren't going to be able to pick up health insurance that will cover your pregnancy that's somethign you get BEFORE you get pregnent. Not after.<br>  2) 10,000ish<br>  3)100-200<br>  4)10,000-20,000 or over for natural and about 50,000 for a C-section or more.<br>  5)I have no clue probably in the 5,000-10,000 range.<br>  6) You shouldn't be getting your son circumcised. It's his body not yours. Leave him penis as it was born. that's a birth right and something that should be left up to him. And it's about 300-500 a doctors visit<br>  7)you are looking at about (my mom paid 100-300 a week)<br>  <br>  <br>  Get health insurance before you get pregnant. It's very important that you do that. I honestly don't think insurance companies are going to pick you up if you are already pregnent. It's not like that.<br>  And I don't mean to dictate what you do with the circumcision thing but I urge you to do some research about it. Once you do you will realize that its mutilation and it distroys a lot of sexual feeling for males. So please think that over and concider leaving your son with ability to grow up with what he was born with, I mean you did and I'm sure your happy abotu that.<br>  <br>  -Connor
BcdbR6iSaa	This is exactly why I'm glad I'm not catholic. Just start going to a Christian church, it's the same religion with less politics. They will baptize you to become a member of the church, and after you're a member they will usually baptize the babies at your request. <br>  Good Luck!! I don't understand why the catholic church has to make it so hard, it's almost like they don't care about the religion, just the "you did this or didn't to that" It's craziness.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Not Catholic myself, but my best friend is.  She wanted me as godmother, but the church wouldn't allow it (and she was dead set against choosing someone else just because I wasn't Catholic)... so she actually had her daughter baptized at the church my sister attended at the time (Protestant).|`|AA11537248	This is a big failing of the Catholic church.  It still is today, and it's as bad as it was 500 years ago.<br>  <br>  My wife was (past tense) Catholic, and I was always protestant.  After becoming frustrated with her church and priest over baptising our daughter, she left the church altogether and began to attend mine.  <br>  <br>  My church (Lutheran...almost identical to Roman Catholic, with a few different administrative and political differences) took her right in.  The kids were baptised there.  She was allowed to take communion right away with no conditions.  She didn't have to be "re-baptised".  She's now actually elected as one of the church's elders.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	They do welcome everyone.  But you have to prove that you're making the commitment to raising the child in the ways of the church (ie, tithing, going to church regularly, etc).  Baptism isn't just "oh let's get it done so they don't go to hell" it's a lifetime commitment.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I went through something similar when I was having my daughter Baptized. I wanted to have her Baptized in the same church as I was Baptized which was not in our district. It was about a 20 min drive away but we were willing to attend church there every Sunday and become a member of that church. The secretary of the church pretty much told us no even though we were willing and wanted to make the commute. So we decided to go with the church we were familiar with. <br>  <br>  We filled out an application and the priest called us back saying he would like to have a meeting with us. He discussed his concern with the issue of us not being married and he wanted to get the paperwork going on getting us married first and totally disregarding the whole point of us being there. So when that meeting was done we had to go to a Baptism preparation class which felt more like a brainwashing cult.<br>  <br>   We ended up getting her Baptized in that church but my advice is that if they are really giving you a hard time, try a different church because each church has a different attitude about it.|`|e0KPhvqCaa	Look.. I say skip the song and dance because the Catholic Church is all about the Catholic Church. It has nothing to do with Jesus Christ and baptizing your children won't save them. Saving is a personal choice and it required obtaining a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. At some point your children will make a decision to accept Jesus or don't accept Jesus. If they accept they will be saved and live an eternal life.<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd find a non-denomination church that doesn't judge. Have them dedicated (real churches don't baptize those that don't choose it) and live a Christful life.
n3wTiKFqaa	Yes you could be pregnant. You should take a test straight away. If it is negative you should see about going on the pill. If not, you need to tell your boyfriend that he needs to wear a condom or face the possibility of becoming a daddy. <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|ameJkDgpaa	oh my gosh! if i were you i would sue him. he is practically trying to get you pregnant. if he doesn't want to wear a condom then tell him to f*ck off. it is your body and you need to learn how to take care of it because if you don't than your gonna end up pregnant if not now. your to young to be having sex anyways. and you need to drop that boyfriend of yours too. but seriously i hope your not pregnant|`|sN8Lycx9aa	Yes, you could be pregnant. Take a pregnancy test as soon as your period is due. NEVER have sex without some kind of birth control. In fact, I got pregnant at 16 the same way you just described. Just tell him that if he's not going to wear a condom he can't have sex with you. God knows I wish I had.|`|qTyQx37saa	Yes, there r chances of u getting pregnant. The best thing to avoid such a condition is to take an ipill within 72 hrs of sex. this will avoid any unplanned pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/iPill-Cipla" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/iPill-Cipla</a>|`|a1uoxczTaa	you can get pregnant from precum. you shouldn't have sex with him if u feel he needs a condom and he won't put it on. wait for ur missed period or look up some symptoms..|`|um8IIEn8aa	TAKE PILS DUMBASS<br>  AND TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND TO STOP TREATING YOU LIKE A WORE<br>  <br>  YES PRECUM CONTAINS SPERM, SO YOU  MIGHT BE PREGO<br>  HIGH FIVE|`|YZAcXNTPaa	pre *** is very very very strong i learned this in my biology and parenting class. you may be pregnant but id wait it out for about 2 or 3 weeks and get a pregnancy test. u must wait before you take the test otherwise it wont give u an accurate answer. i know it may be hard to wait but trust me u just got to be patience. and if ur near Planned Parenthood ( free clinic for teens ) you can get free condums and free birth control with out ur parents even knowing. most of these clinics are really helpful for teens and do not tell your parents anything.|`|YqJGwV4taa	Wow, are you seriously that dumb? If not pregnant now, you definitely will be before youre 17. tell him to wear a effin condom or he isnt getting any. he will soon decide sex with a condom is better than no sex.|`|tecPZUq2aa	Anything Is Possible But The Thing Is Neither You Or Him Knew If Anything 'Escaped' .<br>  <br>  He Might Not Want To Wear A Condom For A Little While But I Don't Think Your Going To Want To Be Pregnant For The Next 9 Months And Responsible For A Child For The Rest Of Your Life!!!!<br>  <br>  Your Boyfriend Really Needs To Grow Up.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Jesus.<br>  Guess what... you need to dump that jerk if he refuses to wear a condom.

And research safe sex.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Rachel, I'm sorry but there is a high chance of getting pregnant. Precum contains sperm and at a young age your fertility is at its strongest.<br>  Either get on the pill or make him get in a condom.<br>  no condom, no sex.. when you're firm enough he'll behave himself and stop being so selfish.. Also, aren't you worried about STI's? for god's sake STI can cause cervical cancer and infertility not to mention HIV...|`|RIVywiykaa	O.K. you have a posiblity that your pregnate, very high. i'm sorry but he is not a very nice guy he would not wear a condom. Intence heat can kill spearm and you might not acually be pregnate yet so take a bath|`|smsUZG4Iaa	yes your were probably ovulating right at that time.. just get use to being called Mommy.. he'll probably leave you anyway.. he doesn't respect you enough to wear a condom, he definitely wont be called daddy.. How stupid..|`|lTsPX04jaa	yes you can. and why would you give up? stop giving it up
KRWm4cUBaa	I am sorry to hear about your miscarriage, they can be tough. I had a miscarriage, although I did not have a d and c. It is possible to get pregnant after one, but not likely. Your body trying to adapt to you not carrying a baby anymore. I felt sick to my stomach a lot probably about 4 weeks after mine and yes my bbs hurt. I would get an at home test or go to your doctor for a blood test. You should have had a follow up after the d and c to make sure everything was alright. I hope this helps you out and good luck with a healthy pregnancy, you know if you are:)|`|Vh4ZHagpaa	Yes it is possible as some people say your very fertile after a D&C. I had that procedure done December just gone and the following month was convinced I was pregnant as my body still thought I was pregnant due to horomone levels etc. Im not saying your not pregnant but just done get your hopes too high only to be disappointed again... Best of luck and I really hope you are!!!
BcdbR6iSaa	Don't do it yet, there is not much a 17 year old can give to a baby.

It will only make life harder for you at this phase in your life.  Wait until you know you can financially provide for this child yourself, and can make a loving home for him or her.

Just give it time, and try to fullfill your life by achieving career and education goals and becoming an independant adult.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8j7FCEOraa	Oh so you are emotionally ready?<br>  You have enough money to buy everything you need?<br>  You have a partner to raise the child with you?<br>  You are done school?<br>  Your ready to give up ALL of your time?<br>  <br>  Why dont you work full time at a day care and then decide. <br>  <br>  A baby is not something that you push your unfulfilled desires or dreams on.

But you will still be able to give a child those things in 5 years when you are more established in life. And if you waut 10 years you will be able to give them all those things plus a nice roof over their head, the benefit of a mother and a father in an established relationship, nice clothes, amazing toys and you will be able to put money away for their college and their future. You are not dumb. ignore that comment. You can not control the things you want in life. But part of being an adult is controlling when and how you go after the things you want in life. Think long and hard about this decision. I know you are feeling lonely and maybe even a little unloved. You feel like a baby can give YOU something YOU are missing. Please wait a few years. You wouldn't want to grow to resent that child would you? While a baby is always there to love you it is also always there to be taken care of. Who will watch your baby when you are in school? Who will buy the baby's clothes and toys and diapers and food. Even if you qualified for state aid you would be amazed at how little money that really is and how quickly it is gone. Even if your parents are in a position to help, remember that help comes with a price of it's own. Do you want to be a parent or a sibling? I think you know the answers to most of these questions or you would not have posted here. I know 5-10 years seems so far away but I swear when you have gotten to be 27 and you think back to highschoool it will really blow you away at how it feels like only yesterday. <br>  <br>  When you picture being a parent WHAT DO YOU PICTURE?<br>  <br>  Mommy and me? Going to the park with your baby? Putting adorable clothes on your child? Play dates with pther kids and parents?<br>  <br>  What about being up all hours of the night with a crying baby and then going to work or school on zero sleep. Then taking your measly $200.00 paycheck and trying to decide on if you should buy food or pay the eletric bill, diapers or formula? If I had a teen who got pregnant I would let them live with me and I would probably even help woth day care, but that teen would still go to school and have a job. The only time they would be at home was when the baby was asleep. I would not do that to be mean but so that one day they could get a better opaying job and be able to stand on their own two feet and support their child. <br>  <br>  One more question? What are you doing for prom or spring break? Does a baby fit into those plans?<br>  <br>  I know you want to be able to provide the fantasy life for your child. You want that baby to want for nothing and to know you love them. If you wait a few years you can have all that. But if you are working round the clock when are you ever going to be able to bond with that child? How will they know how much you love them? <br>  <br>  And having a husband. marriage is a partnership. if their are two parents to share the burden of the bills, the house work, the discapline. Well both parents get to enjoy the benfits and love and fun of parenting as well. <br>  <br>  I would reccomend making a plan for your life. Where do you want to be in 5 years? What about ten years? What do you need to do to get there? There is more to being a parent than popping out babies. How will you pay for all the necessities? What job do you want? how do you get there? I swear the time will fly if you are actually doing to something to achieve this goal and your whole life and childs life will benefit from your planning, waiting and grace. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck. I hope this helped a bit and all that happy jazz.|`|kTZevQNHaa	I can understand your urge...and so now, what you must do is consider the following as a better and wiser option:<br>  <br>  You should practice being a Mom by doing a lot of baby sitting...get your ECE diploma , (Early Childhood Education) and maybe one summer, you  can watch someone's kids...or be a nanny...that way, you can gain that much needed fulfillment of being around kids and caring for them...giving that--as you say--"""what you don't have""""...and this way, you then will see what is involved in Motherhood--by practicing looking after kids in a way that won't ruin yours and baby's life-with an empty and dismal prospect of unwed, underage parenthood...and then you WAIT until you are of legal and mature age to have a baby under responsible, financially sound, emotionally sound and relationship sound circumstances...with an active and present, well-employed husband...because it's not about YOU feeling your maternal clock ticking...or about wanting a baby...it's about what is best for a baby to have a good life and prosperous future--which baby deserves.<br>  <br>  Also, as you get older, you will accumulate much-needed WISDOM.<br>  <br>  And think about this: Baby is only baby for a while, thn baby grows into a teen...and that's a whole other ball of wax.<br>  <br>  If you are a single Mom--your prospects of "free time" and even getting a date...and so deminished--Your whole future and life as you know it will be changed--forever--in one fell swoop. No prom, no dates, no sleeping through the night...who's gonna buy that 300 dollar Perego pram, crib, diapers, formula, clothes, books, toys, FOOD, day care, yearly school supplies, money for school trips, medicine...it costs so MUCH to have a kid--and THEN there's the emotional and time investment...believe me--you don't wanna go there unprepared, at your age, surely not single/alone,...it's be the worst thing you could possibly do...NOW. Unwed. Uneducated. Unprepared...and you wanting a baby has nothing to do with you loving a baby beause--if you really loved a baby-you'd put your own irrational and frankly selfish/whimsical desires on the back burner till you are 'ready' in ALL senses of the word-to give the child the BEST of futures.<br>  <br>  PROPER and fair child rearing is EXPENSIVE and takes full time dedication.<br>  <br>  As a young lady who loves loves loves the idea of  a baby-you will know that--to love a baby is to  WAIT for the right and fair circumstances in which to bring a child into this world--so that you can offer that child all the love, attention and future the baby deserves.<br>  It's a Lifetime commitment and not something to take <br>   on a whim to feel 'complete'.<br>  <br>  Please wait.<br>  <br>  In the mentime, wok hard in school. Get a solid education. Find a prosperous job. Meet a well balanced, sane and responsible man. Develop a strong relationship with him and--when the 2 of you are ready, then that is the time you start thinking about marriage and bringing children into this world.<br>  <br>  Your baby will need a good education and a safe and stable home. So feather your nest of dreams for this baby by building. a good foundation in your own self--so you are well equipped emotionally, mentally, with a good education, home and partnership in which to start a family--a good family the child deserves.|`|yb7FYX9naa	well u have to think wat u can give them... yes love is the first thing.. but wat after that? how r u gana rasie him or her? how r u gana take care of them? do u have a good job to provide with a kid? if u r then fine a good guy that u know that he'll be there for the kid too... u dont wana be a single parent cause then the kid wont have everything...|`|UxG6CkU2aa	WAIT, you are only 17.

I wake up at 5 am to get ready as fast as i can befire he wakes up then i have to feed him get him ready go take him to daycare which is 145 A WEEK! and the daycare calls me all the time i have to leave work to get him its hard! after work i have to pick him up and take him home and its so hard to even take a shower. if your willing to give up EVERYTHING that you enjoy like going out with friends,any alone time and willing to work hard and support your baby each and every day, go ahead. But be prepared for long days and nights and a struggle.|`|aaF1U2JVaa	In stead of answering your question I have a few questions for you: you want to give them something you don't have, what do you have? Are you ready financially? Are you ready emotionally and physically? What will you each your baby? What if you want to go to a party who is willing to babysit? <br>  Just a couple things to think about!!|`|n9hPQhbOaa	i was preg @ 17 & SCARED out my mind i had nothing @ all i had my BF but that's it no $$ no car my fam didnt really care please wait i waited i am not 21 and i have a 3 month old and im happy i waited but a baby is a wonderful thing just wait until u get your own place ur own car a JOB just wait u are too young|`|qrGLcTh4aa	You're too young. Spare yourself, the baby, your parents and some guy the stress it takes to raise a baby. This is not the right time for you. Wait until you finish college and secure a great job. Then, I am sure you will make a great Mother.|`|9QeV07zJaa	If you don't have it, how are you going to give it?<br>  <br>  You would be a good example of how this propagates over and over. <br>  Consider the possibility of achieving some worldly success then poppin' one out.|`|273vsUezaa	You should stop wanting a baby.|`|4BxkkB6Yaa	Buy a toy baby from a store.|`|dyvfTOTYaa	All good things come in time.

jYwSKzg1aa	False negatives are very rare, so it sounds like congrats are in order!<br>  <br>  The drinking thing happens to a lot of people.  The most problem would be if she continues to drink during the pregnancy.  It doesn't sound like she's far along at all, so I wouldn't worry about the alcohol up to this point -- just no more from now on.<br>  <br>  Ditto the pill.  Since she's stopping now, there is little or no danger.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you ask the doctor about both of these things.  The worst thing for most of us in the beginning is all the worry.  The doctor can cure that with information.|`|1b4036203595b627a31f4873225a9b2daa	Your baby will be fine if she drank a couple days before she found out. Alot of women drink and then find out they're pregnant and their babies are perfect....obviously if she continues drinking there will be a problem...now for her having her period a couple weeks ago was it a normal period or really light because it might of been implantation (the sperm meeting the egg and it latching on) Your doctor will let you know when she actually concieved if it wasnt a false poss.   and congrats<br>  <br>  --32wks pregnant
1TXRqT26aa	Babies can sense frustration and anxiety. Try to relax. Immediately switch to hypoallergenic formula (worked like a charm for my girl). We use Enfamil Nutramigen and it's been so great.  She's so much more comfortable now. I know how frustrating it can be and you feel like you'll really lose your mind. Remember this WILL pass and you will regret anything negative you do or say (even though they can't understand it) toward your baby...this can also cause you to have a less connected bond with your baby. Have you tried driving around? Go get a starbucks coffee, strap her in her carseat and drive around---she'll likely sleep and you can get some peace and quiet. Try not only rocking but walking around ...patting the bum a little bit too can be soothing. Good luck. Definitely talk to your doctor about PPD too...but it's likely mostly due to lack of sleep and not knowing what to do with a colicky baby. Best wishes.|`|pXSKSS3daa	If you have thoughs of hitting your baby then you need to speak to your doctor about PPD.<br>  <br>  If it's too much for you to handle at any given time call up a friend/family member so they can come take your little one. It's hard at first, I understand that, but your baby can pick up on how you're feeling so it's probably stressing her out more too. Try to relax a bit while you're holding her.|`|X6as2nOAaa	This is what babies do and if you were not ready for this then you should not have had one, if you are thinking about hitting your child remember do you want to spend the rest of your life in jail for child abuse? I think you need to call someone for some help so that they can take the baby so that the baby will not get hurt. This is what babies do.|`|7a8qCNU2aa	It's better for you to close the door and leave her crying in her crib for a while than it is to handle her when you're so upset that you're fantasizing about harming the baby. You need some help from another family member or friend, so that you can have an occasional break from the noise- which is becoming harmful to your mental state. Some babies are very difficult to care for, and apparently this is the case for you. I would definitely bring it up to your doctor- not only her behavior, but the way her behavior is affecting you.|`|VTB5QpyBaa	A baby can feel your emotions. So if you are frustrated, that rubs off to the baby and will make her frustrated too. It is really hard at times but you just have to think that things will get better in a matter of time. Do you have someone you could have come over and watch her for the day. Sounds like you need a day to yourself and believe me that will work. It will help you refresh. Good luck I hope this helps =)|`|EeGgovyCaa	she's getting her emotions from you, babies can sense when moms are upset or stressed. They feed off that. I would suggest putting baby in the car and going for a drive. Maybe the car will help calm baby down a bit. <br>  <br>  Don't EVER hit your baby, walk away first to collect yourself then try again. patience, patience patience.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	You need to go to your doctor.  I know it is difficult to hear a baby cry that long, but your baby is probably in pain or at the least, uncomfortable.  A normal baby does cry 3 hours a day, but it sounds like your baby is crying much more.<br>  <br>  and I can totally empathize as I had quite a few days with my baby that nearly drove me nuts.  It turns out, he has reflux and we now have him on medication and he is like a new child!<br>  <br>  You need to get some support thru your friends/family/doctor.  Most babies that are abused/killed are babies that cried a lot.<br>  <br>  Do you think your baby is in pain?  If so, see your doctor immediately and tell him how much it is effecting you too.<br>  <br>  Other things to try, undressing her and putting a soft blanket on her; taking her outside; putting her in a carrier and walking around the house; going for a walk with the stroller; singing to her; putting her face down over your arms and playing "airplane"; turn on the vacuum cleaner (worked wonder for us!!!).  <br>  <br>  You just have to keep trying.  All babies have an "off switch".  For our baby, it was running the vacuum cleaner.  You can also try the hair dryer, dishwasher, etc.  Some babies liike loud noises like that.<br>  <br>  Good luck and you are not alone.|`|8lR6OvB6aa	Try giving her a warm bath when she is cranky. If that doesnt work call someone to watch her and you take a brake and let someone else try and calm her down. Babies can sense when you are ypset or stressed out, so take a time out for yourself and reevaluate the situation, and handle the situation with a clear head.|`|28QPS6V9aa	My best advice is relax. When you're stressed babies can sense it which causes them to be stressed which brings on more crying. Get a babysitter and go out for a few hours to catch your breath and get away. When you get back calmly hold her and speak gently to her and remember to smile. Babies love it when we smile. If nothing else helps, take her for a ride in the car. The movement and noise should calm her right down.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	put your baby in a really warm relaxing bath...she will stop crying i promise. just sit there and relax while you watch her...maybe trinkle water on her belly or whatever. it always worked with my colicky son. and maybe you should ask your doc about getting some valiums....that would help the stress when it is so bad you think about hitting her. good luck|`|WGXdfh22aa	how old is your baby? maybe your baby has colic. talk to your baby's pediatrician about the continuous crying. but DONT hit your baby. if it really gets to you that much lay her down in her crib safely until you can be calm enough to take care of her. also ask someone to help you and give you a break.|`|iFDye9RMaa	Ask your doctor about depression too... It might be a factor in the wanting to hit her feeling. <br>  <br>  Its hard sometimes... Take a night off, get your mom to watch the baby and just relax with your partner.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	She may have colic or maybe she isn't tolerating the formula anymore and should try switching to a gentle formula.

uFrqC4Y2aa	Well women don't start to "look" pregnant for a few months after they find out. I was 20 weeks. <br>  <br>  The doctor's tests are more accurate. If it makes you feel better to have an ultrasound then do that. But not everyone bleeds when they have a miscarriage especially that early. Sometimes the body just absorbs the fertilized embryo.|`|vcxdTXbraa	maybe a chemical pregnancy|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	Yes, when you have a miscarriage you can have heavy bleeding.<br>  But not always.<br>  Some women usually with the first pregnancy can have a miscarriage before knowing they were even pregnant. <br>  You tested positive at one point and now negative...<br>  I'd say you miscarried. <br>  The negative is saying your HCG level has gone down from when you tested positive.<br>  If you were still pregnant the HCG would be going up and still detected.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	when i had my miscarriage i had on and off small amounts of red light bleeding. I went to hospital they couldn't find the baby my hcg levels had also dropped too from 88 to 40. About a week later i started heavy bleeding and passed everything and never had any pain. I went back to the hospital a week after the bleeding and my hcg levels were 6 so i was still testing pregnant even though i wasn't. I am very sorry but it does sound like a miscarriage.|`|46K4FtE0aa	A miscarriage can range from light spotting to a heavier than a period. Take a look at this page for more information.<br>  <a href="http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/miscarriage.html" rel="nofollow">http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/...</a><br>  If the tests you took were urine tests then yes you could still be pregnant, as you can have many false negative results but only rarely do you get a false positive result. The urine test relies on the hormones in your urine being a certain level, if your hormones fall a fraction below the required level, you will get a negative result. This can happen if you don't use the first urine you pass when you wake up, as the hormones your urine get diluted as the day wears on and you drink fluids.<br>  my daughter used urine tests from the doctors and the chemist and she onloy got a positive when she was 4 months pregnant, this also happened with her second pregnancy. But she never had a blood test, i would say ask the doctor to take a pregnancy blood test, that should show if there are any pregnancy hormones present.|`|kTu7UtS1aa	It sounds like a chemical pregnancy to me.  That means that you tested positive really early, but the embryo did not attach, so it comes out with your period.  This is SO common that most women don't know it's happening because it just comes out with your period.  People who are trying to conceive are usually the ones to test early, so they are also the ones to notice the chemical pregnancy.  I was 8 weeks when I had my miscarriage and the bleeding was like my worst period, times 10.  I bleed so much!  I had to change my pads about every 30 mins.  I finally had to have a D&C done.  I hope this helps.  Good luck to you.
AA12273294	well you have to have the diapers and formula those are a must along with the cloths and maybe some snacks but if they are not sick at the time leave the meds and everything else out especially for short trips or visits.|`|X6as2nOAaa	That sounds good, I have a 7 month old and I always have her snacks, binki, a pair of extra clothes, baby food, 2 bibs, diapers, wipes, formula and her bottle, I also have her blanket with her as well. Also depending on where we are going I will throw some toys in|`|8lR6OvB6aa	Honestly you will be packing more than usual.Because you are packing for two. But to make it a little easier, you can take one bottle and a container with measured out formula and one sippy for your toddler. Then as for the diapers pack six of each.Then you can pack a changeing or two for each child. As for the meds, all you need is childrens tylenol and infants tylenol (ONE OF EACH) and any meds that your pediatrician perscribed.Do not forget the bibs and burp cloths. Have in your vehical some books and toys to keep your child(children) occupied.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Higher chance of NOT being pregnant.|`|AA11783622	I am so sorry for you. You and the rest of our young people are the product of this country not teaching you the basics....for almost 8 years.....<br>  How Not to Get Pregnant.<br>  <br>  And if you and mom never had a talk, you are doubly unaware.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, an erected penis is full of sperm, and it takes one swimmer. Sperm live up to 10 days in the vaginal area, and mother nature taught them which way to swim....., and eggs live up to five. And many women ovulate twice in one period. Do the math, hon. We are forever fertile.<br>  <br>  We didn't even teach you in school, that you are fertile every day of your cycle....even during bleeding!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  If you don't wish a pregnancy at this time, since you are under 18, bc pills are free at Planned Parenthood, and they won't even call your parents.<br>  <br>  Are you pregnant??? A hpt will tell you that 6 weeks after exposure. No one else can, hon.<br>  <br>  Take Plan B.  It is not an abortion pill.  Then get on bc pills, hon.  <br>  <br>  (PS.  We are ALL pro-life.......)<br>  <br>  (PPS  And we didn't teach the respondents above me that you are always fertile.  I am so sorry that you know so little about how your reproductive system works.)|`|kTu7UtS1aa	If your period is due, then you are not ovulating.  You can only get pregnant around your fertile time, which is a few days before you ovulate and the day of ovulation.  If you are correct in that your period is due, then you are not ovulating, which means that you cannot get pregnant.  But, this is all based on how correct your information is.  Good luck!|`|Y0bPQjSgaa	most likely your not. If youjust had unprotected sex yesterday you can be pregant and missing a period that was soppused to start two days ago. Stress is probably what it is. If you had sex before protected or not you could be. Go to the doctor and see in a week if you have not started|`|D1v4uf1xaa	not likely at all.  you are most fertile about 2 weeks after you start your period.|`|Lo7BrhPeaa	Well if the bottom of yor stomach hard? and maybe its just late or something so many ppl think there prago cuz of this soo dont worry
8x7rFddHaa	You would be really wise to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, a ruptured tube could cause life-threatening problems. I would think you'd test positive by now but what you're describing is enough reason for anyone to be checked. Many hospitals have free care, have you checked out this option? There are also many clinincs that offer free or adjusted care. I'd strongly suggest you to call your nearest hospital and have them advise you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
PTWnWkPRaa	Stay in the school that you are in now. Guys like that are immature and just dont care. I am very sorry to hear that you are in this dilema. Dont do something that you dont want to do, especially if there is a guy that still has his ex involved. So if you move in with him, his ex is going to stay with you also?? so he can take care of 2 babies from 2 diff. people, that is just strange. Just go with your gut feeling.|`|DDFSITiYaa	No  - dump his a**, sue for child support and follow your own path.  He's a loser.|`|qBFojHLMaa	wow. thats too bad that your already stuck in this situation. Umm... you need to leave him and learn to be happy on your own so that your child doesnt learn such hurtful behavior|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	he is a loser and a player. your baby does not need to be in this situation
pXSKSS3daa	Our beagle(she was about one when we brought our son home) had never been around infants either. She had SOME association with smaller children but not enough to gauge how she would react around our son.<br>  <br>  We allowed her to sniff some of his things and to check him out(without getting in his face) when we first brought him home. To be honest, I think she was a bit afraid of him. My husband would hold both of them in his lap to show Molly(our dog) that it was okay and to make sure we weren't pushing her out. Showing your dog plenty of attention is key because you don't want him to get jealous and still want him to feel part of the family.<br>  <br>  Just don't leave your baby and the dog alone in any rooms and you should be fine. Allow your dog to "investigate" some but don't let him get carried away(sniffing baby's face/licking baby's face).<br>  <br>  Our son is now 11 months old and LOVES both of our pets. Our dog lets him pull her ears/fur and she plays with toys with him(he'll take it, give it back, take it, etc.), it's very cute.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Get a squirt gun or even a squirt water bottle. our Shar Pei was jelous at first, but playfull and to keep him settled down we would give a quick squirt.<br>  Godd Luck and God Bless.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I don't know much about beagles and their temperament but we have a great dane and was a mini horse when I had my son.  The only thing we did with her was take her to parks where kids played and she got used to "little people" and we also played audio of babies crying from the internet.  When my son was born we brought her to my inlaws to stay for a week while we settled in and my husband brought over his first hat so that she could sniff it.  And then he would bring her home once a day (first day for one hour, 2nd day for two) and she was completely fine with it and even though she is huge she is so good with him and lets him sit on her.|`|YjkaJtGyaa	We let our dog sniff baby blankets that belonged to my son so the dog could get use to the smell first. We tried to never yell at our dog as well, when he got to close to the baby. Your dog my surprise you ours use to keep vigil beside the crib at night, my son actually learned to walk by pulling up on our dog.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	We have two border collies who were 2.5 years when we brought our new daughter home.  They are active dogs!  We did the following to get them used to the baby:<br>  <br>  -Put the baby seat in the car a month in advance so that this new intrusion on their space wasn't associated with the arrival of the baby<br>  <br>  -Set up the baby's room in advance and spent time in it with them, playing and being affectionate with them so that the change in the room didn't upset them.  Also, they are allowed in the baby's room now.  When she cries from her crib (ie. getting up from a nap), I encourage them to come along to get her.  I say "The baby's crying!  What's wrong?  Where's the baby?"  They put their paws up on the crib rail and look in on her.  She loves it.  They do too.  It's a fun game.<br>  <br>  -Gave the dogs lots of affection and treats while holding the baby... if they think that good things come while this baby is around, the baby must be good!<br>  <br>  -Didn't make the baby "off-limits".  We let them sniff her and lick her hand.  Some people will shoo a dog away if he even looks in a baby's direction.  This does not set up a good relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, our daughter is 6 months and starting food.  The dogs are VERY interested in this development!  They will gently take a teething biscuit from her hand if she holds it out to them.  I don't stop this because I want them to realize that treats can come from her too.  Another reason to like her!  I don't, however, let them just take stuff from her... only if she "offers" the food to them.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that you can NEVER trust a dog with a baby or small child, no matter how "good" he/she is with kids.  The unexpected can happen.  You always hear about those awful stories where "Buddy wouldn't hurt a flea... but then he mauled my 2-year old".  Dogs are all about pack hierarchy.  If they see an opportunity to raise their status, they will take it, and that is dangerous for a small child.|`|8lR6OvB6aa	You could take something that the baby has worn and let the puppy smell it, do this over a periood of time and you will see that the dog will be protctive over the baby.
z2p9JPwZaa	I am on the pill and the doctor told me that changes in your cycle are all ok on the pill because it is due to your hormones and since you haven't taken it like you normally due it probably just through your body off of its normal course i wouldn't be worried but if there is still concern that you think you are pregnant take another test in a few days. good luck
u8VnsJ4eaa	I'm in the same boat as you.  The only thing you can do, if you're still testing negative on home pregnancy exams, is to go to the doctor.  They will probably do a blood test to see if you are pregnant.  If you aren't they can help find out what is wrong so you start getting AF again. Good luck in whatever outcome you're seeking!|`|ycqXAzdWaa	my last period was like jan 20th and i didnt get a period in feb either. so were in the same boat! i havent taken a test yet.. i'm to scared it will say no!|`|FtyBLEC7aa	i know the feeling my last period was jan 15th I've had six negative tests with today being the most recent so i'm just now assuming I haven't ovulated this cycle|`|23gdO7cDaa	if u were preg result should have been positive by now.just go to doc.
1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Could be cysts, could be endo like you mentioned.  If it is you don't automatically have to get a hysterectomy because of it.  You're doing all you can by going to the doctor.  The best advice I can offer is to make note of all symptoms and all questions you have for the doctor, and make sure to speak specifically about your fertility.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, you're heading in the right direction!!|`|LtITBz5Saa	you might have endometriosis and not know it. talk with your ob/gyn and discuss your problems that your having. you have a higher risk of having endo since your mother has it(dosent mean you have it just means a higher risk). also try losing weight your a little overweight and being overweight and getting preggo can cause problems with the pregnancy and baby. also start taking prenatal pills and folic acid. hopefull you and your hubby can have another baby soon. btw i had all the symptoms as you and i have endo and my mother has the same symptoms as you as well but has fibroids so the symptoms your having could be that or something else|`|5iQj68cdaa	May be a chocolate cyst of ovary! get ahead and a scan done, need not get worried, still u can conceive,good luck|`|stRWElvPaa	I would say that it could possibly be symptoms of endometriosis, but don't worry, they have ways of dealing with that these days like corrective surgery and dnc type procedures. I would advise you to lose weight by going on a low gi diet or simply cutting the calories. I know this is hard trust me, I took 3 whole years to find the motivation to go on a healthy diet because I love biscuits and chocolate and anything sweet lol. <br>   But 2 weeks ago I decided that I had to change my situation if I wanted a higher chance of conceiving, because you see excess fat produces excess estrogen, which can aggravate endometriosis by the way, and excess estrogen produced by the fat can suppress ovulation.<br>    I would start charting your temperatures using fertilityfriend.com and maybe go on ebay and look for cheap ovulation predictor kits to see if you do ovulate. good luck and baby dust.
rOFteEdlaa	most cribs have the instruction's on the crib board(the board that holds the ' up) but i believe all you have to do it take the one side of the crib wall(the one that slides) off and screw the side bars onto the crib(should be 1 or 2 to keep the child from falling out of bed) lol sorry don't know the real terms|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Most cribs that convert to a toddler bed just require you remove one side (if there is a drop down side, remove that one), adding anchors to keep the mattress from sliding out, then attaching the toddler rail.<br>  <br>  Here is the catch. Most convertible cribs don't include the toddler rail. It is at least $50 and most toddler bed frames in fun designs cost $50 as well.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	go to the website of the manufacturer of the crib.  they will have instructions or atleast a hotline to call
AA10249078	Etiquette stipulates that one should not host their own baby shower. So, when you send out the invitations, make sure that someone such as a sister, cousin, best friend or mother (as you mentioned) is named as hostess. <br>  <br>  Having the shower at your place is perfectly acceptable, as long as your moth acts as the hostess when the event takes place.<br>  <br>  Often a BBQ baby shower is planned for couples. The baby shower invitations are sent to couples and is usually held on a weekend or at a time when the men can attend as well.  These BBQ baby showers actually turn into a lot of fun, more like a regular party without all the cutsie pink and blue decor.<br>  <br>  You need to put aside your own feelings about opening gifts in front of your guests.  When people take the time and make the effort to give you and your baby a gift, they want to know that you appreciate their gift. If they've really gone to a lot of thought and effort, they look forward to seeing your expression when you see their gift.<br>  <br>  Don't disappoint them. Exude enthusiasm for each gift, finding something nice to say, and be sincere. Even if you've just opened your 10th diaper bag, be just as enthusiastic.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby and I hope you have a wonderful shower!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I feel the same as you. I hate the opening of gifts in front of people and passing it around. I want a shower like yours! <br>  <br>  WHen I had my wedding shower my mom made me open the gifts because she said people wanted to see what other people got me. So I did it, but I refused to pass things around. <br>  <br>  It may be nice to open gifts in front of people. I gues if I got something for someone I may want to see them open it.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Please reconsider openly throwing yourself a baby shower. It's kind of a faux pas... somebody else is supposed to do it for you. Otherwise, it looks like you are just sucking around for gifts, lol.<br>  <br>  You should open the gifts while the guests are there. No need to do the usual games if you don't want to. A BBQ sounds good!|`|1bnhwGACaa	we are doing the same thing and my baby brother is throwing at our house so everyone can see his room and i dont have to lug all the stuff home <br>  it is coed and that way my hubby doesnt feel akward|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Most people want to see you open the gift they brought you.  You're better off opening them while guests are there.  Someone may be offended if you make them leave before they see the gift opening.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Open the presents in front of them and be happy (if you're not just pretend :])|`|2a018170ff75d363213a98baeae86b10aa	Are you going to do a whole roast baby or parts like a chicken?|`|x7jAisPbaa	I'm like you. I hate being the centre of attention and hate playing games. I think it's cool if you don't want to play games or do all the "traditional" shower things, but I would strongly suggest that you still have a cake and open the gifts with your guests present. I know that as a guest, I would be sort of offended to not watch you open the gift. It's really more for them then it is for you at that point. If you get doubles or something you do not like, return it later, but DO NOT forget to write thank you notes first! <br>  <br>  Good Luck my dear!|`|KAj7GfeDaa	BBQ baby shower? Hmmm... that sounds yummy, but I think your guests would enjoy watching you open the presents they bought you!|`|QP62szAuaa	Either way works.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Good luck!<br>  <br>  I just wanted to tell you thank you for posting this; I have never heard of it.  If this is something I can do w/ my clotting disorder (severely limits my BC options), I'm going to seriously consider it.  Thank you, again.|`|j2mRop0laa	Thanks for posting this. We are sure we aren't having any more kids, but for some reason when I just asked my husband to look over the website he said "Uhm, No. Permanent? Absolutely not."<br>  I don't get it..

I say this because there is always that small risk of something like that happening before the tissue starts to grow around it all! But other than that, yes, it would cut down recovery time and everything! <br>  I'd check into if insurance covers it or not, and how much you'd have to pay for it as opposed to the "conventional" method. If it is reasonable and you are very very very shure you are done having kids then go for it!<br>  You will be able to tell us how it went if you do decide to do it so we will all have some idea from someone who actually did it! :)|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Sounds like a great solution to those women who permanently do not wish to have any more children. BUT it's still fairly new and I'd be hesitant to use it until there is more research done. 5 years is not a long time when it comes to research.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	If you are sure then I think this sounds great. I had not heard of this but I'm so glad to hear there are better, permanent options now. Just a ten minute procedure, no pain afterwards and little to no recovery- what more could you ask for?|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	I looked into this and it has only been on the market for five years and it was only tested for five years. It is inserted without need of surgery which is a big plus, but the big con is the uncertainty of long term ramifications on a woman. Also, there is no turning around as it pretty much corrodes and plugs up your tubes. But the big plus is that there are zero reported cases of pregnancy in all ten years. Not one person has gotten pregnant, while surgery has 1 out of 100 people getting pregnant within a year. So, it is an idea if you are willing to take the risk. I personally want to wait at least five more years before considering this process. I do not want any more kids, but I do not want surgery either.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I would not try any type of birth control that is that new.  A lady who works in my office has a sister in law that died of a stroke after switching to Mirena (I am not saying that it was the birth control methods fault, but she was 32 and in perfect health).  I personally do not use any form of birth control (obviously that is how I had the boy, lol) but on a serious note I would stick with a non hormonal treatment (condoms) just to be on the safe side.  Although I have been told that I am a little paranoid.  I just know how short life can be and I do not want to help it along.
ZPVRxV4taa	Love it!<br>  I think its great that your hubby thought of it!<br>  I love the name Elizabeth, itz classic and strong. so that's what I'm naming my lil girl due in May. Also its my middle name also, I think itz important to have a reason for a name that is more than just 'i found it in a book', ya know. For a middle name we picked Darlene which is my mother-in-law's middle name, thus both sides of the family are represent in her.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	"Cute" alternative spellings of names are a pain in the long run.  Sure, it looks nice to you, but everyone will call her the same thing and not be visualizing the letter in their heads.  More importantly, it means a lifetime of having to spell the name every time you tell it to someone who needs to take it down.  She may as well add at the end of spelling out H-A-I-L-E-E for everyone, "yes, my parents are spelling challenged, but it made them feel unique at the time."  Reconsider standardized spelling for her future convenience.  And hey, she'll like being able to find stuff with her name on it as kid too.<br>  <br>  Other than that, it's a beautiful name.|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Very nice name :) Congrats  <br>  <br>  <br>  I like layla to tho :)|`|1JAIyyMqaa	I like it.

Ccq8zEcnaa	You should start to feel little flutters, kinda feels like popcorn popping in you at first.. But you should feel movements any day now. Mine were very faint until the baby reached about 20 weeks, then the rolls and jabs and kicks really started coming. I wouldn;t worry too much about it. Try to drink some cold water or eat a meal, and lay down on your left side and wait to see if that will make your little one move.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I am 18 weeks pregnant with #2 and just within the last week started feeling movements which aren't even that frequent, they're just every now and then. Every pregnancy is different and you don't always feel them earlier with subsequent pregnancies like the books say. A lot of it can depend on if you've gained weight since your last pregnancy, or your baby may be facing anteriorly which can make it harder to feel the movements.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	it should start earlier with each pregnancy, maybe its a smaller baby than the other two? maybe the sac is much bigger? you should be getting flutters by now especially since its your 3rd pregnancy|`|WvWFmwQoaa	this is my first pregnancy and i started feeling movement at around 17 weeks and my bf started feeling movement outside my tummy at around 21 weeks so i would imagine you will start to feel her/him move shortly if not then you should talk to your doc/mid wife and just ask them for their opinion just to be sure. your baby will start off with little movements and and then weeks by week when she gets stronger the movement will become allot stronger and you will notice them more often. she may be moving more often then you think it may be just that you are not feeling her due to you moving around through out the day, take some time to relax and just lie/sit down and feel her move. when you are moving you tend to not be able to feel your baby moving even tho she/he is.|`|CGFAPKJOaa	You can feel flutters anytime between 16-20 weeks. I don't know really, I'm still waiting to feel mine too, although I felt the "flutters" a couple days ago. I'm only 16 weeks though.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Every pregnancy is different. By 20 something weeks I know I felt big movements so just wait a few more weeks.|`|YuA7a08Maa	It's different by the pregnancy, I think.  I started feeling some at 15 weeks, but my sister-in-law didn't feel hers until 25 weeks.  Maybe you have a mellow baby that doesn't make as "huge" of movements as your previous pregnancies.  I wouldn't worry until after 20 weeks.  Good luck!|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I'm 7.5 months pregnant and I was worried with this one too 'cause I was sure that with my first I felt movements before 5 months. Anyway, with this one I didn't feel anything until almost 6 months. The Dr says he/she is as healthy as ever and that there are no worries. The kicking will come - don't worry!
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Yes, I do. Except I look younger. I look 16/17, but I'm 18. So I can still get away with cheaper bus fairs and get away with other discounts. I have dimples on my cheeks that give me a real baby face. It's pretty good...except for when I constantly have to give out ID to people to prove I'm 18. When I'm old I'll love my youthful look much more. <br>  <br>  :)|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I definitely take advantage of it, I just turned 16, but when I'm dressed up I look 21.

I guess they respect me more, because i look older?<br>  <br>  Once some young girl came up to be and was hysterical because she thought i was someone Famous (i have NO idea who). I had to try to tell her i wasn't who she though i was, but she didn't believe me, LOL.

OPhMTPqyaa	It's highly unlikely this is all due to the epidural. It's VERY RARE for the epidural to have any long term problems. <br>  The epidural injection actually paralyzes the nerves to the bowel and bladder for a short period<br>  There is always a small risk of damage to the spinal nerves. The spinal cord is a bundle of millions of nerves connecting the brain with the rest of the body. If the epidural needle directly injures the spinal nerves, it may result in injury to the nerves.|`|9P8WJVNsaa	Congrats!  I had a baby on 1/26 and the same thing happened to me with the epidural.  With my first child, my leg kicked up big time when I got the shot.  With my second child, they had to poke me twice...and boy did it hurt!  My leg also kicked up again and they also got upset with me because I moved.  My whole hospital experience with the second child wasn't that great so the epidural problem was just one of several issues I had.  <br>  <br>  What has been happening to me is a buzzing feeling down my legs when I slightly tap it with my finger.  I don't have any pain in the shot area though.<br>  <br>  I have called my ob/gyn's on call nurse several times and they are always helpful.  I would call your doctors office just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Also, with this recent baby, I actually felt most of what was going on.  I knew that the epi was still in effect, but it was different because I didn't feel a thing with my first.  With this baby, I felt each contraction after 7cm too, and some sensation of the head coming out, but I didn't feel the cut of the episiotomy.  So at least I was spared the pain of that...which I pray I will never get again!<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!|`|PYIA2FCFaa	hmmmm I know with my epidural I was sore in that spot for a couple months. But, i wasnt in real pain when I moved and such. <br>  <br>  I would def tell your gyno about it and see if they can recommend you to a doctor who specializes in the back. it might be possible they hit a nerve. awe, i hope you feel better and that its nothing serious.<br>  <br>  congrats on your new bundle of joy!!|`|v3LnJycKaa	let me tell you my story with my second...<br>  <br>  I got my epidural at about 3-4 cm, the anst. was newer and she was very rude and callous, it took her nearly 45 minutes to get the catheter into my spine, once in i could feel something was off, not right it was painful and tingling on my left side, i felt this pinchin in the same area... well then she gave me the syringe of saline to clean the line and a syringe of medicine to start the numbing, it was terrible, only one side got numb (the left side). She started talking to my hubby and the other anth. came in "dr bruce" my sister, who was an itern at the hosptial while getting her nursing degree started chatting with him as she knew him... well i laid back and everyone eventually left, about and hour into it my legs got really tingly and i knew something wasnt right, they felt like when your foot is alseep and starts to wake up, I called my hubby who followed the tubing which was ON THE FLOOR, not hooked into the infuser, they never plpugged me in to get any meds (45 MINUTES FOR NOTHING!) called the dr in and he said oh your only 6 your gonna be here another few hours... and left, I sat up started complaing to hubby, within ten minutes I souted GET THE DR SOMETHING IS WRONG... came running in I was 10 cm and the baby was crowing, I then pushed for 3 pushes felt everything... I was so angry.. the next day they anst. head came in to see how my experience was (verbal survey) I told him what happened and he said oh sorry, and left nothing else... to this day i get little shooting pains every now and again, dully pain in the center but only dont my left leg... etc... i think damage was done unfortuntely and all for nothing because i felt the entire birth.
1hciyvKdaa	The only sign I am aware of, is rapid weight gain. The Dr will monitor you, ask on your next visit if being hypoglacemic will affect your pregnancy or not. It was amazing my youngest really didnt gain much weight, but since she waited so long to seek medical assistace during pregnancy, they did that test and she was almost to the point of needing insulin, they had her taking blood tests all the time and read her readings journal weekly, she did great, we just have to hope that later in life theres no signs of gum disease/damage due to her being so out of control with it before getting it under control. Baby was fine at birth thank god!|`|oN9UNGZfaa	I had it and I started to feel kinda edgy real thirsty and tired Good luck
eXsR8Gx5aa	That's pretty much it - can she weight bear on her legs if you hold her hands? Can she pull herself up to sitting if you hold her hands? they should be trying that by 4-5 months too - soon she'll be moving on to sitting unaided, rolling the other way etc.<br>  <br>  My 7mo old sits unaided (has been since 6 months) laughs, babbles (dadadadadadada, lalalalalalalalalala, rararararararararara etc) tries to clap, can "high 5" me when I hold up my palm & say high five to him.|`|h85kkDsbaa	Sounds like shes doing well to me<br>  <br>  Have a look at this:<a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/development/04mth/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/develop...</a>|`|dpOJwPJbaa	You mean your baby is not throwing darts for your local darts team...<br>  <br>  You should probably get that seen about.|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	She's doing great. What a joy for you!<br>  <br>  If you any concerns, your health visitor should be able to keep you right, regarding development, centile charts etc.<br>  <br>  Have a lovely day!<br>  x|`|HCg0YZfXaa	sounds to me like she is doing really great. here is a website that might help you that i found. hope it helps.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	It sounds like she is doing good. Children develop differently, my daughter didn't start walking until she was 16 months old! But it definitely sounds like she is doing great!!|`|DDIBEvUTaa	sounds great.  You're going to be amazed at what she can accomplish over the next 1-2 months!|`|UghJ0XROaa	your baby is ahead of my oldest and behind my baby now. My daughter was about six months before she was rolling over or supporting her shoulders or attempting to sit up.<br>  My baby now is pulling herself up to sitting, although she can't balance yet, rolling in both directions, can do a baby push up to her knees.<br>  So i would say your baby is doing great.
deIzFnV8aa	Firstly, you do not HAVE to eliminate one of the four breastmilk feedings you get. People are all over the board on how often babies should nurse at any given age.  The AAP wants you to breast feed to 2 years!!!  And some people want to wean completely at 6 months!!! Those are two extremes, yet you will find studies and drs who support both.  Since there are so many conflicting opinions, I would advise you do to what YOU want and are comfortable with. I must say I am surprised at your drs advice, because everyone I know with babies your age is still BFing 4-5 times a day as well as solids, and all the drs at our pediatricians office really support frequent nursing up to a year.  But like I said, everyone can back up their opinion on this issue, so I think what matters is your opinion.  Your son is going to end up well fed and healthy in the long run anyway.<br>  <br>  I think it makes TONS of sense to eliminate a pumping. Like you said, all that washing, its harder and longer to pump, etc.  As long as YOU are comfortable with it and it isn't just daddy trying to weasel out of helping :P (just joking on that last bit).<br>  <br>  I think it usually takes 3-4 days for your body to adjust to a new nursing schedule. If you are feeling uncomfortable you can pump just enough to let some of the pressure out; just that little bit shouldn't keep your supply up.<br>  <br>  I find rereading your post that I am increasingly annoyed with your dr for being so exact about what you should be feeding your son. If you want to decrease nursing at this age, that's fine, and you should be proud of BFing so long, because it is very challenging and time  consuming for the mom.  I can totally understand moving more to solids at tihs point because you are sick and tired of nursnig. But to to practically force you to cut back so much at such a young age when the majority of current thought (and of course the AAP) says "the more breast milk in the first year, the better", is ridiculous.  <br>  <br>  I know that may not be helping your feel better, and I'm sorry :( The point I am trying to make all through this is that it is your decision and not your doctors, and you should feel confident in whatever choice you make.  In this kind of debatable situation, what you feel is right for you and your son IS the thing that is right.  And no need to feel guilty about making the right choice, is there? :P|`|x033QQA7aa	If your DR. said that is the best thing to do then you are doing the right thing.  It will take a couple of weeks for your body to adjust.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I think if you feel that bad about it, you are not quite ready to stop. I think 3 nursings a day is too little if that is all he is drinking. <br>  <br>  I think you need to do what feels right for you, not what the doctor tells you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you follow through with cutting back-it will probably take about a week to adjust to not feeding at lunch time.|`|f8ed07139ed0b8e2bee89c46a751f7d3aa	First of all, it's great that you are still breastfeeding. The newest research is that it's best to continue breastfeeding up to 18 months old, because that is the most active brain development time. Secondly, it is up to you which breastfeeding time to eliminate, and if you really enjoy the morning and evening feeding times, then the lunch time was your best option. It seems right for your baby too if he was getting reluctant to use a bottle. Maybe he's ready for toddler cups?|`|68c6B8dRaa	He is old enough to have solids instead of milk while you're away and nurse while you're at home -- see <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/17feed_baby_working_moms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/17feed_ba...</a> for one -- but WTF is your pediatrician doing directing the nursing like that? That's a pathological amount of control. You are not getting good breastfeeding advice from your doctor; look elsewhere for nursing support. A 9mo does NOT _need_ three non-milk meals a day.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	That doctor is an a$$hole.  Doctors do not know jack **** about breastfeeding.  Nurse your baby.  Solids are just for fun until about 1 yr.  The baby can and will grow just fine on bm plus he will be healthier.<br>  <br>  Please listen to your own heart.  Why do you feel guilty, do what is right for you and for your family.  Take the doctor's advice with a grain of salt, especially if your baby is growing and thriving.  The doctor will have you weaning at 1 year at this rate.  Is that what you want.  If it's what you want fine, but if not then go with your heart.
Io28z8l2aa	you should discuss this with your doctor as i think it depends on the specifics of the surgery that took place.<br>  <br>  some women with implants find that they do not produce enough milk, whereas others breastfeed successfully. also, the scarring can make breastfeeding more painful for some. <br>  <br>  of course, women without implants also find breast feeding difficult, and often face problems. so i guess talking to your doctor and deciding if you want to try is a good option to take.

1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Not just on a whim.  She would need to re-lactate, and that takes time and energy and usually medication.  She couldn't just say "oh I'll bf your baby tonight while you're out" after not bf'ing for a while.  The milk isn't just Always there after you have a child.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	actually anyone can lactate if they allow a baby to latch on to them. the body automatically responds to that and they will produce milk. its like a survival mechanism.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	She could but the kid wont have any milk unless she continues to have the baby suckle for about a year on a regular basis then she could lactate<br>  National geographic<br>  Tyffannie|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yes if she is producing milk, no if she isnt|`|AiJeS6I1aa	"Just Me" is right.  It takes time to develop milk production if this other woman is not currently lactating.  This takes lots of effort with breast stimulation and medication (domperidone).<br>  <br>  I think that people are missing the point though.  It is not safe to have someone else feed your baby.  Some diseases are passed through body fluids like milk... for example, HIV.  So, I would be careful.|`|DDFSITiYaa	The short answer is yes, she potentiall could eventually.  But you do not automatically lactate if you have not just given birth.  To relactate, you must work at stimulating the milk production and that would require frequent attempts at nursing and/or pumping.  This would require several days to build up.  In addition, the amount of milk produced may not be enough to sustain an infant.  <br>  <br>  So it would be unlikely she could produce milk on the spot.  <br>  <br>  I doubt men can lactate - they do not have milk ducts!|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Yes, you can lactate without ever having children.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	If the women is still breastfeeding her 3 year old then she could breastfeed anyone. If her milk has dried up, then no, it takes months and alot of nursing to build a milk supply. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Yes, because as long as the baby latches her body will respond to this and create milk.  It's crazy, but it happens.|`|2jrffIoWaa	no.|`|AA10615926	is she still lactating?  If so then yes.|`|bQ0PpuSyaa	thats just gross|`|AA11210211	Yes she can,you do not have to have a child to lactate.Even men can lactate|`|tZt7fUYYaa	yeah she can.

KPuDlWFiaa	im 30 weeks pregnant with my first and i suffered morning sickness until i was 14 weeks. I'm having a boy, but my 3 mates are also having boys and have had no morning sickness at all!!|`|WvWFmwQoaa	there are so may old wives tales lol i was told that because i got really bad food smells like food would just reek all the time and the smell would just make me want to be sick and that because ever sine i have gotten pregnant i haven't been able to eat meat that i was having a boy lol well i went to my ultrasound and me and my bf wanted to know what we were having so we got her to have a look and in the ultrasound and she said that we were having a girl lol so i don't really know you'll just have to wait and see hahaha the only way to be sure is to have the little one and see for your self lol..<br>  good luck and i hope you get the sex that you want.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Not true, your sickness is caused by your hormone levels. And hormone levels are the same whether you are carrying a boy or girl. I know women that were sick and had girls, sick and had boys, not sick and had a girl, not sick and had a boy. It really just depends on each pregnancy and each person. I wouldn't stress over it, and if you really want to find out what the sex of your baby is, then talk to your doctor about ordering an ultrasound scan.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I was always told the opposite. With my first, I never had morning sickness and had a girl.  With my second I had morning sickness and it's another girl!!<br>  <br>  Edit - morning sickness is NOT a sign of a healthy pregnancy.  I never had morning sickness with my first and had a perfect pregnancy.  With this one I had morning sickness and the pregnancy has been not nearly as good.  Some people get morning sickness and some don't, it does not mean anything except that some people are luckier than others!!|`|sqaey2Siaa	All those "wives tales" are completely untrue. I had alot of sickness with my first son, i am now 20 weeks with my second son and wouldn't even know i was pregnant if it weren't for this growing belly and the ultrasounds to prove it. That myth is NOT TRUE.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	Not true I have four grown children(Adults now) and with my first pregnancy a daughter I had terrible all day sickness. My second pregnancy was my one and only son no sickness at all or with my further two pregnancies.|`|i4zKc2bhaa	i threw up every day more than once for 9 looong months...and have a little girl.<br>  <br>  the only think morning sickness is a sign of is a healthy pregnancy.|`|VhH9RJrSaa	well i dont mean to damper your joy , you may be having a boy but i never got sick not once. every one is different. your mid-wife is incorrect.<br>  my little boy is now 11 weeks!|`|a9btWYKRaa	Not True. I have two girls and had really bad sickness with both of them. Don't believe your going to a certain sex by hearing 'old wives tales'. I was convinced I was having a boy my second time round because everything was so different to my first, But I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.<br>  <br>  If you do not intend to find out the sex of your baby before the birth try not to let these things get yo your head. You don't want to get your hopes up and then feel bad afterwards.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I'm sure the sickness will pass soon (hopefully anyway) x|`|1F6KJt0oaa	No.  I know a nurse that will tell you she knows what you will be having based on how you carry it or what you crave or how the spiders spin webs in your house or other crazy things and says there are medical explanations for it.  There aren't.  Sometimes the old wives' tales are surprisingly accurate but they are more like 50% accurate at best which isn't much better than cold guessing.  An ultra sound is the best way to find out and even then it isn't fool proof.|`|aGxbD6snaa	its possible but each pregnancy is different regardless of sex. i also heard it and i didnt have sickness with my daughter. maybe you are having a boy, try the chinese gender prediction calendar just to see the possibility as this was also right for me. good luck.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I have an 18 month old daughter and was sick as a dog with her. I'm 35 weeks pregnant with a boy now, and haven't really been sick at all. So it's definitely not true. Good luck and congrats!|`|U2tx9gDHaa	No that is not true.If that was the case then every body would be nearly sure of what they were having. I do know that you get really really sick with twins though.|`|otFCWMuUaa	i had morning sickness like you wouldnt believe for the first 4 1/2 months and im having a girl...|`|H0fXySX9aa	no its not true i have girls and was sick all the time <br>  my friends have 11 boys between them and none of them had sickness<br>  sickness is due to high HCG levels|`|jcXSNjowaa	I dont think its true.<br>  <br>  But! i had morning sickness with my 2 boys and im currently just queezy, i havent thrown up yet.. Girl please lol.|`|nyDPFTT7aa	i heard that my friend had morning sickness with her first child and he was a boy and she only felt nauseous with her second which is a girl on it's way.xxx|`|1JECl7CVaa	No. My mum had really bad sickness and she had 2 girls. My friend had not one minute of sickness and had a little boy.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and Take care|`|VMASMHX6aa	I've heard it the other way round - less sickness with boys!|`|lymCWLcaaa	not true every pregnancy is different|`|3oSQQt6maa	I have two boys and i have never gotten sick with them. Not true.|`|jiTKnCKpaa	Ive had two daughters and was sick with them nearly all the ay through my pregnancy.|`|bmwTSnBfaa	Old wives tales are never true!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I was sick from sun up to sun down with both my boy and girl.  Good luck!|`|cnIzqEoDaa	Not true, mine was the other way around. I was horribly sick with my two girls and didn't even get nauseated with my boy. I do think it's possible that each sex may give a pregnant woman opposite symptoms from the other. That was my experience.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	It's different for everyone. For me, my sickness last up to 6 months with my son and throughout my pregnancy with my daughter. My daughter the worst one I have so far. I am currently pregnant with my third one and it's not so bad like my two kids before.|`|4GwTDea1aa	I've actually heard the opposite! Also im having a girl and was nauseated all the time my first trimester and my co worker has not been sick once and just found out on Tuesday she is having a boy. Probably just an old wives tail but still fun..!<br>  Good Luck!|`|0YdWJVyAaa	i think this is just old wives tales , i have 2 boys and a baby girl , and i didnt get morning sickness in all 3 pregnancies , its just that every pregnancy is different from the other .|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Theres different myths about everything! I heard you get sick when you are having a girl. Its all a myth, dont believe it. Just wait till ur 5 months u/s so they can tell you the gender, dont believe none of that stuff. Congrats!|`|QwYxjjeraa	SOOOOOO not true my mum had me and spent 8 months in hospital on a drip and im a girl she pent 8 month in bed sick pregnant wit my sis and had a great pregnaancy wit no sickness and had a boy|`|BMrnl372aa	if your talking about morning sickness its not true. i was sick all through my preg with my daughter and was feeling good with my son. just depends on your body and the hormones with each baby. each one is unique|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I was told it was bad sickness for a girl! I think it is an oldwives tale as my midwife told me bad sickness is just a rapid increase of hormones.|`|hsp7f9Epaa	I dont know see with my son I was not sick but with my daughter i was always sick|`|ulrnmasZaa	Well i think everyone is different i have 2 boy's and i wasn't sick at all..funny thing is i heard the same when your pregnant with a girl.....but who knows maybe??|`|46PSDx1raa	I've gotten morning sickness throughout my entire pregnancy and I'm having a girl. It depends on your body.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I had horrible sickness, plus migraines and I had a little girl!|`|GxKfvloHaa	I dunno if thats true but when I was pregnant with my son I was awful sick|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	No not true. I had the worst morning sickness with my daughter, and my mother had morning sickness with all her children (3 girls, 1 boy).|`|N6cuuDAmaa	I don't think that's true!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Not true. I have 3 boys. Wasn't sick one day with the first one. Was only sick for the first few weeks with the second one and with the third I was sick everyday the entire pregnancy with diarrhea and vomiting. Had to go get IV fluids twice bc i was so dehydrated. I lost 20 lbs before I gained an ounce almost into my 6th month. Thankfully he was perfectly fine and healthy. This time I have not been sick at all. I felt nauseous a few times but that is it. We don't know the sex of this baby though.|`|NKuQh4sSaa	It is an old wives tale .I was sick all the time with my eldest (a girl ), no sickness at all with my middle child (another girl) and very little sickness with my youngest ( a boy ).|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I've heard the opposite, don't believe anything you hear there is no way to tell what your having until the ultrasound. Congrats and good luck.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Not true I have a daughter and was sick 24/7 until I was about 4 months now with this one I dont know what it is but am not sick at all
muBb414baa	It really sounds like implantation bleeding. Implantation bleeding is exactly like what u described..plus not all women get implantation bleeding so you didnt have to have it with your  last pregnancy.  give it a few and take a test..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|65RZ441Zaa	Implatation bleeding is 6-8 days after conception sex, Implantation bleeding is vaginal discharge which usually contains a small amount of pinkish or brownish blood.<br>  here's someother info<br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #1<br>  <br>  Missed Period<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most obvious early symptom of pregnancy is when you've missed your period. This possible sign of pregnancy is often what causes women to search for more details about the other pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  Some women might only experience a much lighter period compared to their usual. You might not experience any of the pregnancy signs listed below until around the time you notice you've missed your monthly cycle.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #2<br>  <br>  Just "Feeling" Pregnant<br>  <br>  This early pregnancy symptom may be the reason why you are checking this list right now. Many women believe they have an intuition about pregnancy signs. Their intuition is often proven correct.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel different; tired, moody, queasy, lightheaded. You may also have heartburn, constipation, or find yourself making more frequent trips to the restroom. Perhaps you feel a dull ache or stiffness in your lower back, you have sore breasts or they seem overly sensitive, or you are simply not feeling like your usual self.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #3<br>  <br>  Breast Tenderness<br>  <br>  One of the very noticeable early signs of pregnancy is tender, swollen, somewhat sore breasts. You may notice this pregnancy sign at bedtime when you are trying to get comfortable and go to sleep, when exercising or showering, or when getting dressed.<br>  <br>  When you become pregnant, your body begins preparing your breasts for producing milk and breastfeeding. Hormones start increasing. In addition to breast tenderness and swelling, your nipples may feel sore or extra sensitive. Some women notice their nipples darken in color.<br>  <br>  Your breasts play an important role in childbirth. They are naturally sensitive and become far more so when pregnant. This is one of the most obvious early symptoms of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #4<br>  <br>  Fatigue<br>  <br>  One of the earliest pregnancy signs for some women may be fatigue and exhaustion. You may start going to bed sooner, or find it harder than usual to get out of bed in the morning. If you are working, by noon you may feel like you need to lie down. Exercising seems like too much effort. A simple activity like shopping may leave you feeling wiped out and lightheaded. This early pregnancy symptom is caused by all of the changes that your body is going through, plus the increasing levels of hormones.<br>  <br>  If you know you are pregnant, try to take frequent rests or naps of 15 minutes to a half-hour whenever possible. Explain to your family, friends and coworkers that you need these naps. Ask for their help in blocking out rest times for you.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #5<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination<br>  <br>  An early symptom of pregnancy that others may notice you experiencing is frequent trips to the restroom. Your family or friends may comment that you seem to be going off to the ladies room quite often lately. One cause of this pregnancy symptom is that the swelling uterus can put pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy causes extra body fluids to be processed by your kidneys and bladder. That means more trips to the restroom. Sorry to have to say this, but this symptom of pregnancy may remain constant for nine months.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #6<br>  <br>  Nausea<br>  <br>  One of these pregnancy signs of queasiness, nausea and vomiting can take you by surprise when you least expect it. These early pregnancy symptoms may come as soon as a week into the pregnancy. Many women experience nausea in the morning when they have coffee and/or eat something on an empty stomach. This is known as morning sickness (see below). Other women notice nausea in the afternoon or evening. Others feel queasy all day.<br>  <br>  This pregnancy symptom may often be helped by eating smaller, more frequent snack size meals. Many women say saltine crackers and milk seem to be helpful. This is an early symptom of pregnancy that seems to show up about a month after pregnancy has begun. It tends to level off once you are into your second trimester and your body adjusts to all the many changes it is going through.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #7<br>  <br>  Dizziness and/or Fainting<br>  <br>  One of the more surprising pregnancy signs is dizziness and/or fainting. Going up stairs, standing up suddenly after sitting for a time, or just having to stand in line at the grocery store can make you feel light headed. You might even faint. As the uterus swells it compresses arteries in your legs. This can drop your blood pressure and make you dizzy.<br>  <br>  A common early sign of pregnancy is that you may feel faint when you have gone a while without eating. This is due to low blood sugar, because that is your baby's main source of food. You want to eat frequent, healthy snacks to keep your blood sugar up. Stock up on portable lunch box foods you can take with|`|utfoP7GWaa	In my case implatatipn bleeding occurred 3 days before my expected period. It was only 1 dime sized spot of pink blood on the toilet paper, 3 days before my expected period and the day I expected my period it happened one more time. implantation usually happens within a few days of your expected period that is why many women confuse it with a light period! The blood should only be light pink or brown. Hope this helps!|`|aYCjy8Neaa	sounds like implantation to me! Wait till ur periods due again and take a test! Good luck!!
y4Uliyq3aa	Wow! This Is a really hard question! I'll have to give you whatever comes to mind first. I would say my least favorite name for a Boy Is Frank. I basically have a bad association with the name but I have never liked the name to begin with. Not sure why....I guess because It just doesn't seem right to me. (If that makes any sense) I really can't stand old, old fashioned names like Gertrude. (Simply horrible. Lol) More modern day however would have to be Jennifer. That was the first name that can to mind. I just dislike It very much! <br>  <br>  God Bless~<br>  Morgan Leilani|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	We like or dislike names because of  associations.  New mothers see their friends' babies and they associate the names with cuteness.  That's why we go through cycles where everyone and their brothers and sisters are named Ashley, Kaitlyn, Jennifer, Taylor, Tyler, Emily, etc.  <br>  <br>  Now look at names from the old generation.  Would you name your daughter Edna, Mildred, Agnes? Or your son George, Elmer, Clarence?|`|T1qzML1Zaa	I agree 100% with "11 Little Cowboys and Indians". The names that I think of that I don't like are Ashley, Jessica, Crystal and Jenna and/or Jennifer/Jen.

It sounds like a bunch of harsh consonants mushed together. Every time I hear it, I think of a chubby, rude, scowling little brat of a girl in a pink pouffy dress. Horrid.<br>  <br>  Emily~ Dull, common, overused and sounds like the parents put absolutely no thought into the name whatsoever- just looked up the most common girl name for the past 10 years and chose that one.<br>  <br>  Nevaeh~ Trashy, made-up, trailor-park name that pretty much destines the child to get pregnant at eleven.<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Brody/Brady/Brayden/Bryden~ Sounds like an extremely wimpy, coward of a boy.<br>  <br>  Michael~ See Emily.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah~ ... was a bullfrog- not a human being.<br>  <br>  I know I have more that I can't stand, but these are my top (of should I say bottom?) three for each gender.<br>  ?

Either way..it's ugly.|`|kAvgkLxPaa	I hate some names because of personal associations. They are just normal to others, but they remind me of something or someone I don't want to associate myself or my child with.<br>  <br>  For example, Natalie was the name of a horrible classmate of mine in middle school. She was rich, had everything she wanted, and couldn't care less about what others feel. And unfortunately, I was in the same class as her for 4 years. I could never name my child Natalie for that reason alone. However, I do love Natalia because it's the name of my singing teacher, who's a great lady and extremely sweet.<br>  <br>  The other names I don't like stem from them either being too old, or outright too trendy. For example, I would never name my child Gertrude or Edna. I also hate -son names on girls and trendy unisex names, like Madison, Kaden, Jayden, Aiden, Hayden, etc. as well as trendy mispellings of names. Maddisyn, Cadyn, Jaxon, Adisyn, Raechyl, Madalyn (I don't mind Madeline or Madeleine, but I absolutely hate any other spellings of it). To me, they simply look like the parents couldn't spell.|`|uKFgRHeqaa	I hate the name Heather just because of name relation with a person. <br>  i like unique names like Kayleigh or Mackenzie or stuff.<br>  <br>  i know a girl named Andromeda (she goes by Andi) and her sister is Orion. i think thats cool.<br>  <br>  <br>  and i have a friend named Estrella (es-tray-uh) is peruvian and very cute. we call her star or trella|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I don't really like names that are misspelled to the point where I can't recognize how to say them.<br>  <br>  I mean.  Madison's not my favourite name.  But I'd take that over Mahdysynne anyday, thank you very much.<br>  <br>  I also hate names that sound like usernames or sentences.  Like Whisper Secrets and Blue Skye (both of which are names I've seen suggested on Y!Answers)<br>  <br>  I'm not a huge fan of chavvy names(i.e. Crystal, Diamond or Chardonay) either.  I just think that they're kinda cheesy and tacky.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I can't think of anything specific, but I really hate to see perfectly nice names trashified by ridiculous spellings.

Kayden, Jayden, Aiden, Brayden. Etc. Oh and Madison. Not a fan of that either.|`|sqaey2Siaa	Most of the names I hate are because of someone reuining them for me, like it could be a great name, but if a little monster has that name..its hard to get by that thought and enjoy the name.

So I'm french and the names I hear alot are Michel, Luc, Eric, Denis...seems like every other boy is named like that...|`|9ff653285dcca235b469d9b2b3442377aa	I simply associate them with people I've known with the names...some just make me cringe.<br>  <br>  Like Abby/Abigail or Rachel.  Ugh...<br>  <br>  Plus I am Gen X...so names remind me of Garbage Pail Friends, too...<br>  <br>  Wrenching Gretchen or Smelly Melly, etc.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	My least favorite names are just ordinary to anyone else but I associate them with people I know or knew that were such jerks that I can't stand the name anymore.|`|kZqsWsv3aa	emily<br>  gertrude<br>  elizabeth<br>  alana<br>  there very common (almost) and remind me of either a pushover or a mean girl...but thats just me|`|kAuQugVKaa	I just don't like them!  It's difficult to explaine..... like why some people like some colors, but others don't like, etc.
28QPS6V9aa	Anytime after 20 if you're married, financially stable and don't need welfare. I had my first when I was 20 and I absolutely love being a young mom!|`|LtITBz5Saa	i hate kids so im with amanda c for me never and for other people i would say in their 30's when they have "been there done that" and ready to settle down, financially stable and ready to raise a child|`|K7H1zrCbaa	for me,  never.  for other people, probably best to wait till you've gotten a college degree, your married, have a very stable career, and financially pretty comfy.|`|SnanuNKiaa	there is no right age to get pregnant or not. everyone has thier own time. and it never works out the way you expect.  <br>  <br>  i'm 25 with my 1st pregnancy now. i tried to wait till im finacially stable, but the Lord had other plans.  things work out on thier own.
T0gv52CDaa	It will be just like any other internal exam you had while pregnant.  They will  use the speculum to open you up.  They will be looking to see if your cervix is closed.  If you had any tearing during the birth, they want to make sure that you have healed, and that any stitches you may have needed have dissolved.  If you are breast feeding, they will also examine your breast to make sure you aren't having any problems there.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	It'll be a pelvic exam, aka pap smear just like when you first got pregnant.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	They are just going to check things out, make sure everything is healing okay, and make sure your uterus is shrinking back down to normal size. Basically, it's the same as a pap.|`|7K6vpsdhaa	I didn't get an internal at my 6 week checkup, just got asked the usual questions. I didn't have any problems or stitches so had nothing to check up on. <br>  <br>  It shouldn't be more than a normal pap/smear test. Don't worry.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	Its pretty much just like going for a pap, they will use the speculum and look up there to make sure everything looks ok, I was in and back out in less than 5 min's!
u94HOVz7aa	when my son was really gassy and vomiting his dr. switched him to isomil advanced (similac soy).  now he is the happiest, easy baby.  he doesn't even spit up after eating either.  at his next appt. his dr. said he defiantly has a sensitivity to milk then.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	I know this isn't what you want to do obviously, but TRY to go more breast milk. Or put some breast milk in each bottle to try and help babies belly. It's hard for them to go back and forth. Also, similac is horrible (all my girlfriends that used it changed)... try enfamil Gentlease. Just go buy a can and try it out. Then, if that doesn't help you can try some soy. Also, talk to your Dr. first but one of my friends tried goats milk. I know that sounds weird, but hey... it worked! :) Good luck.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You should discuss this with his dr. Ask him if mixing that much between formula and breast milk is ok. That could be what is upsetting his stomach. I would choose one or the other. Goodstart is good formula. Don't make any switches before consulting the pediatrician.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Consult your peditrician from here..Obviously the baby is having digestive issues. Or you could try to use the breastmilk exclusively. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Try the soy formulas and if those don't work talk to a doctor.  My oldest had to be on Nutramigen and Alimentum for acid reflux.|`|x10qO89saa	same thing happened with my daughter, when i gave her formula i felt like she threw it all up... turned out she had milk protein intolerance. a type of lactose intolerance. so my doctor told me to give her similac alimentum and now she is doing great! also she had acid reflux and they gave me liquid zantac to give her so that might be something to ask the doctor next time you go. best of luck!|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Have you tried the similac soy formula (pink can)?  My son did great on this after we weaned from 50/50 breastmilk/formula to full formula.  His fussiness and spit up reduced dramatically within the first 2-3 days.|`|yoNXldH8aa	You can try the formula with the rice starch in it. It helps babies with acid reflux according to my pediatrician when it hits their stomach it makes them feel fuller.|`|59821ioeaa	My son used that formula and they switched him to Similac Isomil instead, no spit up and no vomit. It also helps with the breast feeding diarrhea factor if he has that problem.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I would try adding more breast milk. it's way easier on their digestive system. if that doesn't work he may be having a reaction to something your eating. the most common are milk citrus fruit and broccoli|`|sZ0McynSaa	Our first child had this problem and he had reflux, the only thing we found that sort-of calmed things down a little was to use the Nestle Brand of formula.|`|AA11280073	He may be allergic to milk. Ask your Dr. about a soy formula.
qsAnQa0Raa	With my first daughter I started to wear maternity pants around 6 months. I used the b-buckles through most of the pregnancy <a href="http://www.bizziemommy.com/wear-your-designer-jeans-during-your-pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bizziemommy.com/wear-your-des...</a><br>  <br>  Then with my 2nd I started to show so much faster, I think I was wearing maternity jeans at like 3-4 months. I just wore maternity jeans and t-shirts throughout my entire pregnancy. You can find some cute maternity t shirts at <a href="http://www.lalababyboutique.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.lalababyboutique.com.</a> I had the Jayden maternity t-shirt and Tiny Toes maternity t-shirt and received so many compliments it took the focus off of my expanding belly.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|BMrnl372aa	just depends on your body. i wore my normal jeans throughout my whole preg with my first and only wore maternity shirts starting at about 5 - 6 months. with my second i started weraing maternity pants at 4 months. so its all about when you start to show. some girls nver wear maternity clothes and jsut need bigger shirts! lol|`|mFQydvncaa	For some reason god chose to give me the belly very soon! with my son almost 7 years ago i was 3 months. With this baby, i really dont want to say but i was 12 weeks. My doctor said it was normal, with my son i had a ton of fluid so i guess im repeating that!|`|sufom9OKaa	I was 19 weeks pregnant when I just couldn't button my jeans up anymore so got some maternity jeans. I'm now 21 weeks and my tops are beginning to be a bit tight so probably should bet some maternity tops too.|`|AA10212874	I never wore them--only gained 18 lbs--never looked preggos--just a little chubby|`|H0fXySX9aa	i never wore them i never got big bumps<br>  my friend who is 37 weeks pregnant started at wearing them at 35 weeks|`|igPBuDHkaa	i am 12 weeks with my 3rd baby and my jeans and tops are getting to small so am starting to were them now|`|hsp7f9Epaa	when I was about 6months|`|0YdWJVyAaa	probably around 28 weeks|`|OHgtarUMaa	This is your 3rd pregnancy you should know!!|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Never ever. Maternity clothes were always too freaking big, I don't know who they are cutting those things for nowadays. Us pregnant gals don't need bedsheets lol. <br>  <br>  I did purchase a maternity zip up,x-small, which would have honestly been the same (and cheaper) if I had gotten it in a large 'regular' size. <br>  <br>  You should stick with leggings ($5 at target) and flowy tops (which you can get anywhere) Comfy & cute<br>  <br>  EDIT: thumbs down cos I didnt get a big bump 'me-ow!' lol|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I started wearing maternity trousers at 15 weeks, but I was able to last until 30 weeks before wearing maternity tops.|`|dDVAUA9saa	With my first, around 6 months, with my second around 5 months, but I'm just over 6 months and today am wearing regular clothes!!!  I only gained 18lbs with my first but my size 4 clothes just did not fit anymore.  And I lost alot of weight after having baby #1 and my size 2 clothes don't fit anymore, mostly.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I was about 14-16 weeks when I started wearing maternity. The first thing I couldn't fit in anymore was my jeans and pants for work. Then at about 20 weeks I started wearing maternity tops to flaunt my little bump.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I was about 5 months in. I gained weight pretty quickly. I tried just buying larger size clothes for awhile but at 5 months I went ahead and started shopping for real maternity clothes.|`|sqaey2Siaa	With my first son I was wearing them around 12 weeks. I am now in week 20 of my second pregnancy and still in my regualar clothes..Of course SOME FIT BETTER THAN OTHERS :]
bTlhBX3daa	I would call your Dr. It sounds like your water has "broken". <br>  It doesn't always just gush out, some women leak slowly. <br>  Are you experiencing any contractions?<br>  <br>  Definitely call your Dr. and see what he/she says.|`|rjVALevtaa	You may be leaking water. Is the fluid clear and watery? Is your underwear constantly wet? If so, you need to go the hospital. If you leak water for too long you are prone to infection. Call your doctor first and see what he/she wants you to do.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	sounds like ur water has broken or u have a leak in the bag|`|5MBdJK4Baa	if the amniotic bag breaks at the bottom it will "gush" out but if it breaks on the top it can just barely "trickle" out. but also you have alot of pressure on your bladder and you can leak urine without knowing, you go into your doctor and they will check to see if the bag has indeed broke or that you are just leaking a bit of urine.. Good luck!|`|kvYgopThaa	I would call your doctor, they can do a simple test to tell if you are leaking. This involves them swabbing your vaginal area with a piece of paper, and if it is pos. for Amniotic fluid it will show imediately. I wouldn't wait to call, I would call right now.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I'd call the doctor cause I dunno  :)|`|1kLCl7snaa	I would call your doctor. Main reason is if it is your water, and it is broken, it can cause an infection in your uterus.|`|YUiDqXaTaa	call your midwife your waters may have broken but not properly which can cause infection to you and/or the baby if you dont get it checked out sooner rather than later.|`|fslABgDnaa	Better get your butt to the hospital - sounds like your water broke!|`|mjd1qjy7aa	I strongly suggest that you call your OB, I had my daugher at 37 weeks.
S5n5Za78aa	how long are your periods lasting ??? if 5 days <br>  then your luteal phase is the time frame from when you ovulate (which you  can start tracking about 5days after your period ends until you get a pos ovulation using opks) soo from the time you ovulate till you get your period all over again is the luteal phase but everyones numbers are different you would have to be more specific on how long your period is to the day you ovulate to get more info but im just giving you a basic understanding with estimated time frames ....good luck <br>   <br>  EDIT: just some extra info <br>  you should look into the book (taking charge of your fertility) you can prob get it from library and start charting your temps  on fertilityfriend.com but the book will teach you everything as far as pinpointing ovulation<br>  or you can wait for ovulation which can occur anywhere from 10-24 days after the first day of you period (fertile period ) its different for everyone and start using ovulation predictor kits till you get a positive between the days i just mentioned and go from there  but you have to make sure whatever you do your having sex on the RIGHT days it can get tricky!! good luck
J6vd8Gsbaa	Hiccups give him a few oz's of water to drink. Get Milicon for the gas and feed him some prune baby food. (I know he is 2 months but trust me he is fine with eating food) And sleeping. Try to keep him up as long as you can. Distinguish night and day by opening your curtains in the day even wile he sleeps and keep lights to a minimum at night. <br>  Good luck mama hope this helped<br>  Tyffannie mother of 2 boys 14 months and 2 years|`|AA12041870	When the baby eats, make sure he is in a sitting position, not lying down.  A sitting position helps keep the baby from aspirating which can be a cause of the hiccups.   As for the sleep, I wish there was a cure.  My son (now 29 years old) slept very little.  He never slept all night until he went to kindergarten.  Now he has a daughter that has the same sleeping pattern.  I finally get to stand back and laugh.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	DO NOT GIVE THE BABY PEANUT BUTTER LIKE "PRINCESS" SAID TO DO. Peanuts are one of the highes allergenic foods and if your baby is allergic it could be very dangerous b/c she is small.<br>  <br>  My son had hiccups when I was pregnant with him & came out hiccupping...lol You could try giving him a little bit of water small amount of water with a little bit of sugar. (This is what our peditrician reccommended) The baby could be a little gassy too so try burping him.<br>  <br>  Here are some ideas on helping him get to sleep. Try laying down next to him in the bed with a soft blaket up against his face. Once he falls asleep put him in his crib but and if he starts to wake up pat his belly or chest very softly so that he knows you are still there.<br>  <br>  You could try bathing him before bedtime with lavendar baby soap and giving him a massage after the bath to relax him.<br>  <br>  Let him sleep with a soft stuffed animal. <br>  <br>  Sing to him softly.<br>  <br>  Rub his hair.%|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Everything you've written sound pretty normal for a baby that's 2 months.  As he gets older things will work themselves out.  It's said that the 1st 3 months of a baby's life is considered the 4th trimester because baby is so young and needs the time to adjust to his world.|`|heDtLdz5aa	my son constantly had the hiccups..and actually he always had them while i was pregnant with him too...he he....not much you can really do about them that i am aware of....as far as his sleeping he will just be on his own schedule for now..there really isn't anything you can do about his schedule until he is about 6-7 months...they all eventually tune into a scheduled sleep pattern (sometimes)..|`|ibWLdXlJaa	You can try Gripe Water for the hiccups. To help him sleep you can get the bedtime lotions and bath wash to help. Use the lotion and massage it on him. That usually helps them sleep. Keep it calm and quiet and make a routine out of it.|`|tUIEWhsUaa	What I used to with my daughter when she was a baby I use to just give her water in her bottle and the hiccups would leave. You know when they are drinking from it they tend to hold their breath a little and that will make it go away. About the sleeping give the baby about 2 ounces of water with sugar, that helps to relax and help to make someone sleepy. My mom use to do that to my bother and I when we were younger and I did it to my child and it had the same effects. I guess its something like a home remedy. Hope I helped.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Things that are helping us with hiccups:<br>  nothing :(  sometimes they don't bother baby much, though. someone told me taking them outside for a few minutes into cooler air can help, but I have only had this help once or twice.<br>  <br>  Things that are helping up with longer naps:<br>  swaddling or a sleep bag, since it turns out DD might have just been cold when she woke up<br>  white noise (ocean waves, rain, radio static) played, esp at the time when she usuallly wakes up from  a too-short nap<br>  a pacifier!<br>  a nap routine (putting on a sleep bag and singing) when going down for a nap, and going down as soon as I see sleepy signs (yawns, face rubbing, stare, turnign away from toys) and before she gets overtired<br>  <br>  Things that are helping to pass gas: <br>  tummy massage (tons of website on how to do this - rub down and in a clockwise motion and then plunge the knees into the tummy) done at every diaper change. be persistent at the gas (and often the BM too) will come out<br>  better burping to reduce trapped gas<br>  you can also try gas drops; they work for some people and not for others.|`|7K6vpsdhaa	Hiccups are extremely common in babies. My son get them daily and has done since he was inside me! Their diaphram isn't developed enough and this causes the hiccups. They don't hurt them but can be annoying. <br>  <br>  He's a bit too young to have a sleeping routine now so he will sleep when he's tired. My son went through a phase of only sleeping at night and was awake most of the day. It was draining but now at 5 months he has 3 naps a day and sleeps through the night.  Try all the usual things to get him to sleep, car, music, rocking.<br>  <br>  Try gripe water for the gas and give him water in between feeds to help with his bowel movements. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HGqmsaM5aa	Gripe water gets rid of hiccups!! and gas too so it will help for lots of things. If you read the bottle it tells you this. Very cheap, like 4 dollars. Also make sure to buy non alcoholic one!!|`|MW3Br5V8aa	I have no idea about the hiccups only leave him to pass them himself...<br>  <br>  as for sleep patterns.. read Gina Ford's sleep for happy babies.. i was so against baby books.. but i read this and it helped no end!! it will work... :)
BypjotRpaa	You should be listing them in pieces ,not in lots to make the money..or maybe a few sets of clothes for the 5$..plus up your shipping cost..|`|ge3meKYEaa	Ebay is just not doing good- everyone is feeling the economic crunches.   Unless you have juicy couture or big names in that bag- your not going to get much.  The same people can go do goodwill on a bag day and get 30 pieces of clothing for $10.  <br>  <br>  I was selling designer 5th ave clothing and getting pennies on the dollar- I finally gave up and gave it to good will for the right off.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is no value- not right now.<br>  Sell it in a gaint lot with OK picture or give it to good will for a tax write off.|`|j65rSZ26aa	you can set a reserve price for whatever you think it's worth. If the reserve is not met then you don't have to sell it simple as that lol. 15.00 is pretty reasonable to me. You can also make the shipping/handling a little higher. Think about it this way you have to set the clothes up to take the pic, list it on ebay, then pack, then drive to the usps store to ship. You're using your time energy and gas. You deserve it. Good Luck!|`|CugCzH9iaa	Try selling it in smaller lots.  Sometimes  it sells better that way.|`|TG7yKoOjaa	=)|`|MVgm17o3aa	I have a 3 yr old son so i may be intrested in the 4T and 5/6 clothes...can you e-mail me pics to chantrella9@yahoo.com I will certainly give a reasonable price for them if i decide to purchase .

pNPJH1WBaa	Hi, my son is now 3 and has always been a clingy (hate that prase) baby. I had exactly the same experience as you are having with your daughter when he was younger. I dont think it means they are shy I think some children need more time to adjust and feel secure in different environments. I perservered with taking him to groups and he is fine now. Runs in and plays with all the children. He still has occassions when he will come over and needs more reassurance to mix especially with adults but this is normal and to be honest I am happy for him to be weary of strangers! I had too a similar problem with my son being very laid back and allowed other children to snatch and push him and would just stand there and let them but now he is that bit older he is the opposite if someone tries to snatch he holds the toy tighter and says no wait your turn.. and if he is pushed he pushes back and stands up for himself. When he went to pre-school he cried for the entire session wanting mummy and refused to mix and did this for several sessions but now he is one of the most outgoing and they are always saying that they are really pleased with the way he mixes and jons in. It seems to be a pattern with him that he doesnt like new places/people but once he gets used to it/them he is fine.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt worry she sounds like she is happy to interact with other children and they all develop at different rates and it may be that she needs the extra security of you being there at the moment but this will change as she gets older and more used to mixing with a larger group of children. <br>  <br>  I think you will find in time she will change but would for now cherish the close bond you have as she obviously feels safe and secure with you hence she likes you by her. Just keep talking to her and being positive about mixing and making friends and she will eventually be happy to go off on her own.|`|rVFuRc6Vaa	hi, keep pererering and she will get over her shyness coud you leave her without being there and see if she will mix better i know its hard becouse you love her so much but if she hant got you to fall back on she might come out of her shell good luck she sounds a lovely sweet little girl i have two daughters but one like yours is shy the ohter isnt|`|1JsWMX0daa	she IS interacting and NOT withdrawn. she is not shy and will develop a good personality.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Children continue to grow, and continue to become more aware of thier surroundings, they keep chaning, and going through phases. Totally normal. Its a great idea to continue those classes, they all go through outgoing, and shy phases, giving and taking toys from others, hitting and biting, pigging out and starving themeselves. Try to simply alter the action or remove from a negative situation without much fuss, a soft, no thats not nice and take her somewehre a few feet away, whether someone hit her or she hits them. Kids dont really know how to socialize, its a learned and taught thing, so encourage good behviour but at that age dont panic, the kids just need kind guidance.|`|9f7da82548dac95c35d6ec34826ec681aa	Is she an only child?<br>  Is she used to spending time around other little people her own age?<br>  Children do snatch each others toys from each other - they dont understand its wrong, they just understand that they want it and someone else has it.<br>  Your daughter cant learn to interact if you are looking over her shoulder.  When she goes to school, its going to be extra hard if you've spent all your time with her and then she has to spend all day without you, so break her in slowly.
ECPdAeHQaa	you have a lot on you plate as do most mothers-to-be. Trust me I feel like that all the time.

Untreated depression and anxiety will effect your pregnancy and your baby after delivery, so this is something to address with your doctor now before it becomes a problem - you are bathed in high hormone levels right now and after delivery the rapid hormone drop could send you over the edge since you are already having familial problems and anxiety.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	You have to gain control of your emotions.  Remember the happier and more content you are while your pregnant the better for your baby.  Every time you start to feel stressed just breath and try and clear your mind.  Stressing isn't worth the effects it could have on your baby.  And i'm not talking only physical.  They say baby's who's mothers were calm and peaceful throughout their pregnancy are more calm when they are born.  Baby's who's mothers were frazzled during pregnancy were frazzledeled when they were born.  Just really try.  It's like anything.  The more you practice the better you'll be.|`|KpcjvUgwaa	Delegate work to other people. Focus on nothing but your baby.

GGH0HVdvaa	You gotta who de wha? What is an egg drop??|`|oWXpWLvpaa	is this the thing where you have to but a egg in a container and drop it offa something?<br>  if it is then wrap your egg in a washcloth go to a shipping store and get some of that bubble wrap and those foam things and put the foam things on the bottom and sides and wrap the bubble wrap around the washcloth stuff paper towels on the top before you put the lid on and put them anywhere else where its not packed gooood.|`|2lByIoqGaa	Jello won't work, and neither does putting it in a peanut butter jar that still has peanut butter in it. lol someone did that last year and it made a mess! My friend put the egg in a plastic bag and taped/stapled the bag to the sid of the box and fill the  box with popcorn! And she used a bag of pebbles as the weight. lol It worked, and we even got a snack out of it! But you could just play around with ideas and test them out before you have to turn it in, and things that work you could copy for your real project. That's what I did. Have fun! xD|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	Get one of those tiny Pringle cans and fill it with padding, but leave room for the egg. Cover the sides and bottom of the can with padding and have a piece to put on top of the egg (after it's in there) to protect it from hitting the lid. I did that and my egg didn't break. Good luck!|`|t3OxbttCaa	allright dude <br>  i did this in 8th grade and it worked<br>  <br>  just wrap ur egg in a scarf and put like alot of scarves or little pilows or soft stuff in ur box<br>  <br>  not jello|`|H0sPCJQPaa	straws.<br>  I've seen it on tv :P<br>  make it like a parachute|`|um8IIEn8aa	***** YOU ARE CRAZY!<br>  WHAT CHOO TALKIN ABOUT?
KEu8nqEQaa	I know how you feel! My husband and I have been TTC for 9 months and we just got our BFP on 2/21! There is hope, you just have to be patient. I know it's easier said than done, but when you see that potitive line--it is all worth it!!! *Tons of Baby Dust to you*|`|H6D6jlKGaa	Heyyy :)<br>  <br>  I'm also trying TTC for the first time. I've worked it out to be I will be 3 weeks late for my period tomorrow, I've had 2 BFN but i stopped taking the pill in December having been on it for nearly 2years so i know that could be the reason I've not had my period yet! But it is soooo frustarting as i got a little bit too excited so to see negative was a real disapointment! <br>  All I keep saying to myself is.. It will happen when the times right and I gotta believe that!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND BABY DUST TO ALL!|`|4XTxSfR7aa	me im on my tww and its lasting foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr.<br>  only a week to wait tho!|`|1d729bf4d6b38d30422b14b8a730ea1aaa	Good luck to you all.  My strongest advice would be don't leave it too long, just thinking something is wrong, go to the Dr and discuss your issues.  I waited four years as my husband wanted to give us 'enough time' to have something happen naturally.  We ended up having lots of tests, that seemed to take forever and drag the time out.  Had one round of IVF, NHS funded last year that didn't work and then we paid for one round ourselves.  I'm now 14 weeks and 1 day pregnant.  Am so happy but wish I'd started the whole process of tests in case there was a problem years ago.  Don't be shy or bashful, if you think there is a delay in you getting pregnant, seek advice.  Good luck to you all.|`|JXFYdTqmaa	i am ttc my 2nd child, ive only just started to try again after having an ectopic 2 months ago...i only have one tube now so has knocked me down abit....all i keep telling my self is that it WILL happen....just have faith. <br>  <br>  baby centre is really good. <br>  good luck|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Hi Salma!<br>  <br>  I know what you mean, I am in my first month of TTC for my 2nd child and I have gone past my two week wait by 7 days and still no BFP but all of the signs. grrr. I hate waiting so much!<br>  <br>  Baby dust to you too!<br>  <br>  x
oveuP5m7aa	Sore breasts are usual around the time of your period, i have always got cramps before i am due on. But my boobs never became more sensative before my period and when they did that when i became suspicious and took a HPT and i came up poss. give it about a week, if you don't come on take a HPT as soon as possable.<br>  good luck:)|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Take a test you can take one now. Your symptoms sounds like my monthly pms.  So you can not go by symptoms.|`|WwXQCRcgaa	You should take a test.|`|wObmwK1uaa	your best option is to take a pregnancy test as both of these symptoms are symptoms of pregnancy and your monthly period|`|XJqHuHLiaa	windy would like to give a second opinion (holds his hands out)|`|N37v3VkNaa	think! did you have sex in last 2 weeks?<br>  have you taken a test?<br>  <br>  these are more likely to answer your question|`|JPa0GzDjaa	I would take a test to be on the safe side.
X6as2nOAaa	Im sure that you could but from having a 7 month old I wouldn't because it doesn't seem as safe as the crib and what if the baby rolled and somehow got stuck and suffocated?|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	no!!! absolutly not!  that would be ridiculous.  they should stay in a crib until they are old enough to be able to escape by themselves or are too tall (see instructions with crib).<br>  <br>  its not an issue that a baby of that age couldn't sleep in a bed with a side rail.. its more about the fact that as they learn to crawl and walk they will get out of bed, get into mischief and you will have no idea because you are sleeping in your room.  The crib looks like a jail and works like a jail and from that you get peace of mind that they are safe.  <br>  <br>  it would be fine as an very occasional sleeping arrangement I suppose but not long term, you are just asking for problems doing that at such an early age.<br>  <br>  As an aside - dd went into a toddler bed at 2 years and she height wise will be able to sleep in it for at least two years and she is in her 95% for height.. so there is no rush to get a toddler bed, they don't outgrow them all that fast.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Not to sleep every night. A 6 month old belongs in a crib. I didn't take my daughter out of hers until she was about 20 months. <br>  <br>  In the case of a nap where you have no where else to put him down, I would think it would be okay provided you will be close and have a monitor to listen for the baby.|`|AA10064551	I wouldn't if I were you, my son is also 6 months and I don't see any reason why he would need to be in a junior bed now. I think you should start a toddler bed at around 2. when they are old enough to control there motor skills but definitely its better when they start to walk and talk.|`|vXYQcixvaa	my 6 month old is a rolling fool! Not to mention she manages to get out of any position i put her in! To be in a jr. bed it would be sorta dangerous i'd assume. My little one wathes cartoons and sometimes has nap time in a little fold up bed we got her....this one...<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2885562" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <br>  i realize a jr bed is different than that one we got....but either way....<br>  <br>  as far as overnight....i would only put her in a bassinet or crib. Maybe until he/she is atleast 12 months|`|a1uoxczTaa	is that a toddler bed? a family i used to work for put their twins in toddlers bed that young and they actually did very well in them.|`|UoONXXLbaa	I definitely would not recomend it.  Pretty soon your baby will be able to pull him/herself up.  Those guards are not tall enough to keep your baby safe.  You baby only needs to fall the length of their body to do serious damage.|`|u4uq7Twdaa	I would say no...just because if they start to roll they might roll of or get stuck...So do you have a crib?  That would be the best thing...
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Probably. I've had my belly change shape several times throughout this pregnancy when the baby moves positions. Sometimes it makes it look smaller, when really it is just shaped differently. It could also be due to bloating/water retention. I wouldn't worry too much.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I felt that way too. The bloating comes and goes. I would think I was smaller but when I went to the doctor they measured me to be exactly the size I should be.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	If your worried about something, you should request to see the doctor sooner. The smaller looking stomach may just be the baby in a different position, but I would have the doctor make sure it isn't something more serious. I think your ok though.|`|tfkBHH9eaa	I think you should go to the doctor and let them check it out, because not anybody on here is going to tell you whats really wrong. And if they do, i wouldnt trust them, no offense lol|`|dFo0k3zDaa	Sure, the baby could have just changed positions which makes the your tummy look differently thoughout your pregnancy. Good luck|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Its ok. Maybe you were retaining water before or you were bloated. Could be lots of things. You're fine.
ytE1q20taa	When I was in the morning sickness part I was rarely sick but felt so ill almost all the time, I was quite tired at the beginning and I didn't get the chest pain. If I get really cold and I'm shivering a lot, the muscles in my chest get tight and painful but that is the only time i have had chest pains. I don't know about the twinges, you didn't really specify where or how they are.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Everything you're feeling is totally normal, it's your body is adjusting to pregnancy. When you'll get to your second trimester you will feel a lot less tired and have lots of energy and sometimes even might forget that you're pregnant. Good luck :)|`|rTtIKOmpaa	You are me exactly I am 9 weeks today . I have all that except for the nausea part. our bodies are working overtime making this little baby and so we are going to feel tired and soreness. Don't worry it's all normal. I just went to my 1st Dr. appt on tuesday and she said everything is totally fine. Perfectly normal.|`|vcxdTXbraa	SO so so so so normal. Sounds like a healthy pregnancy. I had intense nausea until my second trimester and then I started doing the throwing up thing|`|dR2bqUixaa	It's all normal. I didn't have vomiting either. You could be a lucky one like me! Lol!|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Sounds like normal morning sickness to me. In fact, it get alot worse!|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Get lots of sleep.  You're mutating, like a crysalis, it takes huge amounts of energy.<br>  <br>  Be glad you don't have to throw up, it's so disgusting.  I didnt' have morning sickness with my daughter so you just might get away with it.<br>  <br>  The funny twinges I think are your uterus expanding.  Sound likely to you?|`|SiIuJXvwaa	ok the twinges is your womb expanding to make room for your babs <br>  your boobs are sore from pregnancy hormones, and yea its normal to feel sick without getting sick, and most people feel really tired in there first trimester because the babs soaks up all there energy to grow
9Iy8LKzaaa	Sounds good i would test now but buy the new clear blue test the one that tells you how many weeks pregnant you are. before i did my test i was getting cramps and i just thought my period was coming but no this is normal in pregnancy i didn't have spotting but what you have said are symptom's of pregnancy first stages of the egg settling in but you should do a test and find out good luck to you|`|qJBMdL7gaa	That spotting could have been implantation bleeding. There are tests that you can take 5 days before period. So I would try one of those and see! If its negative, wait on your period..if it doesn't come. Then test again.<br>  With my last pregnancy I got a Positive at 12dpo.<br>  Good Luck!|`|ZeJav7rUaa	WELL if i was you i would go buy a test and take it first thing in the morning whrn you wake up thats when your hormon level will be up and you will have a better chance of getting the real results but it sounds like you might be pregnant but it could also be where you have been on and off bc|`|5ZVsl4fAaa	There is an early test that says you can use it five days before your period. I would try that one with your first morning urine.
idqJmoU8aa	yeah well that would be one of the most common things today and let me ask you does this father have a gaming console (xbox ps3)? that could be responsible.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	MEMEMEMEMEMEME lol for me it is work clean kids food clean work kids clean <br>  for him it is <br>  tv, vidio games, porn, vidio games, music, tv, tv, eat , porn , vidio games <br>  UHHHHHHHHHHHHH i hear ya mama|`|1hciyvKdaa	And so when you give birth, will he go do the same magically or just be food eating money spending loser in your life. You deserve better, you really do.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	relationship wont work unless you both put effort into it.

4d1kWdpxaa	OMG. You are describing my household.  I am sorry for your problems. I know you are at your wits end, sleep deprived and probably fighting with your wife more so than usual. (all do to stress of coarse) My daughter is just about 11 months old and does not sleep.  We have not tried at my mom's over night but she has stayed there during the day and has had beautiful naps over there.  Over at my house, like you said, it feels like you try to get her to sleep for longer than she actually sleeps... it is very frustrating.  My daughter has not had any problems with hitting and such yet, she is smaller, but she definaly has a temper on her and more than once i have thought- what is she going to be like when she gets older ?!?  We are just at the point that we are going to let her "cry it out" attempt number 2.   <br>  <br>  I am not sure what advise to give you as i don't know what to do myself. My first child had occasional sleep issues but nothing like this.  There was always a reason, teething, illness, ect.  With my daughter it doesn't matter- she can be an angel all day and then it's like jekyl and hyde at night.  I look forward to any advise people give as i might take it as well.  As for the doctors- i thought something was wrong with my daughter for the longest time and spent a lot of time at the doctors office, with no answers.  I hope you have a great night tonight and your son sleeps well.... (i am praying for at least one night for you! )|`|8wGCUSxZaa	Have you talked to your pediatrician about this?  If you feel that you have done everything that you can do as far as setting a routing and providing consistent discipline, maybe you need to consult a professional.  There is always the possibility that there is something else going on.  If there is nothing medically wrong, then try a pediatric therapist.  They would be able to do a more thorough assessment of your situation and make suggestions to help you overcome this situation.  As he gets older, his acts of aggression toward your wife could become dangerous as he gets bigger and stronger.|`|NAIkcKssaa	My son is 19 months and does the exact same thing. He is great at grandmas house.But this seems to make it worse for me when he comes home. He also has the worst behavior with me, Kicking biting hitting temper like i have never seen in any child. When he is with anyone else he is fine.Reading your story is like my life. i have to say not much has worked for us. i have to change his schedule every week to two weeks. this seems to help a little. i am not a push over either. He is well disciplined. My husband can not go near him either seems to make it so much worse. The only thing that is different is that I am ill. so taking care of him is very difficult. about 4 weeks ago we did hire a nanny to come to the house for 6 hours a day 2 days a week. I am home but i hide. This seems to have helped . He has no choice but to be with her in our home. So its not like he is going to grandmas. She does exactly what I do. I mean exactly. He is finally taking naps for her . When she leaves its like a different child and it stays this way for a day or two. He will even go to my husband when he comes home but not at night.As for the sleeping at night. It is the worst.every night is different some nights no sleep at all and others up 5-10 times and then there is the occasional night of great sleep. we have the white noise machine. the music all of that stuff does not seem to help much. I dont know if you are religous or not but my husband had an idea of putting a cross in his room we let him see it told him jesus would be there to look over him and protect him and that he would help him sleep.every night we look at it and say he will help him sleep. This has helped for the last 3 nights a full10 hours of sleep. There is somthing about being in our house that makes him scared or mad. not sure what. Is your wife a stay at home mom or does she work? Does your son go to any mommy and me or daycare? Does he have interaction with other children?Mine does not have much i wonder if this would make a difference.I have noticed if he goes on to long of a walk it makes sleeping worse or if he has to much stimulation like a really long play date or a family gathering with a lot of people we are up all night. i have started a journal of what we do and eat every day to see if there is some connection. i am not sure what else to tell you other than your son is not the only child like this.I hope this helps a little or you find anothr person on here that has a great idea. i will be watching to see. good luck Please feel free to contact me if you have questions|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	Although I don't have the severe problem you have described with my own kids, it sounds like this kid needs a very structured routine mixed with firm discipline (EXCLUDING spanking, hand slapping, etc.). Many kids act much better for other people because they aren't as comfortable throwing fits around them, so maybe that explains that. As for the sleeping issue I at first thought that maybe there was something medical about his not sleeping, but since he sleeps ok at Grandma's it rules it out. I would talk to a pediatric sleep expert, or child psychologist about it and some of the behavior issues.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just wanted to inform those on this board who are having similar issues, I just remembered I saw something interesting on Discovery Health (I think) a few months ago. There was a little boy who never slept except for about 3 hours a night and he was exhibiting the same behaviors described. I believe he was around 2 or 3 years of age. It turns out there was a neurological reason. You might want to run it by your pediatricians. If I remember right they had to do a CT Scan and they found there was pressure on the brain. Just an afterthought. Good luck!! Best wishes.|`|4YqL4iCcaa	I feel for you and your wife! Have you tried watching your mom put him to sleep to see what she does differently? Also, you know that he can sleep so maybe you should try letting him cry it out again. Also, you could try having your mom come to your house to put him to sleep to see if it's the person or the location making a difference... Good Luck!|`|KmC0K59taa	I'm sorry.  I really don't know how to help you.  Maybe your problem started a long time ago.  You should have had your baby at 10 months or so taking 2 naps a day and going to sleep at 7 pm.  You must have not established a proper sleep schedule.  Now all bets are off and your son thinks he can stay up all night.  He's probably dead tired.  They fight sleep then.  He needs to be taking a nap during the day.<br>  <br>  We established a scheudule with our daughter early on.  She is almost 2 and she had always had 2 naps a day and sleeps for 12 hrs at night.  She willingly goes upstairs and is ready for bed at 8 pm.  We let her fall asleep in our bed then move her.  If she does wake up, I let her sleep with us.  We both work full time and have to be up early.<br>  <br>  You have to set up a sleep schedule when they are very young.  Our daughter knows when it's bedtime and she doesn't mess around.  We religiously gave her 2 naps a day and bedtime was at 7:30 every single night.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
