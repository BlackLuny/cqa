Um...there's a huge list of economic disasters out there and there's only so much the media can do for damage control when 2 people out of every 20 in your neighborhood is suddenly unemployed...<br>  <br>  Obama will be a lame duck president in 2010.|`|zE9MnUZLaa	I doubt your independant statement, I can smell a LIBERAL.  <br>  The answer is the GOP is alive and growing daily thanks to Barack Hussein Obama.|`|M1u3IhFFaa	........or dead man reincarnated.|`|AA11814566	The messenger?

If they get back to the grass roots of the constitution as outlined by our founders, many many will find their way back.  The reason the lost is because they tried to become moderates, and history has no great moderates, but It does have great Conservatives.  The average person, regardless of the part lives most of his/her life as a conservative.  When have you seen a liberal taking their check, cashing it, and walking up and down the street handing out money?    What do you suppose one of them would do if someone broke down their door, was attacking/killing their family.  If that person had a gun, would he use it.  I say he/she will.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry about labels.  Most of us are really conservatives and cant come to grips with it.  If the right person with the right message came before the people it would change drastically.|`|IdvnYMHyaa	I don't.<br>  <br>  These things go in cycles.  The GOP looked to be in pretty sad shape after the '92 election, having lost the White House and being in the minority in both houses of Congress.  Then the Democrats tried to swing the country too far to the left, and paid for it in the '94 election.<br>  <br>  Similarly, the Dems looked to be just about dead when the '02 election saw the President's party actually gain seats in both houses of Congress for the first time since Theodore Roosevelt.  It took a little longer, but the pendulum eventually swung back from that as well.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, but I'm thinking that the fortunes of the GOP will improve in 2010.  Time will tell.|`|bEAvjAmdaa	Just take the advice his supporters like to give us conservatives: "Give it some time, it's only been X amount of weeks, months, etc"  <br>  <br>  He could backfire on all of us.

AOC5PkbDaa	I had a Marine whose bad conduct discharge was upgrade by the discharge review board. <br>  <br>  He had served honorable for four years during the Vietnam War and had been awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart and was discharged in the grade of sergeant (E-5).  In 1976, he re-entered service as a lance corporal and his service was excellent resulting in meritorious promotion to corporal.  He went UA when his mother’s boyfriend beat her so badly that she was hospitalized in critical condition.  He didn’t apply for leave just left.  <br>  <br>  That wouldn’t have been more than an Art 15 with a reprimand, but while he was UA he found his mother’s boyfriend and beat him, causing permanent physical disability.  He was arrested by civilian authorities, tried, and sentenced to a short prison term.  When he got out of prison, he was returned to the Marines, court-martialed and discharged with a BCD.<br>  <br>  In 1982 – 83, he petitioned the discharge review board for upgrade.  Given his prior service, the circumstances of his UA, and how he had led his life after discharge, his discharge was upgraded to general under honorable conditions.  Several of his former commanders, including myself, wrote letters supporting upgrade.  <br>  <br>  Thae Army upgraded hundreds of discharges in 1979 when the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in ''Giles v. Secretary of the Army" (Civil Action No. 77-0904), ruled that a former Army service member is entitled to an honorable discharge, if discharged before 1 January 1975 as a result of an administrative proceeding in which the Army introduced evidence developed by or as a direct or indirect result of compelled urinalysis testing administered for the purpose of identifying drug abusers (either for the purposes of entry into a treatment program or to monitor progress through rehabilitation or follow up).<br>  <br>  In other words, the court said it was okay to discharge for such urinalysis results, but it was not okay to base the service-characterization on such results.  About 300 discharges were upgraded.|`|BsJDl6YOaa	Never heard of a successful upgrade but i do know a guy who got an ART 15, LOA and a purple heart all in the same Deployment|`|1de8de08724f9de70d9b40740c046ef4aa	it happens, but as i understand it the timeframe to do it is very short, and you have to go through proper channels first, then to a civilian review board if your military appeals don't go right...and then they don't get upgraded to an hon. discharge they get upgraded to an 'uncharacterized' which basically means as far as anyone is concerned you never even served...no bennifits etc. just none of the big stigma of having had a Dishonorable...things like i think you can't have a concealed carry permit with a OTR or other employment stuff etc.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Well, I worked in the military criminal justice system and about 70% of unhonorable 214's get appealed and about half get upgraded. The other trick they use is it takes 18 months to 5 years to get your  214 after a courts martial during that time they go on excess leave and go to a VA shrink to blame it their mind or find a recruiter to go reserves then active.

f36531cfc5056db27dde00a32fcfe48baa	Yes to everything.  JROTC cadets go in as E-3's and 8 years would be more than enough.  I was also an intel analyst (98J and 96B).  I enlisted for 4 years.  I got out after 3 yrs/8 months on a program called "Green to Gold" where you get out of your enlistment a few months early and go to college and do ROTC to earn your commission.  I recommend this route b/c the next 4 years as an officer were, IMO, more satisfying compared to some of the crap I had to do as an enlistee.  Now let me tell you about my friend I served with.<br>  <br>  We both got out around the same time.  He was military intelligence for 4 years also.  He used the GI Bill to pay for college and was a criminal justice major.  He applied and was accepted into the FBI and lives in Washington DC.

WW II was an eye opening experience, some good, and some bad, for most Americans.  <br>  <br>  Too soon after WW II was over (5 years), we found ourselves right back at it in Korea for another three years.  By then, a militaristic mind set had taken over in the US, so for many going into the Vietnam conflict was daja vu.  It didn't turn out as Lyndon Johnson had hoped, after all, when your leader is the first to capitulate, it's hard to keep a winning attitude amongst the troops.<br>  <br>  The right to bear arms will always be with me.  This latest trend makes it especially necessary for Americans to maintain this right.  We have in Washington today, a gaggle of newbies who seem to have an agenda.

Maybe me. <br>  <br>  On the other hand I think it is your right to keep and bear arms and that right is as much so that you can attack the government as it is to defend yourself. That is the way thnat I read the intent of the founders in their writings outside the constitution such as the Federalist papers. As you likely know the Supreme court agrees with me so Obama has no say in the matter.<br>  <br>  I do not think that it has anything to do with my families military service. My belief comes strictly from readig the constitution.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	My grandfather fought in WWII. I'm only 38, and my dad only 68, so he's way too young for WWII. Both he (navy) and my mother (army) got out of the service in the early 60's just before we started putting troops in Vietnam. They as well as I value the Constitution, our civil liberties and our country. No wonder we all hate Bush.
AA12332649	Those aren't exceptions but reasons.  You need exceptions to the hearsay rule, some of which are listed in the link below.<br>  <br>  The dieing declaration to the hearsay rule ONLY works when the person who is dieing speaks as to the reason why they are dieing, and only when death is imminent.  If someone were to be stabbed, fall out of the room and yell, "John stabbed me!" then die, this phrase would be admissible.  If someone were to be stabbed, fall out of the room and yell, "I leave all of my assets to my wife, Cindy!" then die, this phrase would not be admissible.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Depends on if the judge will allow the evidence to be presented. The witness may be needed to corroborate the evidence. For instance, if it is a surveillance tape, you may need a witness to identify that the person on the video is indeed who you say it is. If not the defense may argue that the video quality is too obscure and cannot be verified. <br>  <br>  The only thing to do is to issue a subpoena for the witness. If they refuse to testify, ask the judge to hold them in contempt for the duration of the proceedings. If the witness cannot be located or is sick, ask the judge for a continuance until they can be found. If they can't be found, then try to proceed with the hearing with the evidence and pray that they judge or the other attorney does not cause a disturbance about the lack of a witness.|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	If a witness makes a statement before they die, someone else can testify to it and while it's hearsay, it's admissible since the primary source isn't able to deliver the testimony.<br>  <br>  If you're subpoenaed to testify and you refuse, you're going to be found in contempt and possibly find yourself in a cozy jail cell.  Sounds like that's something you're really concerned about since you listed it twice.<br>  <br>  DNA evidence, surveillance tapes, physical evidence, you name it, it can be used to gain a conviction.|`|lUSTFw94aa	Depends on the quality and veracity of the evidence, but yes.<br>  <br>  If it can be corroborated, and may protect a witness, absolutely.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why?

qKr5wRxyaa	Actually "socialism in its purist form" can mean different things depending on the school of thought. <br>  <br>  If the socialism exists to justify the existence of the state it usually leads to dictatorships or fascism. (Think Stalinism) "Socialism for the state" <br>  <br>  <br>  But if it's socialism to do away with the state, eliminate fiat money as the medium of exchange, or distribute the means of production democratically through workers union and the people that work it is something totally different that those in power can't tolerate. <br>  Under the socialism I described it is run by the common people, the workers, not the rich capitalist class that oppresses you. <br>  <br>  <br>  By the way Obama is neither a socialist nor a communist. He believes in corporate welfare just like most Democrats AND Republicans  in power. <br>  <br>  The common people are being fooled. By the way the United States is still capitalism because private individuals still own the means of production, although I definitely agree that it leans toward OLIGARCHY.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	The source of our economic problems in the USA is the failures of the Bush II Administration.

However this won't go well with other countries, meaning that in order to do business they would have to settle with what ever terms the government sets, and sooner than later we have a war.<br>  <br>  2) Car companies, need competition who would want to compete against a company owned by the government, when they need the government to approve. Environmental issues, Property, etc.. all the things that competitors require to be approved by the government. It just wont be fair, and you can call that monopoly.<br>  <br>  3) This is where things change my view HOSPITALS is something I am one hundred percent on the Government running them because this ensures the best people for the job are doing it. You might think that free inter price as is in the United States at this time is the best way, sure it is for the Hospitals who make money on everyone who walks in the door and can afford one. Not for the people. Sure they can say they  have a better track record than government ran facilities, but this is on the surface. If you where to see deep on to their operations you will see the reason is because the Doctors there are there for the money so turn down patients that would give them and the hospital a bad record. HOW YOU MIGHT SAY? Insurance companies do the dirty work, I am sure deep inside their dealing they exchange some funds, or at least some perks. As  if the insurance companies don't pay, and the doctors don't get patients that would give them and their hospital a bad wrap that would be just fine. In government ran hospitals no one is turned down from the person who has nothing to the person that has everything. Most important the doctors are there because they want to help people not just for the money.|`|3U1po4Ihaa	SS and  medicare are always in the black; yeah right.<br>  <br>  Politicians always file and do their taxes right; so far, not so good.<br>  <br>  Fanny and Freddy were never influenced by politicians; like hell they weren't.<br>  <br>  If the government and politicians keep up the good work, I'm sure we will all be equally broke.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Well, considering that we have a failed banking system, virtually bankrupt auto industry, and health care that is more expensive and lower quality than other industrialized nations, it's hard to see how the government could do any worse.|`|lPFUfbAyaa	Look at the way the Government runs Medicare and Medicaid; they screw everything up.

AA11210751	When Liberals speak, it is only with themselves. If you watch most shows on MSLSD(I mean MSNBC), you'll see that they never seem to have any Conservatives or Republicans on to offer a differing opinion. So they are only talking to themselves. This gets old fast. Turn on FOX news(highest rated cable news channel) and you'll see both sides of the argument. <br>  <br>  Liberal talk radio has NO audience. They try to succeed at what Conservatives do naturally, but offering sound valid interpretation of reality is just too foreign for them to comprehend. The answer to your question about Liberal whining and finger pointing...it as essential to their survival as eating and breathing. People want to hear THE truth, not the LIBERAL truth(Liberal truth=the opposite of truth).|`|QF4W5aYRaa	yes, it is very true that "liberal" talk radio is a failure.  I'm still trying to figure out what happened in the last election. I know folks were unhappy with the way things were, talk radio told us that if the liberals gained control, what would happen, and guess what, they were right! So, before everyone actually puts 2 +2= 4 together, the liberals need to quiet the radio folks before the rest of the story really gets alot of airtime. People, wake up! we are now on a one way ticket to one world order hell, and Obama is the guy the big boys are using to steer us to the cliff of no return.Once we start to fall off, (about 2 years), there will be no turning back!! The stars and stripes will be replaced with a wreath, (the money and badges are already done,1997).

In 1937, the US experienced a separate recession during the recovery from the depression.  For the most part we were recovering nicely from that recession by 1937-1939.  The US military buildup did not commence until mid 1940 and did not have any great affect on the economy until well into 1942.<br>  <br>  Please do a little more research and try not to oversimplify in the future.  Just as was the case then, several different things have created the current recession, and a combination of factors will cause our recovery.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	It's Obama and the Democrats that keep using their lovable word "depression". We are no where near that yet, but it almost seems like that's their goal. <br>  <br>  Obama was plain wrong by saying this is the worst economic crisis since the great depression. Incorrect. The one under Carter was worse, although it seems Obama's orgy of spending with his liberal friends should close that gap soon enough.<br>  <br>  What will get us out is to get Obama and these liberals (they are not true Democrats) out of there and get a president like Ronald Reagan was. He turned it around and that's a fact. I've provided a link about what Reagan did to save the economy if any libs care to read it. You won't though, because you ignore history.<br>  <br>  Reagan created 20 million new jobs. Obama wants how many? 3.5 million? Nice goal Obama.<br>  <br>  Added: "Shilo" - Absolutely wrong. I don't know where you learned history from but even liberals will tell you that World War II is what brought us out of the great depression. I swear, some of you liberals are the ones who like to rewrite history. These are not "hotly contested" they are facts. It's all there, read it. I've provided you a link.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	Wars are never good, they only destroy lives and wealth.<br>  <br>  If wars could stimulate an economy why don't use just build a bunch of tanks/planes and then blow them up?<br>  <br>  The only reason WWII stimulated the US economy was because every other country had to rebuild from scratch, while US had most of the world's factories after the war. <br>  <br>  Also I am hoping you are not saying we should go blow up everyone elses' infrastructure just so we can be rich again.|`|p9FED6Mvaa	The people that engineered the great depression created World War ll Economic crises are done on purpose by central bankers to cause wars, and you should google "Federal Reserve" to find videos that explain fractional reserve banking. Wars create jobs, but the government could easily find some other way to invent jobs for people on a massive scale, even if it just means 10 million people picking up trash and cleaning graffiti for $9 (lol). War costs in real terms, and all the "benefits" to the economy are really just concocted, convoluted evil nonsense that "experts" use polysyllabic terminology to explain away. No matter how much I learn about economics, nothing changes the fact that in real terms (resources) war is costly, and the economic benefits are mostly psychological. It's done on purpose.|`|CvMkJD7maa	World War II stimulated American economy before the US entered the war, not after the US entered the war.

They didnt know how to solve it. They let the banks go under which brought everything down. The economy will ALWAYS resolve itself. Ask a republican or democrat economist and they will both tell you that. ALWAYS 100%. Just nobody knows how long it will take.<br>  <br>  Now though, we were ready for it. The government is helping out the banking system, which will breathe life back into our economy. The banks are not lending money, thats what is causeing most of this. Business', and people alike live off lended money. Businesses cant provide jobs without banks lending them money, but the government is pushing the banks to lend money by giving them money. This alone will largely stimulate the economy, not saying it will bring it back up but it WILL stimulate it. The reason the government gave the "Big 3" so much money is because they helped us out of out last big recession. They provide a huge number of jobs, but they are going down, and that doesnt have much to do with the economy, has to do with competition.<br>  <br>  We dont need another World War, we arent nearly as bad as we were, and anyone who says that we are knows nothing about macroeconomics. Or microeconomics for that matter. We have become a service country, a retail country rather then a production company, so a World War actually wouldnt help us that much either.

He has no compassion for anyone actually. He also made nasty comments about Michael J. Fox a few years ago. Said that Michael J was "acting" when Michael had an episode where he was having the shakes. That guy is pure slime, and the dumb Repubs that support him can't even see that he's all for self.

fd270a67b3b8b1479a1e7fcdadd75178aa	Basically there are two types of conservatism. Fiscal and Social. Today's Republicans tend to be socially conservative (repressive on social issues) and big government spenders (but they want to spend on defense-pentagon-wars-privatization-corp... welfare and not on the same types of programs that liberals like to spend). Libertarians are the opposite being fiscally conservative (small gov, balanced budget, reduced spending) and socially liberal (want government and religious people to stay the hell out of peoples personal lives).|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I commend your question because as a conservative by instinct you made me think about it. In my country, Canada, conservative vs liberal = protestants vs catholics (and, as immigration increased and changed, Jews.) Identity-based, selfish, mindless knee-jerk reaction in favor of, or opposed to, the Establishment whose efforts built our country in the first place.<br>  Then there was a sea change, politics depended less on origin and more on thinking.<br>  The boomers, youngsters in the 60's, rebelled against anything that smacked of status quo (regardless of the fact that the status quo had given them higher education for next to nothing.) They grew up, and as they assumed the mantle of power, they rammed down our throats their flower-bedecked, pot-induced ideals of "equality." Marxism reborn. Screw meritocracy - its who you ARE that counts. Female? Black? Homosexual? Take your place at the head of the line, please.

yQ0OzEbZaa	I agree with you. When Joe Biden said during the campaign that President Barack Obama was going to face a crisis right out of the gate, it wasn't a wild guess. He was stating half of the elemental strategy of the Obama administration: HAVE A CRISIS.<br>  <br>  Biden went on to say that when that crisis arose, Americans should stand shoulder to shoulder with the Dear Leader, no matter what he chose to do, and he warned that "initially, it's not going to be apparent that we're right." <br>  <br>  Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, gave us the other half of the administration's strategy soon after the election in a talk with Wall Street Journal staffers: "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before."<br>  <br>  So, have a crisis and use it to get things you want that you couldn't have gotten from people who weren't frightened. Repeat as necessary.<br>  <br>  Want to appoint a tax cheat secretary of the treasury? Just tell everyone you're in a big hurry because of the financial crisis.<br>  <br>  Want to hand out, in one fell swoop, more pork and more paybacks to more favored political constituencies than anyone has ever handed out before? Write a spread-the-wealth bill like the one the House of Representatives just passed. Just be sure to call it a stimulus.<br>  <br>  Want to grow government beyond comprehension and make it the master of health care, energy, education, finance and, through regulation, business?

During clinton term the dems were running Fannie and Freddie, they buy the loans that the banks made, clinton and the dems pushed for them to take in more loans from LOW INCOME people, if they could repay or not, this gave the head guys at Fannie and Freddie bigger bounses and they interned gave money to the dems.<br>  <br>  Now GW took office America was in a recession (just had to add that because obama talks about what he walked into)<br>  <br>  In 2002, 2003 he sees that Fannie and Freddie is getting too big and sees they are making loans that are not good and if something happened then there would be a big problem. The dems blocked any and all attempts fro Republicans to change the regulation that allowed Fannie and Freddie to keep buying sub prime loans<br>  <br>  In 2005 Mc Cain put in a bill to do the same thing, the dems mainly chris dodd of CT filibuster it. The dems all cheered and jumped up and down, the money would still flow.<br>  <br>  Now by this time barney frank had his frank up the fannie of the head guy at Fannie Mae.

bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Union jobs are private sector jobs. <br>  <br>  Private sector jobs are jobs created by non-government work. Government workers are not allowed to be unionized.<br>  <br>  As for unions as whole, I think that America has been brainwashed by the Republicans on this issue for too long. It is true that unions can and have become corrupt in the past. But it is not the worker that has done this, it is the union leader that creates this atmosphere. The concept of a union is actually a good one. It gives everyone a shared and louder voice in the workforce. Instead of paying high insurance premiums like individuals do, the union is allowed to negotiate with employers for lower premiums. Instead of being treated like another number, the union provides workers with a place to go to be recognized as a person. If there were more unions in this country, the gap between the poor and the rich would not be widening. Corporations would be receiving so much of the tax breaks and bonuses, bankrupting the middle class. <br>  <br>  Most people think that unions cause businesses to go elsewhere, but really, companies can operate under unions. They have to learn to negotiate with them and not just give-in. The deals in the auto-industry are not because of the unions. They are because the crackpot CEO's that have been running this industry for the past two of three decades don't know what they are doing.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Hmmm...... two questions and two statements. <br>  <br>    So, having someone to figure out how much tax is owed and collecting it, doesn't generate any money for the govt?   Union jobs pay the highest wages of the private sector blue collar jobs, so those jobs pay the highest taxes - correct?

I think Obama is a terrible economist. Socialist generally doesn't believe in capitalism. It's how it is. He believes that the government should be responsible for every single human being in the country. That's a great thing but for an economy in shambles it really not something you can afford.|`|398587d073be2044e73ae194ff808b61aa	Obama is from Chicago.

Negotiating with terrorists gives them legitimacy.  Anyone that would deal from a standpoint of "If you don't see things my way I will commit some brutal act on perfectly innocent people is pure evil. You do not negotiate with evil, you destroy evil.. Some people do not know what evil is.

I'm interested in your definition of it.<br>  <br>  Alright well, thank you for your definition. It would most likely be hard to negotiate given the circumstances, and of the past. However, another pro or con could be when the two sides start talking about morality- and would negotiations ever get that far? Both these Jihad or religious groups and the United States have their own personal preferences for destinies. The US happens to be manifest, while some of these other people, mainly people advocating Jihad or "holy war" ( which it's not) believe in their God given rights to rule.

They may encourage eye/hand coordination and in some cases problem solving via the puzzle like games, but it doesn't serve as a real educational device. <br>  <br>  When I am researching something of interest and find it's not all written in English, I often use Atla-vista's bable fish translation site.

Our desire to accomplish more in the same amount of time leads us to multitask online with multiple e-mail, bulletin board and social networking accounts open simultaneously, resulting in information overload.<br>  <br>  Worst of all, we've allowed our lazy habits to creep into our language through constant text messaging. People no longer see the importance of proper grammar or writing skills because they can communicate everything in shorthand code. This creates a culture in which the written word is no longer prized, and contributes to the decline of reading books and newspapers as well as a lack of comprehension of formal writing.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't believe technology promotes one thing over another.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Nothing wrong with socialism. In fact it's misunderstood and demonized by capitalism appologists.  Socialism is the only civilized alternative to the current free market anarchy that brings war death and oppression.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk69e1Vcmvg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk69e1Vcm...</a><br>  In the United States, far-Right Republicans and Democratic liberals alike have sold many people on the notion that the market should be the main force to drive the economy and define social relationships. They maintain that government should stay off people's backs and out of our wallets. They promote rugged individualism and consumerism couched in terms like "personal responsibility," "freedom" and "independence." "Greed is good!" was the mantra of Michael Douglas' character, Gordon Gecko, in the 1980s movie "Wall Street," and those became the words to live by in the '80s and '90s. The philosophy and value of greed was taken to heart by many a corporate CEO, and, over the past three decades, this twisted logic -- underlined by the values of individualism and the culture of consumerism -- has turned back the clock on human development with devastating consequences.<br>  More than 12 million American children grow up in impoverished homes. When compared with 20 other wealthy nations on measures of health, safety and relative poverty, America's children fare amongst the worst.<br>  In terms of the human development index, the United States has fallen from second place in 1990 (behind Canada) to 12th place. This decline continued through both the Clinton and Bush administrations, with the US falling to sixth in 1995, ninth in 2000, and 12th in 2005.<br>  In certain respects, the decline is even worse. The US is 34th in infant mortality—with a level comparable to Croatia, Estonia, Poland and Cuba. US school children perform significantly below their counterparts in countries like Canada, France, Germany and Japan, and 14 percent of the population, some 40 million people, lack basic literacy and number skills.<br>  Of the world’s 30 richest nations, which comprise the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States has the highest proportion of children living in poverty, 15 percent, and the most people in prison, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the whole population. With five percent of the world’s population, the US has 24 percent of the world’s prisoners.<br>  The report notes: “Social mobility is now less fluid in the United States than in other affluent nations. Indeed, a poor child born in Germany, France, Canada or one of the Nordic countries has a better chance to join the middle class in adulthood than an American child born into similar circumstances.”<br>  In overall life expectancy, the United States ranks an astonishing 42nd, behind not only Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and all the countries of Western Europe, but also Israel, Greece, Singapore, Costa Rica and South Korea.<br>  <br>  The gigantic scale of the existing productive forces and the extraordinary advances in technology are more than sufficient not only to abolish poverty but also to guarantee every human being on the planet a high standard of living. Culture should be flowering amidst unprecedented material wealth. But, instead, conditions of life are deteriorating for the working class, and human culture, deprived of perspective and hope for the future, is in deep crisis. The source of the contradiction between what is and what should be is a global economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, and the irrational division of the world into rival nation-states.<br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  <br>  * Almost half the world — over 3 billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day.<br>  * The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the 41 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (567 million people) is less than the wealth of the world’s 7 richest people combined.<br>  * Nearly a billion people entered the 21st century unable to read a book or sign their names.<br>  * Less than one per cent of what the world spent every year on weapons was needed to put every child into school by the year 2000 and yet it didn’t happen.<br>  * 1 billion children live in poverty (1 in 2 children in the world). 640 million live without adequate shelter|`|sgua3lH6aa	Socialism is a system that sounds "fair" at first but ends up being unfair in the end.  Margaret Thatcher said something like this -  the problem with socialism is that you eventually end up running out of the other guy's money.  When a person works hard, they should be able to keep their own money (as much as possible - of course, the gov't should handle the items stated in the Constitution, like defense) and decide what charities to donate to.  In a socialist country, the government decides what to do with your hard earned money.  Eventually everyone suffers.  Please look at socialist countries - really study them.  You will see that America, with its capitalist system, is really superior.  We need to improve America, but not change its basic system.  And that is my straight answer.

"Socialist" checks on capitalism began in the late 19th century, and they continue today. Even Bush was a socialist.

2lFRYr8Eaa	You could be charged for any crime you admit to while on the stand.  Those charges are not normally allowed to be added.   My best advice is to talk this out with your attorney.  He/she will know the prosecutor and perhaps the judges that gets the case. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way.  If you were tried for stealing a car, and your defense is that it was not you since you were busy killing someone, take the easier fall.|`|lUSTFw94aa	As long as it remains un-adjudicated, the DA can add any charges they think they can prosecute. <br>  <br>  Piling on charges is something cops like to do and helps "make something stick".<br>  <br>  And you are an accessory to a crime. and what you post here is admissible as evidence.If you are going to tesitfy against another make sure you have a plea deal in exchange for your testimony.<br>  <br>  Get a lawyer.

He'll respond probably like he did when Russia went into Georgia. The guy gets up there and says both sides need to work it out. Wow, great.

But, they are too blind to see that every law that infringes on the rights of smokers, and every extra tax placed on smokers just opens the door for them to do the same thing to others.<br>  <br>  Being over weight causes more health problems than smoking does, so I see the next step being the rights of fat people being limited and taken away, and when it happens I'm going to laugh my a$$ off because they have nobody to blame but themselves.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Up to 62 cents a pack in order to pay for SCHIP - the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, signed into effect by President Obama on February 4th.

Just listen and get a good understanding of what they're feeling.<br>  <br>  In the end, if you want to join when you're 18, there is nothing they can do.

BIQrsl4paa	Fiscal conservatism means just what many of the others have already stated.<br>  Where the Liberals went wrong, is making the assumption that our founding fathers intended the government to function as the be-all and end-all of all the social programs that their party has enacted over the last half century.<br>  The only guarantees the Constitution provides, are the rights to, Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. It seems the liberals construe that to mean: Life= being supported by the government. Liberty= the same thing. The Pursuit of Happiness= the government will ensure that no one has to 'pursue' very hard.<br>  I honestly don't believe the founding fathers ever intended for the government to assume the roll of 'Mommy and Daddy' for the people of the U.S., because they themselves, were willing and able to provide for themselves and their families through the fruits of their own labors.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	You see when the government "tries to help poor people" what really happens is that they take a BIG middle man cut. For example for welfare recipient each receive 15k a year, but the cost per recipient is 45k. So for every 3 dollar we give the government we get 1 back.<br>  <br>  Also fiscal conservatism is perfectly compatible with helping people out. It is call charity, if people didn't have t support such a bloated government there would be a lot more of it.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	when you punish fiscally responsible people by harnessing them with the debt created by the irresponsible then every thing crumbles. By allowing people who cannot afford a given home or car to take on that debt and then be given a pass when they default its gonna fall to those who have exercised good judgment to pay the bill. It is essentially wealth redistribution and we now have a government that is punishing the productive and rewarding the the leaches.|`|DhqWBZOKaa	Fiscal what now?  ;o)<br>  <br>  Oh, yes.  The theory is coming back to me, now.  It's just so hard to recall a time when it was practiced.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually the other answers suited me fine.|`|620L80L0aa	Just wanted to say that I was going to respond but the above answers did it for me.<br>  <br>  I love reading well thought out questions and intelligent answers.|`|ubrOdZqMaa	Sorry Fiscal conservation has worked for 300 years.

But they don't think about what happens once you run out of people to tax, and then socialism collapses. On the housing part that is also another huge thing with democrats they want everyone to be equal even people that haven't earned anything. So basically democrats offer false hope and lies. I'm not saying that conservatives don't lie because every politician lies to some degree but the democrats just spread false hope|`|CjpLFJgVaa	I personally believe that they did this knowing that the poor wouldn't be able to pay the mortgages, so they would have another reason to create more wasteful govt. programs where we would end up paying more taxes.|`|AA10397522	The budget deficit and national debt have grown under 3 of the last 4 presidents, excluding barack obviously for lack of data.

This is a good intention.  Their method is to make as many people as possible dependent on government.  Government is not very good at this, hence the results are not what the Democrats intended.  <br>  Good intentions:  unwise methods: bad results.<br>  Wisdom is harder to come by than good intentions.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	The Liberal attempts to control behavior via legislation.  the thought is people are to stupid, or cannot be trusted to make the correct decision, so the adult figure (Gov't) is required to make the decisions and exert control for them.

You can be posted to the middle of nowhere where you  have to be flown in and get supplies once every couple of months. It can take days for back up to come.<br>  Or you get posted in the middle of a large rural area with back up 3-4 hours away (like Mayerthorpe, where the 4 RCMP were left to die after being shot for hours until back up arrived).  If you are lucky, there may be a local force that may be able to respond a little quicker. <br>  The one good thing is if they decide to back you if you screw up, they can make alot go away and will relocate you.  <br>  If they don't, you could end up in jail like one mountie. After wrestling with a suspect who got his gun from him 3 times, the third time he got it back, he was exhausted and felt he would loose it again and be shot, so he shot the suspect, hitting him once in the chest, once in the head.  He was trained to "double tap".  They ruled the second shot killed him and was unneccessary.  The RCMP didn't back him and did not testify that "double tapping" was his training.  He was sentenced to jail time.|`|ocmiI3HNaa	Southern California has some of the most disciplined and well trained officers in the country. <br>  <br>  While the media spouts off about LAPD's use of excessive force, they do in fact show a great deal of restraint... in most cases. <br>  <br>  But again, as far as training and tactics go...

It has undoubtedly played a role in this economic fiasco, it was poorly planned, and virtually every reason given for it has been proven faulty.<br>  <br>  As if he needed to add insult to injury, he shamelessly used 9/11 as an excuse to push the Patriot Act - one of the most constitutionally flawed, privacy eroding pieces of trash ever written.<br>  <br>  The infrastructure is crumbling. As Bush and company diverted funds to the war, other needy projects suffered. How many highway bridges collapsed during the terms of other presidents?<br>  <br>  On education, "no child left behind" was poorly conceived to begin with - how do you help students by taking money away from the schools that need it?<br>  <br>  Katrina - HOW... in the name of all things warm and fuzzy... does it take eight days just to get water to the Super-dome?<br>  <br>  He jumped on the gay-marriage ban juuuuuust long enough to get some ultra-conservatives to like him again... he doesn't honestly care a bit about American families.<br>  <br>  Finally, back to the economy - he may not have been solely responsible, but he WAS among the last to state that it was "fundamentally sound."

If you are afraid of heights, do not bother.  Also, not one branch of the military has special forces that DON'T jump out of a plane of helicopter.  I went through Airborne and Air Assault schools.  They aren't bad, don't worry.  My advice - suck it up and drive on, you'll be proud when you do.  Good luck.

However, just because an officer isn't running with his lights and sirens on, doesn't mean he's not responding to an emergency situation - so who's to judge?  Just like an ambulance or fire truck, a cop may need to respond to certain situations with a "silent approach".  He may be going to a burglary in progress, for instance - or to a house where someone with epilepsy is sent into seizures by seeing the flashing lights.  So it's hard to tell what is and isn't an emergency, which makes it difficult to judge whether or not the officer's driving is appropriate.|`|SkOALXv9aa	If you are not in the field of law enforcement you may not understand what you would feel is an emergency and how the call came out that the officer is responding to.<br>  <br>  Police officers follow the rules of the road under normal conditions.  They do have equipment and the authority to use such equipment when necessary.<br>  <br>  Those who believe that law enforcement officers routinely spend an eight hour shift driving at excessive speeds and using their emergency equipment to permit them to violate the law are sadly unaware of the law enforcement polices and procedures.  If they were to do that which some of you feel they do, their job would last just about as long as a snowball on a hot summer day.<br>  <br>  It may just be a good idea for those of you with such a low opinion of law enforcement professionals to read up a little on the requirements and the code of ethics that they must live by before you decide to provide your knowledge of a profession that you know little to nothing about.|`|b82ba5aa852c579743186c47f88619caaa	They are not supposed to.

While the business increases prices to maintain profit, it wil usually just toss the amount that the labor isn't getting to compensate for higher costs of living in as extra profit.<br>  <br>  Do you see where the wealth is being redistributed here?<br>  <br>  The modern trend to do this is to ship jobs overseas, and get the tax incentives for doing so, so by the time production is done. its even cheaper than the wages paid.<br>  <br>  this causes a decrease in wealth in the USA. Do you think your own country is suppose to just stand by and ship their wealth out the door or the working class is going to stand by and take lower and lower wages because the boss man wants to make more money?<br>  <br>  I don't know what your job is but computer related and tehcnology related jobs are shipping out to india. Just like the exodus of American jobs started with TV assembly, the ones going to India is starting with customer service and telemarketing.

($7,40,000.)<br>  <br>  Someone making $60,000 a year would be required to pay a whopping 30% in taxes. ($18,000.)<br>  <br>  In the end, the guy making $40M a year would come away with about $33M after taxes--and still have plenty of money to burn--while the guy making $60K would come away feeling a little poorer each year and have little save or spend as a cushion. (In reality, $60K isn't what it used to be these days.)<br>  <br>  But what you're confusing is what Obama plans on doing to the super-rich and the uber-wealthy.<br>  <br>  He is raising the tax rates on those whom can *pay* more taxes (those whom haven't before under Bush's "tax-free"-zone), while lessening the overwhelming tax burden placed--by him--on the middle and working class Americans.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	I think everyone should pay the same rate, but I don't think the rich should have so many loopholes that allow them to avoid taxes.

But when the ice is gone, the water is still being heated by the hot room, and will eventually get hot itself.<br>  <br>  Well, that is what is happening to the Earth.  It is getting hotter, and melting the ice at the polar ice caps.

0Yyl68oDaa	Obama has said a lot of things.  He has done little except to increase spending with money this nation does not have.<br>  <br>  Tuesday, he said he would reward the military for their service (or words to that effect).   Today, he has capped their pay to a 2-2.9% raise.   <br>  <br>  He is going to cut $2 x10^12 in two years, to do so he will raise spending by $4 x 10^12.    Will Congress go along with that?   <br>  <br>  Health Care would be easier to solve, if every individual paid for his own with non-taxable dollars.   Yes, there are individuals who need to obtain medical services that they or their families could never afford but that set is small.   Most people could buy their care for cash and this would encourage thrift and out of greed individuals would more likely take better care of themselves.  -- to save cost.  <br>  <br>  Congress wants to destroy the medical magic that is America.<br>  Congress wants your medical data!<br>  <br>  Did you hear that Mr O, want to pour more money into education --- which may not be needed --- perhaps if one allocated all of the educational dollars spent each year to individuals/parents --- they could buy better education on the open market.<br>  <br>  Remember, anyone who had $1.00 more than you and spends it openly is Filthy rich.    When spendthrifts like Bloomberg openingly reject a tax increase because it would drive down revenues, people should listen.|`|818vnUN8aa	Back in September Biden said paying taxes is patriotic.

Under the Dem's and the Rep's the citizens of this country have been spending money to a fair thee well driving up credit card debit and inflating the prices of real estate like there was no tomorrow.  We urged people who shouldn't have got into the home buying market to buy a great home on impossible terms all at a time when economists were saying it can't last and driving our savings rate,the amount of money we are salting away for a rainy day, into negative numbers fr the first time in this nation's history.  <br>  <br>  So in 2007 the Real Estate Market in Florida and California burst and the market began to wobble the economy began to slow down. In Sept 2008 Wall Street melted down and we began to see how much trouble our profligate spending caused us and that our banks had tried to hide toxic loans by bundling them up into packages and selling them over seas. The Bush Administration tried to solve the problem by handing money to several bank to get credit going again. That didn't work so they threw more money at the problem and drove our national debt higher. <br>  <br>  Now it is Obama's turn to try and solve the problem he started with a poorly written stimulus package. But he is doing more then the Republicans are doing when they complain about wasteful spending and cry to the press about the Democratic Congress.  What you propose has been tried and it hasn't worked . I'm for cutting Government pay yes Senator and Representative included and their Health Care Perks, ending the wasteful pork projects that the Rep Congress passed like the Navy's LSC and P-8 Projects, The Air Force's  new tanker and stealth bomber projects, The Army's FCS and Stealth Helicopter Project  and last of all the new President's Helicopter if we need one don't go over seas to by it buy it from  company that has a ready made model that uses parts that ar all ready in the inventory the Sikorsky S-92 which uses the airframe of the SH-60 Blackhawk,Army,Nighthawk, Air Force, and Seahawk, Navy. Oh also let's stop spending time and money keeping people who won a seat the US Senate out,Al Franken, that just denying the people of Minnesota.<br>  <br>  While you put forth a lot a good ideas why can't we see what President Obama has in store for us before you start to head into the hills for the revolution.

I love when I can turn on SNL & see the Palin jokes or Jay Leno & see the guy who used mock Bush. So I love it that Palin is on Fox & her daughter is telling how her Mom was pro-choice when the question came up in her own home. So why would dems need monopoly. Reps. are mean, immature people who give dems an excuse to pick on people cause it is only fair to through it back. As a democrat I have never made fun of any group of people. Now I love hearing Jindal comments or just now they made a comment on TV that Joe the Plumber was not really not a plumber & doesn't pay taxes.

If only more people studied history, we could face the unpleasant truth that we as human beings have learned nothing from the past and are condemned to repeat it, especially in an imperial warfare/welfare state.  What people don't see are the unforseen consequences of Bush's wars and the unintended consequences of Obama's spending.  Not one conservative nor one liberal can claim they do not have blood on their hands--they ALL do, for they are liars, thieves and murderers.<br>  <br>  It is up to each person, as an individual, to think for themselves outside of the warfare/welfare/statist system and our corporatist economy, and come up with realistic solutions to our problems.  <br>  <br>  However, what we have been doing instead is trying to create religious and secular utopias in the name of bankrupt religious and secular ideologies.  Religious and secular utopias don't work in the real world.  It's nice to strive to them as goals, but eventually you have to conclude that the only way to do this is to improve humanity itself.  There have been those in the past who have tried in vain to create a new human for their new utopia.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a quote from history is apt: <br>  <br>  “The real damage is done by those millions who want to ’survive.’ The honest men who just want to be left in peace. Those who don’t want their little lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves. Those with no sides and no causes. Those who won’t take measure of their own strength, for fear of antagonizing their own weakness. Those who don’t like to make waves or enemies. Those for whom freedom, honour, truth, and principles are only literature. Those who live small, mate small, die small. It’s the reductionist approach to life: if you keep it small, you’ll keep it under control. If you don’t make any noise, the bogeyman won’t find you. But it’s all an illusion, because they die too, those people who roll up their spirits into tiny little balls so as to be safe.  Safe?!  From what?  Life is always on the edge of death; narrow streets lead to the same place as wide avenues, and a little candle burns itself out just like a flaming torch does.

An estimated 1,000 Kuwaiti nationals killed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. No conclusive figures for the number of Iraqis killed during the Gulf War, with estimates varying from as few as 1,500 to as many as 200,000. Over 100,000 Kurds killed or "disappeared". No reliable figures for the number of Iraqi dissidents and Shia Muslims killed during Saddam's reign, though estimates put the figure between 60,000 and 150,000. (Mass graves discovered following the US occupation of Iraq in 2003 suggest that the total combined figure for Kurds, Shias and dissidents killed could be as high as 300,000).

The two countries kept each other in check, in a similar way to what the United States and the Soviet Union did during the Cold War.<br>  <br>  Iran could not press its nuclear ambitions, for fear that Saddam Hussein would find out and attack.  Now in fairness, Hussein and the Iraqis did not actually have the capability of beating Iran, but Iran did nto actually know that.  So they held off, out of fear they would be thrust into a war they could not really win.  Not that Iraq could, but the two were so equally matched (at least they believed they were) that it would end with both countries destroyed.  So Iran held off the nuclear ambitions.<br>  <br>  Now because Saddam Hussein is no longer present, and the new Iraqi leader Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki is allied to Iran; Iran has now begun moving quickly on its nuclear ambitions.<br>  <br>  Now its a huge threat, and we can't do much about it because PM Nouri al Maliki won't let us use Iraq as a staging ground to intimidate the Iranians into backing down.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So 1 is actually too high.

Saddam being a former US ally, he was very well informed about US plans in the future for the region. He knew what the US plans were for Israel-Palestinians, etc. In order to understand this, you have to understand that US policies are made in advance.

They don't understand your semantic arguments because what they see is that their family and friends get killed by the American war machine. How unreasonable of them huh? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlMqiPHU4zQ4pJWTslediPjty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221061825AA8d2Ve">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  I'm sure it would be OK to Americans if their neighborhoods were bombed and many of their friends and family died because some foreign super power insists there are terrorist hiding amongst them. I'm sure Americans would understand that's not war. <br>  <br>  I for my part don't understand how anyone can be that insensitive to the suffering of fellow human beings and still claim to represent any moral authority. Sad and shameful<br>  <br>  As for Obama's claim that Afghanistan and Pakistan constitute the “central front in the war on terror” and that American forces are fighting “the terrorists who hit us on 9/11,” he is engaging in the same kind of lying propaganda that the Bush administration used to promote the war in Iraq.<br>  The reality is that the US intervention in Afghanistan—like the one in Iraq—is aimed not at combating terrorism, but at securing US hegemony over crucial energy reserves and pipeline routes in both regions.<br>  US-led forces are engaged in a dirty colonial-style war in Afghanistan, confronting popular resistance from forces that have nothing to do with Al Qaeda. To suppress this resistance, they have resorted to an increasingly indiscriminate use of air power, killing growing numbers of civilians and, in turn, fueling popular hatred of the occupation.<br>  The Obama administration's Afghan troop "surge" and the ensuing ratcheting up of violence will have catastrophic consequences for the Afghani and Pakistani peoples. It adds a new, explosive dynamic to the decades-old geopolitical rivalry between India and Pakistan and will intensify the great power competition for control of oil-rich Central Asia, sowing the seeds for even larger and more destructive wars.<br>  The current US intervention in Afghanistan is the culmination of three decades of intrigue and subversion, which first saw the US arm Islamic guerrillas, in order to destabilize a pro-Soviet government in Kabul and draw the Soviet Union into a disastrous land war, and later, in the name of fighting "Islamist terrorism," occupy Afghanistan and install a corrupt and violent puppet government.<br>  The intensification of the war in Afghanistan will only further destabilize the entire region.<br>  The explosive geopolitical tensions that are being stoked by the US drive to extend its reach into Central Asia were starkly revealed in last August's eruption of the Russo-Georgian war.<br>  The development of a global depression will only intensify the great power struggle for markets, resources and geopolitical advantage.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I honestly don't know anything about war.

Truth be told, the states have every right under the Constitution to secede from the union. He violated the supreme law of the land by turning brother against brother in the War of Northern Aggression. You think Vietnam and Iraq are unconstitutional? How about the civil war? Lincoln was bound by the Constitution to allow the southern states their right to secession, as the federal government is an extension of state will and nothing more, per the 9th and 10th amendments.<br>  <br>  So I'm not all that sure I'd say Lincoln saved America. He simply denied states rights, resulting in a preservation of the Union as he wanted it. <br>  <br>  In this light, I do like the comparison that everyone makes to Obama.

5GJSJyiXaa	I hope this answers your question. Obama took office after Bush and other conservatives ran up the debt by the war in Afghanistan, Iraq. Seems like whenever they are in office with a majority they are always willing to go to war against rebels without a just formal declaration of war against a country who attacks us. Osama Bin Laden is still free and terrorist rebels are always finding ways to kill innocent people. Why didn't Bush catch him on his first or second try without declaring war on a Nation? Sure he said he was gonna git the people responsible for 9-11 but he failed to get Osama Bin Laden. After trillions of our public funds spent for this war and a financially broken US of A, there's still no captured Bin Laden. There's still no accountability for how the money was spent and the only response we Americans get is "Well you approved us going to war and we did it "our way" with your explicit approval."<br>  <br>  Bush is no longer our president, thanks to American voters, and Obama sincerely desires to get us out of this financial nightmare. It wont be done overnight like Bushes war, but he's still deciding on who in our government our is reputable and really wanting to do what's best for our country.<br>  <br>  As for the deficit, everyone who's talking bad about Obama must think their financial experts but notice they didn't plan to keep the deficit down in their plans to get Osama Bin Laden. It would be nice if  Interpol, Homeland security (more unnecessary spending), and our already existing Security departments went back to doing their jobs correctly and the way they were intended to be done by advising the president with "accurate intelligence reports" rather than with "actionable intelligence reports." Personally, I think some of the "actionable intelligence reports" were fabricated for a private agenda of keeping the American People in the dark about what the formal administration real goals actually were, because they sure weren't about capturing Osama Bin Laden.<br>  <br>  If you are really that concerned about the deficit, go back to Economy 101 get a passing grade so you can take Economy 211 and Economy 312. This is where you learn about waste, balancing budgets, and you get an introduction into ethics. Which evidently is an optional course because some American People are still getting away with "skimming from the public funds" to line their own pockets instead of using the funds for what they were intended / approved for.|`|91I5u8F9aa	No it works, i had a balance on my credit card and wanted to pay it off, so, I spent more on it,<br>  <br>  See.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Very Big of you Wookie boy. <br>  <br>  Now to the question;<br>  Well yes it is a little strange, particularly when it's so simplified. But with a simplistic view of the economy you could also say during an economic down-turn people should spend less and save their money, in reality they need to spend more. Of-course it becomes much more complicated when you're dealing with an entire economy and money that doesn't actually physically exist. Not to mention the fact that politicians have to please a multitude of different sides while trying not to step on other politicians feet. Result is you often get policies that may appear well thought out but are in fact terrible and vice-versa. Personally, I'm reserving judgment for now. Giving it alittle time to see how it plays out.

As a Firefighter, I’ve witnessed literally thousands of instances of abuse of this system. Daily I’m called to medicals were the patient has either minor non-life threatening injuries, or a chronic condition that requires them to go to the hospital regularly. In either circumstance, the patient calls for an ambulance, and is transported for care. I’ve seen Paramedics argue with the patient that they don’t need an ambulance, that they are healthy enough to drive themselves and should do so. The Paramedic can’t refuse service, but they can try to get the patient to drive to the hospital. The base rate for transport in my city is $500. We run 80,000 medical calls a year and it is estimated that 60% of those patients do not have insurance. If only half of those calls required transport the city foots the bill at 12 Million Dollars a year. Add to that the actual cost of medical treatment associated with those calls and you begin to see why everyone else’s care costs so much. The Hospital has to make up the difference somewhere.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	Medicare and aid force negotiated rates for all who use it, raising the cost on everyone left.

I think most of them disapproved of the spending.  All of the Republicans I know complained heavily about both of GWB's stimulus plans.  Most agree with the war effort in Afghanistan and they've always been mixed on our presence in Iraq.  I haven't seen a shift since Bush left office.  They seem to be outraged over the current spending because they see it as a continuation of what they're willing to admit was fiscally irresponsible on the part of the Bush administration.  It's not the hypocricy that many are trying to paint it as.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	No. There is no mistake that both sides made huge mistakes.

8SFoQvVLaa	Actually I think the date was negotiated by the Bush administration at the insistence of the Iraqi leadership.  Its a bit later than most Americans would like to see, I think, but if most troops are out by then...it would be a substantial improvement.<br>  <br>  The previous poster's math in wholly incorrect.  There are approximately 150k troops in Iraq alone.  Reducing that number to less than 50k is obviously not a 20% reduction of current levels. <br>  <br>  The president always intended to increase the troop levels in Afghanistan.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Nope. its spin to counter act the flaming hes been getting for afghanastan. <br>  <br>  Freind of mine just got orders for his 3rd tour to Iraq.<br>  <br>  What do i think will happen, same thing that been happening with democrats talk of defeat. Violence is going to break out again with the empowerment of news like this.|`|d4OSNZSdaa	Well, he's sending more troops to Afghanistan. Hopefully Iraq won't go Jenga.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	It should be sooner AND there should be fewer than 50,000 left behind.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	Under his current authorizations there will be 35,000 to 50,000 troops in Iraq for "the foreseeable future".<br>  He has also authorized troop levels in Afghanistan to nearly double this year by adding an additional 17,000. The administration has also proposed an additional 20,000 to be deployed to Afghanistan in 2010.<br>  <br>  From the administrations authorizations already and the proposed deployments, there will still be over 100,000 troops deployed to combat zones in those countries. Only slightly less then the average over the last six years. And just a reduction of about 20% from levels of today.<br>  Sure doesn't sound like they're 'coming home' to anyone who pays attention.<br>  <br>  Edit: for Joan S, there are currently slightly less than 130k in Iraq and just over 20k in Afghanistan. 20% would be around 120k. I should have given a range of 20% to 30%. But the point is DO NOT expect this to end anytime soon as promised during the campaign.|`|ffHcbUeLaa	Have anyone ever won a war by announcing to the enemy when the forces will be withdrawn?  It seems like a no brainer because now the enemies in Iraq can maintain a low profile until that time, and then can strike with increased strength and overtake the country by the end of 2010 - which will require much more funding and additional troops.<br>  <br>  I think the best strategy would be to aim at the shortest withdrawal, but for God's sake, not announce the date like a stupid 5-year-old, giving the enemy enough notice to reorganize.  If they emphasized training Iraqis, the withdrawal could be earlier but without such publicity.<br>  <br>  Also remember one thing - when the troops come home, we need to have jobs for them, additional medical care, rehabilitation, housing.  After WWII we had baby boom when the troops came home.  I do not believe we are now ready for immediate troop withdrawal.|`|IzhKZfsMaa	We should pull out immediately.  Not because the job is done, but because the USA is going down the toilet.  It is time to try to keep the Titanic from sinking, not a time to police the world.

This bull crap has to come to an end or the USA will just be something people will read about in the history books.|`|Vl40Plzoaa	I hope it works out.

Obama, what a war monger!|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Yes, I agree. <br>  <br>  Iraq will be ok for a while....but, make no mistake about it....IF and When they EVER have a problem, infighting, poverty, whatever...it will come back to the US. These people have been warring over which tribe of Islam has the right teacher for hundreds of years. They have very long memories and resentments. We have done our best, and it is not the fault of our forces, but I know for a fact that they have a tendancy of blaming future problems on past situations. This time will be no different. Hopefully, they will remain peaceful and try to govern responsibly and compassionately for their people. <br>  Afghanistan will be far different. We are sending troops now because we need the backup for the troops already there. We will eventually remove them all--hopefully sooner than later--and we will leave Afghanistan in the only way we can.....a situation that will be similar to what is present now. There is little chance of us 'winning' in Afghanistan....as there is nothing to win and no real support from Afghans or Pakistan. We will, again, do our best, but it won't be enough to create a working democracy there. Right now, our duty is to back up the troops already on the ground....long enough to workout an exit strategy.|`|yuqZ6M96aa	it actually sounds like bush's endless wars will continue rather then cease like they need to, we should end all military campaigns as soon as possible and let the people rebuild their own nations in their own way, we have no right to meddle and arbitrarily ruin nations; we also dont need to struggle with funding such atrocities

He fails, we fail.|`|C2HHfun2aa	No it does not require you to hate Obama. <br>  <br>  What time of crisis are you talking about? If you mean the recession then this is not a crisis. First off the recession under Carter was much worse we had double digit unemployment and inflation. If the government would leave the economy alone most recessions last between 6 and 18 months. Do you find it interesting that this is the first recession in our history that requires a huge government spending bill, numbers bailout and a huge TARP bill. All of the other recessions we have had were fixed by lowering taxes. I know that the Democrats will whine about it being the same tired solution but history shows that is what works. History also shows that huge government spending does nothing for a recession except prolong it or makes it a depression. If you don't want this to become a depression then you should be against all of this deficit spending. In two months Obama has spent more money than has been spent on the Iraq war! Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.<br>  <br>  How come it was OK for Democrats to hope and even try to make Bush fail over the last 8 years but Republicans can't hope Obama fails?! I think you will find that most conservatives support the president just not his policies!|`|ErTVzpUUaa	I'm a loyal Republican!  And i said if Obamas plan works, I'll be the first to admit I was wrong, but I don't see how it can!  If your already in debt, any good economist will tell you, don't borrow to pay your debt!  And who's going to be paying for this, not only us, but our grandchildren, and great-grandchildren!  This is not the legacy I want to leave to them!  He could be as white as a ghost, and have a name as plain as Joe Smith, but if he was proposing the same policies, then I would still have to disagree with him!  I also don't agree with him on his very liberal stance on abortion, illegal immigrants, or his opinion on the war in Iraq!|`|aFC72tLZaa	You should respect our President no matter what party you belong to.  Now, if we can convince the Party of NO to support him we might be able to fix this bushed up economy.  What is wrong with cancelling the tax cuts for the wealthy to support health care?  Why do the born again deficit haters (republicans) hate running up a deficit when that's all they did for the last 8 years?  What's wrong with ending 30 years of Reagan-Bushism to fix this country once and for all? <br>  <br>  And to you racists out there:  Barack will fix this economy and George will be found guilty of war crimes.|`|HSftDDOqaa	That's like asking does being a loyal American require me to hate Canadians> It doesn't make any cents.

And at the rate he is going he will not succeed.|`|UhXTWNKZaa	you ll just be a re-pube-ican like Arnold|`|WsE51AD4aa	No. It doesn't require that I think you're more interested in the how conservatives view Mr. Obama. Don't make the mistake of assuming Republican=conservative and definitely don't assume the opposite. That said, many conservatives feel that Obama's policies are fundamentally flawed as were those before him. Both the Democrats and the Republicans have been adhering to the same economic philosophy (Keynesian Economics) for the past 70 years. The only difference between the two is how Keynesian they wish to be (Republicans generally prefer to be less so, Democrats more so). Both generally favor a strong federal government, but for different reasons. Switching back and forth between the two cannot possibly offer change.<br>  <br>  Many conservatives hate that Mr. Obama got a media pass and is seen as such a hero despite not actually doing anything yet. They also feel his policies will fail to accomplish their goals and are largely constructed to look good and pass congress quickly but not constructed on sound principles. I'll let you make the decision yourself, but you should try to move beyond the image the media presents.<br>  <br>  It's not always us vs them, Repubs vs Dems. There's far more involved and, by lumping many competing ideologies into two parties, we fail to offer our citizens much of a choice. If you want to read more check out my website:|`|B42PBRk6aa	For the LAST TIME, bone monkey, we don't hate Obama, we hate his defeatist, backward, socialist, moronic policies.

Only an idiot would WANT him to fail. <br>  Truly, only time will tell, and I know that I am praying for his success, because HIS failure is MY failure, HIS success is MY success. <br>  <br>  I love my country much more than I care about a party.|`|GaGSjIkNaa	True.

And that means supporting the President be he Democrat, Republican or any other party that may emerge. 'Support' doesn't always mean 'agree'. And as an American you should voice that you don't agree but calling people names, threatning to move to other countries, spouting things like 'Liberal' or 'Conservative' like they are dirty words, and hating someone simply because they are a representative of the opposing party is NOT supporting our President or our country. All of that is plain immaturity (on BOTH sides, two wrongs don't make a right guys) and I for one get disgusted by those types of 'conversations' and immediatley tune out go to a different topic etc. I agree with you as an American citizen you should support (again I stress that 'support' does not mean 'agree') the present President.|`|u23sBafTaa	No, I 've never known the republicans to ask you to sign a document that No one said you had to wish him to fail,  maybe you should stop the caffiene a little , you seem kind of tense !|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No, being a loyal Republican would require you to hate Bush/Cheney/Gingrich/DeLay and the rest of the rancid neocons.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Loyal republicans get all of their opinions from Rush Limbaugh.

What we need is a chance for the market to liquidate bad debt and allow prices to correct themselves, not the same New Deal crap that prolonged the depression.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Hell no. Come on, now we have to be working for the government, just to benefit ourselves with cash that will be totally worthless and dead in the coming months? Most of this money will come from China, even if we had jobs, we will be forced to repay the government debts, and high taxes this horrible stimulus will create.|`|0F47hNHHaa	what are they going to create? taxing the middle/upper class, you know the people who own buisness' and create jobs. they are going close shops cause they can't afford the buinsess and create more job loss, is this the fairness you voted for? trickle up poverty people, obama doesnt care if your poor, as long as everyone else is too.|`|AA11450062	In the short term yes while we can recover from capitalism failing to serve the American people.

Government is just recycling existing money not creating any new wealth. <br>   Doing this on borrowed or printed money just lowers the value of the dollar further thereby defeating the purpose for spending that dollar.|`|8Z8Ea2VUaa	Yes, because if lots of people were out of work, we would be in a depression.<br>  <br>  Right now, we are currently in a recession. There are 4 stages of the cycle. Prosperity, recovery, recession, and depression. If more jobs are created, the unemployment rate would drop and we would leave the stage of recession and enter recovery. (Although more factors are an issue and would need to be addressed to get out of the recession)|`|PKzE3AVBaa	What jobs other than defense and bureaucrats does the government create? Are we all going to be in defense or in a public office building? The "stimulus" is going to give money to politically connected companies,( see trucks for hire, Chicago). They will spend half on existing employees, a quarter to the politicians, and a quarter for themselves. Tony Resco, The money will be use for shoddy work, then more will be needed to fix it.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Unfortunately yes. See the free-market doesn't care about people, and yet in theory it works well. But in theory there is no need for everyone to be employed. In theory we could leave out the government completely. Those who don't have jobs and can't steal would then simply die out and the whole equation would balance itself out. The problem is the messy moral questions about this and the strange idea that everyone should get a good chance, because if you expect that, you need some sort of government interference in the economy.|`|ViEgekyIaa	I wouldn't want the US to be another Russia or Cuba, their people come here to work (their @sses off) and sent $$$ home so their families can live like human beings.

d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	Well to teach them how of course. Problem with that though is you have to be selective of who you teach. That and first teach them how to conserve and be stand alone efficient and  effective. Greed usually corrupts even the best taught. Self discipline, stamina and integrity are key to a good selection for an individual. Resiliency is also very vital if not the most overall important part of the selection process.|`|0G7Ehzbuaa	Are we teaching people in underdeveloped countries how to rid themselves of their dictators? Because, apparently, those people choose to be poor. <br>  <br>  But why would we do that, anyways? This way, the capitalists can exploit labour in these countries because it is more profitable to do so.|`|QY1CN3n0aa	Invest in science<br>  Then we will be able to genetically engineer fish that jumps out of the water and cooks itself.<br>  :P|`|E9XL5x3Paa	I believe the Capitalist answer would either be to sell fish to the masses; or find a new source of food that the masses do not currently have access to, and sell them that new source of food.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are asking about the Republican/Democrat debate, then might I remind you that it is the Democrats who push education.  They provide fish to the people while at the same time teaching them to fish, so they can eventually stand up on their own; as opposed to Republicans, who go to other countries and steal their "fish" and hand it over to the rich, so they can sell it to the poor.
OLCoFKQraa	so your argument is to either have socialism or dead children? Wow.<br>  <br>  I see, well no matter how big or small the government is, no one is going to legalize little kids doing hazardous work for almost no money, so the govt has a responsibility to protect those who can't protect themselves (children for example) and to protect the god given rights of those that can, and you don't need a particularly large government for that, beyond that if businesses commit fraud or otherwise break the law they should be dealt with harshly, but the government didn't force them to do those things, in Americas case, they have an enormous government AND they let the private sector run wild, they could have had a much much much smaller government AND created common sense regulations to prevent the financial sector from doing dumb s**t, so a small government that does more where needed and does a lot lot less where it's not needed, small and efficient is the answer.
AA10164318	The progressivity of the income tax has been steadily declining, which has resulted in an imbalance which everyone has felt.<br>  <br>  Since sales tax is a regressive tax, weighing a heavier percentage bite on smaller incomes, and property taxes take a larger percentage chunk of middle income households....this has resulted in pushing the burden of government onto the middle and lower incomes.<br>  <br>  It is about time it was pushed back.|`|wdz5RMaeaa	But the point is, -  Who is going to let loose of capital and get things going again? If the Rich are more heavily taxed, they will not invest in growing the economy. <br>  <br>  On O'Reilly tonight, it was estimated that if tax plans go through, someone like O'Reilly will see an additional 20% to the over 50% he already pays.

Build another prison<br>  2.  Shut down the prison<br>  3. Let criminals go<br>  <br>  Well, CA is prime example!  Recently some liberal legislators began fighting that our prisons are overcrowded, and we dont have enough doctors, so since our budget is in the hole (like the country) starting in April they will start letting people out of jail.  Let me tell you, a cousin of my husband is a known drug dealer (dont worry folks we have no contact with him) he is a gang banger,  He is going to be let out in April because of this.

Why not apprentice them out to learn a job so when they are finally released that they would be able to find work?<br>  If we socialize medicine (looks that way, sadly) why not put some of them to work for us in doing data entry of medical records or something like that too.  <br>  Lots of them are not murderers and rapists (those people probably shouldn't be on work release programs) but many of then are actually going to be released at some point and probably got themselves in jail as they resorted to crime either to support themselves or due to a drug problem.  When I served on the Grand Jury a few years back, I was shocked by the amount of crimes and that about 90% of what we had to deal with were drug related.<br>  I have often felt that our prison system isn't doing a great deal to help people, we just warehouse them.<br>  What about chef's training so they could cook in nursing homes and hospitals, etc.  Lots of places are in need of good help.

As far as the cost goes, that is due to the fact that the criminals locked up there, have more rights guaranteed to them than any citizen who isn't incarcerated.<br>  Consider, free Medical/dental, education (even through grad and post grad degrees) and legal assistance, to name the most obvious.<br>  The biggest problem/expense with enforcing the death penalty, is the virtually endless amount of appeals a condemned prisoner can make.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	The majority of the people in prison are there for drug related non-violent offenses.  I think reducing the prison time for non-violent drug offenders and legalizing more drugs will reduce the cost of the prison system significantly.<br>  <br>  If you knew about the criminal justice system you would know the death penalty and death penalty cases cost 3 times as much as a normal non-death penalty case, so to recommend the death penalty means the costs would skyrocket more...|`|GGAgxzJNaa	It costs more to try capital cases than non-capital cases.  And it costs more to house an inmate on death row and to execute them than to keep them in prison for life.  A better solution would be to release minor criminals who have a low risk of becoming repeat offenders.<br>  And the death penalty has been proven to not be a deterrent.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	what the first answer said...stop putting people in jail for little things like drugs...things like that should be only a charge or probation. death penalty isn't a good answer.<br>  <br>  killing someone as a punishment just cause they killed someone doesn't make it right. two wrongs don't make a right. honestly, death penalty is more uncivilized than abortion. america's one of the few 1st world countries to allow it...behind in time anyone?<br>  <br>  lol and like what the answer above me said...if i kill someone and get caught, and the government wants to kill me as a punishment...that doesn't make sence. "you can't kill anyone, but I (the government) can!"<br>  <br>  <br>  so what you do is charge all those potheads and crack heads instead of locking them up. so you actually have room for the bad bad criminals.<br>  <br>  <br>  plus you know how many inocent people were put on death row? and there actually are killers who would rather be dead than spending life in prison.|`|AA12020119	I sure hope you don't end up in prison facing the death penalty for smoking a little weed or having too many driving convictions.<br>  <br>  Actually to save costs many states are doing away with the death penalty as it is too expensive.<br>  <br>  To many people are in jail who should not be there, I have an issue with a mandatory sentence law which gives no discretion to judge or jury, more rehab and less punishment as just about all are going to get out! I would also quit outsourcing them to profit making companies!<br>  <br>  Some of the laws need to be rewritten as punishment are excessive. In some states you can get life for having consensual sex with a 16 year-old if you are 18, or sometimes 4 years older. While I believe that an adult having sex with a child demands some punishment, I think life is a little much!<br>  <br>  With 14 million unemployed and most prisoners dis proportionately black, who have an unemployment rate 3 times that of whites, I would say we are not going to stop crime anytime soon!|`|kE29abUUaa	No, you can solve it by stop arresting people for trivial things.<br>  25% of the world's prison population is within the US. That's insane.<br>  Things like smoking marijuana, which isn't addictive nor is it even as harmful as smoking or drinking, can earn you a year in jail. That's just ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Many states within the US have a habit of arresting people for the stupidest reasons, because of ridiculous, unpractical laws.|`|KXd5gc0eaa	death penalty in this country will drive the cost up in other departments like the courts.

This country goes into a full blown depression a whole new reality will be upon us.  The responses to this question are pathetic.  It just shows the mentality of American Citizens.  And what about the medical nightmare that exists today in the richest country in the world.  My brother in law who claims to be a true Christian believes a persons right to health is a privelege. What hypocrisy.  Most religion is nothing more than control anyway.  I could just see Jesus talking about how we treat the poor.  Health should be a God given right.  The poorest person in the world should have the same medical care as the filthy rich.  Oh, I mean the filthy rich so called Christians.  If this is your feeling on health care that it is a privelege and not a right.  Don't call yourself some God freak in front of me.  Go preach it to the suckers.|`|JqfIJtvYaa	I believe anyone who has killed deserves to be killed, why give them the chance to do it again, and why support them for doing it?  I think that anyone who has not had a history of violent crime should serve some kind of community service, at a minimum of ten hours a day.|`|wjbQ16Ymaa	If I murder a human being, and then the state government (or federal government) murders me "officially", what's the difference?<br>  Life without parole for cold blooded killers, no jail time for drug users.|`|sM2aNguhaa	lol isn't it sad that that's the "only industry" this country really has left<br>  <br>  and it's all bull ****<br>  <br>  i've heard that like 1 out of every 100 americans is locked up now .. over non violent ****|`|VS0PuI5paa	More death penalties for murderers and more early releases for non-violent prisoners.

Under Obama $1.75 trillion which is about $17.5 billion a day. Since Obama took on the 1.2 that bush had and the deficit is at 1.75 he added $525 billion. I think it is more since the stimulus was $700 billion+.

Most Conservatives believe in fiscal responsibility, Liberals believe in billions and billions worth of pork projects, that we must ultimately pay for through higher taxes.<br>  <br>  And just so you can appreciate the gravity of what we are talking about here. If every person in America who is currently employed, and makes $75,000.00 a year, paid 100% of everything they made over that amount in taxes...we still would not have enough money to cover Obamas spending plans.<br>  <br>  So who do you think will have to make up the difference? That's right...the people who make less than $75K a year. <br>  <br>  Faulty math is the mainstay of the Democrats in charge. Willing ignorance is the mainstay of those who support them.|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	Yes, the Republicans spending was bad, and is the reason they are out of power because they ignored conservative thinking.<br>  <br>  But Obama is greatly exasperating the problem by spending HUGE amounts of money on top of what the Republicans spent.<br>  <br>  It's like this: You and your family are deeply in debt. You decide to buy a brand new Escalade to deliver pizza's.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	I suspect that many of them are blinded by the fact that our prior Republican Administration (Bush) never added the cost of war to his budget's (not to mention the no-bid contracts to Cheney's buddies at Halliburton).  Consequently, we really don't know what was spent on these wars over the past 7+ years and yet, even without those HUGE numbers on the books, the deficit Bush left Obama was still enormous.

They dont go to the city and even TRY to apply for citezenship they just start working illegally and then get upset when there caught.  and they wanna come here and wave the mexican flag around like it belongs, if you love mexico so gosh dang much go live there and dont complain about america.  and last but not least i dont care the color of your skin if you were BORN in america then you are american, not mexican.  and another thing blacks werent the only ones in slavery every race, and ethnicity has been in slavery even whites so quit cryin for repramands just because your poor.

56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	Chavez is a true menace, because unlike Castro, he sits atop an ocean of oil. He also firmly believes his own bs. He is lucky the US has its attention elsewhere (Iraq, Iran Afghanistan, North Korea). When and if he continues to bother, he will feel the full might of the US in his mug, that is unless Obama is still president. He caters to terrorists.<br>  <br>  edit: how does he pose a threat? He freely associates with governments that challenge the US. He nationalizes businesses. He abolishes term limits, defacto making himself a dictator in the "democracy" you and others in this question laud. Americans who support Chavez, those who support Obama and his failing policies,and the ultra left radicals in the US are the true danger. If you believe in Chavez so much, I suspect you will find a welcome place in Venezuela.<br>  <br>  edit II: good luck to you and your belief set. Obviously we don't agree. Yes, I have a passport and have spent a great deal of my life outside the US, and have served the US is many capacities particularly in the military. I certainly do not concur with the assessments you reach, yet will not reduce my argument to personal attacks. If it is Chavez and Venezuela you wish to hold as a shining example, and do not believe he holds either an overt or covert threat, then I firmly know those who reach such conclusions must be delusional.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Probably an apt comparison. Unfortunately, the far left-wing ideologues won't agree with you, as they find socialism/communism to be much more to their liking. That is, at least until you suggest they go and live in one of those countries. Then it becomes a bad idea.<br>  <br>  To respond to Sammy and his concern over term limits in the US.

Pakistan and India are squared off against each other and really don't have a whole lot of issue with us.

0ZPABvh8aa	On the flip side you are showing your ignorance by blaming the economy on one man, Bush. What we see today is YEARS worth.  I blame government meddling in general, both Democratl and Republican.A slow trickle of bad decisions have finally caught up with us. Obama is just making it worse.  He is no better, the only difference is that he is trying to do  a number of disastrous things all at once on a much grander scale. The biggest problem we have is people like you thinking America functions on a democracy , we don't, we have been complacent in allowing mob rule with nearly 50% of the country unhappy at any given time. Thankfully, many States and  many more to follow are waking up a little and exercising the their right to the 10th amendment and will be able to limit the power of  Obamas far reaching and destructive arm and any other future government that seeks to do us harm. The federal government has long been overstepping its authority  and meddling in things it has no business meddling in. Since Obama came to power many States have been scrambling to declare sovereignty and surprisingly not just the Republican States. I will freely admit my prejudice against liberalism as it is my right do so as you are prejudice against conservatism. Sadly, I have not seen any true conservatism for many  years.|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	So by telling you the truth we are ignorant and/or prejudice, well i have been called worst so it goes: Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) has already borrowed 800 trillion dollars (rounding up to nearest trillion) from communist china and a muslim country both of which is a conflict of interest to America and if your fake messiah Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) gets all the money he wants between now and sometime next year (which is 6 more trillion dollars) he will have borrowed more than the last three presidents combined, before Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) our national debt was 11 trillion dollars if Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) gets all the money he wants it will be over 17 trillion dollars and this is within his first year.  your fake messiah is the most expensive president ever in the entire U.S. History. So bashing Bush and claiming he cause the ship to sink is your way of avoiding the truth, while your fake messiah is taking the last life boat and rowing off to safety leaving everyone (including YOU) to go down with the ship.

A sociedade deve ter o direito de se livrar de praticantes de atos anti-sociais de extrema gravidade e de alguns outros incorrigíveis. N?o deve ser duplamente penalizada, pelo mal que lhe fez o criminoso, e a sustentá-lo na pris?o. A pena também deve ter efeito intimidador, para que outros n?o pratiquem atos semelhantes.<br>  <br>  Mas, só há uma solu??o para a violência, exigir que o Estado nacional cumpra seu dever constitucional de prover seus súditos de seguran?a.<br>  <br>  Para tanto, precisamos exigir urgentes mudan?as, rápidas e radicais, pois as penas n?o mais intimidam os bandidos. Devem ser alterados o Código Penal e o ECA. Mas, antes de mais nada, há que reduzir a maioridade penal.<br>  <br>  O ECA -Estatuto da Crian?a e do Adolescente, que foi elaborado na linha da Constitui??o de 1988, de criar direitos sem deveres, dificulta a forma??o da no??o de responsibilidade pelos próprios atos, ao mesmo tempo em permite que menores sejam explorados por criminosos para assumirem a autoria de seus crimes ou mesmo para a prática de outros. Menores assim enredados no crime raramente conseguem dele se livrarem.<br>  <br>  O defensores do ECA consideram-no legisla??o avan?adíssima, a oitava maravilha do mundo, mas enquanto outros países adotam maioridade penal até de 12 anos, ou menos, evidentemente com grada??o da pena, o ECA vem produzindo criminalidade de menores sem paralelo na história da Humanidade.<br>  <br>  Precisamos dar um chega prá lá nos falaciosos argumentos dos que se op?em à redu??o da maioridade penal:<br>  <br>  -- N?o resolve o problema da criminalidade.<br>  <br>  -- é verdade, assim como freios dos carros também n?o resolvem impedem colis?es, mas reduzem sua ocorrência.<br>  <br>  -- O que importa é educar o menor.<br>  <br>  -- Sem dúvida, a educa??o é importante, mas a cria??o da no??o de responsabilidade por seus atos é importante valor que a educa??o deve transmitir às crian?as. A par disso, muitos dos menores delinqüentes n?o estudam por conta de deficiências do sistema escolar, ainda que estas de fato existam, mais por sedu??o do crime organizado, interessado em se valer de sua irresponsbilidade penal.<br>  <br>  Mas quest?o do combate á violência n?o se restringe ao menor.<br>  <br>  Para n?o mais me alongar, anoto apenas que a pena deve intimidar o infrator, ou seja, deve ser árdua (trabalho, rígida disciplina, restri??o a visitas, uso de celulares, televis?o, etc.) e longa, podendo até ser perpétua ou de morte. A par disso, há que se eliminar a sensa??o de impunidade, que tanto contribui para aumentar o número de infra??es; urge adotar tolerancia zero, ainda que com penas alternativas à pris?o.<br>  <br>  Em resumo, urge que Legislativo, Executivo e Judiciário mudem radicalmente sua atitude perante o combate à criminalidade.<br>  <br>  Para que isso aconte?a, todos e cada um de nós deve fazer o que estiver ao seu alcance.

RSB91g2Iaa	Vou tentar responder aos questionamentos da Thais: <br>  Os militares chegaram ao poder em 1964 gra?as a uma revolu??o contra subversivos que tentaram, naquela época, implantar no Brasil a ditadura do proletariado mediante atos de violência abusiva, única e exclusivamente pelo apego ao poder! E pelo fato de o povo, à época, ter clamado pela interven??o das For?as Armadas, os militares entraram em a??o. A democracia que vc vive hoje, e o t?o falado estado democrático de direito, vigente atualmente em nosso país, o qual vc usufrui e que garante todos os seus direitos e liberdades, só existe gra?as à interven??o tempestiva das For?as Armadas. Se você acha que estou exagerando, por que n?o verifica a realidade de Cuba nos dias atuais. O que tem naquele país, nos dias de hoje, que era pregado pelos idealistas, liderados por Fidel, que promoveram a revolu??o comunista naquela na??o? E os ideais de igualdade, fraternidade, solidariedade, fraternidade e desenvolvimento pregados pelos líderes subversivos? Onde se verificam na Cuba de hoje? Os militares intervieram em 1964 em raz?o de uma imaturidade política e democrática dos governantes da época. Passaram cerca de 20 anos no poder e, em 1985, devolveram os desígneos da na??o aos civis, por entenderem que, no tempo decorrido, os ideais democráticos se consolidaram a ponto de impedir uma fragmenta??o do país ou o retorno àquela situa??o de caos e iminência de uma guerra interna civil sem precedentes. O milagre econ?mico, se você n?o sabe, ocorreu no governo dos militares, quando o Brasil passou da 48a economia do mundo para a 8a e a infla??o passou a ser controlada. Hoje, temos, gra?as a Deus, condi??es de comparar os dois períodos, ou seja, os últimos 43 anos da história de nosso país. Em resumo, os militares fizeram o que o amigo, autor da pergunta, t?o bem relatou, nos 20 anos em que permaneceram no governo. E nos 23 anos de governo dos civis? O que foi feito? O que foi melhorado? Quais as conquistas? Quais os exemplos? Quais as expectativas? No que o Brasil se transformou? Você está satisfeita com o Brasil de hoje? Pergunte a seus pais e avós se o período da chamada "ditadura" era t?o ruim assim como alguns pseudo-intelectuais insistem (por interesse escusos) em defender. Fique, também, à vontade para responder a tais questionamentos! Para a Keila...., respondendo ao seu relato, gostaria de saber de que brilhante livro ou fonte de consulta imparcial ela retira todas as suas conclus?es a cerca do Regime dos Militares. Vangloria-se de ter estudado em bom colégio, mas que era privilégio para poucos. Se era para poucos, como se explica a melhora indiscutível e inconteste dos níveis de alfabetiza??o e educa??o desse país NAQUELE PERíODO??? A própria Keila reconhece que os Professores, naquela época, eram muito melhor remunerados, recebendo a importancia que realmente merecem!!! Mas, mesmo assim, afirma preferir viver nessa "democracia" a viver novamente a realidade  daquele período. Mais uma vez volto a perguntar: com excess?o dos pseudo-intelectuais subversivos que tentavam impor seus ideiais comunistas e anti-democráticos pela for?a, você conhece algum cidad?o que tenha reclama??es daquele período??? Ao contrário do que se veicula em alguns meios de comunica??o, o país vivia um clima de paz, prosperidade, crescimento, orgulho e desenvolvimento!!! Quanto aos desinformados que alegam que no período dos militares houve corrup??o e/ou robalheira, numa demonstra??o inequívoca de diarréia mental, pergunto se conhece algum ex-presidente militar que tenha enriquecido com o regime ou em cujas costas paire algum processo ou acusa??o nesse sentido!!! Me apresente, por favor, por que eu desconhe?o! Talvez o cidad?o que esteja fazendo tais considera??es tenha condi??es de "provar" o que diz, para n?o passar por sensasionalista irresponsável e leigo!|`|08c01a97007f3a69c4ee8fb6293b2a2caa	Estou de pleno acordo com você, amigo.

Mesmo nos 8 anos de FHC, o que se fez, de melhor que o REAL? e daí?, estamos nessa marcha lenta, nesse passo de espera, esperando o quê?   Qual nosso proposito em estar com essa discussao?

No regime militar só o que n?o havia era divulga??o por causa da censura. Eles mesmo já se encarregavam de matar bem mais que 2%. O que vivemos hoje é resultado daqueles anos de chumbo. Militares despreparados para o governo aumentaram a nossa dívida externa ao máximo. A malha ferroviária foi totalmente sucateada, até os trilhos foram arrancados. Você viu algum trem novo que n?o fosse para turismo? Aliás, esses bem velhos, pois o visual antigo fica mais atraente para os turistas de fora que aqui vêm para ver mesmo um Brasil de outras épocas. Construimos usina nuclear? Isso lá é motivo de orgulho? Serve como defesa do regime o fato de Geisel ter adquirido da Alemanha o que a Alemanha n?o queria mais e ter dado esse presente de grego para o país? As usinas consumiram bilh?es de dólares e n?o funcionam até hoje.Como é que a maior indústria naval está t?o depressa sucateada? N?o foi obra desse governo, n?o. A nossa grande indústria bélica se sustenta por si, vendendo para outros países. N?o me orgulho de indústria bélica, n?o. Me orgulharia de uma indústria da paz. A Amazonia já vem sendo dilapidada há muito tempo. O que colhemos agora é justo fruto de vários governos desnorteados. <br>  Quanto à educa??o, n?o vejo grande diferen?a, n?o. Só é claro, que os professores realmente eram muito bem pagos. O salário era uma fábula, comparado com o atual. Eu nunca mais recebi t?o bem. E mesmo assim, deixe-os longe de nós. Prefiro a democracia. é muito triste crescer alienado, amorda?ado, tudo censurado a sua volta e o governo fazendo de toda forma o que bem entende. E se você naquele tempo se manifestasse como está fazendo agora,iria para o pau de arara. Qual é o motivo de sua defesa? Você é militar?

Exigiu e nunca regularizou nada. Eis a semente de toda essa devasta??o que vemos agora. A inseguran?a que temos agora é fruto de um amadurecimento democrático que nos foi roubado a oportunidade por mais de vinte anos desse mesmo regime. Deixamos de melhorar como eleitores nesta  longa interrup??o. Agora temos que ter paciência, pois é duro recome?ar, mas já é alguma coisa, chegaremos lá. Tive uma ótima escola pública naquela época, mas sei que fui uma privilegiada, pois o ensino era para pouquíssimos. A economia era inchada artificialmente, e bastou uma crise do petróleo para iniciar o que culminou na própria jogada de toalha do referido regime. Quer dizer, é verdade que "há males que vêem prá bem". A malha ferroviária foi herdada dos regimes anteriores(civis), e, como relatado na própria pergunta, acelerou-se a op??o por rodovias, onde o transporte, principalmente de cargas em caminh?es, é mais caro, menos perigoso, mais desgastante. Tem-se criado muitos argumentos contra hidrelétricas, inclusive citadas como positivas na pergunta, mas até hoje ninguém, dentre os defensores mais qualificados da energia nuclear, sabe dizer uma solu??o para os resíduos desse processo, citado como positivo também. O maior ícone de interioriza??o é Brasília, anterior ao regime. E hoje os índices dos institutos denotam revers?o no histórico processo de concentra??o demográfica nos grandes centros ou um atual retorno para o interior. Creio que se tivéssemos exercitado nosso direito de cidadania continuamente, a educa??o, por exemplo, teria dado conta da explos?o demográfica, da falta de emprego e todas as conseqüentes mazelas atuais, pois certamente teríamos condutores no país que dariam importancia.|`|46e04ff76b073673161a2eb9bacee8a2aa	Prefiro elle lullarápio do que desaparecer por ter sido denunciado como comunista por algum desafeto.<br>  <br>  Em 2010 daremos um senhor chute na bun.da de todos elles;|`|31d9c1e6a187939afdb15319973bc966aa	O que o Lula tem que fazer é concertar o erro clássico cometido por volta de 1984/5, quando o governo federal come?ou a criar carreiras e deixou os militares de fora, alegando serem um grande contingente.

They would all have to go find work elsewhere.  This would result in billions of dollars in savings.<br>  <br>  the 3500+ health insurers each have their own billing requirements that tie doctors and hospitals up in red tape and has spawned a 5 billion dollar medical billing industry.  That would all be replaced by a single billing standard - saving the system nearly 5 billion dollars per year.<br>  <br>  Since there will be one source for insurance, all doctors, hospitals, and specialists will be "in the network", resulting in greatly expanded choice for people who otherwise are restricted by HMOs and PPOs.<br>  <br>  Everyone will be insured, so there will be no incentive for waiting until the medical condition is in crisis.  This will result in far less use of ERs (the most expensive form of care).  Thus, ERs will be freed up so they can concentrate on those who really need emergency care.  This will result in faster ER responses and billions of dollars in cost savings.<br>  <br>  Once insurance companies no longer interfere with yours and your doctors decisions, the quality of care should increase dramatically.<br>  <br>  As far as I've seen, nobody has mentioned reducing doctor pay.  And I hope they never do.  But even if they did, it would not result in fewer doctors.  Where would they go?  It's not as if they can go anywhere else in the world to get the kind of pay they get here.  Even at reduced rates, they still would be the best paid in the world.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	It would turn into a mess.

As Obama comes out with more of his spending plans, it is painfully obvious that his goal is to destroy public businesses and cause Americans to be forced out of work and onto his welfare roles.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Currently the way we ration health care is via the health insurance industry.  Those who can't afford insurance go without.  Those who can afford insurance, have profit motivated employees decided which treatments will be covered.<br>  <br>  Medical dollars could be spent much more efficiently without the profit motive.  Just as out of business brokers and bankers are now becoming federal bank auditors (from NPR yesterday) so could current health insurance experts move into the government and work FOR the people instead of against them.|`|L6Ko87r9aa	Being a doctor will no longer be an economically suitable job. Therefore, med students or med student hopefuls and current doctors will begin to pursue other professions.

For the companies that chose to go along with the government plan, you'd end up seeing a whole lot more HMO type plans available and the PPO plans would pretty much go away.  Those that didn't participate as payors under the government's terms would pass their extra costs on to the consumer purchasing the insurance.  If doctors are given an option to participate, they'll refuse to accept the government plans and will jack up their costs to private pay insurance clients (the same as many are doing with Medicaid today).  If it's all nationalized and we fall under one payor, just take a look at how Medicaid works today and that's what you'll get.  Doctors will also close up shop.  Demand will be high and supply of qualified health care professionals will be low.<br>  <br>  Edit - Another thing to consider is that there will be unanticipated levels of enrollment if they leave multiple payors in place and only have the government plan for those whose employers don't offer coverage.  Larger businesses will be required to offer insurance, but businesses with few employees won't.  Those small businesses that are offering it now will stop.  Their employees will then become dependent on the government health care system.  My mom's a small business owner and pays part of her employee's insurance costs now.  I can assure you that if this kicks in she'll drop it.  She's having a hard enough time keeping her doors open as it is and that would save her a ton.  This is exactly what happened when Hawaii went to their plan to insure all children in the state.  People dropped their private insurance and used the state insurance.  The program lasted for about 6-7 months before the state couldn't afford it any more.<br>  <br>  @ bob k - If you think the greedy insurance companies are bad about determining what care you will and will not receive, wait until the government decides that for you.  Ask any Medicaid patient about how much say they or their doctors have in the care that they receive, and you'll love your greedy insurance company.|`|tK7iHck9aa	From my limited knowledge of the USA system I'd say that nothing much would change. The state health system would become a bit better and private health systems would continue to operate just like they operate now.<br>  There's no need to reinvent the wheel. If you need further answers, just look at all the other countries that went through it already and see what happened there. You can see Canada, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Cuba, in fact I think everyone else I can think of.|`|iTwi0w5Jaa	From John B to John A: Most of these health care partners would fall under heavy pressure and would either merge to form one central health care conglomerate or they would wither away due to the universal aspect of health care that Obama is trying to implement. Best believe that people would still continue to put their trust in the private health sector.|`|o0JEkGCjaa	Nothing would happen. Obama's plan is an option, not a mandate.<br>  It is only available to those that are not offered health ins. through their employer, or those that can't afford high cost insurance.|`|o8xvzhuhaa	It's called Universal Health Care, where everyone is insured.<br>  It's amazing, you actually get doctors making the decisions for you instead of the greedy business CEOs of the insurance agencies.|`|fmDJJobTaa	If everyone is guaranteed coverage then you don't need insurance industries.

What's good and decent about having organizations like ACORN feeding at the public trough and trying to steal elections by registering dead people to vote?   What's good and decent about people like George Sorros who has spent billions trying to tear our country apart?  What's good and decent about the "fairness doctrine" that's trying to suppress any dissent from the liberal manifesto?  What's good and decent about promising no lobbyists in the Obama Cabinet but making exceptions because someone is supposedly too valuable?  What's good and decent about Democrat politicians pointing their bony fingers at conservatives and then doing exactly what they said conservatives were supposedly doing, like lying and stealing and taking bribes?  I could go on but you get the point, I hope.  <br>  <br>  Just one more thing, what's good and decent about running up the largest increase of the national debt in the history of the country and possibly the world because Obama says doing nothing is not an option?|`|7d5ea5e8dbc6e785c1d3bdbe89715586aa	Well technically conservatives want to keep America the way it is so they love all that is good and decent in America by keeping it.

It has been acknowledged that Black men have an underdeveloped frontal lobe, this is the part of the brain than controls impulses and decision making,coupled with this they are larger in body mass and have about 12% more testosterone levels and a lower mean IQ. All scientifically proved.<br>  This may well be the reason for so much Black crime,the statistics are staggering for black crime, Knife crime in London is out of control, Black on Black violence. You are seven times more likely to be a victim of black crime and the statistics bear this out. The metropolitan police figures and the Dept of Justice in the USA prove this.<br>  60% of the US prison population are black but they are only 25% of the US population.<br>  By my experience most young black men are naturally violent and brash and impulsive.Although thankfully I have met exceptions to the rule. My first experience with a Black man was when he offered to sell me drugs. Many people make excuses of poverty and social deprivation for Blacks,but they commit more homicides and rapes which have NO economic determining factors.<br>  On the question,its likely he will get only 10 years and out in 6, while that poor man had at least 25 more years left to live. Now if it had have been white on black violence,30 years for him and a martyr made of out the black man. Racism normally only cuts one way, that's the sad reality.

YCXxP43Laa	Ask for a letter asking for the reason she was dismissed. I have a really good friend who works for the NHS. He has had a lot of time off work due to having a twisted gut. The surgery to fix this (which was botched and he is considering suing) has caused multiple problems; firstly MRSA, then adhesion's, which occur with every surgery.<br>  Due to this he is often in severe pain, and has had a lot of time off work. He saw an occupational therapist and the hospital he is at has not considered dismissing him.<br>  It depends on why your friend was off sick... if it was for numerous colds etc they may think your friend was pulling a fast one. But even then they have procedures... they would have to give a verbal warning and then two written warnings.<br>  If your friend had a sick note form the doctor they couldn't touch her; if the illness became a problem to her work she could be pensioned off.<br>  If your friend was sacked with immediate effect, and without having written notices then it would be for gross misconduct, and your friend would have no come back.<br>  Ask for a letter form her employer, then contact ACAS.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	I thought you had to be really bad to get fired from the NHS, Did they perceive her as not being sick?

E9XL5x3Paa	Bush tried that, remember?  The stimulus checks of $600 for singles and $1200 for married couples failed.  People saved it, not spent it.<br>  <br>  Actually, the tax cuts that Obama proposed is a pretty good idea.  The problem with things like stimulus checks is that people see them as safety money; and so set them away to act as a safety net.<br>  <br>  But with tax cuts, it feels like you just got a raise.  So it feels like spendable income, and we are more likely to let go of it and actually spend.  And while $15-20 doesn't seem like that much, if 150 million or so workers spend it every week or two weeks; that adds up to a lot of money.<br>  <br>  I am not blaming Bush for the stimulus checks.  The idea was a good one with great logic behind it; it just didn't pan out for him.  Studies done over the course of the past few years have found that large scale tax cuts work in the same way as stimulus checks do.  But those same studies found that smaller scale tax cuts, like the kind that provides about $15-20 a week like Obama is proposing, actually gets us to spend.<br>  <br>  Obama is working on theory here, just like Bush did.  But Obama has the benefit of having seen the idea of a stimulus check fail, as well as large scale tax cuts failing.  He's not making those mistakes again, and this has a good chance of working.<br>  <br>  It might not, but the odds are for it.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Yeah, I'm waiting for my $500,000 check. I can spend it better than any business could. House, car, and credit cards would all be paid off, and I'd have a little to go on a nice vacation or buy some really nice stuff.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Why?<br>  <br>  So you can go buy more shoes or another jacket? How is that going to stimulate anything? If the federal government used the Steve Forbes plan and eliminated teh Federal Income tax for the year. That would set off a chain reaction of events forthe fiscal year that would doom this country. And all so that a majority of Americans would be able to put an extra $3-4 thousand in the pocket. <br>  <br>  Federal taxes are used to pay the interest on the national debt each year. If we have no taxes coming, then we can't pay that interest. That means that America defaults on those international loans that Republicans built up over the past 8 years. Then the international community who holds most of these loans would eliminate America's ability to borrow. They would also ask for their principle and interest seeing as America has no more income and, therefore, no way of paying any loans. We would essentially have sell off some of our assets to satisfy what we owe. We wouldn't be allowed to borrow from one country to pay off another because the IMF does not allow it.<br>  <br>  Then there is the case of funding things like Social Security and health care. These programs run off of a year to year budget. Without any taxes coming in, we would not be able to pay for these programs. All of the people that rely on these programs would be without, creating a strain on hospitals and also state governments to provide benefits to the unemployed retirees. And don't think of trying to borrow money from the international community because they won't give us a dime because we have no income.<br>  <br>  Then there is the defense budget. How many times in the past 7 years did Bush have to go back to Congress in the middle ofthe year to ask for more money? Well, you can forget that. The government would have no money to give. The soldiers out there would have to come home quickly before the little bit of budget money that was left ran out and we could afford to fly them home. <br>  <br>  The fact is that the federal government runs off of deficits. We run off the fact that we are able to borrow money from other countries to cover our expenses. We can do this because we can show that we can pay at least the interest on it. Once that is gone, America's ability to borrow spend becomes non-existent and then our budget becomes garbage.<br>  <br>  And all so you and your friends can get a few thousand dollars back to buy some shoes, clothes, and go out to eat a couple of times.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	the week before elections.

jJhItbu7aa	To your first question, no and yes. You will receive orders after your MOS training to your next duty station. It will not change to another Division. Most of the time you will be assigned to the Replacement unit on the installation and then assigned to a unit once you report in. Although sometimes you can be cut orders to a specific unit before reaching the duty station. In this situation yes the unit you are assigned to can be changed when reporting in. (I had that happen to me).<br>  <br>  To you some MOS's can go into many different types of units, such as a mechanic can in most units in the Army seeing that most units have some form of ground vehicles. It really all depends on the MOS. Other MOS's must be assigned to a specific type unit.<br>  <br>  If you are active duty in the Army you won't live a normal life. You will live where that Army tells you to live. Granted you can enlist (or re-enlist) for another duty station you will only be guaranteed a limited time there.|`|KvTGiR6taa	i am going to answer your third question for you its the only one i know about.. idk what your idea of a normal life is. but no u cannot just live wherever you want to. you will be stationed at a miltary post whereever they decided that they need you that is the place you will go to work everyday after hours u can do as you wish with your family. if you are married you can get a place off post but within a distance you will be able to travel back and forth to work..for instance if you are stationed in tx.. you cant live in nc or va for sure . you get lucky and be stationed in one of those states but thats the only way.. now if you are single you will live on post in the barracks|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Your unit will change throughout your career (even if it's just one term).  You could go to Ft. Stewart, GA and spent 2 years with 3rd ID, then get orders for Korea and spend a year with 2nd ID over there.  Then come back to the states and go to Ft. Hood and be assigned to 1 CAV.  You're never permanently assigned to a single unit.<br>  <br>  The second question I'm a little fuzzy on.  It's not really specific but if I understand correctly then what unit you go to has to do with what your MOS is.  Additionally, there's a difference between Officers and Enlisted and how they get assigned but it all boils down to the needs of the Army.  Which leads me into your last question, there's a big difference between what you want and what the Army needs.  Sometimes you're lucky and the 2 converge.  But not always.  I always looked at it as an opportunity to see someplace new.

They can't charge anybody based on e-mail.<br>  The best you can hope for is that enough people report the same vehicle that it is put on a watch list.<br>  Most police departments have e-mail contact links on the department website.  You have to look up the department responsible the the area you are encountering the poor driver.<br>  <br>  Do you know why e-mail cannot generate a ticket?  Say I don't like you.  I e-mail in your plate, and get some friends to e-mail it in, and you get a ticket for speeding or stunting, or some such thing.  Would you think that is fair?<br>  No, you cannot get a ticket from an e-mail report, not anywhere.  As I said, it might put a plate number on a watch list, but even a warning letter based on unconfirmed information is not right.  <br>  If I got a warning letter because somebody sent in an e-mail you bet your boots I would be on the evening news, and so would you if you got one.<br>  Besides, an e-mail with a plate number doesn't identify the driver, only the owner.<br>  <br>  E-mail can easily be used to create false reports and harassment, it cannot be used to generate serious reports.  If you feel strongly enough about a violation, you report it in person and stand as witness against the driver.  If you don't do that, no ticket.<br>  <br>  Your information about Washington is false, by the way.  They do not accept reports on individual drivers.  I know, I took the time to go to the website.<br>  " The WSP relies on citizen input to place our ADAT vehicles and establish where we place our emphasis patrols. In order continue to do this, the WSP has established an online form and e-mail to Report Aggressive Driving. By doing this, we making it easier for citizens to provide direct input to WSP about the areas they feel aggressive drivers are endangering the roadways. The State Patrol will take the direct input and use it to place our vehicles in areas where they will be most effective and increase our ability to catch aggressive drivers in Washington."<br>  <br>  If you make a personal report, you indicate whether you are a victim or witness, call 911 or Washington State Patrol,and they will investigate.

Made a lot of silly statements.  His tongue got tied more  than a few times.

He could laugh at himself.

ViEgekyIaa	Well a lot of his voters did want that in a sense, which was why I didn't vote for him. I saw and heard nothing genuine in his promises since they were all what people who were down for the count wanted to hear. That 26 year old speechwriter of his really knows how to get to stupid people.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	It's certainly not what I wanted.  Which I why I *didn't* vote for Obama.  This is why I didn't worship him, this is why a tingle did NOT go up my leg, this is why I could not see "the warmth in his face," this is why I didn't think he was a "soul of the purest light."  <br>  <br>  He wants to sink this country into uncontrollable debt, then he tells us we have a deficit.  REALLY?!|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Someone "flippant" in the Obama administration!  Now how can you say that about the most narcissistic administration in history?

ohaTU3lmaa	the dummies are those who are duped by what the politicians promise, regardless of party. politicians are professional flatterers, and anything they say or do can more often than not be traced back to an attempt to please someone in their political base. the american people have come to believe that the president is somehow our leader and should be looked upon with a degree of silence and awe. they are our protector, guide, and the shepherd of the economy. congress, similarly, has assume the moniker of the "world's greatest deliberative body" when they do nothing but sit around thinking of ways to keep their own fat butts in their seats come election time. higher taxes on the "rich" to pay for gifts to special interests? check. no bid contracts to friends? check. federal tax money spent on personal expenses? check. this is both parties. some try to argue that their party is less corrupt or somehow better than the other, but it isn't true. <br>  <br>  the dummies are those who fail to see politicians for what they are -- self-interested humans, prone to all the errors of the common man -- and continue to plead that more power be placed in their all-knowing, selfless hands.|`|X9VDzvo4aa	No but from what i've seen getting paid to comment on American politics on cable news and talk radio seems to be almost exclusively for dummies.<br>  <br>  To prove my point right now Chris Mathews is interviewing Joe the Plummer.  What a meeting of the minds on both sides.|`|vNCXgJf8aa	No. I don't think voters are dumb. Just because I don't for whoever you want doesn't make me dumb. Freedom of speech and freedom on choice. The election is over. >><<|`|k1W70RHFaa	It's <br>  <br>  "IS American politics for dummies"?<br>  <br>  Dummy.|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	i would disagree.<br>  <br>  Say what you want about politicians, but last time I checked.. they figured out how to get in a position of power.|`|8ZUs3qxxaa	Uh, you DO kind of have to be at least fairly smart to get into a strong American political seat.<br>  <br>  Sure, you can fail in decisions, but you have to at least be pretty knowledgable about law, foregin relations, and economics. You also have to be good with people. I mean, they kind of elect you, so, uh...<br>  <br>  But yeah, it is true that a lot of our officials aren't as smart as they should've been for us. But that doesn't mean we should all turn into monstrously cynical government-conspiracy-believing prophets lol.|`|ZfxLoMwMaa	If that is so true, look at the last eight years.  <br>  <br>  I disagree.  Americans have a right to vote for who we want.  Just because you lost the election and want the white man to win doesn't make those who voted for Obama dummies.  You need to stop being sore losers and move on with your life.  I don't think you're black either.  If you are, you have issues. You sound like a racist and hate your own black race. ;))|`|0fRsWy05aa	Disagreed.  Regardless what party you belong to.

This is a pure fact.  He will attack the Second Amendment but will not be able to completely destroy it because of the simple fact it is our constitutional amendment.  People are afraid he will gradually chip at it until it is no longer effective by taxing ammo out of existance, banning guns that have nothing to do with crime etc... people are scared of a President who is not pro-gun.  Keep in mind the first thing Hitler did when he conquered a country was ban ALL guns.  In the end guns are a country's only defensive against tyranny.|`|oUuVaQIkaa	Obama wants to get rid off the 2nd amendment...which gives people the right to bare arms...and if he passes a law in which the police or soldiers search house by house looking for weapons, then you know something is not right. Some of my friends are stocking up for illegal guns now.|`|9oTR4Z2jaa	i think its funny because obama has nothing wrong against guns<br>  <br>  siderman, what about real americans?<br>  if you speak spanish and your a citizen<br>  then you are american, i dont care about your<br>  personal racist hate.<br>  <br>  you claim bush was so much better when<br>  he took almost all the national gaurd over<br>  to iraq.<br>  so much for his border patrol<br>  <br>  at AKA down below:<br>  your an idiot, thats exactly what they are<br>  just conspiracies.<br>  obama is for the constitution.<br>  tell that to your anti fedaralist ancestors|`|194195b82dfda7927256d7ba5a877a46aa	I voted for Obama so I'm not making preparations for "the coming of evil Obama" but I did read online that right after he was elected, guns sales jumped because people were trying to buy more guns before the regulations changed... they're all probably getting together for some sort of anti Obama party :o)|`|rBYqlytYaa	i love obama|`|d2lvgxJhaa	Nothing can help you understand anything|`|GOpDGnsXaa	Government Troll<br>  How are you?|`|5haljsUJaa	Look at it this way.  Bush started two wars he couldn't finish.  He hired a FEMA chief who botched the response to Hurricane Katrina.  "Hell of a job Brownie!"  He let the financial industry "regulate itself" and now we are dealing with the crash.  And Bush cut taxes on the rich while increasing federal spending.  He basically doubled the national debt in 8 years.  Think of that.  In 8 years Bush racked up as much debt as the other 42 presidents combined.  And he had the nerve to call himself a "conservative."  So now Obama has to clean up the mess.  Rich white men who have profitted enormously from wars and deregulation don't want to pay higher taxes.  So they have hired a bunch of think tanks and lobbyists to try and scare people about Obama.|`|qGD0aTjQaa	get ur hands on as much money as you can because ur money will be taken from you and given to people who cant take care of themselves and refused to work hard.|`|FPX6AcjFaa	it was probably just an idiot or racist or plain bitter person who doesn't appreciate what a great thing it is to have Obama.|`|btrYBildaa	I have seen some people buy new guns because obama will ban them.|`|yRIYBX4iaa	I think some people are very close-minded and ignorant.

He has a strong team, he knows that it's easy to get the stimulus wrong.<br>  <br>  Rather than buying guns, pay off your debts.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	I bought rossetta stone spanish because apparently we will all be speaking spanish very soon because he dont give a crap about real americans.|`|uAy7Y6HPaa	Selling all my tinfoil hats to those that need them more.|`|lIumT7lmaa	what?
8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	You are absolutely right, and we will be paying for it for the rest of our Lives and three more lifetimes. Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) is destroying America and is getting away with it.|`|AgxtBVwoaa	Some of the useless pork spending is garbage because it does not create jobs that are long term.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I don't believe it is enough.<br>  <br>  Financial systems lost trillions on the bad housing bubble. Replacing it with $787 billion is a drop in the bucket. I would have liked to see more spending on infrastructure programs and less on things like welfare and unemployment. I also would have liked for this plan to have been thought out better with more details. <br>  <br>  Obama and this administration will have to spend another $700-900 billion in the next two years alone to keep any kind of stabilization going after this money runs out. The money that people get from this and spend on it is only going to circulate enough to stop banks from going under, but it is not going to be enough circulation to give the banks the capital they need to start lending again.
7e93c8ae2870f2afdb6338542707db20aa	It does seem that the Republicans do take a more protective posture when it comes to defending life inside the womb and making sure tax breaks are guaranteed for those who already have more than enough as opposed to providing affordable health care and other "essentials" that would be nice for life outside the womb. They also are "hawkish" when it comes to spending billions on wars and other "pro-life" issues.  Maybe we ought to be asking RUSH for the answers.  He seems to have no lack of pomposity or ego when it comes to providing solutions or preserving the "American-Way," now does he?|`|yAsLhdp2aa	true republicans are pro life and anti war....we are not the neocons that you have become all so familiar with|`|U2qRvH2laa	No, I doubt it.

That's 3000 fewer liberals per day.|`|DtILThwAaa	These fools might be surprised that all the major wars of the 20th century were started by democrats. Point is republicans and democrats are just as likely to go to war. It's sad, but in the real world war is a necessary evil, but then again maybe we should have let Germany win WWII and exterminate most of the worlds' population. Executing guilty murderers is arguably wrong, but taking an innocent life that has just begun is fuked up. <br>  <br>  Why do Democrats support taking innocent life, but not guilty life, or taking life in self defense (war)? It's you that have it all wrong.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	No, they also use the Blind Date method.<br>  <br>  It consists of setting up a blind date with a normal human being and locking them in an SUV going to Vegas with Rush Limbaugh. <br>  <br>  No woman has yet survived.|`|IH6NrVNBaa	No, we oppose cold blooded murder.

He finally woke up one day and realized that he had lost his jouralistic integrity and walked away from it. He has been speaking out about that and many other things ever since. I think that he has a good handle on things and a good understanding of the American people, but I don't agree that all the folks that voted for Obama were unsophisticated, <br>  There were alot of moderate people of very intelligent nature that were fooled by this guy too. You would think that they were smart enough to see through the bull, but the main stream media covered up a lot of the things that otherwise would have blown him out of the water early. <br>  Too many people wanted to be in on the new wave, and there are a lot of people today with buyers remorse. Nothing we can so about it for almost 4 years.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	I doubt your quote.  More likely its the usual spin from the Right.

It is amazin how much we get done. Everyone is very loving. The gifts that people bring to this center is an inspiraton. The people are focused on education. We all have huge home libraries. We are very spiritual despite the accusations that we are Godless. We just don't push others or try to sell them on our church. The level of prosperity is amazing. Yet, we just come or go as we please trusting where we are is in perfect divine order. We focus on all the good, the God, the gift's in life so we manifest peace, joy, love, harmony, etc.<br>  I have not seen anything from Republicans except fear, war, anger, destruction, resistance.

In the real world...people react to situations differently. In...liberal ideas, those who have pay for those who don't. In time , people realize that if they don't work, others will pay for them. History proves that a majority will eventually prey on the kindness and compassion of those who believe in that system.<br>     In conservative ideas, the individual is responsible for gain or loss, right or wrong, eat or starve.

L6Ko87r9aa	People work hard to manipulate the welfare system, instead of working hard to get off of it. < - - Something like that would be an excellent argument. All people have to do is send out resumes to random (usually high-end) companies requesting ridiculous positions that they know will be laughed at, like starting out as the CEO of Boeing or Microsoft with a six figure salary with no previous experience, et cetera, and they'll continue to get their welfare checks.<br>  <br>  However, just realize that this is by no means EVERYONE on welfare... But throwing out there how easily it can be manipulated to get out of hard work is, in my experience, an effective argument against the current welfare system.|`|9UNsd4Vtaa	While I still have hope for the American public, I don't necessarily believe that people try hard to stay or get on welfare.  I would suggest that you gather some data and make your comparisons.  A point however, I would start at is one from a personal experience.  I felt so terrible for an employee, a single mom, with 6 kids (by 5 dad's - all illegal mexicans I learned later) that I let her move into a rental home for only the cost of her utilities - no rent.  Well, as it turns out, she couldn't get the utilities turned on in her name, and since she worked for me I had no problem with having them turned on in my name.  Can you say CHUMP?  Well, needless to say, the salary she made from me wasn't enough to support 6 kids and herself, so she collected welfare.  The entire time she was on welfare she was collecting cash from the babies daddies, according to her to the tune of about 2000 a month.  I still had no problem with her not paying rent because feeding 7 people is highly expensive.  I learned later, that she was collecting nearly 1300 a month in food stamps.  So you add it all together and with the 2000 a month wages, 2000 a month under the table so to speak cash and 1300 a month in food stamps, free housing she should have been doing rather good.  Well, I was stuck with an electric bill of over 1200, water bill of about 600, phone bill of about 370 and my home was completely trashed.  I've had to have it tore down because of the filth which adds about another 3000 with the cost of disposal.  <br>  <br>  So there are some who completely manipulate the system and others.  YES, YES, Yes there are.  Another example would be that chick in Cali who has what 14 children and no job?!?!!|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	actually most people with welfare that have families, work 2 minimum wage jobs,  day and night just to survive and still they barely get by.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	i wouldn't say replacing hard work, i would say, supplementing from a job loss. believe me, i have friends that would rather have their jobs back, then ask for help. ya gotta do what gotta do to <br>  survive.<br>  <br>  on the other hand, what gets me, is when i'm at the check out counter with my groceries, and see a well dressed lady, nails and hair done to perfection whip out a bridge card. and to top it off i clearly saw hundred dollar bills and credit cards in her wallet.<br>  <br>  as for me, my fiance is a independent contractor, so we must have a bridge card for now. he makes enough money to pay his employees, paint store, tools, and the bills, nothing left for food. there are no jobs where i live, so we all depend on each other. family and friends that is.|`|JpvXhgmraa	Nobody in there right mind decides they are going to go on welfare, because they don't feel like working. 400 dollars a month, or whatever it is is not enough to live on, and I'm sick and tired of people calling everyone on welfare lazy.

ujAzSfCzaa	Your link refers to KKK hatred based on race.  Thank God those radicals are a rare minority.<br>  <br>  There are many people who completely disagree with President Obama's politics, but share Rev Martin Luther King's dream.  Some of his dream was realized in this past election:<br>  <br>  "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood."  <br>  <br>  Now under this brotherhood, we have room to disagree with each other politically without being accused of racism.  We should be able to look at the content of person's character without regard to race. <br>  <br>  "I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."<br>  <br>  I found your question and the link, with racial intonations,  to be an insult to Rev King's dream.

056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	You are so right, it is absolutely irresponsible.  I was against Bush's budget and Obama ia taking it to a new height of irresponsibility.  If there is a crisis, why is he not cutting programs?  That's what a household or a business does when cash is short, you cut back so that spending is within cash flow.  Instead, he increases spending with money we do not have.  He is like the person who is bankrupt and finds an unused credit card not yet maxed out and goes to the mall on a spending spree.  I hope the Chinese cut us off.  He doesn't care at all about those of us who had some money saved for retirement and it is now half gone.  Every time he speaks, the stock market goes down and I think he wants it that way.  He does not want us to achieve independent wealth from hard work and saving, he wants us dependent on the federal gov't like most of his voters.  If we stop giving to charities, he is happy with that because he does not want private charities to help the poor, he wants it all to come from a centralized government.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	We're ****ed. Buy some gold, stock up on food, ammo. Get ready for the revolution.|`|AA10719402	This is because Obama has the balls to include the military spending (war) that Bush so strategically left out of said budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes he did include the wars.

bTguVXMjaa	I hope so! While there were some negatives, like police brutality and drug overdoses, we still need the optimism of that time. The "Age of Aquarius" was dawning, and we wanted to throw off the bad karma of corporate greed and institutional racism. People "came together" for great music and good times. It was fun for me! It was also constructive: people rejected the consumer economy and built their own houses, grew their own food, made their own clothes, etc. The 60s gave us the environmental movement, women's lib, Black Power, and the whole idea of diversity that includes everyone in the national experience, not just bitter old white men in suits. Well, the "suits" put it down, but what was their alternative? More greed, more war, more pollution - people would have been better off if "The Revolution" had succeeded...|`|BIQrsl4paa	God, I hope not. I spent my teenage years living through the 60's and, with the exception of some of the music, wouldn't wish that era on my worst enemy.|`|XsPo8rm7aa	We are heading back in time, but you have the wrong era.  It's a repetition of the 40's we are heading for.  During 1944 and 1945, deficits were 16% of GDP.  Cumulative deficit in 1945 was 130% of GDP!  <br>  <br>  Besides which, living through the 60's once was good enough for me!  Been there, done that!!  I do agree tho, the clothing was pretty KEWL, as was some of the music.  The riots sure stunk tho, you forgot about that part, as well as Viet Nam.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Sure I do.  I just hope I'm long dead by then.|`|c5a80b54427d403df08bd924a7e11fc6aa	Its 1929 right now, I guess we have to wait 31 years.|`|AgxtBVwoaa	I doubt it.|`|DhqWBZOKaa	If it does, hopefully i won't be around to see it.<br>  <br>  While i'm aware that many significant civil rights battles were fought at the time, the picture some paint of the period as a grand political awakening and power shifting to the people, who almost heroically stopped a war is ludicrous to me.  "Baby Boomers" have a terribly grandiose view of themselves and their times.<br>  <br>  Sexual promiscuity, the birth of an out-of-control drug culture, the breakdown of the traditional family, getting a lot of people _unnecessarily_ killed in a war, political corruption, and abandonment of so many societal financial and social upward trends are the legacies which stand out the longer i live and the more i learn.|`|opjgggqnaa	One element that lead to the political mobilization of so many young people in the 60swas the fact that there was a draft for a very unpopular war.<br>  <br>  I don't know if any president in the future will be so bold to institute a draft.<br>  <br>  The music was excellent.  We'll never see that again.|`|sgua3lH6aa	It's here already with Obama and his radical approach.

That, too, requires thinking, an action they're not very familiar with.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	OMG!!!  Jindal using Katrina as an example of his own party's failures was surreal!  Alaskans are currently blasting Jindal, since they have numerous active volcanoes, one of which is ready to explode.  Monitoring natural disasters is silly only if you're far away from the target area.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	As a republican he knows he'll probably be able to avoid any such disaster and there's money to be made when the Federal government comes to your aid. As is typical of Republicans.|`|oJLCAKxuaa	You see B. Jindal presented a rich set of targets.    He kept the same old tired rhetoric, government bad... big business good.<br>  <br>      You chose to  defend him on this one.<br>  <br>  The reality is big business often makes lots of money off of natural disasters.   But most of us  want hurricane warnings, tornado warnings, ice storm warnings, and if they are available volcano and earthquake warnings.  We want to get ourselves and our families out of the way.<br>  <br>    Pretty obviously you do not live in the south otherwise you would not have made a statement that monitoring natural occurrences is unnecessary  and wasteful.<br>  <br>    One of Reagan's assistant secretaries of defense  was on TV the other day and said that if we wanted to  just spend stimulus dollars, re-equipping the military would produce dollar for dollar turnover.  Most economists agree that infrastructure investments, like    the volcano monitoring equipment,  turnover two or three times compared to the Keynesian single turnover  that military expenditures  usually produce.<br>  <br>   The idea is to spend money in ways that will create multiple returns.|`|ViEgekyIaa	He was right. It's just partisanship.<br>  <br>  It's strange the way everyone forgets: many Republicans crossed over and backed Obama for the Presidency and now they're all back to petty partisanship.

qzfAG3ciaa	Actually, most conflicts are tribal based.  Just look at the conflicts in Africa, the majority of the middle-east and south east Asia.  Usually one tribe holds power in a country and the other tribe wants it.  <br>  <br>  This is what is happening between the Kurds, Sunni and Shia in Iraq.  This is what is happening in Zimbabwe and Congo as well.  Rwanda is another example.  Ethipia and Eritrea war.  Civil war in Djibouti.  Sudan and Darfur.  Iran/Iraq war.   Kurds.  The failed Palastian revolution to take over Jordan.  The Palastian/Isreali conflict is tribal.  The PKK and Truks is tribal.  Turks and Armenians is a tribal conflict.  Azerbijan and Armenia is tribal based as well.  Just right here I named more tribal conflicts then nationalism based ones.<br>  <br>  Most of these conflicts never make western news.  <br>  <br>  The big conflicts, such as the World Wars had Nationalism, but most actuall conflicts had tribal roots.|`|zmmP52P3aa	nope, WWI fed on nationalism at the start, but was caused by a system of treaties meant to stop war.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	I would agree that it was a primary cause of human conflict in the 20th century but with certain stipulations. That the Germans practiced an extreme form of nationalism is not in doubt. But the French did as well and they were not driven to invade anyone in 1939. Nationalism in and of itself isn't bad, it is taking it to extremes that is a problem. In the 21st Century I would not even offer that it was a primary cause of human conflict. Rather religious extremists and a quest for resources would be greater causes.|`|GhWUbfySaa	Try researching fascism, communism, and socialism. These failed forms of human subjugation were responsible for almost all the death and destruction of the 20th century. It is incredible at how violent these governments became toward their own populations, murdering in the millions those whom the leaders feared - the educated and well informed, the wealthy, the owners and producers. Enough were murdered that the rest feared for their lives. Through greed, class envy, fear, hate and distorting the truth, these tyrants were able to stir up enough hate to wage war with the rest of the world. They frightened the common citizen to the point that no active resistance was possible, with secret police everywhere, political dissenters were first ridiculed instead of reasoned with, then secretly killed. Nationalism, racial and religious intolerance were causes used by these to induce warfare. These governments constantly sought through force to reassure themselves that their cause was just or superior. Except when they lost, then it was someone else's fault, or it wasn't done just right.<br>  <br>  Censorship, controlled media, indoctrination in education, enforced political correctness, all were all tools used to prepare then maintain control over the lives of these populations. Such tools are being pulled out again. How soon are the purges going to take place here and when will the nations fall upon each other again?  I don't know, but from what I have seen lately, this cycle of freedom is rapidly passing us by.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Check out this map of the spread of the various religions - take note of words such as "death", "conquest", and "fall of..."<br>  <a href="http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/history-of-religion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/history-of-...</a><br>  Nationalism runs a very distant second to religion.|`|3zlD0fYZaa	Ideology is another cause, such as Communism vs Democratic-Republics. There are many causes for human conflict. Economic quality, religious beliefs.|`|pss8LblLaa	Another primary cause of human conflict in the 20th century is the invention of the toilet.  Until someone creates an auto lowering lid it will continue to be a source of human conflict unless we revert back to the lidless outhouses of the 19th century.
Nzm0O9UOaa	I seriously doubt he is lying. Since the new boss took office, he has greatly decreased military funds. Bonuses are almost nonexistent at this point. The Army was even on a hire freeze for awhile.|`|NVuZLJhCaa	Not sure if he is lying, but you are wrong about the two year terms anyway. They do not prevent you from going anywhere, and you will hit stop-loss if deployment is coming whether your ETS is coming or not. The three year is the way to go, if you do the two year and 16 week enlistment, you are eligible to re-enlist very quickly, and then the money really is hard to turn down. A $10,000 for 2 years? No way. Why are you afraid of being stationed overseas? That was a selling point for me.|`|5Rn5BHjQaa	I don't know if he's lying or not. I suspect he's telling the truth, though. His job is to get you to sign up. If he could entice you with a fabulous bonus, why wouldn't he?<br>  <br>  Here's what I'd do: call some recruiters in other cities. Don't tell them you've already talked to a recruiter, but ask them about the bonus. If they can offer you a bonus, then go to their city to enlist. Just be sure to get it in writing before you sign on.|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	u should really b thinking about this we have a war going on and most likely another 2 the way things r headed. and they'll try to get u in for as many years as they can. u should look it up on there site to make sure. they want to sign u up cause for ever person they get they get more money well that's how it is in the marines. really think about b4 signing once u sign ur there's. well hope u stay safe|`|PVnKQG8Waa	Overseas is much better than stateside and you get paid more because of COLA (cost of living allowance). I loved Germany, I was able to travel all over Europe. My time in Korea was spent drinking so I don't remember much, but it was fun. Currently in Hawaii and enjoy going to the beach and snorkeling; although it is one of the 50 states, the Army still considers it an overseas tour. If you are infantry and are interested in going to hawaii, ask your recruiter to list it in your contract. The 25th Infantry Division is based in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii so you should have no problems getting an assignment here.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	It would not surprise me to learn that the Army is not giving enlistment bonuses for two year enlistment. You spend as much as five months in training and the Army gets practically no return on investment. But the site below is very reliable. Note the "national call to Service" bonus in the article. But you should also know that you don't receive 100% of the new Post 9/11 GI Bill unless you serve 36 months on active duty following 9/11. This is worth the extra 12 months of service. Also, you are 18! You should be looking for travel overseas. Most people fight to get an assignment in Germany. If you are instead referring to service in a combat zone, those are not the same as being stationed overseas and the length of your enlistment won't have a real effect on this. You will be assigned to a unit and if they are deploying to Iraq of Afghanistan then you will go. <br>  <br>  Give it all some thought and trust your recruiter. He has someone looking over his shoulder and someone else reviewing every statement he makes. When you do that final sit down with the man that reviews your contract tell him that you were really interested in a two year contract and ask about bonuses. Good luck!|`|zmmP52P3aa	If you don't want to go overseas then don't enlist at all.

I know that most soldiers who reenlist don't get a bonus for a 2 year reenlistment, it has to be longer. It all depends on MOS, length of reenlistment and/or where you are being sent to.<br>  <br>  The $10,000 might depend on the MOS you sign up for and how long you enlist for. If you don't like what he is telling you, speak to another recruiter.|`|014NXPfFaa	Although recruiters do have a stereotype of misleading, they don't generally like to rip people off.  If he says you cant get a bonus, he is probably right.<br>  <br>  But being stationed overseas is about as likely for everyone.  There are a lot of things you could do with 11B that could require you to stay stationed stateside...|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	What makes you think you won't go overseas with a 2 year stint?  That was the length of draftees & they got a tour of 'Nam.  Read the fine print; they can always extend your obligation or tour.  You'll learn real quick what you want doesn't matter; it's what the Army wants.<br>  As a 11B, tell them no bonus, no signing.<br>  <br>  ???What's the difference between stationed & deployed???

Also, I could almost envision people divorcing but still living as man and wife in order to not have to pay.  It wouldn't surprise me.<br>  I know an elderly couple who have lived together for about 20 years since their former spouse's both died.  If they marry, their social security will be cut and cut big time.  I feel sad and they hate that they are not married.  They both say that in the eyes of God they are married, but I swear that on the death bed of one or the other of them, there will be a very sad wedding.  I really think laws that penalize people from marrying are so wrong.<br>  I wonder about "married, filing separately" and if that might work?<br>  I also wonder if a person were about ready to get a raise if it would put them into a higher tax bracket and they would end up making less in the long run.  What a sad thing that is for a person who has achieved such success in life.

The reason it is considered bad by most americans is because of its prior short comings.  Examples include the former USSR.  Capitalists consider the idea bad because they view the government as an incapable or inept at management.  <br>  <br>  See government is accountable to people, not profit, and therefore must make every effort to accommodate the needs of every individual.  This creates a drag on the system.  It bogs down the process and creates to many levels.  Which in practice has been true.

VjgqZetcaa	Music piracy is theft. Legalizing theft of music would deprive the rightful owners (composers, performers, publishers, producers) of compensation for their labors. Many musicians and most producers are in it mainly for the money. If there is no money from music sales, because theft has been legalized, then we will have fewer artists who want to contribute (for "free") and the producers will stop paying for songs to be produced or sheet music printed.  As the production shrinks, the marginal costs will increase. As the costs of producing a few records increases, the increase will be passed to the consumers. Consumers will stop buying as many records and start stealing more free music from other pirates. When nobody pays for recordings of music, there will be no economic benefit to recording them. Eventually, the only way to hear music would be at a live concert.  Any musicians who cannot perform in concert will go into some other line of work.  Thousands of people involved in recordings, packaging, distribution, and after-market of recorded music (or sheet music) will go out of business.<br>  <br>  Along the lines of "reductio ad absurdem", if music piracy becomes legal, what property rights are next? Maybe it should be legal to take anyone else's property anywhere at any time.  Why not patents? If your company put $500million into research to develop a new medicine, once you announce it, everyone should be able to mass produce it for "free", just like "free music", because "medicine should be free" like "information should be free."  Thus, the pharmaceutical companies will no longer be able to obtain any profit from research and development, fewer medicines will be developed, more people will become sick or remain sick longer, and die at a younger age.  Thus, if you want to start making intellectual property "free", you will die sooner.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Consider that the music industry consists of more than just the artist(s). There are the agents, the industry executives, their staffs, marketing personnel, all the way down to line workers who produce the physical products such as CD's.<br>  Consider that none of these people work for free.<br>  By legalizing the free distribution of music one would, in effect, be bankrupting an entire industry and thus eliminate access to the product itself.|`|m3eFscuqaa	Google search the Free Culture Movement, and also look into Creative Commons. It isn't "piracy" if you don't profit from it. Oh, you can also check out the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) website.|`|sM2aNguhaa	well information should be free<br>  <br>  music and software and video essentially can be freely copied and distributed for free (time the artist spends creating is all your jacking)<br>  <br>  but at this point, food, and clothes cannot yet be free, but maybe in the future when atomic de-scrambling, and re-organizing is possible, we will be able to print out food and clothes, etc, essentially .. and then "all" information should be free<br>  <br>  similar to the star trek replicator technology .. then people don't work for money,but rather  just to expand their brain etc<br>  <br>  do you understand?<br>  <br>  one thing you may want to consider though, is that by stealing,  people are also stealing motivation away from some very good artists ... they may want to spend their entire life making beautiful music for humanity, but if the job is not putting food on the table for their family etc, many of them will go to work on wall street, or any other job that brings home the bacon ... thus the world just loses the next "Claire De lune" ,  "Hotel California" ,  "Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds", etc, etc, etc<br>  <br>  ot, but i even often wonder how many souls locked away in prison, could be writing beautiful music ... "How many Johnny Cash's, David Bowie's, and John Lennon's, etc are locked away forever in prison for smoking weed etc?"|`|QY1CN3n0aa	*If you don't have money to spend on music, and you pirate music, then the artist never lost a sale!<br>  *Sometimes, the pirated musics is of better quality than the one you bought at the store.<br>  *If you own the music CD, you should be able to do whatever you want with the music. Like downloading it so you can put it on your ipod or whatever.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	It would collapse the music industry if it was. We live in an age of technology and CD's are quickly becoming a thing of the past ever since the invention of the iPod so most people buy their music online.<br>  If music piracy were to become legalized everyone would just acquire music from them rather than the official source since why would someone pay for something when they can get it for free?|`|7uznrLBXaa	This is a rather stupid debate topic...music PIRACY.  Piracy is illegal - it's theft.  It's no different that filling up your car with gas and driving away, or shoplifting, or helping yourself to your neighbor's gardening tools.  You are enjoying something that is not yours and you are not paying for it.

AA10887916	Please see my previous answer to the self same question.

Presumably the shop did not change location so why exactly was the grant paid? Your question reads as if the grant was due for the change of ownership from a sole trader to a company.<br>  <br>  2. You state that Ahmed received the letter for incorporation (certificate of incorporation?) in April; what date was the company incorporated? Are we dealing with pre-incorporation profits?<br>  <br>  3. Presumably Ahmed was the payee on the cheque and therefor the claimant rather than the company.<br>  <br>  4.

On the other hand Mr.A may have a counter argument depending on what value that the shop went onto the company books at.It could have been pre-grant full market value or an asset value nett of the grant.This could be an advantage to the company as it means they got the asset at a discount of ￡6000 and in theory an immediate capital profit if the shop is revalued at some later point.Worth a try anyway.        <br>  <br>  One other unknown is how a grant can be paid to an individual shop owner "in connection with" a proposed transfer to a limited company.You would need to know a lot more about that part of the story before revisting the basics on promoters and pre-incorporation transactions.<br>  <br>  If this Question is more than just an academic exercise you will need to see a Solicitor to find out where you stand.

fAcVndo7aa	I honestly can't understand why it's illegal. <br>  <br>  -Why can't you sell something that you are allowed to give away?<br>  -Why is it illegal to have sex for money, when it's legal to have sex for money as long as someone is filming it to sell for more money?<br>  <br>  I think it should be legalized, regulated, and taxed.<br>  <br>  I see a lot of argument against it. Here's my logic:<br>  If prostitution were legal, the prostitutes wouldn't have to troll the streets looking for business. People who wanted to hire a prostitute could contact them instead of pick them up off the corner!  Wow, we just cleaned up the streets!<br>  <br>  Not to mention, we don't have to pay a bunch of cops to stake out corners, looking for people who are arranging to fulfill a perfectly natural human need (sex) in exchange for what really makes the world go around (money).  Then maybe the police would have more time to do other things - like catch murderers and pedophiles!  Plus, more money is freed up in the budget by taking away those great prostitution task forces!  Double bonus!<br>  <br>  Regulation and licensure would help with revenues for the government, and naturally a requirement would be regular testing for STDs and drugs, and full disclosure of same to all customers! So we can help cut down on the spread of STDs because prostitutes would know they had them - and so would their potential johns! If you want to hire a prostitute, wouldn't you prefer one you know is not on drugs and isn't going to give you a disease?  We just improved world health!<br>  <br>  Women are used and exploited and forced into prostitution every day. Legalizing and regulating prostitution would allow people to use reputable, regulated and licensed prostitutes - who certainly wouldn't include illegal immigrants or minors.  Bam!  Cut back on the illegal sex trade!<br>  <br>  And for people who think that prostitutes don't respect themselves - neither do people who sleep around for free, if that's how you think. At least, with a job as a legal prostitute, someone could make a living without the shame of breaking the law every day. Wouldn't that increase self-respect?  <br>  <br>  I know I don't have a popular opinion.  So go ahead and heckle.  But some food for thought:  a hundred and some years ago, somebody's however-many greats-grandmother married a man.  She got a home, food, clothes, and maids to take care of the things she owned.  All she had to do in return was her "wifely duties".  Sounds like bartering goods for sex to me.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Only if you want STD to go through the roof.<br>  Relationships are actually in a way a legalized form of prostitution. Dinner and movies aren't free you know.|`|sciYpfiWaa	I feel it should be, we all know that prostitution is going to be out there no matter how much effort we put into stopping it, second how can anyone tell two consenting adults what they can or can not do with each other? I feel that it should be legal but what they should do is ban the solitication of it. If you are caught selling yourself on the streets you go to jail. No signs or advertisements. This leaves one place to get the business... The internet. This opens up the door for prosititutes to do whatever they want away from the public view. And if it were legalized under these conditions pimping would be a legal profession so you would now have business qualifies individuals running the show instead of drug dealers, thus greatly reducing the crimes associated with it.

Shall we make modelling illegal?|`|dba6798daedd01dcb233c8a115096ed5aa	Nah, I don't think a lot of men would want to go into that profession. Don't get me wrong, i'd love to pick up a hot sexy guy with a tight butt to have fun with in bed after a long day of work at the office but it'd be real risky. Lots of STDs out there and I know some of those guys could get pretty pricey. I'd probably become an addict or something cause i'd get tired of buying the same group of guys over and over again and i'd just go out looking for fresher meat.

BIQrsl4paa	The hand up would be the preferable course. Unfortunately, too many of the people on welfare don't want anything more that what they have, if it requires any effort on their part to get it.<br>  Also, don't propose that the government, State or Federal, make the welfare people clean up roads and parks to get their hand outs, it was tried by Gov. Reagan in the 60's and groups like the ACLU took it to court because he was trying to make those same leeches "Work for free".<br>  <br>  Strange that eclectic... immediately casts the conservatives/republicans in the role of the bad guy. I have yet to see any politician, except Reagan, make any realistic effort to force the chronically lazy to earn their keep, and he was most definitely a Conservative/Republican.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Some of these people choose to be poor.  To give them a handout would be a waste, but to try to give them a hand-up would only mean you'd have to listen to a litany of excuses.<br>  <br>  The only cure for poverty is self-motivation to WORK.  Self-motivation is not something you can teach.|`|5LR1RZelaa	Of course attempts at making them productive members of society is better but it's not always possible.  Besides that, it costs a lot more to teach someone initially.|`|NxGqxsBvaa	Bryan, you have just rephrased a question that you have already asked today.|`|AA11086243	a hand up... <br>  <br>  now... who's giving hands up?

The 1st would be suitable for children, since they are still young and do not understand how to fend for themselves.<br>  <br>  Whereas adults have experience of the outside world, and would benefit from learning to be "self reliant".|`|uFTO5rs8aa	Hand up.  But hand up is harder to do than hand out.<br>  <br>  The problem is what do you do when there is no hand up?  Do you ignore them and let them suffer or give them hand out so that they don't get crushed, but might still suffer?|`|UpZFb6X5aa	The latter, of course.That's why programs conservatives oppose, like improving education in poor areas and inner cities, are the best way to help the poor.|`|1amF7oNwaa	A HAND UP BUT ALSO THEY HAVE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

I used to have many soldiers that said they'd stay in if they were assigned to Ft Hamilton, NY. In short they wanted to bargain. That's not done.<br>  <br>  You will enlist long enough to be eligible for an overseas tour. Given our combat tempo, it's almost certain. Then there's TDY, Temporary duty. I had mone soldier get sent to Central America for 179 days. He then extended for another 179 days. When he came back, after almost a year outside the country, he came up on orders to Korea. Why? He hadn't had an overseas tour.<br>  <br>  In short you can enlist for North Carolina. Just don't expect to stay there.|`|L3mbE6WOaa	Ft. Bragg, and Pope AFB in Fayetville.<br>  <br>  Seymore-Johnson in Goldsboro<br>  <br>  Those are the army and AF bases in NC.<br>  <br>  There's not a big chance that you would get stationed where you want, unless you go overseas before and get base of preference.  It's happened before, but not a lot.
pss8LblLaa	If you are single you will be living in the dorms on base.  Eligibility to move off base as a single airman varies base to base depending on policy and dorm occupancy rate.  Some young single airmen "ghost".  They pay out of pocket to stay off base but they are still required to maintain their dorm room.  Key thing is that if you are young and single you will not receive any housing money since the Air Force will provide you a room in the dorms.  Once you are eligible to move off base you will collect housing pay.  If you are married you can collect housing pay for living off base as well.  Housing is called BAH, Basic Allowance for housing.  If you Google "BAH rates" you can find a link to a rate look up tool that will tell you how much BAH you will be paid based on rank, location, and if you have dependents.  You are entitled to collect the full amount for your rank/location regardless of how much your rent is.|`|be8558170517e11de3a13500ca72ff48aa	Since you would be getting to your first duty station as an E1 - E3, you will most likely be assigned a room in the barracks. If so, you won't get BAH even if your family is nearby. BAH depends upon your duty station, pay grade and number of dependents.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	If you are married you will qualify for military housing or living out in town and getting BAH to pay for the rent/mortgage and utilities.  Usually if you are single you must be E5 and higher to be approved but it can depend on the CO of your command and the base to whether or not you can do it as an E4.  Until then you live in barracks.|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	I'll break you're questions down individually.<br>  <br>  If you get stationed close to home after your AIT (initial training) you can live at your home and come in each morning. Once you're full time active it's just like any job usually where you can go home once the day is over.<br>  <br>  As for the housing allowance you'll only get it if you meet certain conditions. 1. You're a E-6 or above, E-5 and below under extreme circumstances.<br>  Or If you are married you get the housing allowance, otherwise you'll be proved on post housing in the form of some kind of barracks with your unit. <br>  <br>  The housing allowance is designed to pay for housing for senior enlisted or married service members since housing is provided to all service members and you're spouse and family can't live in the barracks.|`|S6IumG2naa	I don't know exactly how the Air Force works, but in the Marine Corps you only rate a housing allowance if you are married. If you are single you live on base, but if you happen to live nearby you could live at home, but would not receive any compensation for it. For us anyways, there is no guarantee of where you will be stationed either, so don't join just thinking that you can be by your home. Plus, why would you want to join just to come live at home again? The whole idea is to travel and see different parts of the country.|`|AA10709853	not necessarily.  Single personnel are typically required to live in Barracks until they are E5s.   if given permission to reside off base prior, they don't always qualify for BAH.  <br>  <br>  BAH is based on paygrade and zip code of the duty station.
jaluxPusaa	I have been through this with my husband. The best thing for you to do is to go to the INS web site, and get the exact address for your location or call them. This way you will not be taking second hand information and run the risk of it not getting where you wanted it to. <br>  <br>  I also suggest that you double check all paper work, the slightest mistake will get you rejected. It is crazy how picky the INS is over every thing. I am sure these are things you know though. <br>  One other option would be to find a good lawyer who handles immigration things. This will allow you the comfort of knowing the paperwork is proper and everything is going to the right place. We spent a lot of money for this and it was by far the best choice.   <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|2fc364a9e53401a00266a4c78aaee631aa	You need to find your local INS office. That is how I did mine.

AA11672256	Insurance agents earn commissions. So what more are you going to do for them? Maybe, make their commissions bigger. Or make insurance compulsory so that the agents have a bigger playing field. Or make the policies more lucrative, so that people contact the agents for cover and not the other way.

AA12109395	If both your parents are abusive, call child protective services! However, you must understand that just because he is removed from an abusive home (if that were to happen ) doesn't necessarily mean that you would automatically get custody.<br>  <br>  That is a decision that would be made only after an independent investigation by CPS, a summary recommendation to a judge and a court order.

Don't even dream about ever getting parole!"|`|5K43n7ieaa	Yeah, they stay there.
BETCfjFdaa	The way my Criminal Justice professor explained it to us:<br>  If you have a warrant to search a house for 20 inch TVs, you can only search places in the house that someone would be able to hide a 20 inch TV.<br>  If you open a closet and find drugs or something else in there, it was a reasonable place to search, a TV will fit in the closet. Now the drugs can be used against the suspect. <br>  However, if you open a drawer where a TV could not fit, and you find some drugs or anything else, it is inadmissible. <br>  If the drawer was already open and there are drugs in it, then they are in "Plain View". The officer did not have to open the drawer and search it, so those items are admissible in court. <br>  If that is the case, they found the other illegal items, because they were out in the open, ie, setting on the table or in an open drawer, then they will just go call the judge and have him fax or Email an update to the warrant. That could take any where from a few minutes, to a few days. More than likely, they will have the warrant updated in under Two hrs!<br>  In a case like this, they will arrest you on the spot anyway and you will not have time to hide any thing, because you will be on your way to jail.<br>  If they arrest someone, then they DO NOT NEED A WARRANT TO SEARCH!!! It is one of the Ten (10) exceptions to the search warrant rule. That rule says that all warrant-less searches are illegal for the police to do per se. Unless they can prove they had one of the exceptions to this rule, in this case: Search Subsequent to arrest. When they arrest someone, they usually have the automatic right to search with out a warrant.|`|fAcVndo7aa	If, in the course of their search for items listed in a warrant, they find other things, you can get in trouble for the other things.  Just because they are only looking for one thing doesn't mean they're going to ignore your marijuana garden or your crack pipe.  The warrant only controls what they can LOOK for, not what they can see.  For instance, if the warrant is only for a lawn mower, they can't look in your underwear drawer - because a lawn mower will not fit in your underwear drawer.  But if they have a warrant for a stapler, then they can search anywhere a stapler might be - including under your bed, in the shoes inside your closet - and yes, your underwear drawer.  So if that's where you're hiding your heroin - expect to get busted for it.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Yes the marijuana can be used against you if the marijuana is found in the area described to be searched and the contraband was found within the scope of the warrant.  For example, the warrant is for your house but the items listed on the warrant that are being sought are described as two flat screen televisions that were stolen.  If the Officers found the marijuana laying on the floor of your closet the marijuana could be used to charge you since the televisions could be hidden in your closet.  However, if the Officer found the marijuana in your medicine cabinet then the drugs could not be used because there is no way you could fit the televisions in your medicine cabinet.  No new warrant is needed.<br>  <br>  Search incident to arrest only allows you to search the person being arrested and the area in the immediate control of the person...........it does not give the Police the right to search an entire house.|`|racnq84Vaa	They can only look for the items on the warrant and search the room or house or vehicle or whatever listed on the warrant.  However, if they find illegal items during the search for the original item they have an obligation to charge the person with that crime.<br>  <br>  So, yes you could get in to trouble.  You cannot break the law and get away with it for long.  You will always pay in some way.|`|AA11315360	A search warrant means they can search only for what they are looking for (say they are looking for a gun). BUT if in their search they happen to come across something else, like drugs, or the drugs are laying out on the coffee table they can take the drugs AND charge you with possession of drugs!|`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	lets put it this way. if they are looking for assault rifles they cant look in your jewelrybox unless you have a jewelry box big enough to hide an assault rifle. but if they do look in something that looks like it could hide what they are looking for and they find something else they can use it against you|`|IH6NrVNBaa	So if they're looking for stolen property and they find bodies in the closet, they're going to ignore it?  Think about it.|`|A6ztIJC6aa	As long as they are looking/searching within the scope of the search warrant They can seize and use anything illegal or any evidence of a crime they come across.<br>  --- So, if the search warrant is for a stolen car and they find a bag of marijuana in a desk drawer during the search then that marijuana would be excluded because search for a stolen car in a desk drawer is beyond the scope of the warrant. They must limit their search only to places where a car could be hidden.<br>  --- Police like search warrants for drugs and/or small stolen items because they allow them to search EVERYWHERE because these thing could be hidden anywhere. So if they happen to find your stash of kiddie porn in a desk drawer it would be completely legal evidence to use in court. <br>  --- Now the wording of the search warrant is important too. If the warrant says it is for the search for marijuana only then if they looked in your computer files and found kiddie porn it would not be usable as evidence. However, the police/ District Attorney usually make sure to include the search for any records or proceeds from said marijuana or stolen items. That allows them to look in computer files and read all files they find, paper or computer.<br>  --- The key words to remember in dealing with warrants is the reasonableness of the search. If you ever have any question about a search go to an attorney or a public defender and ask them about it.|`|XqzH0l0Maa	yea its only good for what they suspect but they will tear the place up and if your not an upstanding citizen than they will find something else that will incriminate you and you will be living under the jail for the rest of your life.<br>  you can get in trouble for drug possession. depending on how much they find they will have a field day with you.|`|2BceQT7waa	The warrant allows them to perform a reasonable search. If they find other contraband during that search, they can use it to prosecute you.

GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|zqPjdhgKaa	You can request leniency, but that doesn't mean the judge has to give it to you.  You can tell them you will go to traffic school or something and they may waive your fine, or reduce it to a lower amount.  <br>  <br>  There is a myth out there that if the police officer doesn't show you win by default.  This is not true.  Several things can happen if the officer doesn't show.  The judge can either use the paperwork the officer provided beforehand, they can change the date to accommodate the officer being able to come, or they can rule in your favor because they didn't show.  Remember, most jurisdictions don't consider a ticket to be a crime and therefore it is immune to a lot of constitutional requirements, such as having your accuser brought to court before you.|`|vet4adaYaa	That's the best option, plead your case, but the whole cop not showing up rarely works anymore, they now just give you another court date, and cops are paid to nicely to show up to court so they usually do.

aMrVslQkaa	Even if you were talking ****, physical assault is not legal. If you decide to press charges, remember: Take pictures of your injuries ASAP, and be sure you keep the medical records from your hospital visit. Get witnesses that saw what happened and can help your case. Look up your local attorney and discuss with them what you can do.<br>  <br>  However, if you don't want to press charges (for fear of further physical assault or lack of funds or something) just take care of your injuries until they heal and stay away from that person.|`|vet4adaYaa	people don't usually make appointment for a broken jaw, but whatever.

A6ztIJC6aa	It might be a street drug and it might not. There is no real way to know for sure unless you test it. Many street drugs do come in crystaline form and can be granulated to look like what you have there. Meth, Cocaine, Heroin, LSD,  all of these and more can ne made to look like what you show. However as I stated before there is NO way to know just by looking at it. You have to have it tested to know what it is for sure.<br>  --- AND make damned sure you don't try that TV stunt of dabbing some on your finger and putting it in your mouth. That is an excellent way to end up on a bad trip at best and die a terrinle death at worst. Remember that many slime bag druggies use strychnine and/or many other poisons to cut their drugs with. Dab some LSD on your tongue and away you may go or dab some other poison they put in it and die writhing on the floor.|`|KNaqn7Tdaa	Not sure what it is, but if those are pictures of anything you have in your possession I would delete all traces of them right now.  And whatever you do, don't ask the police or try to turn it in to them.  Even if you innocently find something and decide to do "what seems right", if it is contraband, and it's in your possession, you're violating the law and can be arrested and sent to prison.  If you have it, I'd dispose of it as discreetly as possible.  <br>  Whatever it is, it's either trouble or it's something of very little interest.  <br>  If you're seeking to ID it for possible use, I'd highly recommend against that.  If you're going to experiment with something, know as exactly and certainly as possible what it is.  Personally, I wouldn't trust what some anonymous person online tells me, and I'm sure you wouldn't want to sell it to someone else who could potentially be injured by it. (Hope I'm not offending you, but I don't know anything about your motivation for asking, so just covering bases.  But in any case, the smart thing to do is to get rid of it.)<br>  Good luck.|`|eHjk9di0aa	You can't tell that kind of thing from a picture, that's the reason the police have labs.|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	crystal meth i think i dont use just had some out side help|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Try it if you like it, it''s is bad.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Just flush it.

This was pushed through by the conservative Arkansas Family First Coalition.

Not only does this hurt children in need of homes, it also hurts families. Hopefully, all of your family members will remain healthy and alive....otherwise, if your sibling were to die or lose custody of your niece, you would be disqualified as a parent for your own relative....and she would have to wait for strangers to adopt her...straight, married strangers.

VjgqZetcaa	Can't be done that way. <br>  <br>  Copyright does not apply to names or individual words.  Trademark does not apply to names (or anything else) until and unless the name is used to identify some goods or services in commerce (i.e., "trade").<br>  <br>  Unless you use your nickname as a brand on some articles or some services, you have no particular claim to it. Even then, after you have used your brand on things, the protection only applies to goods and services like the ones you've branded.  In other words, a brand like, say Godiva chocolate doesn't prevent anyone from having Godiva spa treatments (completely different industries).<br>  <br>  Further: "Incorporating" yourself (whatever that means) will not change the fact that you can't "trademark" your name. A corporation (like any other person) cannot "trademark" its name either, unless it uses that name as a brand on goods or services.  In fact, if you start a corporation using your nickname, then the CORPORATION will own the trademark rights and you won't.   On the other hand, a company can register its name as a "business" (corporation, partnership, d/b/a, "fictitious name", etc) to prevent others from using the identical name in the same jurisdiction.|`|AA10118655	If it can be done, it would be a trademark. Copyright is for intellectual property (IP), such as music, art, photos, etc. You best bet is to hire a lawyer that specializes in this, and he/she would probably do a thorough check to make sure it have never been used before, and is not already trademarked. You also would most likely need to incorporate yourself.<br>  <br>  Also, just because you have a trademark on your nickname does not mean no one else can use that nickname, It just basically means no one can profit from it.|`|e0cf3671c2a9ccd057f41cdfc7ca55f1aa	Yeah I'm pretty sure you can't copywright names, unless it is naming something, like a book or a clothing line or something like that, you can change your name to your nickname, legally but I don't know if you want to do that...|`|AA11622716	A trademark is a name or symbol used in commerce, and it is protected so as to avoid confusion.  So, if your nickname is pepsi, it is taken already.  If you are not using your name in commerce, you cannot get trademark protection.  Copyright is a protection to an original work of art, such as a book, script, painting, photograph, etc.  Unless your name is unique to you, and no one else has ever used it before, you cannot get copyright protection.

No one has ever tried to make it illegal.|`|IasHMWM2aa	Ask scientist Doug Melton.

This is a moral question because stem cells are usually and best obtained from aborted fetuses. Therefore, President W. put a ban on government funding of the research. There are other ways to obtain such cells but the ban pretty much nerfed the whole thing in the U.S. Meanwhile, other countries such as Korea are doing quite well. Now, why should the government fund the research? Stem cells can actually be obtained through other sources than aborted fetuses. If the U.S. can shed the stigmatism of the aborted fetuses, the country may be able to make headway on the research but this would require educating religious zealots

Even under those conditions, that equates to a 16-hour duty day, 7 days per week.<br>  <br>  A "standard" duty day is 8 hours.

With that said, extra duty is just that...something added on to your regular work schedule.  The max punishment for a FG Article 15 is 45 days extra duty, 60 days restriction, half a months pay for 2 months, and a reduction in rank, based on your current rank(E-4 or below to E-1) (E-5 and E-6 can go down one).   Your punishment will begin the day your commander finds you guilty.  Remember those punishments can be suspended.

It specifically allows for any kind of duty, including fatigue duty, which is basically duty intended to physically tire you.  The duty may not be a health or safety hazard, nor may it constitute cruel or unusual punishment or violate regulations.  <br>  Your extra duty may also not demean your rank or position.  <br>  Unless you are IET, than no regulation controls how much sleep the Army must allow you to have.  FM 22-51 suggests that 6-8 hours of sleep is preferred and a minimum of 4 hours is needed.<br>  <br>  If you feel your commander is not giving you enough time to for sleep or the extra duty is too onerous you may want to contact a trial defense attorney or the inspector general.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theallenlawfirmaugusta....

If you have 14 days of extra duty, or whatever, then it is 14 straight days. You don't get a break from punishment. <br>  Technically the "Army" only HAS to give you 4 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period. It doesn't even have to be 4 consecutive hours. I could let you sleep for an hour, make you clean something for 6, then sleep another hour, then clean, then so on and so forth. I could put a cot in the HQ and make you stay there with me the whole time. There is not really a time limit in hours other than the 4 hours of sleep in that 24 hour period.<br>  <br>  It does not get any clearer than this hero. If the Soldier has 14 days of extra duty (for example) there is NO from this time of the day to that time of the day crap. I can personally keep that Soldier in my line of site the ENTIRE 14 days if I wanted to. The ONLY thing I would have to give that Soldier is 4 hours of sleep in any 24 hour period, food and water. I don't even have to let that Soldier go home to their family if I don't want to. What don't you get about this? There is NO SET TIME.

Eventually he'll get his comeuppance - and most likely will die a lonely, painful death. He continues to further divide this nation at a time when we need unity and togetherness. His hate-mongering only serves to spill over into a cesspool of rage, anger, bias, bigotry and political prejudice. Limbaugh is despicable....and it's indicative of how 'dumbed-down' Americans have become that 20 million of them actually admire him. <br>  Limbaugh's gluttony, narcissism, hubris and arrogance is representative of the inhuman, inhumane kind of society we've become.<br>  While I agree with his concept of a 17.5% flat tax, I find most of his political ideologies to be contemptible. He is a reckless, audacious, irresponsible cretin who lacks social skills, education and common courtesy. <br>  Limbaugh lacks any semblance of intelligence, objectivity, courtesy or integrity. He is obviously the product of a degenerate upbringing where he was picked on, abused and defiled. Now, his only reproach is one of bullying others and behaving as rudely and crudely as he knows how. In formal social situations, Limbaugh is probably very uncomfortable because he knows he lacks the people skills or common decency required to mingle in such circles. He is a mongrel dog trying to wade through the muck of the moneyed world. <br>  Don't call him a 'success' just because he makes a lot of money. Call him a failure because that what he is: he has failed to use his "talent on loan from God" for the common good. He has failed miserably at using his skills to bring good and dignity to our world. God will eventually have His payback once Limbaugh appears at the 'Pearly Gates' and St. Peter asks him what limbaugh did to make the world a better place.  <br>  As you might ascertain, I loathe this disrespectful, shameful example of a man.....because he is nothing more than a simpleton, a sniveling coward.   -RKO-   03/07/09|`|hXwqKidraa	Whatever.

I can tell by your question that you're probably just a little bit naiive.  That's OK.  Everybody was once.  <br>  <br>  I don't consider the abortion issue all that much in my daily life, and I certainly understand the desire to have an abortion if you're young and just ill-prepared for a baby.  However, there are couples out there who are currently going all the way to China to adopt and would probably love to have more options here at home.  Also, everybody deserves a chance to live.  Maybe it won't be under the best of circumstances, but with age and talent comes opportunities.  Who knows what the child might ultimately become?  Aborting the pregnancy simply for convenience seems harder and harder for me to justify in my mind.  <br>  <br>  As far as the death penalty goes, our system of justice is really a good one, all things considered.  Of course innocent people get executed.  Always have.  But a sense of justice requires me to support the use of capital punishment.  If the evidence is not entirely clear (based on just one eye witness or circumstantial evidence) then I would not support the death penalty.  Rotting in a prison as an innocent man in my opinion is no better.  <br>  <br>  As far as why conservatives have firearms...what do you care?  Law abiding citizens ought to have the right to defend themselves, and pursue happiness however they see fit.  That doesn't mean they enjoy killing "stuff."  Hell, I am willing to bet that if I took you out to a gun range and let you pop off a few rounds you'd be a gun nut yourself.<br>  <br>  Ease up, buddy.

I would never wholeheartedly support anybody.  I will, however, think critically about anything that intelligent people say.  If I agree wonderful, but I won't discount everything that someone says because they say one stupid thing.  Nor would I support everything that somebody says because they said one thing with which I agree.<br>  <br>  We have a very strange and easily swayed society right now.

It is complete goverment control world wide. <br>  <br>  And it is true and real.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Search it out.  Obama talks with EU's PM Gordon just as recent as this week - New Global Deal .....<br>  <br>  GW Bush talked on it, Bill Clinton talked on it - even said he agreed with the exact wording that GHW Bush used - New World Order.  Obviously, GHW Bush talks about it.  French Pres. Sarkozky talks about it as do many other leaders WITH the United States.  It goes back further than that - it is just more in reach now.<br>  <br>  Close your eyes to it if you want - it will happen whether you look or not.<br>  <br>  If you knew anything at all about those in the Church - you would know that they do NOT live in fear - this is NOTHING to fear.

AA11163314	You need to learn some basic economics son.<br>  <br>  The spending blitz that Obama is on is using borrowed money.  Money is not 'free' nor is it available in unlimited quantities.  The government has to go to the investment and capital markets to get this money.<br>  <br>  This means that there is less money available to the economy to be used by businesses.<br>  <br>  The reduction in money available for private investment is one of the reasons for the decline in the stock market.  Instead of cash flowing towards stocks it is flowing towards government debts.<br>  <br>  Decreasing government borrowing will free up money that can then be used to buy stocks and other economically productive investments.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?<br>  <br>  The more the government takes money out of the hands of the people, the LESS the economy has to spend.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	OMG how can they do that?

They're not saying "don't buy anything," they're not even saying "The government won't spend any money."  It's simply "The government won't be spending any more than current bills and budget allow."  It's pretty much going to stop the pork laden bills like the $410 billion pork laden bill that (luckily) failed in the Senate.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  How big do want the deficit to be? Maybe, I don't know, Obama could stopp calling this economy the worst since the Great Depression or is will actually become that.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	I want to go to an auction with you.

ALL "government money" is gained by SHRINKING the economy. ALL government spending competes AGAINST the economy for resources.

His dergegualtion of agencies like the FDA and his firing of Food Inspectors have cost the lives of hundreds of Americans since with poisoned ansd spolied foods. He  was more actor than President.

N.Korea? Canada? Australia?<br>  I prefer to work hard and pay for the best medicine available.|`|lJGnuMbbaa	because to see a doctor you will need to get government permission and any specialty care will be based on cost efficiency if it cost too much you ain't getting it. and the government will have your medical info in their computers.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	There are many among us that do not wish to be educated.|`|kwWiMrmgaa	Okay, look at Canada, England, you name it - if you meet people online or where ever from those countries, ask them how their health care is. People are put on waiting lists and literally have to wait sometimes years for procedures. There have been news reports on it, it's no secret. I read somewhere about an American man visiting  Europe. He injured his thumb and went to the hospital, they gave him salve and put a band aid on it. The pain kept getting worse. When he got home to the U.S. he went back to the doctor and was told it was broken. There are people who've waited so long for life saving operation that they've DIED. A woman my mom knows had to wait a year for hemorrhoid surgery. THAT is universal health care. That's how it works. Anyone who has had experience with it despises it. Universal healthcare IS socialist health care - everyone will be paying through taxes for everyone else's health care. If you go to doctor once a year you'll pay just as much as someone who has major health problems,medical procedures every week, and prescription out the butt.<br>  Here's the best part - you're doctor will have absolutely no control over your health care. The government will make all those decisions. Talk to your doctor, see what he thinks about universal health care. It's a an absolute nightmare.<br>  As for it leading us to socialism, those who don't know history are bound to repeat it. You need to learn about why our country operates the way it does. History has proven that SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK|`|voxCmK1Haa	I don't use/trust wikipedia as a source of information.<br>  <br>  But how do you plan to pay for universal health care without having strong taxes to pay for it.

AA10294213	When picking a message, remember that they don't care about you, they care about themselves.  To the average voter "organized, neat, responsible, most experience" sounds like boring.  Since the Secretary probably can't actually do anything for the voters I suggest you say something to get their attention, get them talking about you, get them to remember your name when they vote.   <br>  <br>  A message which says, while you are going to take good care of their business, you've got the kind of energy and spirit to shake things up and make things happen, rooting out and cleaning up the incompetence and corruption of the incumbent or previous Secretary and while you're at it, change the world!<br>  <br>  How about printing big photoshop'd pictures of you wielding a broadsword like King Arthur or Conan the Barbarian would use, and printing in bright colors: "WHATEVER IT TAKES" and your name.

The ideal plan would be to do nothing, as we did in 1921 during a mini depression/large recession.

And that was after the rest of the world had recovered.|`|B07sKfdvaa	Not to turn American into a third world country, but to disable the American machine long enough that we have to be part of a global effort to recover.  It seems pretty apparent that the liberal plan of dissolving nations and creating a more globalistic approach to government and economics is becoming a reality.  The finishing touch on America is to take out our legs during an economic downturn, by getting ourselves so far into debt that we have to depend upon other nations to get us out.<br>  <br>  The downturn could be in recovery right now, but the debt to which we have now hitched our economic wagon will weigh us into oblivion unless some other entity bails us out.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	It officially ended with the start of World War II. Get your facts straight.|`|749a6586e68d3ab356d776176fd57b63aa	I believe its an ongoing slump on purpose,set by Obama and Rahm,and the rest of the radical left.There have been numerous plans set out by many of the republicans,but they all have to do with lowering or eliminating capital gains and other taxes.The theories set by the right have been proven(Reaganomics).Since the left continues to blame Reagan for his policies,they also refuse to understand how they and there parents thrived from Reaganomics and pulled us out of a worse situation than we are in.Rahm himself,told Obama that a crisis would be a terrible thing to waste.(so exactly what did He mean?) Its a reason to grab power and government reach into personal lives,and since Obama is Hell bent on doing everything but addressing the issues in the market etc,it only leads me to believe,that Obama is creating a very much harder obstacle to overcome.Reagan did it,why don't they follow that route,and stop the suffering,unless its the tool Obama and his minions are using to grab all they can.|`|6f945bb0d7d1b30bd32ee2906d4ae659aa	This is not the depression of the 30's. It's not even close. In the Great Depression, people lined up for free soup. In this recession, people line up for cell phones and video games. <br>  It'll get better in a few years. The sooner the dems are out of congress, the quicker recovery will be.
hqvPk8WIaa	You can adjust your paperwork after the babies are born. Yes, you can buy any edible item with food stamps.|`|AA11209831	Yes, you can buy baby food with food stamps, however you should also get WIC, you can sign up for that while you are still pregnant, it gives you vouchers for milk and formula.<br>  <br>  As to applying as a family of four, I'm not sure if you can do that until they are actually born.<br>  <br>  Good luck, God bless.|`|Xi5Jno6haa	What you will do is apply for a family of two with babies on the way and yes you can buy baby food with food stamps. What can do also is apply for WIC I don't know where you live but in MO we have that program for pregnant women, infants and children up to age 3 ( I think it's 3) and they will pay for milk, cheese, peanut butter, infant formula, juice. It helps tremendously! I was on WIC with both of my kids while I was pregnant and even after I had them for a little while. If you apply for food stamps make sure you let your case worker know when you have your babies, in case there needs to be adjustments in the amount of food stamps you will get. Good luck and congratulations!|`|cz5XbKfOaa	Children don't count for food stamps until the babies are born. You will still put the babies on the application as "unborn". So you will need to meet the income requirements for a household of 2 of $1517 until they are born. You can buy baby food and formula with the food stamps.
Ti0q1Btiaa	You really remember the Great Depression?<br>  <br>  WW II and our world class manufacturing brought us out of that.<br>  <br>  Do you also remember 1972?  1980?<br>  Unemployment over 10%?<br>  <br>  We didn't spend invisible money back then.<br>  I'm sure that you are too young to remember those.<br>  <br>  What you will remember for the rest of your life is that you may be paying more in taxes than you take home.<br>  Sooner than you think.<br>  <br>  If you have ever thought of accumulating any wealth, put in in your sock.<br>  <br>  I hope that you will learn more about money than this guy who you admire so much.  He knows nothing about money.  Maybe what was given to him.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	You must look at the 1920-1921 depression to understand this.<br>  <br>  Recessions, being good for the consumer, bring prices of goods and services back to real levels. Once government gets involved like in the 29 depression, things drag out decades, and in the end government is much more powerful and the people much more weak. The method of funding this ends up stealing purchasing power from the middle class and poor. The rich, always emerge much more rich.<br>  <br>  "Conservatives" of modern times want bailouts just like the "liberals" of modern times (although both are technically neocons). It is just they want bailouts that make them rich and not the democrats.<br>  <br>  Anytime you give government more power, the rich get richer and the poor get more poor. They fund things in national debt, and monetary inflation instead of taxation (because govt couldn't tax enough to fund their spending), so it is the poor and middle class who is destroyed with a debased currency.|`|AA10079277	Who cares what the rich think.. They are only 2% of the population.<br>  <br>  I fear for the remaining 98%, or 49% of the middle and lower class democrats and 49% of the middle and lower class republicans.  They are the one's getting slammed.  Just wait until everyone's energy bills doubles, if not triples due to the cap and trade legislation they are pushing through right now.|`|VS0PuI5paa	Doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing.  Government spending cannot fix a recession, especially when the money is being spent on increasing the size of government.  What fixes a recession is putting money back into the economy, not taking it out.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	The rich get richer and the poor go to war. Its the right wing way of evening the score.  Greed, war and religious law is what the "Conservatives" stand for.|`|u23sBafTaa	I don't know what conservatives you talk to but you are way off, first of all the car companies should have cut production long before they did, they have thousands and thousands of new cars sitting parked all over the nation .  They should have been able to tell that there sells where down and acted accordingly.  We haven't said do nothing however we do know that spending money we don't have is not the way to get us out of debt !  Most of us are in the middle class and trying to hang on, we can afford to pay only so much in taxes before we are going under as well.  We have never said the rich should get richer !  If you look at the numbers they do pay taxes, true they have more loop holes that need to be eliminated.  A lot of those people you consider rich are small business owners, you tax them until it is no longer profitable for them to take the risk of running a business, they stop and there employees are out of jobs !  I know that we pay a great deal of taxes and have very little deductions, and we can't afford to continue to support all the people who prefer not to work.  Why are the liberals so naive that they think that a lot of these poor people really aren't able to work?  If they are unable there is disability, most of them are on welfare.  Obama has stopped even looking for welfare fraud.  Drive through the projects in any medium to large town in this country in the middle of the middle of a sunny afternoon, see how many are sitting arund chilling !  Why should we pay for that, and there medical care.  We have worked for ours!  Obama has no clue what he is doing,  he has no experience he came up through the system with affirmative action.  Common sense tells you  can't spend your way out of debt !  This spending is not even good spending it is just a shopping trip for pay backs to the democrat party, much of which will find it's way to the campaign funds of democrats running for office next election !  It is rocket science !|`|B07sKfdvaa	You will never find a conservative that says we should do nothing!  We need to cut taxes, which in turn will shrink government and put money back into the hands of people that spend it, thus reinvigorating the free markets.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Didn't we learn anything from the history of the Great Depression?

O1jigUYSaa	Mike,<br>  Just to help you out with some numbers.  You're right about Social Security.  However, we pay more on the Interest of our national debt than we do for our national defense.<br>  Next year you'll likely see a slight favorability to even in your federal taxes.  However, your state taxes will take a terrific jump.  70% of those are devoted to medical entitlements.<br>  No society has ever taxed itself into prosperity.<br>  another tid bit:  If you want to encourage something...subsidize it.  If you want to discourage something...tax it.  Not too much wizardry or rocket science in those words.  You'd also have a hard time challenging the results.

Bush, however, is one of the rarities in presidential history: He has not only stumbled badly in every one of these key areas, he has also displayed a weakness common among the greatest presidential failures -- an unswerving adherence to a simplistic ideology that abjures deviation from dogma as heresy, thus preventing any pragmatic adjustment to changing realities.

There is nothing bigger.<br>  <br>  They believe they can run that budget knowing every year they can have a huge record setting shortfall or deficit. This lunacy is now at the point where the cumulative total national debt is close to about 14 trillion dollars....and yet the mentality seems to be by many that what we need is more tax cuts...even with proof posititve that those tax cuts are only followed by more record budget deficits each and every time.<br>  The scheme apparently is to spend money that we dont have and that we are not willing to come up with in a responsible manner by just borrowing it from other countries, putting us in competitive disadvantage, making us a debtor nation and passing on the bill to our future generations.|`|AA11228933	Amway?|`|MNqwUHypaa	It has to be the upper management at AIG.<br>  <br>  They must have the support of the Austrian banksters, the Tel Aviv Zionists and Hillary Clinton plus Slick Willy.<br>  <br>  To Wit: MOSCOW (AFP) – Russian media has been poking fun at US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after she gave her Russian counterpart a "reset" button with an ironic misspelling.<br>  <br>  Clinton's gift to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at their meeting in Geneva on Friday evening was meant to underscore the Obama administration's readiness to "to press the reset button" in ties with Moscow.<br>  <br>  But instead of the Russian word for "reset" (perezagruzka) it featured a slightly different word meaning "overload" or "overcharged" (peregruzka).

A spending bill or other law is formed mostly of generally useful stuff, then each legislator adds in a few 'pet' projects.  Sometimes these are ways of paying off political debts.  Mostly they are a mechanism for funding needed projects which are outside the scope of the legislation  (Passing separate legislation is usually prohibitively expensive in terms of time.)<br>  <br>  Let's talk for a minute about an earmark.  Volcano monitoring is a favorite of some people.  Has anyone heard of super-volcanoes?  There are 8 known in the world and 5 are in the US.  La Garita  in Colorado is the largest known, and would winter the world and wipe out life in the US Canada and Mexico if it repeated.  Kilgore Tuff and Black Tail Creek in Idaho would do less damage as would Island Park Caldera in Wyoming/Idaho.  Yellowstone, though, is looking grumpy and would bury Wyoming, Idaho, Western Montana, Eastern Washington and Oregon, and Northern Utah in ash, even thought it is the smallest of the five and the one with the most recent eruption.<br>  <br>  So for the price tag, would you want warning, and a possible desperate option to avert the disaster, or would you rather be a somewhat richer puddle of liquid or cloud of vapor?<br>  <br>  <br>  Why monitor?  We may be able to craft a release in pressure using nukes to prevent a much wider disaster.<br>  <br>  Earmarks of course are a buzzword which many people interpret as "pork".   Certainly there is some.  That is part of the price of getting anything done.  But more likely the earmark will be for a traffic signal ($300,000) at an intersection where two little girls were run over last year, but which the local community cannot afford.<br>  <br>  As with any arrangement, there is the potential for abuse.  "Uncle Ted" (Senator Stevens) made off with huge amounts for Alaska, but an examination of it shows sanitation in tiny villages who could never have put it in themselves but where 1/4 to 1/3 of the population was infected with strep (throat or impetigo) every month (but not now with proper water/sewer), programs for the treatment of alcoholics, and vital infrastructure.<br>  <br>  Still there are those folk who would rather see none of this happen because they believe it is their money that is being spent.  They would probably be happy if the government spent nothing, at least until a few jets collided mid-air and a few bridges fell down.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	To divert attention from the 99% which is bankrupting us<br>  Old magicians trick - Wave the right hand mysteriously this way and that while the left one is doing the sneaky stuff<br>  <br>  We should do away with all "entitlements" and subject every dollar in the budget to the same scrutiny as these earmarks.

Not only are the Republicans heavily represented amongst the earmarkers, but of the top ten earmarks in terms of cost, 6 of them are being sponsored by Republicans.  Can you say hypocrites? :)<br>  <br>  Earmarks in and of themselves are not necessarily bad because they often provide funding for necessary projects in the districts of members of Congress.  The problem in the past was that the process was completely opaque and even the identity of the sponsor was hidden.  Most of those problems were reformed when the Democrats became the majority in Congress.  So, the real debate should not be about the number of earmarks but whether each individual expenditure is necessary and whether the process by which earmarks are passed and are funded is transparent.  However, that is far too nuanced and sensible for Republican Party talking points and talking heads.  They rather spew phony diatribes on TV hoping to get a few votes.|`|TkQZtNjyaa	Because Republicans need something to complain about. Remember, these are the same Nazi's who didn't vote for Obama because Obama knew a guy(Ayers) that did some bad things years ago. These are the same people that claimed Obama wasn't an American citizen because they had NOTHING ELSE to criticize him for. These are the same people that defended Sarah Palin's foreign policy experience by claiming Alaska is near Russia therefore she should be the second most powerful person in the world.<br>  <br>  Republicans are so dumb that they think we actually believe this crap. It's like when a 6 year old tries to lie to you because they assume you're on their level. Once Republicans come to terms with their lack of intelligence the world will become a better place. As of now, we have a bunch stupid red necks and Neo-Nazi's running around thinking they're geniuses when in reality my 10 year old niece is smarter than most of them.|`|C1itJ9ZHaa	Let me try to explain it in a different way:<br>  You have 100 million dollars.

And I'm an independent, so I don't tend to take sides on issues because of political parties.

The likes of Gore, Biden, Rangle and Pelosi come to mind in recent times. Al "The Weatherman" Gore is the most outspoken and public of these fountains of misinformation. He started all the uproar about "Global Warming" and how man is the single, most influential cause of this. The problem was that better than 70% of meteorologists disagreed with his statement. They pointed to any warming that occured over periods of time were actually cyclical events that have happened historically on the planet. In the past few months research has found that Gore was using his "Sky is falling" logic as a way to sell "carbon offsets" (some sort of payment for energy misuse). He, and a handful of other political hacks profit from the sale of these intangible assets. The funny part is that Gore and his partners also use private jets and gas-guzzling limousines as their preferred modes of transportation. Given the Obama administration's difficulty in finding tax-abiding staff members one has to wonder about this as well.

So get ready.|`|742e4c8b4668a0ad6462b4a0210ce82aaa	I don't think they'll go up, because President Obama is giving tax breaks to companies who produce alternative sources of energy.  In the 70's gas went up to about a dollar a gallon.  We were told that there was a shortage and we were running out of gas.  There were long lines at gas stations and these stations ran out of gas.  President Carter implemented a plan for alternative energy and tons of companies/small businesses started up to make us energy independent.  But Congress, at the time, didn't want to set a floor for gas prices and the Saudi's lowered the price so much that all these new companies went out of business.  And THAT'S why we're still in the same boat as we were 30 years ago.  I think it's different now.  The Saudi's might try to lower gas prices, but we have to be smarter about it, and I think President Obama will be.

The GOP has tried to connect all Democrats to the 'san francisco' mentality and lifestyle....That works well for southern and rural voters. While they care about other issues, many Republicans see things in moral absolutes....they see one gay couple, one guy defrauding welfare, one woman neglecting her responsibilities as a parent, and believe that a government controlled by Democrats necessarily means rampant gay pride parades on their streets, 'welfare thugs' all over their neighborhoods, and women having children for the sole purpose of receiving 'free money from the government'. <br>  For the past decade, the GOP has succeeded in stereotyping our beliefs and our own morals.

By telling dumb people like you that we are going to tax the rich you feel all good because you think you are entitled to what someone else works for.

vUiUoamVaa	on roosevelt putting japanese americans in internment camps?<br>  <br>  At the time, it seemed like the right thing to do because he felt that there could be a lot of sympathizers in the Japanese-American community.  They were easier to identify than German-Americans or Italian-Americans.  But my personal opinion, having the benefit of studying this some years later, is that it was wrong to single out a particular ethnic group when there was no evidence that they were doing anything to help the enemy.  Now to single out individuals who were supporting Imperial Japan would be a different story.<br>   <br>  on truman using the Atomic bomb?<br>  <br>  Truman considered many options including massive bombing of the island nation, which just would not have worked as they are so far away and the logistics of it were impractical.  An invasion of the island would have resulted in massive American and Japanese deaths, and it was not really practical to try that, any way, due to the distance they are from us.  I don't know if China would have let us use their territory to amass an army to invade Japan - but even if they had, the logistics involved would have been incredible and perhaps beyond our means at the time due to use of troops and supplies for the war in Europe.  He wanted to end the war quickly, surely, and save as many lives as possible.  The dropping of the atomic bomb must have been a terrible decision to make.<br>  <br>  But dropping only one would have made the Japanese government think it was a fluke, which apparently was their thought at the time - who really knows what they thought?  Dropping a second one dispelled those thoughts.  My question would have been why target those two particular cities?<br>  <br>  But those are my rather brief thoughts on a pretty darn interesting question.|`|3oUSroiZaa	I think he did that because he couldn't trust Japanese americans after what happened.<br>  <br>  That is why I hate this government because it's like if you're not from here they treat you like you 're a piece of trash.<br>  <br>  The Japanese Americans had nothing to do wih what happened.<br>  <br>  Edit:To Chevick thanks for showing me that dude but I still hate the ways of the government.|`|89e0c1de65541f968ea18e0756f6ee60aa	They were both thought necessary at the time.  <br>  <br>  Honestly the atomic bomb may not have been absolutely necessary, but it saved lives.  The Japanese would have fought to the last man.  Many lives would have been lost on both sides.  The two cities were warned in advance.  It was done as humanely as was possible.<br>  <br>  As for rounding up Japanese Americans, I don't know if it was right.  Hind sight is 20-20.  It is certain that there were Japanese Americans providing Japan with intelligence before Pearl Harbor.  Thats a fact.  It is also clear now how a scenario like those camps can degenerate into total genocide like in Hitler's Germany.  Fortunately American morals were sufficient to keep that situation from being any worse. <br>  <br>  Lastly I believe it is unfair to retrospectively apply the mores of today on people who had not yet been where WE are.  Ideals change and fast.<br>  <br>  To Matt Morrison (below) - Some of them did have something to do with the attack.  It is a historical fact.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	I don't know about the Bomb, but I certainly wonder how many people of German descent that were herded off like Japanese children were. Many of the people that were incarcerated in those were second-generation Americans and didn't understand any Japanese. I have always found Japanese to be polite, respectful, industrious people who made an important contribution during the War after the hysteria died down.<br>    As for the Bomb, there was a whole lot of time, effort, and money spent on getting it-might as well use it. Personally, I question a decision to use such a filthy, cruel weapon.

Bet you didn't think of that while posing the question, did you?  :)<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  No friend, you are wrong, because if for instance a person earns over $250k in capital gains, it is proposed that the capital gains rate be raised to 20% for those making over $250k, so their taxes would be raised even if ALL their income is from capital gains.  Secondly, you are asserting that ALL the Dems we are referring to don't have earned income over $250k with no proof whatsoever, so your attempt to wiggle out of the noose you put around your own neck is an obviously silly ploy  :)    In other words, I got ya dude.<br>  <br>  Edited again to counter your ill mannered silliness:  Warren Buffet pays less in terms of percentage of his income than his secretary, which he of course believes to be idiotic and he is all for raising taxes on the wealthiest including raising the capital gains tax for those making over $250k like Obama has proposed, thereby putting principle ahead of self-interest like I stated because his taxes will increase..  Like I said, you point to Warren Buffet and say that the Dems don't have earned income over $250k, but of course you are being ridiculous because while some very wealthy people have only capital gains income, it is rather obvious that many will have earned income too.  Your argument to try to get out of the hole you dug for yourself is built upon just another phony premise.  For example, Obama's proposal would raise taxes on (drumroll)....Barack and Michelle Obama because the prez  of the USA makes a salary of $400k which is of course earned income.  Duh dude. <br>  <br>  Finally, why on earth are you calling me a feminist as if it is an epithet...because i answered a question of yours and beat the living daylights out of your silly attempt at dissing Democrats?

In other words it causes assets to artifically rise in value. This is a situation that also occured in the 1920s and 1930s. It wasn't sustainable then, and isn't now.<br>  <br>  Bush ordered troops into Iraq. It was proved during the Carter admin, what meddling in Middle East affairs does to the price of oil. Anyone that is running for President should be aware of these affects.<br>  He did it anyway. Immedaiately, as boots were dropping in Iraq sand, speculator dollars($64 Billion USD to be exact) were dropping into the oil futures market, driving oil prices up.<br>  This caused a problem with other commodities going up in price(like corn, soybean, gasoline and others due to transportation and production related costs), which dramatically increased American cost of living. This in turn reduced spending and consumption(consumer confidence) which led to lower retail sales, lower factory orders and job cuts, which compounded the problem even more by killing investor confidence.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, that chain reaction caused problems in the housing market. As people lost their jobs, they defaulted on their home loans(these are the people that talk radio wants to claim were given loans they couldn't afford).<br>  As they did, home values dropped. People found themselves unable to refinance their ARMs when they adjusted, because their property values were lower, so many defaulted on them pushing property values even lower.<br>  This caused calls on mortgage based credit default swaps and derivitives. As investment banks had to pay them out, they foudn themselves very closed to being undercapitalized. This severely limited them to the tyes of loans they could make to regain capital. Essentially being up the creek without a paddle, the banks started collapsing. As banks that invested in their stocks found their investent portfoilios worth much less, they do ended up being undercapitlaized, creating a chain reaction that led to many banks refusing to loan money for fear of being undercapitalized by their own investment portfolios losing value from bank collapse or Lehman Bros exposure.<br>  <br>  This caused credit to dry up. Not only did this reduce consumption, but increased the cost of credit for businesses needing Operating Notes.<br>  This essentially caused businesses to have capital shortages and forced to close up. This created even more job losses, drops in real estate values, and even more problems for consmers to obtian credit and continue to buy things. Which compounded the problem even more.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, while all that is going on, specualtors and other investors are ditching their investments to cut their losses. This is driving share prices down, and causing their own problems that are compounding the crisis.<br>  <br>  This all started to slowly occur in 2003. The entire time the problem was gaining steam, the Bush admin was claiming the economic fundamentals of our economy were fine, even though they weren't, for political reasons, essentially so he could blame Democrats if they won the election or prevent them from winning by claiming the eocnomy was in great shape.<br>  <br>  AND BTW nobody forced Fannie and Freddie mac to give bad loans. Fannie Mae and Feddie Mac do not give loans to individuals. They buy loans from banks who were giving bad loans and packaging them with good loans without them being noticed, because the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act reduced regulations.<br>  And Nobody forced banks to give those bad loans. Even the Community Reinvestment Act doesn't do what peope claim it does.<br>  I bet nobody who claims it foces banks to give loans to people who can't afford them, even read the thing. I have, and I can tell you, that statement is a lie.<br>  The banks were givign bad loans, collecting their fees, and dumping the risky ones on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.|`|AA12104896	1. Bush was the President, if he and his supporters have no capability to accept responsibility, then he should never have been President to begin with.<br>  <br>  2. Democrats didn't force Fannie and Freddie to do anything<br>  <br>  3. I wasn't aware we out of a recession by 2007<br>  <br>  4. These companies were "too big to fail", maybe Bush should have stepped up and helped break up companies that were too big to fail.<br>  <br>  5. Once again, it's called responsibility, if it happens when you're in charge, then it's YOUR responsibility to fix it. Bush never did that.|`|742e4c8b4668a0ad6462b4a0210ce82aaa	Sub-prime mortgages are relatively new and that's what caused the problems.  Real estate brokers and mortgage companies were the ones telling people they could afford these houses.  Let's face it, not many of us are economic geniuses.  Mortgage professionals are the ones who are supposed to determine whether a person or family can afford a mortgage.  They just let everyone have one so they could line their own pockets and now, they've wrecked the economy.  Regulation would have put a stop to it, but there has been no oversight on anything for the past 8 years....except the phone calls and e-mails of American citizens.|`|xLm6tO7Zaa	And the fundamentals of the economy or still strong and we do not have an insurgency in iraq.

You know what? He's responsible for everything that I could have prevented myself.|`|diCASlUXaa	He drained the American economy by investing billions of our money overseas rebuildling Iraq instead of pumping that money where it's needed; here at home.|`|3AMaOT7Naa	Spending billions in Iraq<br>  <br>  and a dozen more wrong decisions.|`|x3D2BUMEaa	Problem with your question is that you cite supposed facts which are absolutely inaccurate.<br>  <br>  First of all, the recession that took place at the beginning of Bush's term started in 2000/2001 not in 2003.  Secondly, the Republican Party was in the majority in Congress from 1994 thru 2006, except for one year when the Democrats held majority in the Senate at the beginning of Bush's term.<br>  <br>  The ways in which Bush helped create the current recession and financial meltdown are two-fold: first of all, they pushed for completely unregulated financial markets and the appointees he placed in the Treasury Department failed to keep watch over the burgeoning glut of risk being taken on by the nation's major investment banks, brokerage houses, commercial banks and insurance companies.  The subsequent financial meltdown when the house of cards Treasury and the Fed allowed those institutions to build collapsed is still reverberating throughout the world and may not be fixed for some timeto come.  Secondly, he insisted on playing fast and loose with the true amount of debt being taken on by the U.S. Government and drove the dollar down against the world's currencies.  In both these pursuits he was aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve and the Democrats in Congress for sure, but his Republican party was firmly in majority in Congress most of his term and he did not utilize the veto at ANY time while they were in majority and had no problems getting his legislative agenda to pass.  Bush's greatest failure was presiding over a government that was ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH and not facing reality.  Altogether, the recession and financial meltdown are certainly not all Bush's fault, but he and his Administration deserve a great deal of credit for the debacle.|`|DWQNrMZKaa	OK... you're either Bush himself or maybe Bush's mother right? because if you're not, then you've got to be some kind of f***ing idiot!|`|2uCIb3cAaa	he let people who couldn't afford it take out house loans.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	He did his part, but in general all politicians who support the national debt, monetary inflation, expansion of the budget, and the FED are the ones who caused it. Yes government policy to force out loans was a big problem, but it tool below market rate credit from the fed to afford it. The below market rate credit caused malinvestments.<br>  <br>  Government cant 'get us out' of a recession, government has no wealth of its own. It can only steal from productive aspects of society.<br>  <br>  Overall Bush doubled the size of government, and added some $6,000 Billion to the national debt. With Obamas momentum, he is set to beat Bush at his own big government neocon game.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the only way to get out a recession is for goods and services to lower their prices low enough where people think they are worth it. Artificially keeping prices high, or throwing some change (debt) into the hands of people, wont make them buy overprices goods and services.|`|um87XJvmaa	He didn't do it all by himself. There was a list of 25 who caused this.  Both Bush and Clinton were in the middle as well as American citizens.<br>  <br>  Below is a list.  Of course, the order could be changed with personal opinions.
gnRiLwSxaa	I think your friend is messed up and should quit having children that she cannot support and raise.    Has she heard of birth control?    Also, she might be more selective about boyfriends or lovers.    Meanwhile she should get child support from both men.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	She owes the state for raising her 2 kids.  Pay up or she goes to jail. Simple|`|AA11758925	when they go to court for child support, they determine a fair/sometimes amount for the parent to pay. He will not go to prison if he keeps a job. If he keeps a job and doesn't pay the child support the state will start deducting it from his paycheck and any refund the government might give him at tax time. Jail is the last resort for those that don't pay. If that guy were to flee to another state she would have to file where he lived so that state would deduct the support owed. If he kept fleeing and was able to get away without child support than yes he could face jail time but very highly unlikely cause that does no good for the state or person owed. Basically file for child support and if he doesn't pay than the state will take it from him. If she doesn't pay the 6,000.00 she owes they will start to deduct any money from her as well she might be recieving.|`|F6yfJSr9aa	That is a tough question.  I'm not sure what your friend should do.

The factors there are MAINLY immigrants from England (well.. they owned America, remember), AND the population was extremely small at that time.. leading to many close marriages. Many of the early immigrants were speculators and such, and it is reasonable that several members of same families would be going to the colonies for making money. <br>  Every generation that you go back in family, your number of ancestors will double. 2 parents, 4 grandparents... so on. If your ancestry does trace to early American, then the number of ancestors is large enough to increase the odds of being related to others, who also were here. <br>  People did immigrate from other countries, but the MAIN surge of immigration was the late 1800s.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	If you go back far enough, we are all probably related.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No, Obama is related to  Brad Pitt not Bush.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	If you go back far enough we are all related.<br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  US Army<br>  Retired

Kennedy approached the legislation. In a very important sense, Kennedy came to endorse a civil rights bill because political circumstances allowed him to support what once had been a controversial and unpopular legislative program. <br>  <br>  John F. Kennedy's (Democratic ) civil rights record before 1963 was neither a clear endorsement nor rejection of civil rights legislation. As a senator from Massachusetts, he had an opportunity to vote on the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the first passed in the 20th century. Kennedy apparently had enough reservations about the bill to vote to send it to the conservative Senate Judiciary Committee where it probably would have been pigeonholed. Another indication of his lukewarm support for the Act was his vote to allow juries to hear contempt cases.<br>  Link with this information <br>  <a href="http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%931968)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-Ame...</a>|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Both sides fought school Integration in the fifties.

Britain is, thankfully, amongst the most secular countries in the world.  Those who fear the spread of Islam are assuming that  all the children of Muslim parents adopt the religion. That is not the case. I work in a national industry where there are workplaces where Asians form a sizable part of the workforce. This is particularly true in Lancashire. Therefore I mix with people of many generations from asian backgrounds. It is notable that each generation is more anglicized than the previous one and adherence to the religions is very much diluted. <br>  <br>  Look at history and you will find many of the attitudes expressed in some of the answers here attributed to Judaism over the centuries. <br>  <br>  The sooner we progress from superstitious nonsense of all religions the better the world will be.

BTW, you Paris Hilton IS one of the rich.|`|WoESqX8gaa	The same reasons Rich Celebrity's support the liberals.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	fooled or masochist|`|AA10079277	Very simple answer.  They don't  People care about themselves.  It is common sense.  And since only 2% of the population makes up the wealthy, that means 48% of Democrats are milddle and lower class and 48% of republicans are middle and lower class.<br>  <br>  It is not a care about the wealthy that drives republicans, it is concern for their own well being.<br>  <br>  The reason you believe they do is that you've bought into all the propoganda from the democrats.  They are masters at marketing.  The republicans suck at it.|`|AA10179458	How do Republicans support the rich?

When the rich get richer so do the middle class and even the lower class parasites. Check the facts.|`|B07sKfdvaa	I have no problem with the Hilton's giving thousands of jobs to people.  The more we tax them, the fewer jobs that they will have for people, because they won't be able to afford to pay them.  That is the view of a big company...the real damage will be done to small businesses that have been struggling to make it for 10-15 years that suddenly burst through.  Suddenly a couple that has been scraping by to build a business is considered rich because they had one year of big earnings?  That's what's ridiculous about taxing the "rich" and "wealthy"...they are the people creating the jobs and making the economic pie grow!|`|QPwx9qOjaa	If you give rich people tax cuts they have more money. More money means more potential disposable income. The more money that is spent in the economy means that demand is up. To meet the supply/demand ratio due to increased spending we need to produce more goods and services. Which means more jobs are created to produce those goods and services. Simple economics.<br>  <br>  Now I support tax cuts for every single class, but there is economic logic behind what republicans generally do.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	To those who wonder why Hollywood actors and others support the Democrats, it is because Republicans love the rich ELITE and the really really rich, not the newly rich such as sports players, actresses, singers, etc.  They consider these upstarts trying to muscle in on their territory.  <br>  <br>  Okay.<br>  <br>  Here is proof that the Republicans love the rich:<br>  <br>  1. Obama plans to give tax cuts to 95% of the population and the Republicans are crying out and the rich are silent knowing that that is a drop in the bucket for them.<br>  <br>  2. Obama plans to give jobs to people and Bush did not.  The Republicans didn't criticize Bush for doing nothing, but they're trying to stall Obama as he's trying to save jobs then create jobs in order to make him look bad for the next election and to protect their friends who would lose a profit if they couldn't get the poor to work for pennies in their factories as wage slaves rather than working at a living wage... not minimum wage.<br>  <br>  3. The conservatives want to conserve the past where white women were prisoners in their homes, minorities were wage slaves and the poor were their piggy banks and were exploited for profit.  <br>  <br>  4. Republicans voted against increasing the minimum wage, which helps the rich save billions by keeping the poor in low paying jobs and their noses at the rich guy's grindstone.<br>  <br>  5. The Republicans spend all the money on wars that profit the top corporations such as weapon makers, the auto industry that makes tanks, the construction companies that rebuild the land that we destroyed, etc.  However the working guy or girl is destroyed as jobs fly overseas at a quick rate.<br>  <br>  Republicans are supposedly better at foreign policy than Democrats... so why should we put them in?  They don't want to help the people domestically, they just want to sit on their piles of money like a dragon on gold and give to the rich who'll supposedly trickle down to the poor.  Do you know what the rich did to the poor in the olden days?<br>  <br>  1. Wage slavery<br>  <br>  2. Black slavery<br>  <br>  3. Exploit them because they couldn't afford good lawyers<br>  <br>  4. Took their families as slaves when they couldn't pay debts and took their land and houses as well.<br>  <br>  5. Banks foreclosed on homes instead of lowering the interest rate so that the people could pay or deciding to lend money to those who could pay.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but the Republicans are hand in hand with those who have destroyed the world in wars, destroyed others for their own gain, stole the labor and money of others to enrich themselves and exploited others so that they could make a profit.<br>  <br>  Now the elite are fighting the CEOs and the newly rich but none of these are the friends of the ordinary working American or the poor.  Because whichever one the Republicans bring out on top, the rest of us will still be held upside down and our money will be shaken out of our pockets and into their bank coffers.|`|yhFJzscmaa	Where do the jobs come from? Who are the people that create them? It's not the poor or the middle class. If you take money out of the people who would otherwise be investing it, then you hurt the economy. Consider this. The first Bush raised taxes and we had a recession. Clinton raised taxes and we had a recession so bad it flat lined for 18 months. Kennedy lowered taxes and we had economic growth. Reagan lowered taxes and got us out of a double digit unemployment recession. Bush lowered taxes and we had a booming economy from 2003 to 2006. So if you believe in history, you will expect that raising taxes on the the job creators will hurt the economy like it always does.|`|CxvUDpfiaa	when the rich will pay higher taxes, which most of them have there own companies,<br>  <br>  they will either do a couple of things<br>  fire more employees so they can make up the difference<br>  or decrease pay wages.<br>  <br>  see in any situation NO matter what it is in a long run something else has to give..|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Rich people create jobs, not the poor.  If you take away the money from all of the rich, including the very very wealthy, no one will have any money in just a few short years.  No new businesses, no new jobs.  I don't grudge anyone their money.  Only a very few inherit but even in those families, someone had to earn it.  If I didn't like my own income level, I would change it.  Before you start saying that poor people can't, read this true story.<br>  <br>  There are other inspiring stories but I like to use this one because of the factors involved.<br>  <br>  JC was working for a company about 40 years ago that made wooden seating, when they went out of business and he lost his job.  He decided he would start his own company  and used his last paycheck to buy wood.  He and his wife lived in a 10‘x 40’ foot trailer and they built seating on the front porch.  Before long, they were able to get a building and hire employees.  Ivynease had young children but still did all of the administration of the business, including the accounting.<br>  <br>  After 22 years, JC got his GED and went to school for an AA in architectural design.  He went on and obtained a degree in engineering.  Today almost 40 years since he lost his job, churches and courtrooms across the country buy their seating from JC and he has contracts to start providing to the Caribbean islands as well.  There are several interesting things to note:<br>  <br>  JC is black, he was poor, and he lives in the deep south.<br>  JC dropped out of school in 8th grade to support his family when his father died but obtained his education long after his company was successful and he didn‘t “need“ to.<br>  JC’s business suffered a fire in 2000 but he rebuilt and kept going.<br>  <br>  This is a true story.  So arguments that growing up poor, not having the education, that some adversity has stopped you, that your race or gender or locale is stopping you, are nothing more than excuses.

pdmNyWpCaa	Hola Bethita!<br>  bueno te daré unas lecciones<br>  político históricas de tu propio país ;)<br>  primero empecemos por parlamentarismo para luego llegar a la respuesta en si:<br>  parlamentarismo esta es una forma de gobierno a base del régimen representativo y de la separación atenuada de los poderes del estado, pero se mantiene un continuo rol fiscalizador entre el poder legislativo y el ejecutivo, siendo importante lazo entre ambos el "gabinete ministerial", donde el Presidente compartía funciones de jefe de estado con jefe de gobierno, no obstante el gabinete era de confianza del Congreso Nacional, y es responsable sólo ante el Parlamento.<br>  Los elementos esenciales de un parlamentarismo son:<br>  partidos políticos bien organizados, un gabinete homogéneo, libre acceso al Congreso, y responsabilidad del gabinete ante la Cámara.<br>  <br>   Pero este sistema, implantado en Chile gracias a las reformas de los <br>  gobierno liberales que querían imitar a países como Inglaterra y Alemania, tenía muchas imperfecciones, que lo hace ser distinto al existente en Europa, y lo hace fracasar, es por ello que se le llama "PARLAMENTERISMO A LA CHILENA". <br>  <br>   Para que funcione en buenas condiciones se necesita un partido de gobierno y otro de oposición, en Chile habían seis partidos bien organizados pero que se agrupaban según intereses en dos coaliciones y cambiaban constantemente dentro de ellas, lo que hacía que el gabinete cambiara muchas veces en un solo gobierno, ocurriendo en algunos casos que el Presidente triunfaba con una coalición y terminaba gobernando con la opositora si esta ganaba en el Congreso Nacional. Esa fue la principal razón del fracaso, además del cohecho o compra de los cargos públicos como parlamentarios y otros. Durante el período pelucón y liberal juntos, o sea 51 a?os de gobierno hubo 29 gabinetes distintos; durante 33 a?os de parlamentarismo desfilaron 530 ministros a través de 121 gabinetes ministeriales distintos, parciales o totales. Esto ocasionaba que los ministros no eran leales al Presidente sino a la coalición con mayoría en el Congreso, afectando al funcionamiento normal del Estado y de un gobierno en desarrollo, es por ello que fracasará hacia 1924, siendo sacado de funcionamiento por un movimiento cívico militar.<br>  <br>  bueno espero haya comprendido se?orita<br>  jeje nos vemos amiguita <br>  te quiero mucho <br>  un beso|`|4Vmlf902aa	Sorry!!

Slavery on our soil started two centuries before America existed, so it was not an American policy that started it. <br>   <br>  <br>  3. African Kings sold slaves to Europeans for centuries, shipping them through Islamic controlled trade routes. <br>   <br>  <br>  4. It was primarily four European countries that bought slaves from African Kings and sent them to the Caribbean and North America – the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British (so the USA had Nothing to do with it starting). <br>   <br>  <br>   5.

And if you really want to blame someone for slavery, the black kings who thought selling their fellow blacks to get British and Euro products are more at fault than any white guy who bought them in the South. Finally, if ancestors of blacks in the USA today hadn't come here as slaves, they would all be living in Africa right now or not been born cause history would have had a whole other outcome.

Ever rode a "neighborhood electric vehicle?" Well, you might want to now. The stimulus includes a tax credit toward the purchase of NEVs, which closely resemble golf carts in appearance. They are considered green vehicles because they use an electric battery instead of gasoline. You fill it up with juice by plugging it into a home electrical outlet. Don't expect to be able to take your NEV far outside of your neighborhood, though. Federal regulations limit their top speed to between 20 and 25 miles per hour. Freeway cruising is out.<br>  <br>  Those aren't the only green vehicles getting stimulus subsidies. There is also $300 million to buy "green" cars for federal employees.<br>  <br>  2) Closing the ice-breaking gap. The U.S. Coast Guard is getting a shot in the arm from the stimulus, thanks to $98 million for a "polar icebreaker." That's not a new gum flavor, but a ship. The service currently has three ice-breaking ships able to sail through the frozen Arctic Ocean, but it wants a new and improved one to upgrade the aging fleet. Thad Allen, commandant of the Coast Guard, testified before a House panel last summer that icebreakers are needed for national security reasons. "Russia, Germany, China, Sweden and Canada are all investing and maintaining and expanding their national ice-breaking capacity," he said.<br>  <br>  3) Homeland security stimulus. That pricey icebreaker is just one of several examples of homeland and national security spending contained in the stimulus not directly connected to restoration of the economy. There is also $200 million to "design and furnish" the Department of Homeland Security headquarters. De Rugy says that security spending should be considered by Congress in bills related to security, not the economy. "There was no debating these things on the merits," she says.<br>  <br>  4) Clean Coal. While Obama has stressed the number of "green jobs" his stimulus will create, $3.4 billion of the $787 billion will be spent on old-school, non-green energy technology. That's how much goes to the Fossil Energy Research and Development program, a Department of Energy project that, among other things, seeks to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by the use of fossil fuels. Daniel Weiss, a senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, says that most of this money will go toward the development of clean-coal technology. "The goal is to develop a technology that can capture carbon dioxide from coal in a coal-fired power plant," he says. And where's the stimulus in clean coal? Weiss says that we won't see the results of this investment anytime soon, and $3.4 billion is probably only a fraction of what is needed for real clean-coal technology to ever be achieved. But, he adds, in the short term, "this would create research jobs and jobs at power plants." That isn't stopping critics from calling this fossil energy provision pork.|`|9HRkwzruaa	I haven't heard a word Rush has said in 15 years...but whatever.<br>  <br>  Here's a spreadsheet that breaks down everything in the bill: <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pV-c6t5fOVmNorqMpHvnCMw" rel="nofollow">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=p...</a><br>  <br>  Let's see...$650,000,000 for digital-to-analog convertor box grants, line 52.  Yep, that'll form tons of jobs and keep folks employed.  (Funny, if they decided not to tax me out the wazoo I would be happy to just fork out the $40.)  "Habitat restoration and mitigation activities, $400,000,000, line 56.  I can see where that's going to help the economy soooo much.  $2.5 billion in "research and related activities", line 63.  I'm not saying research is a bad thing, not at all...but that will probably create a handful of jobs at some colleges, without a whole lot of payoff.  "Efficient Federal Motor Vehicle Fleet", $600,000,000 to provide hybrid cars to government officials, line 89.  Yes, cars are a good thing to manufacture, but good grief.  At $100,000 a pop, that would provide 6,000 of them.  We don't have 6,000 government officials, and unless they're hybrid Lamborghinis, they don't cost anywhere near that much.  What is that money really for?<br>  <br>  Then there's $200,000,000 for National Mall Revitalization, line 99; $100,000,000 for "Centennial Challenge", line 100; $800,000,000 for "Hazardous Substance Superfund", line 103; $650,000,000 in Capital Improvement and Maintenance", line 109; $150,000,000 in Smithsonian Facilities Capital, line 112; $2,188,000,000 for Public Health centers, only $600,000,000 of it goes toward actual training and payroll (and not until at least next fall); $4,100,000,000 for HHS research grants, unspecified, and $1.5 billion set aside so the director of HHS can issue a report (lines 126 & above).  Dang, for that kind of cash I'll type the thing for him.  How is any of that going to stimulate the economy?  It might save or provide a handful a jobs.<br>  <br>  I could go through the rest of it for you, but I really don't feel the need.  Hopefully, you'll take a few minutes and read it yourself.  I found almost $14 billion of pork in 5 minutes of looking.  Perhaps you could do the same?|`|hQPi5t1Gaa	The venerable Oxford English Dictionary defines “stimulus” as “something that promotes activity, interest, or enthusiasm.” If, as appears almost certain, the federal government enacts legislation appropriating more than $800 billion in a so-called “stimulus package,” the next edition of Oxford might properly include further definitions for the already-overused term: “any massive federal spending program designed to funnel taxpayer monies into pet political projects; a term employed to disguise massive federal spending programs designed to funnel taxpayer monies into pet political projects, but labeled ‘stimulus’ in order to secure votes necessary for passage.”<br>  <br>  Of course, as is par for the course in proposing and enacting modern federal legislation, congressional leaders have attached a high-sounding and misleading moniker to this latest and largest ever so-called “stimulus package.”<br>  <br>  The legislation, which passed the House last week and the “senior” chamber Tuesday, is entitled “The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.”<br>  <br>  How clever be these members of Congress. They know you can never go wrong by including the word, “American” or “America,” in the title of any legislation, since there is then always the implication that anyone who votes against the bill is, of course, un-American.<br>  <br>  But the true evil of this spending boondoggle is not so much its title as its substance. Virtually every pet project and constituency of the Democratic Party will be at the receiving end of the billions of dollars rushing down this latest federal money sluice. The disaster that is this “recovery and reinvestment act” is made far worse by the fact that every single one of its more than $800 billion bills is borrowed.<br>  <br>  When all is said and done according to the government’s own estimate, this spending measure will add more than a trillion dollars to our national debt which already tops $10.2 trillion.<br>  <br>  Moreover, this appropriations vehicle comes on top of last year’s “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act” —- the so-called “bailout” —- and the now small, $152 billion 2008 “Economic Stimulus Act.” Thus does the true magnitude of the damage to the value of our currency and to the future economic health of our nation start to come into focus.<br>  <br>  State and local government officials, including our own here in the Peach State, are already gleefully counting the billions they are slated to receive from Washington’s “reinvestment” largess.<br>  <br>  These are the same spendthrift state and local governments that have failed for decades to keep their own spending under control.<br>  <br>  Throwing even more federal money their way simply rewards their irresponsibility, and further disguises the necessity for state and local governments to rein in their own spending.<br>  <br>  Some of the details of the “reinvestments” in the House’s version of the stimulus package are truly amazing. For example:<br>  <br>  > A billion dollars will continue to subsidize the perennial money loser, Amtrak; $20 billion expands the already bloated food stamp program.<br>  <br>  > About $2 billion is diverted from the wallets of hard-working Americans to subsidize childcare. Some $2.8 billion is slipped to global warming advocacy programs.<br>  <br>  > $600 million will buy more and newer cars for government bureaucrats, along with $44 million to refurbish the Department of Agriculture, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, and $150 million to spruce up the Smithsonian buildings.<br>  <br>  > Another $650 million is earmarked for helping consumers convert analog TVs to digital (because the government earlier decided to halt analog television broadcasting). More than $400 million promotes anti-smoking programs and programs to fight sexually transmitted diseases. Those are just the tip of the fiscal iceberg.<br>  <br>  There are minor differences in the House and Senate versions, but overall the amount of money spent and the amount of pork in each is outrageous and harmful; and besides, the House-Senate conference may very well add back in what the Senate took out but really just shifted around, in a typical example of congressional legerdemain.<br>  <br>  When all the dust settles, the only thing this fiscal monstrosity will “stimulate” is making American citizens, businesses and state and local government even more dependent on Uncle Sam than before; even as we and our children and grandchildren are rendered the poorer.<br>  2 points|`|qaaLbzltaa	You know, you're just as bad as those who follow Rush blindly, because you follow Obama blindly.

WQlNNHuXaa	I agree with Its that Guy, feudalism is a much more localised and self contained system. The landlord doesn't use that percentage of income that he gleans from the peasant to contribute to that peasants quality of life, nor the quality of life of those surrounding him. It is much more self interested in that sense. With taxes in a democracy, money is constantly being fed back into the economy, for the benefit of the people and the quality of life.

They had no chance to advance themselves or improve their standard of living.  They worked for the land, in other words ALL their crops belonged to the landlord and they were given a small amount to live on.  They had no say in how their country was run or what the landlord did with his money.<br>  <br>  Taxpayers in a democracy (or republic, same thing) have collective control of their country.  They go by a totally different idea, that man is born free and people institute their own government for purposes of social stability.  The govt. doesn't -own- you, you own it.  You don't work for the landlord, he works for you.  You have as much right as anyone else to decide how much you are taxed and what your tax money goes for.

You'll also learn more about the law than you ever knew. Once you go through the police academy, you realize just how little the average citizen knows about the law. It's a great education, and I am very glad that I went to the police academy. I am looking forward to working as a peace officer myself.

UdERC367aa	Hard to say, as it's all conjecture.  However...<br>  <br>  The Civil Rights Movement was already underway in 1963 and would have continued much as it did w/ JFK's support. Vietnam is trickier to predict if Kennedy had remained in the White House through 1968. Rusk and McNamara continued at State and Defense through much of LBJ's time, so it is possible that Vietnam would have unfolded much as it did. I like to think, though, that Kennedy would have seen the developing quagmire and acted to change course more quickly than Johnson did. A lot of what happened in the late 60s and 70s was fueled by anti-war resistance so a chance in the trajectory of the Vietnam War would have resulted in a drastically different America.|`|mQsF5dLnaa	I think that this country would not be headed for the nanny state that it is sure to become. JFK said, ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country. Obama is just the opposite, the dems want to keep the citizens on the Federal teat so that you will vote for them in order to survive. Look at Chicago politics, because that is is where we are headed. Long live Acorn.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	No Chicago riots at the 1968 Democratic convention.<br>  No Watergate scandal.<br>  No RFK assassination.<br>  No Nixon presidency.<br>  <br>  But we would probably still have had race riots, an LBJ presidency, the Beatles, and Woodstock.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Nuclear war. <br>  <br>  I laughed when I heard Sheryl Crow defend Obama with, "He has as much experience as JFK did." Dear God.........|`|XgMqcXsPaa	for starters, JFK probably would have been seen as much less of a great president, and more of a playboy|`|FJJJVmRaaa	There wouldn't be a federal reserve.

As is was, they hijacked the country, and never gave it back to the American public.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Many.  Kennedy would had to have resigned as president.<br>  <br>  One of his girlfriends was a Communist Spy from East Germany.<br>  <br>  The News Media warned him that they were not going to Cover-Up for him any more.<br>  <br>  Check it out.<br>  <br>  (Even so, I liked Kennedy.  He was the First president to give Tax Cuts to Taxpayers.   That's why many Democrats hated him.)|`|8tf5rOXdaa	He would have resigned in shame over a sexual scandal and the USA would have had to go through it.|`|AA11042510	He would continue to seduce other women behind his wife and childrens back.

I'm really not impressed with his handling of the economic crisis.|`|GxKnzVVzaa	I voted for him and I do not regret it. I'm appalled at the amount of right winged people who are complaining this early in his presidency. If they complain so much now, what is it going to be like in 1,2,3 years? Cleaning up the mess is not going to be easy, people expect results yesterday. Not gonna happen. It will take time.<br>  <br>  I suspect i'll get a lot of thumbs down because people are so wrapped up in their political party that they forgot what thinking for yourself meant.|`|78z7gk7naa	I'm too young to vote, but I'm GREATLY interested in politics. I consider myself more libertarian than democrat, but in my opinion Obama has been doing a alright job. I wish he would be a bit more optimistic, but so far hes being doing alright.<br>  <br>  But in the end, it doesnt matter whether you dislike Obama or not now. Hes our president. We should respect him and not bash him, especially not this early in his presidency.  Hes our president, and we should still be proud of him. I say this for other presidents too, like Bush. I greatly disagreed with 99% of Bush's decisions, but he was our president. I need to respect that. Do I need to agree with what everything Bush did? No, a course. But should I respect him? Yes :]<br>  <br>  I think both the Republican party and the Democrat party should learn this.<br>  <br>  I'm 13 years old.|`|14448424cce976d640af04d6e8081a3faa	i didn't vote for him and i don't regret it because if people researched what obama has done they would have voted him out of congress<br>  but now because all the uneducated/ignorant have screwed all of us|`|i5TqhvrOaa	Bush is a tard obama is a bigger tard!

This question is asked constantly by the far right conservatives who just can't seem to get around the fact that the majority of people rejected Republican conservatism . . we want a liberal Democrat and his policies and are excited about this administration and the changes that will happen. Bush made a mess of the economy and left Obama with an unfinished war . . so these are hurdles that we feel Obama can over come but they will take time. No one is in any rush at all . . Obama can take as much time as needed as long as he continues with liberal changes that we all support . . healthcare, stimulating the economy, education, tax reform  .  . those of us on the left fully support all of it.<br>  <br>  The only people who remain bitter about Obama are right wing conservative Republicans . . they can not believe that there are other people out in this country who do not embrace the narrow mindedness of conservatism. They can not believe that there are others who have a totally different outlook and belief system than they do . . and they have become intolerant of any difference of opinion.<br>  <br>  You don't need a poll . . or hear about a true difference of opinion . . you only want conservatives to agree with you.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I voted for Obama, I don't regret it, Bush left Obama with 2000 Enron collapses about to occur and the CEO's of the fortune 500 living on Caribbean islands that they bought with their offshore accounts while the middle class becomes a memory.  What do you expect Obama to do with 30 years of Republican destruction given that he has only been in office 2 months.  When it comes to guns and abortion I am as conservative at the far right, but without a Federal Government that protects the American Domestic Economic Base, the country is screwed no matter who is in power.  Lets face it Bush and Cheney along with their big business buddies were no more than global fascists, worse than the WTO and the EU.  <br>  <br>  Give Obama a chance, and see what the country looks like in four years, it can't be more f-ed up than what Bush left him with.  The "get yours at all costs and to hell with the rest of humanity" attitude that Bush and Cheney applied failed for everyone but the elite super rich.  It's time the Federal Government actually "governed" the people who elect them instead of serving corporate masters.  I hope Obama does a small fraction of what he promised, but as for now, Obama has already done more for the American public in his first two month in office than Bush did in two terms.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Not me.  I voted for Hillary in the primary (I debated up to the last minute) because I thought Hillary had a better chance to win.  Boy was I wrong and I am really thrilled about it.  <br>  <br>  It is still early.  I have strongly disagreed with one of his cabinet choices but you can't make everyone happy all of the time.  <br>  <br>  Now I will get a zillion thumbs down just like after the last question.  I always wonder about that.  I'm not insulting people, I'm just answering the question honestly...|`|dFHsAXDMaa	OMG you people are so stupid reallyWHY WOULD WE REGRET IT.... people are complaining that Obama has lost 6 million jobs.....that he is making changer for the worse ( like BOB the fraud commented) OBAMA has not lost 6 million jobs the Man has been in office what 2 months really this is all still fall out from BUSHHHHHHHH..... it took bush 8 years to destroy this country.. do you really seriously think Obama has a magic wand to fix it all in 2 months come on give me a break... research history a little OBAMA is more like Roosevelt the man who came in when economy was falling.. war was happening and is destined to be president for years like roosevelt was from 1933-1945 because just like back then hopefully the people will realize changing leadership in a time of economic crisis would be detrimental to this country.... Give the man a chance... stop charging on your credit card save some money and help a neighbor like people in the great depression did... we will survive this but it will get worse before it can get better.. unfortunately..this is how things usually work they have to get worse before we see them getting better...<br>  <br>  Americans lived that keep up with the jones lifestyle too long buying house they could not afford on only one of the salaries of a couple... as the yelled charge it at the mall and out to dinner....And government lived above their means as well and now everyone needs to turn that around and that will take time and effort and compromise...stop thinking about how they screw you over think about how you yoursellves were irresponsible with your budgeting and spending and fix it and help a neighbor or someone in your community.. that is how people survived the great depression they waited in line for their monthly allotment of say flour.. butter..sugar...even pantyhose... and they pulled together with neighbors and they did things like baked bread.. canned foods and share their resources with people so everyone was taken care of... This is what our neighborhoods need to do now during this hard time...for example if you are a mechanic and your neighbor needs help with a car repair help them and maybe they can help you with something you need..need a babysitter so you can go to work...maybe you can get a teenager to do it in exchange for helping them with something they need like ride or homework think about it... Go shovel out an elderly neighbor or mow their lawn for them...and not expect anything in return...bet she bakes you something anyway to say thank you....maybe if you were all a little less worried about what you don't have and more concerned and thankful for what you do have the world will be a better place....maybe it is time for teenagers to learn what hard work means and going without...and not getting everything handed to them.... maybe it is time for Americans to get back to simple pleasures in life Family, love. Neighbors and community spirit.<br>  <br>  Give the man a chance 2 months really ..... how is he suppose to fix in two months what took BUSH 8 years to ruin and why didn't all these people complaining do something to stop Bush and impeach him before we got to this point...think about that!|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Why do we keep seeing this question over and over again?  Lots of people who voted for Obama and approve of the job he's doing (e.g., like most Americans) say so, and then they all get six thumbs-downs.

We didn't give 9/11 victims and families much assurance of anything. We didn't investigate or care why this happened. Some criticized and attacked these families for simply wanting answers to why their loved ones had to die and what the governement was and was not doing. <br>  I'm all for airport security, but at the cost of thousands of lives on 9/11 and thousands more in the Iraq war--that was repeatedly 'tied' to 9/11, I don't think it was worth it.

AuWHIJPKaa	It is up to grandparents, not any farther. However, since both Britian and Ireland allow dual citizenship (citizenship of 2+ countries), you can apply for Irish citizenship through this process:<br>  -legal resident of Ireland for at least 5 of the 9 years before application<br>  -be 18+ years<br>  -of good character and must intend to reside permanently in Ireland<br>  -passport, Green Book, Certificate of Registration with the Medical Council (if doctor), Birth Certificate (Plus certified translation if not in English), Certificate or letter from the Revenue Commissioners that all all tax due has been paid, to include personal income tax, company tax, PRSI and VAT, Marriage certificate (plus certified translation if not in English), Documentary evidence of financial circumstances (e.g. bank statements for the previous twelve months), and Payslip / statement of earnings from employer<br>  -upon approval, ￡500|`|OjbGuHa6aa	It doesn't go that far back to claim Irish citizenship. Just your parents or grandparent. Not great great grandparents. Plus you have to have birth certificate, marriage certificate and death certificate. Remember during your great great grandparent time Ireland was still under British rule until 1922 Ireland became independent. So during your great great grandparent time they would have been considered English.<br>  <br>  Other Irish ancestors<br>  Unless at least one parent or grandparent was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis of extended previous ancestry (that is, ancestors other than your parents or grandparents). In addition, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis that relation such as a cousin, aunt or uncle was an Irish citizen if none of your parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth.|`|AA11366224	As a general rule, you need an Irish grandparent.  However, it's more complicated than that.  It's unlikely you qualify for an Irish passport if your only connection with Ireland is 2 Irish great great grandparents.|`|WKiAISZdaa	Why would you want to bother if you already hold a British passport?

x3D2BUMEaa	I would have subjected myself to nasty and unspeakable things if that would have prevented the attack.  <br>  <br>  What could Bush have done?  Perhaps he should have convened an urgent meeting of his top intelligence officials after being handed the National Intelligence Estimate in August, 2001 which trumpeted that bin Laden was determined to strike in the USA possibly thru using airplanes instead of going on vacation in Crawford, TX for a month?  I get the impression that the CIA's dire warnings were not given sufficient weight.  <br>  <br>  Just a thought...such a meeting and heightened security might not have prevented the attack, but we will never know that for sure.  Contrast the attitude of his Administration at that point in time with what we have today and have had ever since the attacks--such an intelligence estimate would be viewed very seriously.  So, yes, he probably should have done more because today we know we would do more if faced with the same circumstances.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Listened to the CIA and FBI....I would have read the actual briefings.<br>  I would have never set up US military bases in regions where we knew that the people of that area deemed the place to be sacred.

Or at the latest in Kennedy's.  The encroachment into palestinian guaranteed areas should have ceased.  The Israelis should have been brow beaten into abiding both by the UN Resolution 248 and their own law passed by the Knesset.<br>  <br>  But now both sides have become intractable and neither side has the will to back off.  Resolution of the basic territorial conflict is the only solution and there is too much blood on both sides now.<br>  <br>  There is probably little Bush could have done to prevent a few people from killing themselves to accomplish their political agenda.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	If normal protocols had been followed that was all that was needed.<br>  <br>  Simple things like taking notice of warnings, from many very credible sources:<br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13203-2005Feb10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/art...</a><br>  <br>  And, on the day itself, simply following established protocols, would have diminished the damage. The Pentagon would not have been hit, for a start.<br>  <br>  But I guess you're new to thinking about this, look into it a bit further, and do some thinking for yourself, ask some simple questions like<br>  <br>   "is it likely that a plane would be allowed to hit the most secure building in the world, the Pentagon, over an hour after it was known planes had been hijacked and used as weapons?"<br>  <br>  or<br>  "Why will the government not release one of the dozens of CCTV videos, known to exist, showing clearly what hit the Pentagon?"<br>  <br>  or is this a controlled demolition, or the result of asymmetrical damage, and isolated fires, as we are asked to believe:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p9A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Bush could have done nothing, he was a place-man for the real rulers of the US, and they would have been in a lot of difficulties carrying out their agenda if 9/11 had NOT happened.|`|LoSXjaGXaa	If I knew about it, and who was doing it, I would have had them detained at the airport.<br>  <br>  Also, Clinton had the ability to kill Bin Laden back in the '90s.

I also don't know that he did anything.<br>  <br>  Sure I would have followed up on all the warning signs.  When the previous president told me it was the most important thing I would face.

Blacks can be more likely to commit hate crimes, but committing hate crimes can still be a primarily white phenomenon, as his data indicates. <br>  <br>  It can be correct to imply that "hate crimes" come mostly from whites.

(Unless he just got out after serving 12 years on it).<br>  <br>  As a general rule, for a felony 5 theft, a person can expect probation, restitution for the amount of the stolen items, if it was a store, banishment from that store, a fine of up to $300 and possibly community service. <br>  <br>  If the prior felony was a minor one that he didn't serve a lot of time on, a court appointed attorney would usually work.

438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	the truth is there should  be an AMERICAN history month, for all of what america encompasses.  once any particular race is singled out, the whole concept becomes racist by definition.  there is no other conclusion possible.<br>  <br>  if people insist on celebrating their own ethnicity, which is fine by me, then others should be able to do the same without any rebuke.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	No a pull you head out month, and save this country before<br>  every stinking minority interest destroyes it|`|MEReSvZeaa	The entire concept is racist.<br>  <br>  Liberals are obsessed with dividing people by their ethnicities and backgrounds.|`|AA12104896	We've got...<br>  <br>  January<br>  March<br>  April<br>  May<br>  June<br>  July<br>  August<br>  September<br>  October<br>  November<br>  December<br>  <br>  I think that about covers it.|`|k6hicodfaa	We're actually in women's history month.  I'm curious why this question is never, should there be a men's history month?  It's fascinating.|`|G6ein0naaa	Why should anyone get their own month? I mean, whatever happened to "the melting pot", and "all men created equal"?|`|L6Ko87r9aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  And a Red History Month, as well. (Perhaps Brown, for the Indians and Middle Easterners... Would they be considered 'black'? I'm not sure.)<br>  <br>  And I'm being entirely serious. Reverse discrimination is so rampant in this country that it's not even funny. It's not to say discrimination of the minorities doesn't exist, but at the political level, every effort is made to end THAT discrimination... And so the majority loses.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	that would be racist didnt ya know white people cannot have anything we are still being punished for slavery which was over a hundred years ago. plus theres not enough months to give every culture a spot it would have to by weeks|`|klj3cOFPaa	We have Irish-American history month, German-American history month, and many other history months that relate only to white ethnic groups.<br>  <br>  If we had a white history month, it would be redundant.  Why should white people get TWO months to celebrate their history?|`|q7v1XAHAaa	The entire concept is stupid. There shouldn't be anything that focuses on the contributions of one particular race.|`|318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	No.  Caucasians do not need a racist month to know that Caucasians have contributed to this nation.  N'egro History Month needs to be abolished.
3YRrGfkiaa	It's a phony democratic state.  There are minority parties, but they aren't allowed to exercise genuine free speech and risk lawsuits if they say anything critical of incumbent MPs.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, it's a pretty standard-issue parliamentary system.|`|VP7A10bXaa	idk, parliamentary?
bMymXRwJaa	The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) was passed by President Carter.  Basically, it mandated that everyone who wanted to own a home should be given a mortgage.  This created an artificial increase in housing prices which fell apart in the late 80's.<br>  <br>  Not to be outdone, Bill Clinton re-vamped the CRA, creating the largest housing bubble in history, the effects of which we are seeing today.<br>  <br>  During the Bush administration, several Republicans (John McCain included) warned of the imminent failures of Fannie & Freddie.  However, Democrats (Maxine Waters, Barney Frank, et tal) rallied to defend their social experiment and eventually won the day.  Hence the collapse became inescapable.<br>  <br>  ACORN is an attack-dog of the Democrat Party.  Any mortgage company or bank that did not tow the Democrat Party line of "everyone deserves to own a home, regardless of credit or income" was attacked by ACORN and their army of lawyers (including a young lawyer named Barrack Obama).|`|mULVP4k4aa	Barney Frank and Cris Dodd we're the two main ones. Bush Didn't help either, but then again it wasn't his job to be regulating it. But like I said it was Frank who was suppose to be regulating it but he did a terrible job, told people it was getting better, causing people to buy stocks and then it crashed and thats part of the reason our economy is in the ditch right now.|`|AA11042510	Obama was a lawyer for ACORN which was affiliated with Fannie & Freddie...need I say more...|`|8b06acae86e7471a828ef5e2813ebb23aa	Barney Frank and the Libtards did it on Clintons watch trying to make homeowners out of those that should not own homes...|`|pAYzU2ykaa	Barney and his Butt Buddies, under the direction of Clinton.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	Franks Clinton...and Acorn supported it under the advisement of their leader OBAMA.....WOW no wonder they gave him MILLIONS during the Campaign|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Ronnie Ray Gun.
