I had my family at Chili's in Sugar Land. The food was brought to the table, shortly after the server brought the check to us. We eat out frequently, but have never had this done to us before.

20090222213215AAxO01u	Dining Out;United States;Kansas City	What are some good places to study in Kansas City?	I have a lot of trouble looking for a good place to study with free wifi and late hours. It's hard because there are bits and pieces of what I want in certain coffee shops, but they don't have everything. I've already tried the plaza library (never guaranteed to find a seat), Border's (I can't stand their coffee), and Starbucks (wifi not free).      I guess I'm looking for mainly free wifi and good coffee. Also, someplace that's not so crowded on Friday and Saturday nights I end up not finding a place to sit, and hopefully something that's open until midnight everyday.....      Any suggestions? If you have one, it doesn't have to fit everything although I really hope there's something that does! Thanks.

20081008141253AA4WHS9	Dining Out;Fast Food	What happened to the beef?	Lately, I have been going to my local fastfood burger place.  It is an national franchise.   I've noticed that the meat is getting smaller and thinner, but the prices are getting hirer! I don't mind paying the extra .10-.20 for a burger, but don't reduce the size too. Are the fast food places trying to pull one?  What's going on in your area?

20090203124412AA8Zz8t	Dining Out;United Kingdom;London	What was the London restaurant in the 1970s called where you paid what you thought the meal was worth?	There's a story on AFP about a restaurant called "Little Bay", and AFP is saying this is a "novel idea".  But it's not a new idea - that other restaurant did it first, as far as I know, and there's also an Indian restaurant in New York today which does the same thing.      Googling is useless - does anybody remember the name of this 1970s restaurant?  It was very popular.
