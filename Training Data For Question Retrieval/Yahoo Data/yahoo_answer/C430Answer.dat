vEsSIGfYaa	I have no experience with your model of string trimmer, but have owned and used many different brands over the years.<br>  <br>  Usually, the line spool has a "knob" on the bottom, which is used to bump on the ground to extend line, AND to remove the line spool from the spindle cup.  The spool is removed by pulling outward on the knob.<br>  <br>  Normally, the line spool has a small hole in the bottom of each line storage section.  You insert the end of the line into that hole, and then wind the new line in the direction indicated by an arrow EMBOSSED [sometimes difficult to see!] into the bottom [usually] flange of the spool.<br>  <br>  Usually, the bottom flange of the spool will have small slots which are temporarily used to capture and temporarily hold the line(s) until the spool has been reinserted into the spindle cup at the end of the trimmer.<br>  <br>  IF your spool uses two lines, then do the section next to the slots [the bottom of the spool] FIRST.  Then do the upper.  Be sure to securely insert/embed the line ends in the capture slots because if they "pop" out, then the line will "unspool," create a mess, and you will have to start over again.<br>  <br>  After "locking" the line in the capture slot, cut the line so that a "pigtail" of about 5 to 6 inches extends beyond the capture slot.<br>  <br>  After the line(s) is loaded and locked in the capture slots, align the spool with the spindle cup, insert the line pigtails into the holes [180 degrees opposite to each other] in the cup, and then fully insert the spool assembly into the spindle cup.<br>  <br>  The spool is captured in the cup with a spring loaded clip, so it often requires a pretty hard whack to get the spool to fully seat and lock in.<br>  <br>  Once spool is properly and securely intalled in the cup, Tug {pull, usually requires a very hard pull] on the pigtails to release them from the capture slots.<br>  <br>  IF the lines are not fully extended to reach the "trim" cutter blade on the safety shield, then once the engine is running, bump the spool on the ground to allow the line to fully extend until trimmed to the right length by the small cutter blade.

6t68dbfoaa	Check all the drains, if you have a sink or any drain that you've not used in a long time, it could mean that the water in the P-trap has dried up and is allowing stinky sewage gases to come up the pipe and out the drain.  If that is the case, run some water down each drain to make sure that the P-traps have water in them.  <br>  <br>  If this is not resolved, you may have something wrong with the ventilation of your plumbing that would go out through the roof.  If there is a vent pipe that has broken in the wall, it might be causing the gas to escape into your living space.  Good luck in determining the cause.|`|AA11136470	go up on the roof & check the sewer vent stack. it is probably plugged|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	A sewer smell is not usually a sump pump unless you have a sewer ejector pump, some times the sump will smell rotten but not as bad as sewer gas. you have to track the smell to see where it is strongest, you can have a open sewer vent or some plumbing connected without a trap or an open sewage  inspection port. old houses like that will have cast iron pipes, than cat rot to the point of collapse some times we see that a part of the pipe has busted off inside the wall, and will cause a great odor|`|vKKjqbQzaa	The p-traps are indeed worth checking -- every fixture needs to have a trap, and it needs to have water in it.  If they don't have water, perhaps your sewer stack isn't being properly vented.  Your sewer stack should have a vent above your roof (another thing to check - that the vent isn't opening into your attic!) which allows air in.  If this is being blocked, it's possible that you are creating a vacuum which is pulling the water out of the p-traps, which in turn is allowing sewer gas to enter the house.|`|bbpDgLonaa	Check all of your drains, spray bleach on the smelly spot or use drain cleaner maybe

9a96c4a44aeb8de92d94a90832dd12b4aa	I've done lots of staining on different woods. Although I have never used a wood conditioner, I always make sure the wood is lint and sawdust free just by wiping it off with a clean rag. Then I apply my stain with rag or sponge brush depending on the consistency of the stain. I let it dry thoroughly between each coat. After each  application I take pieces of a brown paper bag and rub each coat of stain. This sets the stain. After the final coat, I follow with a couple of coats of polyurethane that have been that have been rubbed with steel wool. No primer is used for staining.|`|HohvVE5Waa	If you are going to stain the trim,DO NOT prime .<br>  The purpose of a primer, is to prevent wood or any surface to be painted from absorbing paint and to block any existing stains on the surface to be painted.<br>  When "staining" a wood you want the wood to absorb the stain,the stain will enhance the grain of the wood .|`|2ef01856a98bb897637a933f17a49424aa	Are the pieces regular cut or finger joint?

What this will do is eliminate the differences and densities of the grains and promote a uniform stain color.  This is most important to do with soft woods such as pine if you are particular enough to not want that light and dark splotchy finish.  I use it on every stain application as it's instrumental in achieving a furniture grade stain finish.<br>  <br>  Once this is done you can effectively apply coats of stain until you get the colorand appearance in the wood that you want.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.us" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.us</a>

V9HNzXFuaa	Well, theres a million ways you can save money on a million different things, alot of which are common sense.  Sounds like you're doing good with the shopping stuff- use coupons, buy things when they are on sale, buy generic brands instead of name brands, don't buy more than you need, etc.  Also eat at home as much as you can, eating out costs alot more than getting your food at the grocery store.  Now with car stuff... nobody really needs a "new" car, example I'm perfectly happy with my old 95 and 97 F150s that I drive, and no more payments means saving more money.  Do whatever maintenance you can yourself instead of paying a mechanic to do it, like changing the oil, filters, spark plugs, brake pads, etc.  And try to avoid driving around alot by doing more than one thing in 1 trip to save gas.  Cell phones- Have as low of a plan as practical for how much you use it.  Use the house phone to make as many local calls as you can to avoid using up the minutes on your cell.  Electricity is a big one too- keep the heat set as low as you're comfortable with and turn it back when nobody is home, use compact flourescent light bulbs, don't leave things on when you're not using them like lights, the tv, computer, etc.  And I'm sure theres many many more things I'm just not thinkin of right now.|`|C5UUltHtaa	Money doesn't fly out of my pockets, it gets sucked out.<br>  I went to magic jack for my home phone since I have cable internet, $20 a year, works well at my location.

Plus watch out for things that come on muti packs; toilet paper may not be a good buy in the 48 roll pack vs 2 of the 24 pack. I found 12oz can of tuna costs more than 2 of the 6oz cans at one store.<br>  This may be little differences, but it all adds up.|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	Most people spend a lot more money on cleaners than they really need to.  For instance, ammonia is a great degreaser and the cheapest one out there.  Buy some microfiber cloths.  These things are fantastic for cleaning and wiping up spills.  For most cleaning jobs just dampen the cloth and wipe away dirt, dust, and grime.<br>  Buy energy efficient appliances and, of course, smart light bulbs.  Shut off electronics, lights, computers and such when not in use.  You'll see the difference in your electric bill.<br>  Lower the thermostat in winter, higher in summer.  Just a few degrees can make a big difference in heating and cooling costs.  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on getting off to a good start.

All your hard work will be for naught if you transplant too early. It's a good idea to put them outside during the day and bring them in at night for a few days before you actually set them. They need to get used to their new environment. They look hardy, but trust me they are in a delicate state for a long time after they sprout. Good luck and have fun.
p3jipoEnaa	I would try hydrogen peroxide.  I use hydrogen peroxide all the time when I need to get blood out of things.... carpet, clothing, car seat, ect.  I have a little boy who is very prone to bloody noses (as well as my husband).  I heard of peroxide before but had never used it.  One day my son got a bloody nose in the car on a brand new WHITE outfit and I thought for sure it was ruined.  When we got home, I put peroxide on it and it immediately (in front of your eyes) lifts the stain right out!!  Just open the cap, dump some onto the item with the stain (I do it over the sink) and viola... it's gone!!  I have used it ever since and have never been disappointed!  Now keep in mind, this is before trying to wash and dry the article in the washer and dryer.  You must get to the stain before it's been dried or you set the stain.  I haven't tried it on items that have already been washed and dried, so I'm not sure it would work as good in that situation.<br>  Ohh, I've also NEVER had it bleach or discolor anything I've used it on!  Good Luck!|`|bYgxGrYHaa	hydrogen peroxide|`|AA10097817	First try cold water and a clean white cloth. You might need to use hydrogen peroxide and a clean white cloth.

That business about leaving lights on to save on bills might have applied back in the '50's, when energy was cheap, but it no longer applies.  Whatever minimal amount it might shorten bulb life (if any) is far overcome in cheaper power bills.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Florescent bulbs cost more on the front end, but they do last a very long time. The home I live in has had florescent lighting for years. The electric bill for our three BR home in the hot south averages about 60 dollars a month. I use the dryer and dishwasher infrequently and that makes a difference in the bill.  It does go up slightly in the summer, but not too badly.|`|UFa1ZUQKaa	It is cheaper to turn off the lights when unneeded.  When time to replace use the florescent ones.  I wouldn't just go out and buy all new bulbs, but over time your home will become more energy efficient
wKQbNvm9aa	You need to pick a spot in the yard that gets full sun, or at least 6 hours a day.  Clear it of grass and weeds and loosen the soil to a depth of about a foot with a shovel or a tiller.  If your soil is poor or has lots of clay, dig in a lot of compost.  After all danger of frost, like mid May, you can put out seeds for beans and cucumbers.  Even before that a bit you can plant lettuce and spinach.   Later in May when the ground is good and warm you can put out tomato plants and peppers.  Whatever you plant, you want to read the seed packet or the tag that comes with the plant for information on when and how to plant.  You can find out more by googling 'how to grow tomatoes', etc.  Ehow.com has lots of basic information on things like that.   <br>  <br>  Easy things to grow:  leaf lettuce, radishes, beans, cucumbers, peppers.  A little more trouble are tomatoes.   Corn takes quite a bit of space.   Carrots need really good loose soil.   What do you like to eat?  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ivak5SlVaa	Tomatoes and green beans are good to grow.  Peppers and cucumbers do pretty well too.

Add fabric paint additive (you can find it in the same acrylic craft paint section) and if you want it thinner-just add water. You don't want it too thin as it will soak up and bleed and you won't be able to see it. Use another piece of fabric and/or cardboard till you figure it out. Old toothbrushes are great too-run your nail along it to spatter the paint.

Remember that urine itself is sterile, you may not have to worry too much about germs from her accident.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a flannel-and-plastic "wee pad" to put under the sheets before she goes back to bed, put a plastic garbage bag on the most vulnerable spot on the mattress.  If the mattress is still wet from odor treatment, put an old towel under the garbage bag so your mattress doesn't get moldy.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  You have my sympathy!|`|721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	Blot as much of the urine up with towels as possible. Spray the spot with white vinegar and water. Let it set for 5 minutes or so then blot. Place something heavy on top of some clean towels or sit on it and try to get out as much liquid as possible. I know vinegar sounds smelly but the smell goes away and vinegar is a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. Also you can add some white vinegar in the wash with your sheets.

36QJQXXyaa	most toilets have a flapper in the tank that open and closes with the lever and chain with each flush. any chemicals put in the tank will damage the seal on the flapper requiring replacement. also , sometimes the float can stick for various reasons, such as lime build up, etc.|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Tim's answer is quite good, very good directions, if you have the old style rubber flapper ball seal.  However, if you wind up with a different style seal in your tank and you don't know it till you get back from the supply house you go to to get the replacement, you're going to have to make another trip.   If you have a cell phone with a camera function or a decent digital camera, take a picture of the tank's guts after you've drained the water out.  Then take that along to the store and ask them for a replacement for the type of seal you have.  That way you've got the right part the first  time.     Been there, done that.|`|Rn7Kjwdxaa	If you can listen closely with the lid off and hear a dripping noise, the flapper isn't seating right.  More than likely it's warped with age.  Buy a new one at the hardware store or Walmart and replace it.  It's very simple so most anyone can do it.  Start by cutting off the water below the tank, there should be a cut off valve there.  Then flush the toilet to remove the water, holding the handle down until all the water has run out the drain hole.  Then proceed to remove the flapper.  It has two rubber arms out the back side that fit over the angled pieces sticking out of the tube, just slide them up and it will come off.  Then remove the chain that's attached to the flush handle.  Put on the new flapper, sliding the two arms over the angled pieces then adjust the length of the chain to where you have a little slack between the flush handle and the flapper.  If it's too tight, it will hold the flapper up too high to seat right.  If it's too loose, you won't lift the flapper up enough to properly flush.  When you have it where you want it attach the chain to the flush arm, open the water valve, let it fill up and try it out.  Listen to make sure you don't hear any drips.  If you don't, it should be fixed.|`|AA11929237	It sounds like the plug is not sealing in the bottom of the tank.  If it's an older toilet and there is a chain between the flushing handle and the plug, be sure the chain isn't tangled.  In order to stop the water from running for now, you can lift the float that normally rises as the water level rises and tie it up.

IddUYNR3aa	Garden centers have sprays that deter rabbits, woodchucks, and anything else that eats plants and wood. Liquid Fence is a good one. <br>  There are also homemade sprays. 1 quart of milk, 1 beaten egg, 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, and one tablespoon of dishwashing liquid.(Dove is recommended). You have to strain it so the egg white doesn't clog your spray bottle. Or you can use a paint brush. <br>  Sometimes you have to rotate sprays. Spray every few days or after a rain at first until the critters take your yard out of their routine. Then every couple of weeks is usually enough. You can also spray along your fence line so they don't come into the yard at all. <br>  There is also a powder that smells like dead animals and blood, and is very effective and long lasting,but dogs like to eat it, and you sure don't want to use it around your deck or you'll lose your appetite.|`|UDoqWji4aa	They sell repellent at Lawn and Garden centers.

If there is not adequate ventilation, and most foundation vents would not be, the moisture can condense which could foster mold growth and wood rot.<br>  Many mobile homes do vent underneath the floor but because they are not usually on a full foundation there is greater air exchange. <br>  It does seem like and attractive way to save on heating bill in Winter, to use what is essentially wasted heat.

If it did, the machine is re-breathing the damp air.  Another possibility would be a blocked vent hose, something is obstructing your airflow.

If it is an aniline style leather (one that absorbs moisture<br>  <a href="http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/glossary..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lttleathercare.co.uk/glossary...</a> ) it will be far more difficult to shift, (working on a ￡1500 Chanel bag at the moment). If it has a pigment coating then it may be easier.<br>  <br>  Dye transfer can be tricky to remove as the longer it is on the leather and the more agressive the dye the harder it will be to remove. You need to try Maxi Cleaner (LTT) which was specifically formulated for this problem and if this does not remove it then no leather cleaner will and you will need to call a qualified leather technician who will have stronger solvents that he will use and then recolour/refinish whatever is necessary.<br>  <br>  Using a good quality leather protector (Ultra Protect is the strongest one on the market) is imperative on a pale colour leather to help guard against this sort of problem as all clothing etc will give off a certain amount of dye as the body sweats and so this problem will only continue. Using a protector means the dye will sit on the surface and then can be cleaned off easily with a cleaner or maintenance product<br>  <br>  Baby wipes will damage the finish on the leather so shoudl not be used and hairspray will do the same. Using household products and 'hints and tips' are the biggest cause of damage to leather that technicians see - much more expensive to put right in the long run|`|R6CuDunzaa	I don't know if it will work on leather, but I've always used shampoo to get hair dye stains out of everything.

OTBYJtKkaa	Specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 lb of a substance 1 degree F. Every substance has a different specific heat. The specific heat of water is 1 Btu/lb/ deg F. the specific heat of steel is 0.116 Btu/lb/deg F. Concrete is 0.156, Copper 0.092, etc.<br>  A manufacturing company may need to buy a peice of heating equipment to heat steel before it can be machined. The steel may be stored outside in the cold at 0 deg F and need preheating before machining. The temperature desired for the machining is 70 deg F. How much heat must be added to the steel if the plant wants to machine 1000 lb/ hour?<br>  The specific heat of steel is 0.116 Btu/lb/deg F. This means that 0.116 Btu of heat energy must be added to 1 lb of steeel to raise its temperature 1 deg F.<br>  Q= Weight x Specific Heat x Temperature Difference<br>  where Q= quantity of heat needed<br>  Q= 1000lb/h x 0.116 Btu/lb/deg F x 70 deg F<br>  Q= 8120 Btu/h required to heat the steel for machining<br>  <br>  The example has some known values and a value to be found. The known information is used to the unknown value with the help of the formula. The formula can used when adding heat or removing heat and is often used in heat load calculations for sizing both heating and air conditioning equipment.|`|3uWCmNCsaa	Need more info. What kind of heater? Gas, electric, oil. How difficult of a problem do you want? One that's hard to troubleshoot or one that's expensive?

f7zLs18caa	The first number is nitrogen, which is to make plants more green.<br>  <br>  The second number is phosphorus which increases the plants blooming cycle.  It also affects how big the blooms will get, and helps with root growth as well, but this root growth is more to help sustain a flowering plant.<br>  <br>  Potassium is for root growth and disease resistance.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Phosphorus fertilizer stimulate root growth and flower production. That's why they named it bloom booster. Potassium is helps with cold and heat hardiness, nitrogen encourages shoot growth.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Potassium used in fertilizer is nothing more than potash, or common wood stove ashes minus the alkali.  Ash is necessary for the plant to form carbohydrates in the form of sugars (sap or juice).    Increase ashes and you will get an increase in plant growth. Ashes are what makes the slopes of a volcano so fertile.<br>  <br>  If you want a productive plant, you will need a large healthy, root,  stem and leaf structure to absorb and process the other chemicals. Perhaps that answers your question.<br>  <br>  You can actually aid your garden by spreading your wood stove ashes or burn barrel ashes into the garden, and then till them in.  You will notice a difference in the growth of the plants in the area with ashes, plus you won't have root weevils or root maggots attacking the tubers and the roots of the plants. <br>  <br>  For some reason root weevils and root maggots don't like wood ashes, but if they are tilled in, earth worms still thrive.

1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Unplugging things can save you money, but only if they have a transformer in them.  Generally, they only have a transformer if they have electronics   Phone chargers, powers supplies that kind of thing, when not in use still pass an idle current through the transformer, its small, but it is there. Your dryer, toaster, blender (most blenders don't have digital displays) probably don't use ANY electricity when not in use.<br>  <br>  Tell you what, If you really want to save money on your electric, replace all your incandescent light bulbs with CFL's (Compact Fluorescent Lights)  I had a house full of teens, did that, and chopped 25 percent of my usage.  Avoid the hair dryer.  Hang laundry outside on a nice day (if you can).  Go to bed early.<br>  <br>  I don't like paying my electric bill either, but unfortunately I've become rather fond of using it.  Like right now.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Don't unplug your appliances when not in use. The clock on the microwave uses very little electricity and the dryer uses none when it's off. The biggest users of electricity are the dryer,electric stove and oven,and central ac. Dry full loads and keep the thermostat at 78 or even 80 in the summer. Use a toaster oven instead of the large oven when you can.|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	As some of these other folks have mentioned, any appliance with electronics, especially the ones with an LED display, will draw electricity when setting idle.  TV's are a major idle user of electricity, keeping the picture tube warm so it comes on almost instantly when you hit the switch.  Toasters, blenders, those sorts of things that don't use electronics for displaying instructions on a screen, probaby don't use any electric when not in direct use.   We use multi-strips in our home.   We plug appliances into them, that we use occasionally, but we don't want on all the time, when we do want to use them we just flip the on switch and we're ready to go, no searching for the end of the cord and an empty recept.    Many people who do these things expect a direct and massive savings on their bill and that seldom happens.  It's a cumulative thing and may only save $2 - $5/ month or so, or maybe less, but in a year's time or 5 years, it all adds up.   And the way our energy future looks now, we'll all need all the help we can get paying for it then.|`|bFOcQeDCaa	If it's not in use unplug. That's what I've been doing to cut back on power bills. A study done last year revealed that an electronic microwave oven uses more power to run the clock in one year than it does for cooking over the same period.<br>  My microwave oven has a wind up clock and a start button. I bought it before electronic ones were available. Now I see some clever manufacturers are bringing the manual ones back again.|`|uBtQuK8haa	I'm not sure about the dryer but you will save if you unplug the microwave.  If the dryer has a display that is always lit, then yes you will save there too.|`|AA11577593	listen most dryers dont use any electricity when plugged in and off, you might save 50 cents a year by unplugging say a traditional whirlpool duet dryer, woopee! and the microwave consumes more electricity because of the clock display but by unplugging thast you might save a whopping 1 dollar a year if you are worried about that 1.50 let barack obama know, he might bail you out, other wise the most common energy suckers are computers, and old refrigerators, and old 1970's appliances.

AA11435704	The answer to this will depend on your size (height and weight), and the amount of room that you have in the bedroom. It also will depend on your sleeping style. <br>  <br>  As a rule the more room you have in the bed, the more comfortable and restful your night's sleep will be.

Overall, it would make your garden/yard more interesting for you if you have a mix of species, some of them to flower, as well as provide bushy thick growth. Camellias are evergreen, a little more expensive, but are full of spring flowers. If you need protection as well as privacy, try a pyracantha, which is thorny, and has winter berries,great for wild-life, like birds, or holly, which can be green or mixed green and cream evergreen leaves. <br>  You can also get tall shrub roses, that will give you summer colour, and these can grow through other bushes-theyre not evergreen usually though. <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck! Rob|`|AA11072058	Get a few bay laurel.  They are lovely and grow fast once they get going.<br>  AND you can use the leaves for cooking.

bKVy6Dv3aa	I have flagstone floors in my sunroom and on part of the backyard hardscape.  I've been using Behr sealer with good results.  However, if you read the labels on the various sealers you'll see they do not recomment using the product on pool surfaces because of the hydrostatic pressure that can build when those surfaces are sealed.  Also, you have to know that when you seal stone surfaces they sometimes become very slippery.  Hope this helps.

Be sure to always oil the wood before using as it helps to release the concrete after curing. <br>  <br>  Another type is using Silicone. u take what ever u want to make a mold of, spray it with spray nonstick cooking spray. cover it with the Silicone and when cured cover that with plaster of paris for support. these last a very long time and can make intricate shapes.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	Just make your same inquiry,exactly, with the Web.

83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	Aubretia is unlikely to flower the 1st year from seed, but should have a good chance of flowering next spring. It's a good long lasting perennial, so will be a great addition to your borders.<br>  Some of my favourite annuals are Californian poppies and nasturtiums, both of which are really easy and thrive in poor soils. Calendula, or english pot marigolds are also bright and easy, and can be sown before last frosts. Nigella, or love in a mist, adds some blue flower colours, again hardy. If you fancy growing some indoors, the flowering tobacco plants, or nicotiana, generally have strong fragrances, filling the air, especially in the evening, so are good near patios, windows and doors.

Even futons have arms.  Doesn't mean it isn't available just tough to find.  What you are really looking for is something small scaled and that would definitely be an ultra contemporary piece.  Check out scandinavian furniture stores or Ligne Roset or any contemporary store in your area.  Arms aren't an issue but space obviously is so a sleek minimalist design is what you actually should be looking at.|`|hY2L94iCaa	If you only need it for 'overnighters' Ikea do a good futon that acts as a sofa until you need a bed - double or single.

93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	buy perennial flowers that come up year after year. pansies are really good for this and will grow back even thicker year after year. while they are blooming deadhead and when you get little seed pods on them pop them and they will grow, they pods are full of seeds, in corners you can plant butterfly bushes, they always look really pretty and lilac bushes grow well up against houses and are very pretty.if you want a good display that will grow up onto the house you could plant wisteria that grows on just about anything and they have purple in that,and it grows in shapes like bunches of grapes, that would look nice. start off with some paper and get on-line to look up plants and draw what you have to see what you think would look nice. you can always add more as you go along, and remember gardens change as they grow, just enjoy making it look beautiful and don't worry, most plants are strong and before you know it you will have a beautiful  landscape. good luck hun.xx|`|f7zLs18caa	I don't know what your "zone" is, but I would suggest for trees a Red Japanese Maple or a Smokebush, both which have a red-deep burgundy color to them.  Put one in a "bubble" at the corner of your house for an attention grabber.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you add evergreens into your landscape so you have year round color.  Hollies are also great because they produce berries in the winter, which provide added winter color.  I like variegated hollies because they are a foliage plant, but with the added yellow in the leaf it makes them more interesting than just "a green bush".  A lot of people like to put Alberta Spruces next to their doors.  There are also low growing junipers which are nice as well.<br>  <br>  Blueberry bushes are also neat because 1) they produce blueberries and 2) their leaves turn red in the fall.  <br>  <br>  Go to a local garden center (not Home Depot or Walmart) to get your plants, they are much more informative and have better stock.<br>  <br>  One great tip that I love is going to your garden center once a month and buying something that is in bloom, that way you will have seasonal color.<br>  <br>  Plant bulbs for early spring color.  It's a little too late to be planting bulbs right now, so you can buy hyacinths and daffodils etc that are growing in pots and plant those in the ground.  The bulbs, if not eaten, will come up every year.   Aliums are another great bulb with great color, they produce a purple "globe".<br>  <br>  Look for perennials at the garden center.  They all have different bloom periods.  Make sure you buy at least 3 so your garden has some continuity to it, and so that the plantings look "substantial" and not "weak" (you don't want a lone flower, you want a bunch of flowers).<br>  <br>  Some of my favorite perennials are: <br>  phlox (low growing, blooms early spring)<br>  black eyed susans/ecinacea ("daisy"like flowers, colorful, july-august)<br>  hosta (great for shade, foliage plant with different colors)<br>  sedums (fall foliage, full sun, varieties also come in burgundy foliage)<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also look into buying shrub roses, Double Knock Out Roses are my favorites, and come in a nice bright pink color.  They are very low maintenance and bloom all season (from May through Sept).  They can take hot hot hot full sun, and are disease resistant.<br>  <br>  Hydrangeas are also great flowering shrubs.  Ask for the "Endless Summer" variety. Depending on your pH, which you can change, they are pink or blue (add garden sulfur to make blue).  Endless Summers are great because they bloom on old and new growth.  A problem with a lot of hydrangeas is that they bloom on old growth only, and sometimes this growth gets pruned off or doesn't last through the winter.  Endless Summers also bloom all season.  They need a little shade, as hot sun makes them "weep".<br>  <br>  <br>  Martha Stewart actually has some great gardening advice.  One of my favorite things about her is that she has a "cutting garden", which is made up of perennial flowers that you can cut and have as a bouquet!<br>  <br>  <br>  To make your house even more colorful, I would add window boxes and hanging baskets with annuals in them.  Annuals are great because they provide color throughout the season.  Make sure you water them though!<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helped!|`|AA10873763	Better Homes and Gardens has some really great garden plans on their website.|`|pcEJMHPMaa	I am a landscape designer and will be happy to help with ideas,a few important questions .what style of home,what color,are you looking for conifers or flowering species and I am assuming you are temperate,but how cold does it get ,and how does it get.landscaping is exterior design,and whatever you plant,will be a reflection of you.I will be looking for your edit.|`|6R9McFZhaa	there are a lot of tv show about it ,but you can go to home depot or lowes and they have a lot of books for landscapings ,if you want you buy or just see the pictures and get ideas

If it's large I would go with a black, but not a straight black, more in the line of what's called a "Matrix" which has fine accent colors, or a stone close to black granite.  See, a solid that presents definite contrast will be defining and if the kitchen is small or has no center island you you bring attention to that size. . . if there's pattern, and within that pattern you have colors that match or accent the colors in the room the features will all come together and create a balance and flow.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.us" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.us</a> or .com|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	No, don't stick to the brown colors...use the black.

2Ypig4jBaa	There are a lot of variables.<br>  Size, location, sunlight, drainage, water, electricity, heat, crops, etc.  <br>  A basic green house may be nothing more than some translucent plastic sheets protecting plants from heavy rain.  These just allow the farmer control over the amount of water that the plants may get and keep away birds.<br>  At the other extreme are those with full temperature and humidity controlled environments.  These may also have grow lights to give the optimum hours of "daylight" to the plants even in the dead of winter.<br>  For this you would need to know the average outside temp compared to the average inside temp.  As well as the insulating properties of the glass.  This would effect how much energy you will need to maintain the temperate.  How many hours of lighting, and the number of Lumens needed by the plants will give you how much energy you need for the lights.  Don't forget the workers that will need to do the maintenance of the building, water bills, etc.<br>  <br>  You may want to approach an actual greenhouse operator in your area.  Explain what you are doing and ask for a ball park estimate from them.  They will know the actual construction and operating cost for your region.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	It depends upon the size of the greenhouse, how it was made, and the use (commercial or private.)  <br>  <br>  If it has a conventional design with glass all around and a peak in the center of the roof (or more modern with half hoops and plastic stretched over it with little thermal mass inside,) then it will need to be heated.  The amount of heat will depend upon the environment, the orientation and the latitude.  The size of the greenhouse and the optimal temperature as well as how strictly this temperature and humidity must be maintained are other considerations.  <br>  <br>  A solar greenhouse will have been designed to use little or no backup heat other than the sunlight it normally receives.  A typical design would include an insulated northern wall with a thermal mass inside of the insulation that would give off heat at night.  The northern ceiling might be slightly off verticle to reflect the most light into the interior.  Glazing would be only on the southern roof side that would be pitched according to the latitude to maximize the sun's heating in January and February.  Orientation would be glass to the south.  The "upkeep" for this solar greenhouse would be limited to structural repairs and this would depend upon the weathering effects of wind, rain, and sun.  <br>  <br>  Upkeep for the plants would be a separate issue after the environment is sufficiently stable.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	One of the most expensive considerations for a greenhouse, if it is used during cold months, is the heating bill.

AKrTZqbKaa	What size wire is it?  They sell a repair splicing kit at the big box stores or electrical outlet. These are NEC approved and are great for your needs. They are about $14.00 a piece, still a lot cheaper than calling some one or replacing the whole line. I have only used ones for #14-2 or 12-2 wire. I think you will have to go to an electrical outlet if they don't have them at the Big Box stores. You will need a heat gun to shrink the tubing after it's connected. These are safe and become water proof. If some of the wire has to be replaced you will need two of them. Repaired about 60 wires this way. It sounds like it wasn't in conduit as this would have protected the wire. Make sure you use 12-2 or 14-2 UF (underground feed) rated wire. Make sure the breaker is off it it was reset after the cutting.|`|IW3jmnKbaa	All electrical splices, or connections MUST be in an approved box, with cover. Not quite sure what bill is talking about, the NEC doesn't "approve" or recommend "splice kits". They specify "approved" methods of splicing, not products.

WtqsWctjaa	The laminate flooring is not a good choice for stairs.  I would rather have an indoor/outdoor kind of carpet on stairs. The look of the stairs may be important, finishing them may be a bit tricky without knowing the kind of wood it is.  Pine...finishes nice, but it is soft and will mar easily.  Oak is a very hard wood but staining and finishing is trickyfor a good look.  If you get the look of wood that you want, you might try adding a very small amount of fine sand to a gallon of varethane to give it a roughness and not be slippery while showing the wood.|`|a6vU1nT7aa	a good vinyl or vinyl faux wood product may be your best bet. even some of it comes in plank styles that really lends the look of wood, plus has the necessary traction to avoid your dogs or you from skidding down it. Vinyl as well as other products like ceramic have a good slip differential because there are raised texture in them. Stay away from products like Pergo. The issue with them besides being slippery is that they are simply laminated paper that has a top coat, so if they get scratched or worn over time you will see the mdf board underneath. An alternative to this would be to cover your stairs in any material you want, hard wood, vinyl ... whatever really and buy the individual carpet treads that have a special non skid backing. These are usually made with commercial grade carpeting, and because they have a rubberized back, any accidents that happen on the stairs will not soak through onto what's below. It's a minimal cost to save your flooring. They're also washable and available in many colors.

b207128f6213ea5411a368f91e6bb3d1aa	In an empty microwave the energy can induce voltages and cause a feedback. There's a couple of things in there known as Gunn diodes and you can break them. DON'T take off the cover. Either get down to the electrical shop and buy a new one or get it repaired by a certified technician. The former may be the cheaper option.|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	It could be the fuse.  If it is not an easy job to replace the fuse I would think about buying a new one.  I got a basic one from Sainsburys for under ￡30 which works well.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Shouldn't matter if the microwave was empty- sounds like it just went out on you.  Make sure your switch (GFI) is okay- press RESET.|`|UFa1ZUQKaa	Probably a fuse.  It could be a thermal fuse or the standard glass rod type fuse.  The standard fuse can be replaced at Radio Shack for a couple of bucks.  A thermal fuse is a small black button looking device that you will need to go to parts house for.They cost 10-15 bucks|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Yes, theres a couple of thermal fuses inside the unit.  You blew one, they are not self resetting so it needs to be replaced.  Take the cover off, its probably up on top of the oven chamber.|`|QLlJf7waaa	please listen to nuckle wotsit you women havent got a clue

FWOdlpx8aa	The 2 air vents are for the gas fire so you don't get carbon monoxide building up in the room.  Only block these up AFTER  you have removed the gas fire.<br>  <br>  A little ventilation is however beneficial. You can get covers for vents with a slider that allow them to be closed during cold weather but opened when its warmer|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	the old gas fireplace inserts, are alwasy known to leak air, you can track the points of air penetration by using a smoke test which can be done with anything that will create smoke cositently even a cigar or the like, just go around the opening and vents to see if the smoke is pushed or sucked out, this will help determine the casues of the leak. If I owned the house I would remove the fireplace and seal off the area. But if you want to keep it you can tighten the area up you will have to remove the fireplace and find all sources of the leak seal them with a fire proof material (thermal insulation- rotten cotton) and you will have a tighter house
AA10614558	Hello Michael: <br>  <br>  Yes, you can use a plastic putty knife or a cooking spatula dipped in clear cold water.

You may have to do this several times as sometimes they will come back to the same area to rebuild their nests.<br>  You can use your fingers or a putty knife to spread the caulk around.|`|j6yiw1Hmaa	You would want to kill the bees/wasps first, then using a caulking gun insert the tip of the caulk cartridge into the hole and fill. Using the tip of you wet finger smooth it over.

AA11431926	I love your colors!  Pick a nice wall color.  (I would stick with a lighter color).  Dark paint is hard to cover.  Maybe a pretty pink or purple.  Find a bedspread to compliment your walls.  Check out WalMart, Target and TJ Maxx for bedding.  Shop Thrift Stores for great bargains.  You can do wonders with a can of spray paint.  Most of all have fun!  It is so much fun to "decorate on a shoestring budget".  Hunting for items is half the fun and the cheaper the better as far as I am concerned.|`|l9xnybUMaa	Congratulations on your new bed and room recdecoration!  Its thoughtful of you to think of conserving money, so I would use this to your advantage.  Collect a quick group of images from cataqlogues that show the replacement costs for window treatments, bedding, paint and or wallpaper, art posters, light fixtures, and closet systems.  Then ask your parents to give you a budget to work with on approval.  With a budget you can plan and save costs and have peace of mind. Start with a favorte poster for inspiration, and dress the new bed beautifully.  Celebrate GF!|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	First of all, the economy is going doing because people are afraid to spend money. So, let your mother know that unless we all start trusting ourselves, no one will ever get out of this crisis. The economy will never get better if we stop giving it what it needs. You die when you don't eat for a REALLY LONG period of time, right? Well, same goes for the economy. Don't let people scare you into not spending. Just do it wisely. There are many ways to save on everything. <br>  <br>  Now, to answer your question: you can't redecorate much if you're not spending money. Take what you already have an switch it around. That's about all you can do without spending money. Figure out what YOU like and would not mind living around for a while and then do that. If you're afraid of the money, sell what you don't need or want anymore and with that money, but what you need to redecorate.

IZswST9Laa	Your low on freon, have it recharged you should be fine|`|OTBYJtKkaa	It sounds like you actually have a heat pump and are operating it it the heat mode. A heat pump extracts heat from the air outside and redirects it indoors by carrying it in the refrigerant. The refrigerant is caused to absorb that heat by making it colder than the heat source, in this case the outdoor air. In order for the refrigerant to be colder than the air, it is often colder than the freezing point of water. As the system operates the surfaces of the outdoor coil will absorbing heat from the air  and transferring it to the refrigerant and causing it to boil from a liquid to a gas. A lot of heat can be moved during that change of state process. As heat is being sucked out of the air, moisture in the air will freeze on the coil. As the system continues to operate, ice continues to build up on the coil. When the unit satisfies and stops running, the ice will sometimes melt away, but it often doesn't have time to melt entirely and can build up on the coil and interfere with its ability to absorb heat. The heat pump's control board will place the unit into a defrost mode every 30, 60 or 90 minutes. The defrost process has the path of the refrigerant changed and melting the ice from the coil with heat from the gas. After an appropriate time to defrost, the system goes back into operation moving heat from outdoors to indoors.<br>  If your system is forming ice on the outdoor unit while being operated in the cooling mode, there is something else entirely going on.

4I6UMGh6aa	I have germinated seeds from several types of guavas.  The seeds germinate easily if sown in potting soil and kept warm.  The germination takes longer than you might think, 4-6 weeks.  After the seedlings get large enough to handle, transplant them to larger pots.  <br>       See the link below for more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/guava.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morto...</a>|`|lb1pPyTcaa	I have had some guava eating expericences.. they are really good tasting.. but idk wat pot to plant it in, but you need to plant it in a really hot tempature area, or it wont grow
3hu7tgS8aa	for one or two items, it is simply a matter of having it boxed at your local UPS or FEDEX mailing centers.    If you are shipping a large number, contact your local box manufacturer to order boxes made for the size chair you are trying to ship.
adRoJzKNaa	no you can not fill it your self but your local fire department might but if they cant there are company's that they will send it out to. if your valve of your fire extinguisher is plastic it can be refilled but it is very expensive. if the valve is metal it will be cheaper to refill. if you fire extinguisher is co2,d, or k that is very expensive to refill. i DO not suggest to just throw away fire extinguishers be cause they can explode and spread the ammonia based powder every where. and its a waste. i know this because im certified to service and refill fire extinguishers. e-mail me if you have any more questions.|`|944iJNAdaa	I don't think you can, but there are companies in the business that will.  There's some kind of certification involved.  I used to get this done, years ago, but fire extinguishers are so cheap to buy now (I buy mine at Costco) that it's cheaper to buy a new one than to get one refilled.  I know that doesn't seem right, but that's the way it is.|`|UNUJNgHxaa	You cannot refill a fire extinguisher. But you can call your local fire department and ask them were to have it filled. They will be more than happy to help you. I hope this helps and good luck to you. Oh and remember there are some fire extinguishers that are NOT refillable.
