20070320040233AAiyhqV	Pets;Dogs	Curious about beef bones -?	I DO NOT  and WILL NOT give my dogs any bones, but I am curious.  I have read several things on here and some people say that beef bones are okay to give your dog as long as they are not cooked.  EXAMPLE" T-Bone from a steak.  What's the difference between cooked or raw?  Are cooked bones softer?      Like I said, I DO NOT and WILL NOT give my dogs any bones....rawhides included.  This question is strictly for personal knowledge.
20070309062026AAVtPxj	Pets;Other - Pets	Single Hamster with Babies???	My husband and I woke up one morning to both of our cats chasing something around our apartment in a frenzy. What they were chasing was a fat dwarf hamster, which I still have no idea how the thing got into our apartment (we live in a complex with 27 other apartments, so Im thinking one got lose from somewhere). I felt bad for the little guy, and I didnt want my husband to feed "him" to one of our snakes, so I bought a hamster cage and food and decided to keep "him" as a pet.      Things went great for about 2 weeks. The hamster is very friendly, and I practically held "him" all day every day. I guess I should mention that I have no experience at all with hamsters, as I have never had one before.      I woke up this morning and heard squeeking noises from the hamster cage. When I looked into the cage, all I saw was the hamster but still heard the noises. When I checked the last time the bedding in the bottom of the cage was moving!! My hamster had babies, and I have no idea what to do!!!

I never really thought about it before, but my dog knows commands like -      Knock it off/can it/don't make me have to kill you - meaning stop what you're doing right now    chill/Chill out/chillax - some people use "settle" but my dog will certainly chillax when told lol.   Have some wa wa - get a drink lol.   Haul a$$ - this one is actually from the Popeye movie with Robin Williams (those that have seen it will know what I'm talking about).  Haul a$$, Haul a$$!!! and it means, get out of my way.      What sort of funny things does your dog know?

20090309081400AAVhdIl	Pets;Dogs	Re-homing an Akita puppy?	My husband HAD HAD HAD to get an Akita I was against it as I'm allergic to the fur but I gave in because he's never had a dog that he wanted before. I warned him it was going to be a lot of work and so on... but again I was ignored.       So now we got puppy off of someone else when she was 4 months old. But after having her 4 months she's become very very aggressive. She's been nipping a lot and every time I go out she rips up her pee pad, cries, and goes all over the floor.       Walking her is a nightmare! She pulls, jumps, nips, and freaks out if there's anything new on the walkway where I take her. Things is she's getting so big I can barely handle her on walks anymore.       It's getting to the point where her behaviour is so bad I don't know if I can handle her anymore. I was hoping my husband would grow up and take responsibility and HELP me but it hasn't happened leaving me with a dog that I'm terrified is going to attack me because I said no.       So should I go about re-homing her or keep trying?

20090309062933AA0gsZI	Pets;Other - Pets	Is there an Animal Shelter in Sydney that I can go for my Work Experience?	Today I was watching the TV and I saw an ad urging people to not dump their puppies in pounds, and for others to adopt them before they are put down.  I was really upset by this, especially because all of the animals they filmed were small puppies. This may well be an advertising stunt, but I've heard - more than once - that puppies (small, white, fluffy puppies) are most commonly dumped. I'm really desperate to help these animals, but I'd rather not work at a pound.  That really destroys the whole point, and it would be so, so depressing.       Can anyone please get me some informations to help me find a way to do my work experience at an animal (or cat, or dog etc..) shelter?      Thank you.

20090227145346AA2j6J0	Pets;Cats	Cat Ear Infection. What to do?	Hi everyone. I have a Himalayan Cream Point cat. It is a male, 12 years and a half old, and is quite healthy overall. 2 Days ago, he seems to have contracted what looks like an ear infection. Specifically, his right ear has become swollen. The swellness is basically on the inner upper part of the ear, and looks and feels "puffy" (sort of like it got inflated). There is also a little bit of discolouration on the inside, a little reddish. His ear also become slightly bent. I am wondering whether anyone experienced this with their cat, and perhaps can give me some help in determining what it might be. I will be taking him to the vet on Monday, but until then, I would like to know if it is serious in any way. My cat is an indoor cat who never goes outside.

I have always wanted a chinese crested, but I already have a cat with many medical problems, and when I go to school, I would never be able to afford to take the best care of a chinese crested, so I am waiting until I have a house, done with school, good job, ect.      I am staying in my mom's house during school. I'll live in the basement which is pretty large. I'll have a little kitchen area, bedroom, living room, and bathroom.   we also have a pretty large fenced yard, and my family has a german sheperd mix we rescued 5 years ago.      so I have narrowed it down to a chihuahua and a papillion. I have been doing research out my butt, and I was looking for stories from people that actually own a papillon or have been around them alot.   I only have at work.      I think a chihuahua would be great, because they are a bit more calm, and wouldnt need as long of walks everyday and can cuddle on ym lap easier when I do homework. =P   but I have always been in love with papillons, I am a sucker for thier soft fur, gorgeous ears, and strong face.      which would be best?   they wouldnt be alone that often. only during the day for the few hours I am at school.   and I am not starting school until next spetember.

We made the mistake of letting him sleep in our bed with us. Now it's the 4th night and he's in his crate and he won't stop whining. I should just let him cry until he goes to sleep and ignore it right?       I want to take him out when he's whining but i know he doesn't have to go potty.      I also heard that putting a warm hot water bottle and a ticking clock helps them sleep at night? What about a blanket? Or should he just sleep on the floor of the plastic crate?

I have a four month old Rottwiele (Rocky)..and as my boyfriend and I were rubbing his tummy yesterday we noticed a red spot with a ring around it, with a black speck in the center. My boyfriend seems to think it is a tick. We tried to get whatever it was out with tweezers but it wouldn't come out at all. We could get ahold of the black speck and pull but it just wouldn't budge. I was wondering if anyone knew what this could possibly be? Could this really be a tick? I already set up an appointment with the vet for 330 this after noon (only thing they had open)...but just trying to get some insight before! Thanks in advance.

20090309091150AAYWteY	Pets;Cats	Two cats, one small room, what do i do?!?	Okay, there's a couple of issues here.      My boyfriends mother lives across the street from us.  Her brother used to live in that house with her.  He had 2 beautiful cats, and when her brother passed away she started taking care of his cats.      Here's the problem:      The cats are confined to one very small bedroom, they've always lived in there since they were kittens ( i think that this is so cruel).  They tear things up.  They're pretty much the fattest cats i've ever seen in my life.  One of them is an absolute sweetheart (Shadow), and the other is very skittish and mean (Tuffy).  She will not let these cats out of that room because I rescued a declawed cat named Gizmo, she's afraid they'll hurt him.  I feel terrible that these cats are not allowed out of this room.  Another reason she doesn't want to let them out to roam the house is because they're poop smells. She changes their food often, and I tell her that changing their food too much will cause that smell and they may even get sick.      She been feeding all of the cats IAMS for awhile now.  I am trying to get her to switch over to completely wet food because I know that feeding all dry is not healthy.  She says that Gizmo refuses to eat wet food.  When she buys wet food she either gets fancy feast or friskies (which I told her isnt that healthy for them either).  I'm going to suggest for her to switch them to wellness.      Please dont tell me that I should mind my own business, this woman is practically my mother.   I do not want to bring Shadow and Tuffy to a shelter because of the overpopulation problem that we already have.  I cannot take them because I already have quite a few cats in my house.  Those cats are about 5 years old and I know I'd have a problem finding someone to adopt them.  She even has told me that she wants to get rid of them but she doesn't have any friends who will take them.  And I don't have any friend that will take them either.  The cats are brothers and it would probably be a bad idea to separate them since they've been together for 5 years now.      What should I do?  Or what should I advise her to do?

20090309093441AANpF1e	Pets;Dogs	Questions to ask myself before getting a second dog?	I am the happy owner of a 2 y/o male cocker spaniel. Duncan is a big boy now, he's had his professional training, we got all the little irritants under control, we got out exercise routine down and I couldn't be happier with him.       This weekend I came across a family with a 8 month old cocker, identical to my mine. They're very   people. The place is a dump, both adults are out of work, the kids are left on their own and .....the dog is unwanted. They don't even have a bowl for the poor little thing, they have an opened bag of dog food on the floor, that's the extent of their care. They say they can't deal with him anymore cause he pees everywhere when they talk to him. (so much ignorance)      My heart is crushed, I can't get him out of my head. Getting another dog is a huge responsibility. In my case money is not an issue but I am a woman living alone and cockers are physically demanding.       So to all of you that have made the decision to go from 1 dog to 2...how was the transition? Tell me about your experience, I'd love to hear your advice.       Thanks in advance.

20090309102451AA3BxQ2	Pets;Dogs	What would you have done?	I recently heard this story and Wonder what some on the Y!A answerers would have suggested or told this woman, I know the outcome of the story, but will withhold it for now:   A reputable breeder has a bueatiful ***** (call name) Kispy, who is doing excellently in shows. She decides to breed Kispy to the best male she can find. She finds a very well-bred stud and breeds Kispy at the age of three. The ***** births four beautiful puppies with no problem and everything seems to be going perfectly. As soon as the two pet-quality pups have found homes(after ofcourse 8 weeks) and one of the show  quality pups has found a home, Kispy returns to the show ring. She shows for two more years, then at five is bred again. At the same time Kispy is bred, her show-quality puppy that the breeder kept is also being bred(at age two,for she excelled beautifully in the ring). Both Kispy, and her puppy Ryla birth their pups with no problems. Kispy has five puppies, Ryla has four. Ryla is a wonderful mother, who pays perfect attention to her pups, however Kispy does not. She abandons her pups and attempts to hurt them when she sees them. She is immediately brought to the vet, where after many tests it is found that she has a rare neurological disease which could be inherited(don't know the name) which causes aggression. She is now aggressive to everyone, and within six months, she is dead. Ryla adopted her mothers puppies and they grew beautifully. Ryla returned to the show ring, but the breeder was faced with a problem:   If the disease was inherited, was it fair to breed the dogs descended from Kispy? Should Ryla be spayed and retired, and should all the pups be spayed given or sold to pet-homes? The breeder decides to retire Ryla and spay her. Of the nine pups, one female is show quality, the rest are spayed and sold to pet homes where the owners are informed of the possibility of a neurological disease. The female pup, Lessen excells in the shows as her mother and grandmother did, when she is two and Ryla is four, the breeder gets a call from one of Ryla's pet-quality littermates, he has the neurological disease. The breeder explains to the owner and pays the vet bills. Lessen continues to show and does very much better than he mother and grandmother did. When she is three and Ryla five, Ryla becomes sick and aggressive, she too dies of the disease that claims her mother, the breeder contacts the other two of Ryla's littermates, neither ever get the disease. Lessen is three years old a doing very well in the ring. What should the breeder do, retire her best show pup because their is a less than fifty percent chance that she may have the disease? (dogs cannot "carry" this disease, they inherit of they don't, it's a gamble, if a ***** has it, the pup has a fifty percent chance of having it too)

The shelter we got her from says they had her vet checked & she doesn't seem to have any problems. They suggested she might be nervous. I don't think that's it b/c she loves to play with the other dogs, cuddle in her bed & she runs to greet us when we come home. We've had her a month.

20090309112851AAke9aD	Pets;Dogs	Our dog has a bite record.  What should we do?	We own a 4-year-old male Shiba Inu, and we've had him since he was a puppy.  He's been through obedience training and is actually a very good dog; our household consists of four children under the age of 10 in addition to a second dog and a cat, and with us, of course, he's very sweet, patient and affectionate.       In general he is detached and cautious around strangers, a behavior that has never worried us because it's presumably characteristic of the breed. He's never shown aggression, though, at least in terms of growling or snarling or anything along those lines.  He just hangs back and warms up slowly.  He generally does get to the point where he introduces himself, though, so human aggression really hasn't been a serious point of concern.       Until now.  We've now had THREE bite incidents with him involving kids running through our backyard.  We've posted signs, made rules about having friends over when the dogs are out, etc;, but though the kids try to obey and we try to be vigilant about it, yesterday he was out when a neighbor boy came over to seek one of my sons, and when the kid ran away Griffin got him on the ankle.       The family has elected not to contact Animal Control this time, but we are at a loss.  Previously we've self-reported to Animal Control when this happened (and did this time too), and each time they've assured us that a dog chasing something moving in its own territory is not technically 'aggression'... He is not reacting out of fear; he's giving into his prey drive.  They won't move forward on any action without a report by the bitten party, which means, I guess, that for the moment our dog gets a pass.        However, we obviously cannot deny that this a very real concern, and that we're facing some serious liability if this keeps happening.  We've made rules, done the muzzle thing, but with four small children in the house and children involved in the case, there's only so much vigilance we can depend upon.  We've tried training, and worked with him with the kids to encourage him to view the neighbors as 'part of the pack', but clearly this hasn't had the intended effect.       I don't know what to do.  A rescue would not be able to adopt him out, and I would obviously not want to see him put down unless there really was no other possible alternative.  Does anyone have any ideas?

20090309092606AAddJy8	Pets;Dogs	Should I adopt a third dog? I really want to, but my husband isn't as excited about the idea.?	We have two dogs already.  A 4 year old male golden retriever and a 2 year old female poodle mix.  Our golden and my husband are best friends and do everything together and our poodle mix is a total mommy's girl and can be found at my side all the time.  I think the more the merrier when it comes to pets, but my husband is comfortable with what we have and doesn't want to add to the family.  He doesn't want either of our dogs to feel less loved and doesn't think we could bring three dogs in the car with us or camping with us.  What should I do?  I don't want my husband to resent a new family member.  Is there something wrong with me for wanting more and not being satisfied with the two we have?

I thought that cats were supposed to bury their 'business', but these bloody cats do it all over my lawn.  I have two children (toddlers) and can't let them go out to play because I dont want them falling in cat poo.       Is there anything I can do or purchase to get rid of the cats from coming in my garden?  I have tried cat pepper but it doesn't work.        Please dont suggest poison or shooting them, as believe me, if this was legal, I would have done it by now! lol      Thank you xxx

20090309095221AAkg65m	Pets;Cats	Kitten cries when I pick him up?	My now 11 month old kitten, Timmy, hasn't been himself all day. Both himself and his brother have been very subdued from this morning. Timmy cries when I pick him up, which is very odd since he is an extremely loving cat towards me and has never done it before. He's eating, drinking, and I assume going to the toilet. He also is very jumpy.    I was stroking him earlier, and he was purring away and then meowed when I stopped (this is very normal for him as he likes attention!) then I picked him up and he cried then started purring again.   He also runs away from us all and cowers down.      Since it has only been a day, am I worrying too much? Should I wait another day or so and then take him to the vets?

20090309100819AA9raxu	Pets;Dogs	My dog wont eat her food?	My dog, she's about 6, won't eat her food anymore. We've tried every different brand, mixing, adding a little bit of water, everything. We've even made her some meals, which she will eat on occasion.      We recently got a puppy and both dogs do well free feeding. We had gotten her to eat for a couple weeks with the puppy.. she was eating her adult food. But the past week, we've caught her eating the puppy food and just ignoring her own food.        I know it's not healthy for her to be eating puppy food, but I don't want her to starve. She doesn't ever really bed for food when I eat either.      Any suggestions?         She's currently a healthy weight, but she needs to start eating.

20090309101424AAuZBCq	Pets;Fish	Why cant i get my aquarium water to be crystal clear? very frustrating!?	I have a 75 gallon aquarium that has been set up since mid december.  I upgraded my old 20 gallon tank.  So i used some of the gravel and cycled the old filter in my new tank for a few weeks to help get it "cycled".  I have 2 discus (which i plan to add more as soon as i can get the water clear), 1 very large bristle nose pleco, 3 clown loaches, and about 10 platys (sp?).  I get the water tested frequently as well as doing home tests.  All parameters are normal (no ammonia, (low to none) nitrates, no nitrites, alkalinity is around 80ppm, pH is about 6.8.  Temp is about 86.  All fish have been acting normal, no lethargy, all eating normal, no deaths.  Lighting is on about 8 hours a day.  Water changes are done about 20% weekly. There is no overgrowth of algea, so i am just about positive that is not the problem. My problem is the water is cloudy (whitish cloudy) and no matter what i do it never seems to get better.  I have tried reducing the amount of time the lights are on, i have left more time between water changes, i have added Kent Proclear (as advised by my aquarium store), i have purchased polishing pads specific to my filter (Fluval 4050).  Nothing seems to help.  I have asked my aquarium store owner, even spoke to filter manufacturer multiple times.  And still nothing.  Any advice you can offer me would be greatly appreciated.  As this is my last resort.  I dont know what else i can do.  I hope ive included all necessary info.  Hope its not too drawn out and boring.

He has been groomed and has the "puppy cut" and I even told the groomer that he has bad dry skin.  After he was groomed he still has the dry skin.  I only bath him once a month to a little over a month and he is washed with oatmeal shampoo for dogs...I have not changed his food..I have given him Purina Puppy Chow ever since I got him.  He stays inside and only goes outside to potty.  I asked the vet about it and he said add oil to his food or rub him with baby oil...well the baby oil is to messy and he will lick it off of him.  I was also told to put a teaspoon to a half of teaspoon of bacon greece in his food.  I am not sure what to do, because I don't want him to get sick, with the oil thing.  But I don't want him to be miserable and itchy with the dry skin!  What are my other options?

I already asked this once but got mixed answers and a little confused so I'm asking again, with more details.      This is going to be long but bear with me, Im trying to make the BEST possible decision for us and a new pup.      -We want a larger breed dog that will be able to play with our other dog who is about 80 lbs.   -It will be December before we get whichever we decide.   -we have one dog, a German shepard husky mix, 3 years old and neutered. acts just like a puppy.   -carpet and tile floors (don't know if that does effect hip problems or causes them but making it known, there is tile)   -7 acres for them to roam, we still have to fence it all in, but a portion is already enclosed   -We live in Arkansas so the climate is a toss up, you never really know. It can be 70 Monday 40 Tuesday and storming and 80 the next.   -We are home a lot so he/ she will have plenty of attention. (Saturday nights we will be gone from about 5 to 12 ish every night (boyfriend races))   -They will get spayed or neutered so gender isn't a big deal   -We don't want a guard dog, just a watch dog that will bark to let us know if someone is there but it won't go any farther than a bark.   -They'll have regular vet care and be raised around dogs, people and children because we plan on having kids someday.   -We know all dogs shed, but we want one that won't be an extreme shedder (we are going to vacuum everyday)   -He/she will be inside/outside moreso inside than out but outside enough to get plenty of exercise.      I know I'm probably driving people crazy asking these questions but I seriously want to make the best possible decision when it comes to bringing home a new pup.      Thank you all

20090309135837AA29soa	Pets;Dogs	I have a Corgi/Collie Cross who sheds...?	I have a 10 month of Corgi/Border Collie cross who has the thickest coat you have ever seen! She is a short hair, but her coat is very coarse. Because of the thickness of her hair she gets very hot both in th house and outside especially in the Texas heat. Right now she is shedding what I guess is her winter coat and she is having to stay outside full time because of all the hair. I called a groomer and the reccomended clipping her hair or shaving her instead of just brushing to keep her cooler. I have always heard that you shouldn't clip their hair, because it grows back wrong. Is this true? What should I do?
20090309151157AAO5qWR	Pets;Fish	I need help with air stones.?	I have a Hagen Optima air pump and its been the best $35 that I've spent in a while its very quiet and it has an electronic adjustment nob on the pump that slows down the pump instead if just restricting the air flow. Any way the pump is very quiet but my air stones are not as quiet. The fizzing from the bubbles is loud and annoying I tried to cover the air stones up with gravel and that worked but the bubbles were too big I would like to keep the bubbles a nice small size. I have also moved the air stones away from glass and that didn't do any thing so. What kind of air stone should I get that doesn't make that fizzing sound as loud. Right now I just have some basic air cylinder shaped air stones but whats better than that.

20090309150236AApVlPq	Pets;Dogs	Plz help me :( I lost my best friend?	I'm 15 years old and I am not taking putting my dog to sleep that well I can't stop crying! Well yesterday she fell and broke her arm badly so that it wasn't even connected (the bone was completely off and dangling). We brought her to the vet today and they said we had 3 options. 1. amputation 2. surgery that probably wouldn't work and bring more pain to her 3. put her to sleep. The vet said putting her to sleep would be the best choice, and so did other people knowing that she was a very young puppy. I didn't know about anything until my parents picked me up from school telling me the bad news. We decided to put her to sleep, I witnessed it because I wanted to be there to comfort her. Now she's gone there is no turning back. For some reason I can't stop blaming myself :( I regret putting her down but I'm just glad it ended her pain. I can't stop looking at her things and pictures I have of her. Please give me any advice you can :(

20090309145854AAIWx4X	Pets;Dogs	Stinky Beagle! What can I do?	This is a little gross but I'm at a loss.....      For the past 2 weeks or so my Beagle's anal glands have been draining at random times and I cant get rid of the smell.   I had them drained at a groomer about a week ago and she said his anal glands are not infected and he wasn't impacted. She said this can be done about once a month and I don't want to do it myself. yuck :)      After his glands drain I take him in the bathroom and wash him and then spray Apple Cider Vinegar around his bum area to get rid of the smell (groomers tip). This only works for about an hour, then I have to wash him again!   We have 2 other Beagles and they run a play most of the day in addition to a few long walks so he gets enough exercise. His poos are also firm, I thought that was supposed to drain them...?      I'm really at a loss, he is an indoor family member so I wont even consider leaving him outside so don't bother posting that idea.      Is their anything I should feed him to help this problem?   Is their a good/sanitary shampoo you can recommend?The groomer said there's really nothing our Vet can do because his anal glands weren't infected.... is that true?      Thanks in advance.

20090309135916AAetlVq	Pets;Rodents	How can I get my guinea pig to drink water from bottle?	My guinea pigs teeth recently broke from not being cared for enough at the pet shop so I had to give him water with a syringe because he couldnt drink from the bottle... well he could but he wouldnt maybe it hurt or something and I didnt want him to get more ill... when his teeth grew back slightly I stopped with the syringe and just left him with the bottle but again... he wouldnt drink from it. So I added some 100% pure cranberry juice to water... and made it very watery, just so it had a little taste of fruit he'd drink about half a bottle of that... so I know he can drink from the bottle happily, but now i've changed it back to plain water he wont drink it again.   I know it's probably my fault for treating him like a spoilt baby and giving him juice.. hand feeding him etc but I just wanted him to drink and now he wont when its plain... what could I do to encourage him to drink?   Or should I just leave him and when he's really thirsty he'll drink water.

20090309143345AAoj8aH	Pets;Rodents	I found a field mouse, i need some advice?	my cat caught a field mouse last night, i managed to get it away from her before she killed it. i put him in a box and he was breathing really heavy and his eyes were wide open, i think he was in shock. I left him alone for a few hours and when I went back to it, he was up and about and breathing normally. i was about to let it back outside when I noticed he had his eyes shut completely, i though he might be tired and i was worried about letting him out if he couldn't see. A few hours later I went back to him ( i thought he would be better after a nap) but his eyes were still closed, i tried gently opening them with warm water and they opened a little but he closed them again soon after. He might be a baby, that would explain why his eyes won't open, i figured that they were open when I found him because of shock, but anyways, now I don't know what to do with him. He won't open them, if he's a baby and I keep him until his eyes are open then let him outside, he won;'t know how to take care of himself because he would have already been dependent on humans for too long, if i let him out now he won't know how to take of himself or be able to see where he is going and this is assuming he even is a baby.      I am going to call the vet in the morning to get advice but i just wanted some advice for now. Should i keep him as a pet? How long does it take before baby field mice open their eyes? I completely have no idea what to do for him. I''m not sure if its ok to keep it as a pet      What about diseases, could he have any? I wash my hands every time after touching him, so if he does have any, i wont catch anything as longs as I make sure that i was my hands, right?      PLease answer ALL my questions. i'm really worried about him      thanks so much

Good or bad idea to get rid of the old ones?  Should I continue with the moving process or is it not necessary?

20090309120816AAnhQJg	Pets;Dogs	Leash walking going down hill....?	So I have been doin gleash work with my dogs on how to walk on the leash properly. My 4 month old (who i've had for 2 weeks) was doin ggreat along with my 3 year old (I've only started training her in August) . I was feeling VERY good on their training because they would just walk by myside and I would simply have to correct them once and it would be over.       Today though, it fustrated me and broke my heart, because we had been doing so well then I take my 4/month out and she is pulling and wont pay attention to me AT ALL!    This is sort of the case with the 3/year because when I took her out she was pullingm but once I corrected her 1000 times, she started to walk good again.      I was just wondering, is there anything that could be triggering this or is it just an off day? Also, how can I not get so fustrated when they do this, any calming techniques?

She is about 3 now and yesterday at the park she was on a leash and a little maltese was not.  The other dog was not showing any signs of a problem and my dog was wagging her tail as she smelled the other dog. the other dog was just smelling the grass and then all of a sudden my dog attacked, she picked her up and shook her like she was trying to kill her. luckily we pulled her off and the maltese was ok.  She was bleeding but after taking her  to the vet she is ok, no stitches needed.  I am not sure what to do since sadie has never shown any aggression before.

I have now found a lovely mare (with lovely very laid back owners) who needs excersizing, I've ridden her twice, she is forward but safe and I loved it, but today I just bottled it, without even getting on her and am now terrified but can't explain why... I'm so frustrated at myself and would appreciate some tips on building that confidence.
20090309135505AAVycdF	Pets;Fish	My hermit crabs smell and I want them to GO AWAY. What do I do?	I bought these three hermit crabs over a year and a half ago, in the naive manner that all children do. In my past experience, hermit crabs have died within a couple months, and it's not like I wanted *that* to happen, I just never realized what the long term effects are of managing them.      Anyway, I've grown more and more tired of feeding them and giving them water, and their cage is impossible to clean because it is a metal grate cage, so I can't pour out the gravel to clean it. The worst part is the fact that they are growing progressively more stinky. Yesterday, I preceived a tremendous stench from the cage, and it's getting worse. I can't stand being in my room! I think one must have died!! It's hard to tell because they are all capable of pulling far back into their shells. And I'm scared to check.      I feel bad, but these are NOT happy crabs, and I really want to get rid of them!! Can I give them to a pet shop or something?? What do I do!?

20090309140846AATt8nz	Pets;Dogs	What do I do for urine smell in my Golden's 'feathers'.  Dog is incontinent at night, I must bathe him daily.?	He is now 5 months old.  He was born with a congenital defect and urinates through a hole below his anus.  He has sphincter control. But at night he sleeps on his back and 'leaks'.  When he awakes his hind end is wet.  I bathe his hindquarters daily with Fresh & Clean and Pro Pet from Walmart (the green apple scent).  Both still do not eliminate the odor completely. I am concerned with bathing so frequently (because of the odor) and the 'yellow' color his hair is becoming due to the urine.  He is such a trooper and luckily enjoys the time and attention.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!

20090309143224AAkCtbC	Pets;Dogs	Which type of dog makes a good playmate for a large Chihuahua?	We have a 1yr old deer legged chihuahua. She weighs about 10lbs. She has so much energy!

20090309143322AA8qzSu	Pets;Dogs	Does this sound like neglect to you? What should I do?	So my friend lives in the apartment below me and she has an English Bulldog.      The thing is, she leaves her dog in the crate. A lot. I'd say 8 times out of 10 whenever I'm in the apt the dog is in the crate. She feeds the dog, takes her out and will probably let her hang around for an hour before she has to "make dinner" or something and puts her back in the crate. She (the dog) is probably out of the crate 3ish hours a day. We're both uni students, so no one has excessive amounts of responsibility or commitments outside school. She'll just be sitting in the living room and Lola (the dog) will be in the crate.       It's strange because she talks about her dog so much, wants to work with animals for a living etc. I know she loves Lola but she's like a prisoner. My friend "fosters" puppies that are rescued from shelters before they find a home, but the puppies don't generally like her dog because she's so hyper so she'll be in the crate even longer. She is constantly searching for more animals, but then she'll get bored of them and give them away (for example, she dragged me to a reptile expo got a whole monitor lizard settup and a month and a half later gave it away). She now has two cats, one of which hates Lola so it's a whole ordeal if the cat escapes into the living room when the dog is out. Really it's an ordeal letting the dog out at all.       Does it sound like maybe something isn't right here? I love my friend and she means well but I really just don't know what to do. She (my friend) is sensitive and I don't want to start a fight as she takes things VERY personally, especially about her dog.       Does this sound like its teetering on neglect? How should I go about saying something if it is? She's starting to remind me of Elmira from tiny toons if anyone has seen it.

20090309114742AAH5lhe	Pets;Fish	I help with my air stones.?	I have a Hagen Optima air pump and its been the best $35 that I've spent in a while its very quiet and it has an electronic adjustment nob on the pump that slows down the pump instead if just restricting the air flow. Any way the pump is very quiet but my air stones are not as quiet. The fizzing from the bubbles is loud and annoying I tried to cover the air stones up with gravel and that worked but the bubbles were too big I would like to keep the bubbles a nice small size. I have also moved the air stones away from glass and that didn't do any thing so. What kind of air stone should I get that doesn't make that fizzing sound as loud. Right now I just have some basic air cylinder shaped air stones but whats better than that.
20090309120510AAE0S5X	Pets;Horses	Horse buckling at knees, not locking?	I have a 15yr old Appendix QH. I have owned him for 8yrs. About 3yrs ago my friend who had a horse right next to Flight was video taping him threw the cracks in the stall because he was snoring and then all of a sudden he almost collapsed, but luckily caught himself. I haven't seen or heard of anything other then that one episode. I had never had a problem with his knees and I did show jumping and barrel racing with him competitivly for a long time. He had an old fracture in his elbow that started acting up last spring and I had taken him to the equine clinic and they did a nuclear scan soft and bone tissue and X-rays and it showed his whole front end, and there was nothing in his knees other then some arthritis. His problem was in his feet and elbow. Since then I have retired him to a pleasure trail horse and have a lovely family leasing him. His knees have gone bald and we havn't been able to figure out why because from laying down normally his hocks will have some rubbed hair but not his knees. The other night a woman apparently heard a horse snoring and went to check it out and she said Flight had his butt up in the air and was on his knees sleeping and snoring. I talked with one person and they said his knees may be buckling and may not be locking correctly and he could be falling, The woman leasing him said last time she rode him now that she's aware of the situation said that he did stumble a few times. He hasn't been lame or sore at all. i would think if hes repetitivly falling A) he wouldnt have been sleeping if he fell and B) he would atleast be sore coming out from the stall in the morning. Any one have any thoughts?????
20090309115313AAiOJGw	Pets;Rodents	Can mice be really be racist?	Okay heres the story:      A long time ago my sisters friend got me two mice. It was for me and my bro. we got a HUGE cage for them but they fought. One was a girl the other was a boy. The girl (white and black kind) was biting the boy (golden) and like they were fighting soooo much. But is was the girl fighting.  Then we returned the golden one for another boy (i have been reading some of the answers here and i might have found out why she was fighting so no being mean) and she still was being so rude. then she killed the boy. IT WAS SO SAD. Can they be racist? or sexist?      sorry for making this a bit long.      please answer!!
20090309120030AAQY1Q3	Pets;Fish	Aggressive angel fish! problem!?	so i brought a new angel fish and the old one i had is so aggressive to the new one. territorial! so what i did was keep the new one in a breeding tank just so the old one will get familiar. (when i buy a new fish the angel fish always chases the new one away after few hours it wont. so am guessing it will be the same for the new angel fish. so i kept the old angel fish in a breeding tank instead so the new one doesn't get stressed too much as i just added it to the tank they become stress when they arrive in new tanks. should i continue to keep the old angel fish in there? if i let it out then the new angel fish just stays in one corner wont move but once i trap the old one the new one swims around harmless

He/She isn't timid by nature (from what I can tell) but it is scared and even a bit stressed.   It hasn't eaten anything and I'm worried, because I know these babies must be fed three times a day.      I have a variety of different foods I have offered, but it wont eat.   Will it be okay and is this normal?

20090309120343AAXGsLH	Pets;Cats	I cant get my cat spayed!!! HELP!!?	My cat is in season, and has been for the last week. When we originally went to get her spayed at 6 months old the vet said she was too young so we left it a few months but she is now in season and attracting all these male cats to our front door... We have kept her in despite how annoying her cries are to go out. I have since spoken to the vet again who has now said that they cannot spay a cat until 1 month after being in season as it will cause more damage to the act but from what I have read on other answers to peoples questions cats are constantly in heat until either pregnant or spayed, so I now have a dilemma! Is there a gap between cats being in season...??
