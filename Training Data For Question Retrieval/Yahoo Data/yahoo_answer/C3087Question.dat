20090309142646AAYEBoa	Local Businesses;United States;Seattle	Who in Everett, WA gives the most honest deal with flooring?	I have severe asthma and my doctor has asked me to get either laminate or vinyl flooring (or hardwood or tile) to replace my carpet.  My landlord agreed to let me do it with no charge for not leaving it the same way as I moved in.      Now, I have had Empire, Flynn's and Totally Floored all give me estimates for laminate.  I am also going to go to Home Depot and Hatloe's Carpet One (the Carpet One located in Everett) is coming tomorrow to make an estimate.      Problems: I get 357 sq ft according to the landlord's dimensions                   Empire and Flynn's get 641 sq. ft.                   Totally Floored gets 549 sq. ft.                   1 company charges 5% and another 8% more sq. ft. for waste when they cut along edges and transitions.                    1 company separately hires out an installer, two companies have their own.                     Nobody seems to have the exact same flooring: Mohawk "Northern Maple" is one, a version of "Northern Maple" with padding and in a softer less yellow tone also by Mohawk and a Blonde Cherry Dream and a Spring Oak.                  I am on disability and am having volunteers from a local agency move my stuff out and others move back in.  I am renting a truck to store my stuff while the job is being done.  My landlord is taking out the carpet and tack strips so the only work is putting the floor down.              I have approx. estimates of $2400, $3300, $4400 and $6600!      How can I find out who is most honest?  What information do I have to have to compare accurately?  Have you personally done business with any of these companies?  What else can you tell me?
