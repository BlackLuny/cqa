20090202105755AAEehIz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	10 days of positive OPK's?	I just had a son in september and ever since he was born and it was safe my husband and I have been TTC again. The last period i had was the 23 of december and it lasted til january 3rd. Its really weird for me to not have another period by now, but since i just delivered 4 1/2 months ago i figured my periods would be irregular. Now, i've been taking Answer OPK's and for the past 10 days i've gotten more than just a couple positives. I took one on the 22nd of jan and it was + then i took like 8 more throughout the past 10 days (the most recent being about 25 min ago) and they were all +. i've taken HPT's (the most recent being yesterday morning) and they have all been neg. Im just wondering why the heck my OPKs would be + for 10 days! I think once or twice they have been -, but mostly +. i know i have never ovulated for 10 days before... anyone maybe know?

20090202105053AAJoBO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has anyone used a "Harness Buddy" for a walking toddler in crowded areas?	Let me preface this by saying I am really not comfortable with the idea of this...but, here is the story.      We are going to Florida next week.  My DD will be 2.  She doesn't like her carrier (Ergo) any longer, and pretty much refuses to be in it.  She is fine in the stroller for periods of time, but likes to walk around.  She is normally fine walking holding my hand.  I am concerned though about crowded airports, and us going to Sea World.     My friend was telling me last night that she used one of these "Harness Buddies"    http://www.target.com/Eddie-Bauer-Harnes...    on their child who is the same age, and it worked pretty well.   Have any of you used these and did they work out?      I hate the idea of this...and I kind of cringe when I think about it.  Any other suggestions instead of this??      Oh, and please, don't say she is a child not a dog.  I am well aware of that fact :  )

20090202105849AAL6Txi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I took all of my 18 year old sons luxuries away?	Hello.      I've been dealing with my sons lazy attitude towards choirs for a long time now, he attends college but he does nothing around the house.      Also me and my wife believe he spends to much time locked up in his bedroom on his laptop computer.      I've taken away his laptop, I've banned him from using the downstairs PC, I've taken away his xbox360 and I've banned him from using his mobile phone for personal calls and any form of internet connection.      If he wants his things back he can go make a life of his own, nice things come to people that earn them and he does nothing.      He claims "I go to college!" or "I'm 18 you have no right!"      As far as I'm concerned while he is living at home, he can either help out or receive nothing.      I've banned him from using the internet until the 1st January next year.   It may seem severe but he is old enough to deal with it, if he doesn't like it he can go get his own place.   Have I done the right thing?

20090202110232AAixsYE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I introduce my boyfriend to my children and the rest of the world?	I am a divorced Mum of 3 children aged 2, 6 and 7 and a half years old.  My ex moved out of the family home 4mths ago and we lived together for 8mths separated as we waited for his house to finally go through and he refused to move in with his parents until that happened.  However although we have been split up now for a whole year, unfortunately all our friends and family see it that it has only really been 4mths because that was when he finally moved out.  The complication is that I have a new partner that I have been dating for 9mths now.  I was already friends with my partner before he asked me out.  No he isn't the cause of our relationship split, my ex was.  It isn't how the rest of the world will see it though.  I have told all MY friends and family but my ex's family, my ex and OUR MUTUAL friends don't know that I have moved on.  To be honest they are all suspicious as my ex did text me over the xmas period asking me why I wanted to know if he was having the kids new years day and was it due to my new fella etc.  He described his van colour and the make in the text but I ignored it and nothing has been said ever since.  I don't want any trouble but wonder whether I should keep dating him in secret and let fate let it all out if you know what I mean.        He came out with us new years eve and the kids met him, thinking he was my friend.  He has also come around the house to fix something but there was only the younger 2 there.  He has seen the youngest child loads of times.  How do I progress from here?

I haven't been on a date with my husband since November of last year.  The only alone time I get is when my son is sleeping or I am out running errands or my husband is running errands.  My mother-in-law will take him overnight but generally that is after we have eaten dinner, he's in his pajamas and it's already 9 at night.  Oh yes, he also has to be picked up by 10 the next morning.  The longest I have been able to get away was from a Friday morning to Sunday afternoon and that was last June.   I would love to be able to sleep in again and just lay on the couch for one day.  Is that too much to ask?  I would love to tell my mother-in-law our son is all hers and we will see her in a week.
20090202111027AAiE84W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Behavior issues with my preschooler?	My four year old daughter is extremely energetic and curious. We have to keep everything out of her reach or she will dismantle it. For example, she will take dishes out of the strainer and put them in her mouth (making them dirty again and then I have to re-clean them.) She will take a box of tissues and take them all out and try to make something out of it.  I can't turn my back for a second without her getting into something or another. She has pletny of toys and gets plenty of attention from me and my husband. How much do you let go and say it's just a kid thing and how much do you discipline over it? I feel like I"m saying "No! stop!" every five seconds. We are in the process of getting her tested for ADHD and autism but in the mean time I'd like to hear from other moms or people who work with kids

20090202111331AADe7nJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	PREGNANT OR AUNT FLOW? *Help please*?	Hi everyone!      I ovulated on Monday January 19th. And had intercourse the 18th (day before), 15th and the 13th.   All last week I thought I was having pregnancy symptoms. My breasts were heavy, a little swollen, and a little sore. I had some nausea, and a little cramping.      I've also been keeping track of my BBT, and before I ovulated it was anywhere from 96.2 - 96.8. And now its anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7. I've been surprised to see it at 97.9 for a few days.      Normally I dont get nauseated or swollen/tender/heavy breasts before my period. Just some usual cramping.      The past 3-4 days now, I have not had sore breasts at all. I was a little nauseated and light-headed this morning tho. I also had killer cramps this morning too. I had to take some Tylenol to ease the pain.    Is it normal to get cramps like that during early pregnancy?       I'm supposed to start my period today or tomorrow, but there's no sign of it yet. Except maybe the cramping.          I wasn't stressing about being pregnant or anything. Just excited.      I thought for sure I was pregnant. But maybe I was wrong? Does this mean I'm not pregnant? AF? :(         What do you think?   Advice or Help would be appreciated :)   Thank you.

It's the second kiss ever happened. It was just such a situation. Steph's 4yo daughter Kylie was in the other room but she came and saw us hugged (it's nothing unusual, we hug and snuggle all the time) and the problem is our faces were too close, which Kylie noticed and asked what were we doing. We just said nothing and started talking about TV. Steph and I are not lesbians, we both like men, it's just something strong between us, close relationship and understanding, I can't explain.   How much should the child see and know? How do we prevent the too-much-information from Kylie?   We don't lock our doors and it would be strange to start, also Kylie has seen us hug and doesn't find it any strange, we hug her too.   Do you have any advice in that situation?
20090202111841AAQL6VC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it appropriate when at the park / playground ?	This is sort of a spinoff from another question that was just asked regarding parents that take their children to parks/playgrounds. It made me wonder, this person mentioned in her question a child that was at the playground while his/her mother spoke on their cell phone.     1) Is it appropriate to be on your cell phone when at a playground or park? Should your focus be on your child and not on your cell?    2) Is it appropriate to tell another child to play nice or to share when theyre getting a bit rough with your own child? Would you actually say something to the childs parent? Or would you kind of brush it off?    3) Sharing: When another child approaches your own child but isnt sharing the toy, how do you react? Again, do you tell the child to play nice and share or do you speak up to the other parent?

20090202112603AA3ysZE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	On and off again, the perils of potty-training boys?	A year and a half ago, I traveled 800 miles to visit my grandparents for a few months. My grandmother had bought a potty for my older son. Surprisingly, he was immediately potty trained... I could not believe it. He literally trained himself in a day (or less).       When we got home, we had the same potty with us. He decided he was not potty trained. A few months ago we went back to visit and brought the potty with us. Again, potty trained.       Now that we are home, he will only go on the potty if he is in the bath tub and realizes he has to poop. Any suggestions?       I'd like to start him in preschool but he has to be potty trained. When we visit my grandparents, I don't have to ask him if he has to potty or anything. I do this (ask him) here where I live, because that is the only way I can get him to sit on it (the potty).       He will be 3 in mid-March. He wears Pull-Ups.. the Cool Alert ones. He doesn't care if the designs fade. He used to care if the Pull-Ups felt funny when he peed in them, but now he doesn't care. He wears Night Time Pull Ups at night. AKA, he does not wear regular diapers, only I think Pull Ups are just diapers for big kids. He does have big-boy underpants, and training pants, but he will just pee straight through them and not even seem to care.

20090202113627AACvcmS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I have a deaf son and the schools out here can't help him.. What now?	My son is 3 years old and I remember when I was younger they sent me to a different school district just to get the help I needed.  Now these days they want to try and make sure all kids stay in the city limits! But none of the school out here in Granite City, IL have a program or classes for the deaf or hearing impaired to help my son.  He goes to an Early Childhood Center now and he's only there for 2 hours. He's not even getting the attention he needs for his disability. I've called the School district here and they keep giving me the same answer they can't help him! It's not right! He is to far behind because this school he goes to has NO IDEA what to do for him, so they just let him play the whole 2 hours while he is there. I am very angry and very upset.  I have tried everything I can think of and nothing seems to help.  Does anyone know what to do here??  I can't just move, money is to tight these days. Even if we did have the money, we still can't because my husband is a Firefighter and an EMT here in Granite City, IL. And you have to live in area to stay with that job. I don't know what to do!!  I don't want to send my 3 year old to Jacksonville IL School for the Deaf. Thats to FAR!!! I would only get him once or twice every month, plus he's to young for that kind of school. Can anyone help me find something on the Internet or numbers to call... something!!!! I need HELP!!!!  :(  I want the best for my son!!!!!

20090203163804AAO7kWC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you decide when to get your toddler bigger shoes?	My son is 15 months and I usually just move him up a size as it seems the next size will fit.  I really don't know if he outgrows the previous size or not.  I'm currently a little annoyed.  He wears a 5 right now.  I didn't like the tennis shoes he has and wanted to get him some new ones.  I had already purchased him adidas in a size 6 for when he needs them (they are way too big).  I ordered him Pumas in a size 6 to wear now.  I thought Pumas ran small because he had Pumas in a size 4 which fit when his other shoes he was wearing were 3's.  The Pumas came and are huge.  These don't run small at all.  I then ordered him some Nike's in size 5.  I thought this was safe because the ones he has been wearing are Nike size 5 (he also has striderites size 5 that fit).  He got the new Nike's today and they seem small :(.  My husband says they fit but he'll outgrow them soon.  I thought about returning them but decided it wasn't a big deal since I'm pregnant with another boy and he'll get some wear out of them too so it's not a complete loss.        I don't want to get his shoes at the store because I like to find unique styles and I can find better deals online if I shop around.  Anyone else order their toddlers shoes online and have trouble with sizes.  THey don't seem to run the same even within the same company and he's too small to tell me when they are uncomfortable.        What do you do?
20090203163513AAA6Hl8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do i handle being 35 wks pregnant and dumped?	I am 35 weeks pregnant and my baby's father just broke up with me. He broke up with me twice before. I know he has been cheating on me because he admitted it. I just want to forgive him and move on with him. I really don't want to be alone raising our baby. He says he feels forced to be with me and has feelings for someone else. I feel like I'm living a nightmare. The other day he pushed me out of his room and locked the door. I couldn't believe he was doing that. He's 35, sings in the choir at church, is the lead usher, and works with security at the church. I thought he was a really good man. He talks to me like I'm trash at times and makes fun of the way I talk and think. I pray for him to recognize how he's acting and treat me better. I thought about ignoring his calls but I keep thinking he might be calling to apologize and be with me. When I answer the phone and he just acts like it's no big deal, it hurts so bad. How do I move on? If he were to change for the better, I would be overjoyed. The hope of that happening keeps me hanging on. Has anyone experienced a similar situation? How did you handle it

20090203164016AAppWE6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My baby girl is crying for attention to be held and waled around all day.?	Hi,      I have a 5 month old girl and she constantly cries for attention. When i pick her up she stops, but i have to walk around the house. Even if i sit on the sofa and hold her she cries. When i leave her on the swing she cries and scratches face really hard, sometimes leaving bad cuts and cries. I have tried leaving her but if i leave her for 1hour she would cry for 1 hour, so she just cries until i pick her up. I don't know what to do at times it drives me crazy. I cant do any housework and i don't want to hold her all day long or she might become attached. I am only 22 and i am very inexperienced , Does anyone have any tips?
20090203164223AAoaWv5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I want it to hurt more?	Ok I asked a question a few days ago about having pain in my lower leg. It originally happened becuase I got nailed just above the ankle by a our #1 Varsity pitcher. Although it is not swollen and it is hardly bruised it still hurts a lot, especially when touched, or when i extend it while sitting or laying down. I know there is probably nothing wrong with it but i am sick of it hurting. I feel like I want it to hurt more, and I want there to be something wrong with it so that it can heal like under a cast or something. Not to mention I have always wanted to be on crutches. I just feel like I am going through this pain that is going to continue unless something is done. I have even prayed that something will happen that will cause it to break so that it can heal. Dont say I should rest it because softball season has started and I am starting Varsity so it is impossible to rest it, we have two a days. I don't know what to do. I want to hurt it more so i can rest it, but i dont know how to. Just maybe somethign that will put me out for like 4 weeks or something. Don't call me a psycho or anything, becasue I am not. I just want it to heal by making it worse so that I can actually go to the doctor and have something be wrong with it. I wouldnt even mind surgery.

20090203164959AAnUovt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	OK. Just guesses .. ?	So, I'm going in for the Gender/Anatomy Ultrasound in two days when I'll be 17wks4dys pregnant.    My conception date was calculated via ultrasound 3 times as being October 19th. That was a Sunday. Me & the boyfriend, for the most part have sex every Saturday making it possible that I'm having a boy. But I vividly remember having my ovulation symptoms during the week after that, no later than the 21st. I either ovulated (felt the symptoms) late Monday - the 20th - or late Tuesday - the 21st. Based on this, what would you say I'm having?    PS - They say female sperm last 3 days & male sperm last a day or so bc they die off quicker.    This is just for fun. To see what you think! I'm VERY excited about having either as a child. TRUST ME! =)    THANKS!

So i decided to do a search on google and i found a lot of interesting information about Native American, more specifically from Alaska Tribes, it was a very interesting search.   I saw that they use loads of interesting words and some named their children after a dead family member, the gender didn't matter.   It was a really funny thing to search.   So do you guys no any Ntive names? Not that i want to name my child any of this names (well i don't know but i don't think so) but i'd like to know a few.   Do you know any?      Thank you very much.

I don't understand how teenage girls think if you have had sex before the age of 17 you instantly become a slut. One of my friends was pregnant and as soon as all of her friends found out they all abandoned her cause she was considered a "slut". Its just not right for a group of people to ridicule someone that is going through a REALLY tough time dealing with pregnancy. Its funny too, because when i lost my virginity i was instantly a thug. It's the complete opposite for both genders.

20090203171749AAMHjL6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Telling the father of the baby?	I have one of the most complicated stories you can possibly have. I'll try to make it brief:    I've been in a relationship with a guy for 2 years. In June I found out I was pregnant, and the father pushed and pushed and pushed for me to have an abortion. I moved in August, and in September I finally gave in half way and told him that I did, even though I really hadn't.     I've continued to speak to him since that point and I've seen him and we've "messed around." I am not showing a lot, even now at 9 months (36 weeks, yesterday). He has heard some things from different people about me being pregnant and I denied it every time.     I was planning on telling him a while ago, but in November his brother got in a motorcycle accident and has been in a coma ever since. I've been waiting for things to cool down with that but they haven't. In fact, his brother's condition has been up and down he has experienced a lot of complications. I haven't had the heart to throw something else on top of his already-heavy load.    Well I'm getting close to my due date (March 2) and I still haven't told him. My parents are urging me to tell him. But they don't know I've been seeing him and talking to him the whole time. I'm afraid of a few things: one, I've been lying the whole time. Two, I'm scared that the father of my baby will tell my parents we've been seeing each other and cause problems for me with them.    I made a huge chaotic disaster for myself and I have no idea what my next move should be. Who knows, maybe I shouldn't even tell him. What do you think?

Yestarday, I went to my evening college class and arrived a little early, so I went to the student lounge to get a soda. A girl walked up to me and said I share a class with her, even though I didn't recognize her. She started talking to me and when she discovered that I was pregnant, (I was in a long coat so you couldn't easily tell) the flood gates opened. this girl proceeded to ask me every question that she could possibly think of, including;  when are you due? What are you having? What dr do you see? What hospital are you giving birth at? Is that where you had your first baby? How big was your first baby? How big is this baby? Are you done having kids? Are you gonna take birth control? What does your husband do? Do you work? Are you gonna take a semester off after the baby comes? How many classes do you take? What are they? Does your mom help you take care of the baby? What's your major? Are your kids gonna go to day care? Are you having a natural birth. Did you have a natural birth with the first one? She asked about my grades and test scores too. THEN if that wasn't enough, she asks me if I'm going to get on WIC to take care of my babies (in those exact words) I looked at her like she was crazy and said "no!" She looked at me confused and said "is that bad?" I said "I don't qualify for WIC, its for low income families and I can take care of my kids myself." It was the most ackward conversation I have ever had. I finally made up an excuse to leave! I can deal with the basic questions (when are you due? ect...) But when personal questions about my income,grades and things like that come up, I have to draw the line. How would you have reacted? Anyone have an similar experiences?

She has very delayed speech; she will be 3 tomorrow and no one besides her daddy and I can decipher what she is saying. She didn't talk much at all until she was 16 months old and all she said was mommy, and ball. And even though she can talk now, she still cannot tell us what she wants.       She doesn't follow directions well (which may just be a 2 year old thing) and tunes people out when they are talking to her.       She also throws very extreme tantrums. She often throws herself on the floor and screams and screams to no end, even over the littlest things.       So what do you think...Autism or no autism?

Her parents know that I have 2 kids, obviously. But she was having sex long before I was. She is now 18 weeks pregnant and her parents wont let her have anything to do with me. If anything, I thought theyd want her to babysit my kid once or twice (they always said that before she actually got pregnant) to see what it's like. My question is: Why do you think they're acting this way? She is 17, almost 18. Her boyfriends parents kicked him out upon hearing the news and he lives with them. I am now back at home with my boyfriend (my parents got a divorce) living with me and my mom and I am 17. She has been sexualy active since 13 and Me since 15. Her parents knew right away that she was, becasuse she told them. Sorry for all the background info. But long story short- her parents KNEW she was sexually active before me, and that I got pregnant 2 years after she started having sex. So why would they tell her I AM a bad influence, when she is the one who told ME that i should have sex??     Someone answer me this. IT's confusing the heck outta me.

I applied at every local place I could think of (we don't have a bus system I don't drive, and we don't know anyone here to carpool with, so I'm gonna have to hoof it two miles to work each day when I'm called in), I filled out my applications to all the local shops and restaurants, but no one has called me back yet. When I call the employers to speak with them, they give me the schpeel of, "we'll get in touch with you" or "we aren't hiring right now", I've been busting my butt trying to get a job so I can help save up for baby stuff and our wedding. I'm beginning to give myself grey hair and enormous migraines because the stress is getting to me. Does anyone have any advice? A very sad, stressed out, and confused mama to be.  :(

I hate the questions where people ask if they're pregnant when they could just take a test to find out, too.      But here's my situation. I'd been on the pill for about two years but I recently went off it for around a month. I went back on but missed some days so I doubled up on the pills two days in a row (this is what the leaflet that came with them said to to).       A few days ago my fiance and I had sex. We usually use a condom but this time we didn't. I think some of the semen got inside of me. Is it likely I'm pregnant? My period isn't due for around two and a half more weeks. I know no one here will actually be able to tell me a yes or no, but do you think it's likely or unlikely?

20090202144943AAR8I3C	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Can You Get Pregnant On The Pill?	Ok so I have been using the pull out method with this guy since October, only twice have we ever used condoms. The second time, which was this past Saturday, he thought that he came in me but I got my period so we know that I'm not pregnant. However, he really wants me to start going on birth control now. I told him that I would probably get birth control from planned parenthood if I was able to talk to someone there about it and calculate the risks. He hates condoms though so I know that once I get the pill that he is going to want to continue with the unprotected sex, im not sure if he is going to want to *** in me though. Im just trying to figure out if I start going on the pill, can I still become pregnant?? I'm 17 years old turning 18 in 5 months and he is turning 20 in less than a week, so we are probably not ready for me to get pregnant right now, but I dont need people telling me not to have sex. I have been having sex since I was 15 and I am going to continue to do it, if i get pregnant then I will accept that consequence if and when the time comes (no abortions, and most likely not adoption).

20090202145151AArLlX8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Daughter becoming hypochondriac because brother is always sick?	I'm not sure what to do about my almost 4-year old daughter.  My son, who is almost 2, has been sick a lot.  My daughter sees that he gets extra attention, gets to stay home from daycare, gets to go to the doctor (she thinks it's good because they give a sucker or toy there), and gets medicine (again, a thing she thinks is good because they make them taste so good now).  So, whenever he is sick, she complains that she is sick too or if he's getting medicine she says she needs it too.  Every morning she starts out saying she doesn't feel good and shouldn't go to daycare.  Today, when my son had to stay home again, she told me she was going to be very sick tomorrow and have to go to the doctor then.  So, I know she's not really sick most of these times.  But, what do I do with her?        I've tried explaining that being sick isn't good and that my son feels really miserable the whole time and she shouldn't want to be sick.  I try to make sure I give her what extra attention I can.  I'm not sure what else can be done.  Any advice?

Could that be the culprit, or should I be concerned? It is the consistency of pudding. Sorry if TMI. I am a new mom and I have never seen this color before. Maybe it is the solids.

20090202145546AADpWVf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 16 and pregnant, and i need help.?	i've posted  few of these before, but today my grandma took me to buy a pregnancy test, and i came home, and took it. it was positive. she said that i'm a smart girl, whose done very stupid things for 16 years, and that my 16 years was a waste. i asked her if i could maybe have an abortion, to make her happy and she said she would in no way pay for it. me and my boyfriend are broke. then, i asked her if she could help me out, give me some advice... and she basically told me that she wouldn't help me no matter what. that i made this choice, and i have to follow through with it. she also told me that she's not even sure if she wants me to live in her house, and she wants me to get married to my boyfriend whose about to be in the military, and have my baby.   i don't know what to do. i told her that she didn't mean that, that she didn't want me to get married, and she said 'yeah, well, i guess YOU didn't mean to get pregnant. but now you have to make your choices.'   i don't know what to do. i'm planning on calling my boyfriend once i get some answers. he already knows i'm pregnant, as does his mother, who said that i could come stay with them. i just want some help, especially if your a mother, or are in my place, or ever have been.   and, the legal consent age in florida, is 16, so my boyfriend wouldn't be with an underage girl.

20090202153549AAjdbTE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it normal to hate men this much because of my dad?	because of growing up around my dad I can't stand men, I HATE THEM. even when I hear the word man I wan't to just flip out.. all threw growing up my dad used to hit me with belts and hangers, he stopped now because I'm too old to get hit (I'm 17 now) because he KNOWS i'll call the police. but still now whenever he has a bad day he comes in and takes it out on me and remotely screams at me for no reason and I just sit there because I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, he sounds agressive and scary. and all he does is makes the whole house unhappy, he causes nothing but stress.. and my brothers the same, his nothing but a sexist PIG.    earlier on my dad came in my room, was trying to fix something, got mad and threw EVERYTHING in my room around and I had to clean it up, I thought I was actually going to kill him but instead I said "I've had enough of you you dirty man, f*** off" and he just went out of my room in a bad mood as usual.    I have SO much hate for men I can't even explain to you. I wish I didn't so I could be "normal" but the sad thing is I can honestly say I don't even know ONE nice man and if they're nice all they want is sex.    All I think about on a daily basis is how much I dislike men.    should I go councelling or what???????

She wont let anyone touch near her mouth, and she cannot sleep. She is miserable and whingy, and it is obviously bugging her as she keeps laying her face on the floor with her fingers in her mouth crying. I have nurofen and panadol, but she is not used to having them and becomes hysterical when i try to give it to her- to the point she panics herself and stops breathing.    Just wondering if there was anything natural (shes using teething gels) apart from a cold washer that i could use to ease the discomfort?    Thanks for your help (btw- she is 11 months)

20090202153232AACBgNW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My brother keeps leaving the door unlocked when he leaves for school?	I leave for school at 7am, and him around 7:30am. I always lock the door when I leave, he does not. He started taking the bus last week and just about every time he forgets to lock it. Dad told him to lock it, and he didn't again. I wrote on a piece of paper taped to the door "Lock the door or I'll steal all your stuff - Intruder" And I changed the sign and put on it "I stold yur ps2" since he has one.       I really want the door to be locked not only because stuff may get stolen  but because we have 1 cat and 2 kittens which love to try to escape. I love them to death and I don't want anything to happen to them.       So: My plan is if I get dads permission: Next time he leaves the door unlocked if take his PS2 and hide it, then when he freaks out be like "I do not know where it is. Did you not lock the door?" Then eventually give it to him.       He is able to lock the door. He is 3mo. younger than I am. I am 16, he is 16.
20090202152554AAtJFuN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and losing weight.?	This is quite long - be warned.    Well I am now 12 weeks pregnant, and have lost 7kg since the start of my pregnancy.    I am slightly overweight for my age and height (a lot to do with what I have been through over the last few years). Yeh on one hand I'm glad I've lost a bit of weight, but kind of worried at the same time.    My first pregnancy went quite smooth, I only had 2 weeks of morning sickness @ 3 months in, and that involved yacking in the morning then feeling fine the rest of the time. I also had one night in hospital due to dehydration (couldn't keep anything down, not even water, had to go on a drip).   This pregnancy, I have had bad morning sickness, although it's more all day sickness. I practically walk around the house with a bucket, as I constantly just feel like I want to throw up. I drink a lot of water, as it's pretty much all I can drink (good thing in a way since I've almost given up coke (soft drink guys!! lol). I barely eat, as whenver I think about food, it just puts me off and makes me want to yack. Then because I don't eat, I yack (mind you I yack nothing most of the time, just bile or it's dry heaving). So I end up eating something, because I have to and more often than not part of it will come back up again. It's frustrating because I run out of energy. And the dry heaving up to 4 times a day, sometimes makes it painful in my abdomen because of the movement of muscles associated with it.    I want to be able to have my appetite back, so I can eat properly for myself and my baby. If I'm lucky I may have 1 day where I actually have a proper appetite. I can't get comfortable at night because of it either. At the moment it just half feels like my baby is feeding off my excess fat o_O. (I'm not morbidly obese lol - just have a low view of myself). I just feel like if I take nausea tablets that they won't work, because of how my feelings are towards food at the moment.    So what can I do? And has anyone else ever lost this much weight during pregnancy??
20090202150640AALIurI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Ladies help please....upset and major issue w/sons pediatrician?	Had a little issue with the pediatrician today, sorry if this is long.   My 4 month old son was 9lbs at birth, his 2 month checkup he was 14lbs, then at 3 months almost 18 lbs, and today at his 4 month checkup he weighed in at 20 lbs, and 27 inches long.  He's super solid and has a little bit of chub on him but most people think he's a 6-9 month old.  My husband and brother are both tall men (like over 6'2').  Well today the doctor was really harsh, rude and basically implied that Caleb is fat!  She asked how much he's eating and I said anywhere from 34-38 ounces of breastmilk and formula per day.... (thought this was the norm)  She said "no no no you're feeding him way too much, he's gaining too much, and he's going to start developing fat cells."  .....to which I replied "Umm okay, what do you suggest, just don't feed him when he's screaming for food?"  On top of that what does this woman mean when she says "he's gonna develop fat cells?"  Is she a moron?  I was always under the assumption that human beings are born with fat cells.  Anyways,  He wakes up roughly every 3-4 hours at night to eat anywhere from 2-4 ounces.  She said I needed to start giving him water all night, stop feeding him at like 8 pm and begin him on water and juices until 8am, so no formula or breastmilk all night long.  Well I really expressed my concerns about this to her saying that I'd heard water wasn't necessary for babies under a year old, or at least waiting until the 6 month mark, because it can cause kidney problems and water intoxication if its done too early.  She seemed soooo offended that I was questioning her holier than thou doctorate....She said "I have no idea where you heard that at!'' Looked at me like I was nuts and asked me if I wanted my son to keep getting "wider" and that I was stretching out his belly"!?  I'm sorry but seriously WTF?  I'm not an uninformed mother, I do plenty of research and by no means do I think my son is getting fat!  He eats when he's hungry.  I have yet to give him any rice cereal, which she said I needed to start a month ago.    I need to start giving him water instead of formula but need to start rice cereal??  That seems so off to me.    I got home and got right on the internet, went to baby center.com, etc and it turns out I'm right! Infants this young aren't supposed to have water or juices yet.  I really feel frustrated with her, and I'd like to get a second opinion, not only because she's misinformed it seems but simply because she dismissed all of my concerns.   What are your thoughts on this, am I overreacting?   By the way water intoxication can cause seizures and coma in infants, what if I hadn't done my research and just listened to her!?   I know my son is a big boy, but babies eat on demand and he's not obese for Gods sake, but I don't like the implication by his doctor that he is!
20090202150827AAfXyjb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Another Question For Those of You Who Do Spank - How Do You Handle the Child Who Resists With All He's Got...?	and bites, claws, kicks, punches, and yanks hair?  I did all of those things as a child, and we are talking a spanking here, not a beating.  I just panicked, flipped out, and went into fight mode.   My parents threatened me that I'd get spanked more for resisting, but it simply didn't register or compute.  The only thing that mattered was getting away NOW.  With my dad I learned that peeing on him was the most effective way - he got nauseous and I got away.  My youngest brother was a lot like this as well, but he was exempted from spankings.  The brother immediately below me in birth order never got all that worked up over them and forgot all about it in minutes.  Assuming you have determined that the offense is best served with a spanking, how do you proceed if the child is truly wigging out?  Interestingly enough, neither of my two were like that.  They were upset at the time but bounced back quickly.

I was wondering if maybe it was the onset of something or just normal baby behavior.

I would just like some honest answers which can either give me hope or prepare me for the worst!! My son is waking every two hrs in the night for a feed and he's done this for the past five weeks. Please don't say "welcome to motherhood" as I realise that this could be normal, but all my friend's babies are formula fed and they have been sleeping through since around 6-10 weeks. I don't want to give up on breastfeeding!

20090202151303AAc4k97	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Has anyone used "The Potty Bootcamp" book to help potty training?	We are at our wit's end with our three year old son and I am considering buying this e-book to help but want to see if anyone had feedback first.    for anyone who is wondering:  We have tried the positive reward method with him (i.e. giving him stickers to use the potty, etc)  He does not seem to care about being in a poopy diaper for hours on end, so putting him in regular underpants for the uncomfortable experience won't work (and we've been there!)  We are consistent but he just screams when we put him on the potty  We have tried both a potty chair and a potty seat that fits on the big toilet.  He is very strong willed and refuses to listen even with discipline.     any help of any kind is appreciated. This is getting out of hand and we don't know what to do!

The doctor said that an ultrasound is always not a correct way to diagnose this problem.i am worried sick from the afternoon since i came back from the clinic.The doctor said there cud be nothing wrong as well.Pls people with exact experiences reply.i cant stop thinking about it.I also came to know that its a boy today.I am hoping every minute that my baby has nothing wrong with him when he is born.I want to know if anyone were told the same thing and it turned out to be nothing and hoe likely it is.Sorry for the long  question.Thanks in advance.

20090202152147AAdZ1xG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy symptoms I never had with my first?	Hi, I have a 14 month old baby girl, the most beautiful little girl in the whole world and the only thing in this life I will ever love completely.   Ok, so Hayley, my little girl was born extremely premature, at only w26 weeks gestation. She, my little miracle pulled through with such strength that I am amazed by her, and she is my hero.    Now, I have a BiCornate uterus, the reason Hayley was born so prem, although unfortunately holding on to her for so long (Yes, for so long) made my condition worse, and I would not make it past 12 weeks pregnant if I were to fall pregnant again.   So I got the Implananon inserted into my arm, although my body reacted quite badly, for a little over a year and I had to get it removed and go on the pill.   Now, the pharmacist ensured me that the pill would work straight away, and I would be protected against pregnancy, however two weeks ago I read the booklet and it said that from rod to pill, it takes two weeks for the pill to work.    I started this change about six weeks ago.   Two weeks into taking the pill, I was taking the "no period" section and I had bled (spotting) for one day. Now, I am CONSTANTLY dizzy, tired, sick, "confused" and cry very small, stupid things.   I am terrified that I am pregnant again, as I could not bear to lose my child, it is something I can't imagine going through.   I do plan to visit the doctor for a test, however I would like either some reassurance or someone to tell me, yes, I probably am pregnant.   Thank you very much         I

20090202153240AAC6Zmw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	4 week old baby. best routine for him?? doesnt finish whole bottle?	my son Jaxon is 4 weeks old on thursday. im well aware he is very young and its all part of parenting! he is on 4oz bottles but doesnt always finish them in the day he might have 2 oz then fall asleep then have the other 2 an hour later, and at night he wakes a few times for instance last night he had a bottle at about 11.30/12pm then went to sleep until about 4am for another one then another at 8am that was good cos he usually wakes every 3 hours, but im trying to get him to have full bottles in the day too so hes a bit more satisfied at night. because when i put him back in his moses basket he sometimes fidgets and wakes up so I put him next to me in bed (next to the wall side, with no quilt cover at all, just a blanket, and far away enough that I wouldnt roll on him, i dont move in my sleep and i dont like him to be inmy bed but he just wont settle once hes up) im not worried about waking up but would like to have a bit more routine of when he wakes etc. any help??

I never got my period in January. About two weeks ago I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend because he said it feels more natural. Lately my boobs have been so tired, and having headaches. Yesterday I took a pregnancy test and it is supposed two show 2 lines if pregnant, and 1 line if you're not pregnant. I got 1 1/2 lines though, so it was probably a defective test. I think I am pregnant though! What should I do? I don't want to get an abortion but I don't think I'm ready to have a baby.

20090202154043AAxf7mT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	So sorry in advance, extremely TMI! Need some advice :(?	I'm sorry because this is a bit of a horrible question! :S I should be ovulating tomorrow (3rd) and so we have been trying to have sex regularly this past week. However, although I have been doing the whole "pillow under the hips" thing and lying in bed for ages afterwards, the next day when I go to the pee there seems to be a LOT of it (or at least that is what I assume it is...although it is slightly thicker) coming out! (I know, TMI, I'm so sorry!)      It's so frustrating, as I feel like nothing I do is right. I was wondering if anyone is a bit more clued up on this than I am - is this maybe just excess if there has been too much for me to hold, so to speak? Or is it possible that excess semen comes out but the sperm remains?   Has anyone experience this while TTC and still been successful?       Please no rude answers suggesting I'm stupid - I know it's a silly question but I'm beginning to feel fed up about all this trying and getting nowhere :(      Thanks :)      xxx
20090202154251AAP12EQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like labor. ?	I asked a similiar question earlier, but didn't get any responses. Ive been having constant menstrual like cramps that ive been having since early this morning. About ten hours now. They aren't going away, but they aren't timeable and they do get more intense at times than others, but nothing i can't handle. But they are more uncomfortable than previous Braxton hicks that ive had.  My belly has felt like the baby was balling up a few times, but that has went away. I have had a little more discharge but nothing more than some clear snotty stuff on the toilet paper. It looks like a blew my nose and its not always there. SORRY TMI. My lower back has also been aching. And when I stand up my lower abdomen and back both ache. Ive been super tired the last couple of days and I was tired earlier today, but now I feel fine and a little more energetic. Just hurting. COuld this be early labor, or is this normal. Im 38 wks today by the way. Im hoping this is labor, but I know that I could still go over my due date to.

OK my period is due tomorrow, and I'm going freaking banana's. I can't sleep for thinking could I really be pregnant this round or am I just wishful thinking. I have all the signs saying I maybe pregnant, but as u all know that these signs can also be signs of my period getting ready to start. But the only thing that got me so gone is that my nipples are not sore or tender and they usually do 4 to 5 days before af starts and this time their not. I have a hpt, but I'm not sure if the result will be accurate, do to the fact that it's not an early response hpt, it's a dollar tree test. Have anyone every use a dollar tree test the morning of the day their period was due and got an accurate result?      I'm so afraid that it's going to come back neg. I only have two more times to take clomid, and I really don't know if I can do it. It is so easy to tell someone else what to do in this type of situation, but when the shoe is on the other foot it's a totally different story. Last month when I got my neg, I was so freaking hurt I cryed the whole night. But the next day I was back on it and said everything I was going to different this month and got happy all over again. But now it's that day before and I'm going crazy, so I just need some good azz advice. So if u got it give it to me, I really need it right now.

OK, I'm 13 (I don't care if your one of those "farr too young" people, just write "2 points" and go away) and I've recently become attracted to this girl (also 13).      I do trampolining with her, and we are on the same level (I'm SLIGHTLY better, because I've been doing it for longer) and I think she likes me.       She will take any excuse to stare at me or giggle at me. I once stared back and she just burst out laughing and said "What?".       She has started to start casual conversations with me (Like "You look tired", etc).       Anyway, last week, we had free time. Her and 2 of her friends (there were only 4 of us, 1 boy and 3 girls) kept nagging me to do as many front somersaults as possible, I said no, and she started saying "I was scarred" in that sort of tone when someone teases you to flirt with you.       Should I ask her out (the age difference is like 7-8 days).       The only thing is, I'm like 5'11" and my voice has broken, so I might come off as intimidating, I don't want that to happen. Any tips?      PS: Once again any of these "Your too young answers" will be thumbed down and reported for not actually answering the question.       PPS: Yes, I DO like her back.

Now that my son is 7 month's old he grabs it constantly and my husband was sick of it anyway, so he decided to shave it.      It went...okay.  The baby definitely recognizes him but he's also clearly a little confused about what happened to his Dad's face.  He kept reaching out to grab his chin and looking kind of sketched out.      I think it'll be okay, though I'm curious to see what happens when he comes home from work tomorrow.      Anyone dealt with this?

All three of her sisters have already gotten their periods, as well as all of her friends. She doesn't buy the 'You're lucky you don't have it!" quips. I suppose she feels left out, which is understandable. Her pediatrician and I have talked to her and told her that it's perfectly normal and that it will come soon. She was premature, as were her sisters, so the doctor said it would be normal if she waited even a few more YEARS for it. I didn't tell her this because I thought it would upset her more, but do you have any ideas on how to make it feel okay to be the 'odd one out' (her words)?
20090202113728AASf3kR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I have a deaf son and the schools out here can't help him.. What now?	My son is 3 years old and I remember when I was younger they sent me to a different school district just to get the help I needed. Now these days they want to try and make sure all kids stay in the city limits! But none of the school out here in Granite City, IL have a program or classes for the deaf or hearing impaired to help my son. He goes to an Early Childhood Center now and he's only there for 2 hours. He's not even getting the attention he needs for his disability. I've called the School district here and they keep giving me the same answer they can't help him! It's not right! He is to far behind because this school he goes to has NO IDEA what to do for him, so they just let him play the whole 2 hours while he is there. I am very angry and very upset. I have tried everything I can think of and nothing seems to help. Does anyone know what to do here?? I can't just move, money is to tight these days. Even if we did have the money, we still can't because my husband is a Firefighter and an EMT here in Granite City, IL. And you have to live in area to stay with that job. I don't know what to do!! I don't want to send my 3 year old to Jacksonville IL School for the Deaf. Thats to FAR!!! I would only get him once or twice every month, plus he's to young for that kind of school.

All my pregnancy I've felt SO tired and mopey and exhausted, but today I'm very energetic, Don't wanna clean or anything like that lol, buuut.. i have been jumping up and down, and doing squats to try and lower the baby, and trying some maternity acupressure.   2 weeks ago I was 1cm and 50% effaced, haven't been checked since then, but I did have an ultra sound, a week ago the baby was practicing breathing, and measuring large, he was already 7lbs (I was 36 weeks).   I went through nesting (last week), been having alot of period cramps and BH, ESP. after sex, moving alot, etc.   Last week I had frequent BM towards the beginning of the week, then i had NONE, and then last night I had horrible *WARNING - TMI** diahrrea (sorry!!).   Annnd last night I also was up ALL night, for no reason, just couldn't sleep.   The doctor said they wont stop labor if it happens because the baby is so large, and he could come any day, and now I'm just over 37 weeks.   I'm ready to get this show on the road!!!   Did anyone else have these things happen just before labor?!   Pardon my energy, I feel great, for ONCE in 9.5 months!
20090202161213AAWkeZl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 2.5 year old is potty training. I have a few questions though?	i have gotten rid of the diapers except for at night and she goes in the potty 90% of the time maybe 2 mistakes a day but at daycare she makes no mistakes. whats up with that and also it ok to leave her in her dirty pants for 10 mins? It works but somebody told me it was abuse. I think thats crazy but what do you think

20090202163246AA0UvgH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I feel like the WORST mom in the world =(.....?	Poor Lilah hit her head on the coffee table today and it was my fault.  We were sitting on the couch playing and I had my hand beside her in case she toppled over b/c my couch is very soft and SOMEHOW she did and I didn't catch her in time and she smacked the side/back of her head on the edge of the table hard.      Of course she started crying and continued to do so for about 2-3 minutes while I tried to calm her down.  She was smiling and cooing and all happy about 10 min afterwards and has been since.  This happened about 3 hours ago.  I felt so bad, I was crying too.  I called the hospital afterwards and they told me just to watch her for anything out of the norm and make sure one of her pupils didn't get dilated more than the other.        I just still feel HORRIBLE.  She has a red line about the length of an inch and it's a little swollen (not noticeably, only if you feel for it), it kind of feels like a vein if that makes any sense.  I know it's not, but that's the only way I can describe it.        Please tell me I'm not the only mom who something like this has happened to.  To make this a question, has anything similar to this happened to your little one?        **She is 6.5 months btw.

20090202163530AAmKzEa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How will I know the right time to have a baby?	My husband and I want children. We're 26, almost 27. We originally planned on having a child by now. We make good money and have secure jobs, but we have a lot of student loan debt, so our money each month goes there. We don't know how we'd ever afford daycare, because it costs so much money and we both need to work in order to pay our loans, mortgage, bills. Another thing is, my husband acts so immature still (we've been together 10 years, married almost 5). He keeps "trying" to change and grow-up, it just hasn't happened yet. Nothing ultra-serious, but he doesn't help pay the bills, forgets to do things I asked him to a million times, doesn't initiate helping out around the house. I've said for years, that I couldn't imagine having a baby until he grew-up, but will I be waiting for ever??      I would like it if some experienced moms could let me know, how do I do it? How do I know the right time to have a baby? Can you ever really afford children? What did you do about daycare costs. We have no family that lives near us so having a family member watch the baby is also out of the questions. I know I am babbling, I just feel so lost. I feel my biological clock ticking and the only thing we both feel is missing from our lives is a child. Any advice you can give is much appreciated.

20090202115954AAGUgZn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How likely is it that I'm pregnant?	And before you tell me to take a test... it's too early. But I feel for you. I hate the questions where people ask if they're pregnant when they could just take a test to find out, too.      But here's my situation. I'd been on the pill for about two years but I recently went off it for around a month. I went back on but missed some days so I doubled up on the pills two days in a row (this is what the leaflet that came with them said to to).       A few days ago my fiance and I had sex. We usually use a condom but this time we didn't. I think some of the semen got inside of me. Is it likely I'm pregnant? My period isn't due for around two and a half more weeks. I know no one here will actually be able to tell me a yes or no, but do you think it's likely or unlikely?

20090202163732AAJIUys	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could this be implantation bleeding? Need your thoughts ladies!?	I'm doubting that it is unless I miscalculated my ovulation day. I was doing my cervix check this morning and afterwards I always wipe my hand off (sorry if TMI, but that is what I do!) and this morning I happened to wipe it on toilet paper. I looked at it because it always just looks wet and nothing else, but this morning it had a reddish tint to it. I know it is possible to have irritated my cervix and couse it to bleed, but the one time I did this it was actual blood, not like a faint coloring. I am currently on cycle day 18. I THINK I am 2 dpo, unless I ovulated sooner than I thought I did. Going by what I think, it is highly unlikely its implantation, but I never ever bleed anytime other than my period. Could this be it?? Also, on cycle day 15 when I wiped there was this like what I'd call a glob of mucus. It was clear and very very stretchy. Like I said, it was a glob. Lol. Weird....any ideas ladies??

20090202163152AAwZUO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How likely is this to happen?	I am 22 weeks pregnant and i went for my ultrasound scan today.The ultrasound technician did not say anything.She said everything looks normal.But my OB said my baby might have clubbed feet and that she is not sure about it.I asked her about it and she said that the baby might have to wear braces or special shoes to correct this.But still she was not sure about it.And she did not ask me to take another ultrasound or anything.She did also not ask me to take any other tests to check for it.      The doctor said that an ultrasound is always not a correct way to diagnose this problem.i am worried sick from the afternoon since i came back from the clinic.The doctor said there cud be nothing wrong as well.Pls people with exact experiences reply.i cant stop thinking about it.I also came to know that its a boy today.I am hoping every minute that my baby has nothing wrong with him when he is born.I want to know if anyone were told the same thing and it turned out to be nothing and hoe likely it is.Sorry for the long question.Thanks in advance.
20090202164624AAhApUE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I teach my nephew to leave pets alone?	My 15 month old nephew was scratched by my cat a few minutes ago on his face. I immediately put some soap / water, Neosporin and Band-Aid (that he'll most likely rip off later). He cried and I reassured him, but right now he is OK.      He has been around animals since day one. His parents, his regular babysitter and I have all isolated the animals. When the animals are out and he wants to holler at a cat, I keep telling him "NO" when he seems to understand and imitate me but I just wonder if that just goes over his head. I have started explaining things to him why some things are off-limits but then again, I wonder if I'm talking to myself. I take the kid away which he throws a temper tantrum. He's going through his terrible twos, by the way. His parents do not isolate the animals anymore; they believe "NO" and a trial-by-error should be enough. He has been scratched up before but this is the first time I've dealt with a toddler, especially one I'm related to.      My question is this - when / how do I teach my nephew to mind the animals? Am I doing this right or wrong?      Unless my golden retriever goes Cujo on my nephew, it is not an option to declaw any animals, give them up and et cetera.

She said nothing was wrong just that her dad had paddled her the night before really hard and sitting was uncomfortable. I tried to stay all cool about it like I found it normal but throughout the day I was able to get out of her what happened. Apparently she was watching a video online of an episode of House MD that she missed and the website she saw it on gave her computer a virus and deleted a lot of her father's work files. When he found out about it he took a disciplining paddle and made her bend over a table. He gave her a few hard swats with it over her jeans, and then he told her to take off her jeans and he proceeded to paddle her butt over her underwear. He made her count each stroke, and she had to call him sir. She didn't tell me how many swats she received.   Isn't she kind of old for a spanking? She says she is still spanked with a hairbrush when she is bad and paddling is for serious offenses, but I thought this situation was kind of weird. What do you think?      btw her parents are very nice, non abusive people. my family has known them for years and they are trustworthy and kind.

I smoked once during my pregnancy, at the time of birth I tested positive for marijuana but my baby tested negative. Now I have CPS in my life, is it even legal for them to drug test you when you are pregnant and on Medicaid, isn't this an infringement on my rights? Do pregnant patients on regular insurance get drug tested and reported or is it just those of us who can't afford the $400+ a month to buy insurance through our employers? I live in Texas if that helps anyone answer this question.   Also I don't need to be bashed for one poor decision, I need answers that pertain to my question not someone telling me I am a bad mother.    “Do not judge others, and you will not be judged."

Ok I will be 33 weeks pregnant tomorrow  and I am worried because I have been super stressed all day due to family problems and what not.  I had a little bit of mild cramping earlier, and so I didn't worry about it, but i took a nap and when I woke up I had some blood on my panties.  Not a whole lot at a all and there was none there when I wiped but I was just worried.  And I will just throw this in here I fell the other night.  So should i call my doctor, go to the ER?  Please help me out.
20090202163003AAkAqkw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How many Braxton-Hicks Contractions are normal?	Hello!    I was just wondering what was normal when it comes to Braxton Hicks contractions! I've had them for months now, but have been getting more and more of them just in the past week or so.       They don't hurt at all, they just make me very tense and then relax. I usually have them after I pee and after sex especially, but of course they pop up all the time.       When can I expect to start feeling pain with them?       They aren't regular at all yet, but does anyone else feel like they get these all throughout the day?       Thanks :)

Last week though, they've become a lot stronger and more painful, and get worse each day. They last for about 30 mins or more. Also Im having a heavier discharge. Im a little worried that Im starting to go into preterm labor but im not 100% sure. Any advice would be great. Thanks

20090202164322AAyNbyj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Please help with a question?	Ok. I am a 16 year old boy, and I need to make some money. A few months ago I bought some ring from a police auction that was $140. Recently I tried to sell it to a Pawn Shop but they only offered me $10, but I know its worth more than that cause it has a white gold band and diamonds and saphires. Just from this description, how much would someone maybe buy it for? I have no idea.         The only picture I have of it is in some video I made, and its at like :59.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQZu5U-Ag...

I just need advice for this, I'm being bullied by this popular girl Sasha(she has a lot of friends) she use to be my friend but today something changed at first it all started with me pulling out a snack, everyone started running at me for some and when it came to Sasha she grabbed a lot so I didn't really care so when I was at a corner with my friends I looked at her because she turned into someting I didn't like which was a *****(she got everything she wanted) so well I don't know I think I gave her a mean look or something but in class she hit me and my friend on the head and when it came to the next class the teacher called my name and another popular girl said "what kind of name is that?"(she teases me) so my plan is to just avoid her and Sasha but I just need advice to get this bullying off my shoulder, this keeps question keeps going over and over my head what if she wants to fight me and grabs all her friends to fight with her. anyway advice really needed I'm only a 7th grader if your asking.

No biggie and just put it down to a long day at work. However this morning I woke up and it was twice as worse and also spreading round my hip bones and to my tummy. Feels alot like period pain. This is my 2nd and you'd think I'd know the signs of labour but my first was an induction and I had an epidural early so I didnt actually feel any contractions. Can anyone either put my mind at rest or think it could be anything bad? I dont wanna go to the doc and find out I needed to do a poo or anything!!

20090202164302AAP6Tyr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should pregnant women receive medical benefits?	I personally dont think so because they put them selves in this predicament.

This is an unnecessary cost. what do you think?

She's an angel in all the situations that count, i.e. daycare, public, relatives etc. One on one she can throw a major attitude and dig in when she doesn't get her way.

I don't do too well in Math and have always been that way because I just hate it.   I never do my Math homework because I just don't want to, he assigns us way too much. (At least 30 problems)   My other classes are fine, it's just Math.   I'm pretty sure that my family can afford to send me to a private school because my Step-Dad owns his own business.   My mom says that I can't be home schooled though because I don't have a teacher.   Do you have to have a teacher to be home schooled?   Can you home school your self?   What is better Private or Home schooled?   Oh, and I live in Virginia if that effects anything.
20090202164856AAnwh1Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Questions for you parents maybe with similar situations?	My fiances son from another relationship is on a diet from his pediatrician..the mother didn't do a very good job on informing us what he can/cannot eat, meaning specific foods. I know he can not eat carbs/soda/redmeat. What else could I make for dinner tonight instead of grilled chicken and green beans?      Also, he wears an eye-patch for a lazy eye. I work at a daycare center and there is a child that goes there wearing the patch only 6 hours a day. He wears his from the time he wakes up til the time he goes to bed. Is this right? Have any of you experienced this with your own children, how long did you keep the patch on? Does it vary between children how long they should have it on? I just think all day everyday is excessive.      Thanks!

They wake up anywhere from 2 to 3 times at night. So far the only way I can get them to go back to sleep is by giving them a formula bottle. My doctor says they should be able to go all the way through the night without a bottle after they are six months old. Well here its 9 months and they still are waking for night time feedings at like 1am 3am and 5am. Any tips on how I can get around they feedings and possibly get them to sleep through the night? I don't want them to gain too much weight either. I know there's has to be a better way then the way I am doing it. I have tried just giving them water  they won't have anything to do with water. Please give me some advice. I am stuck.
20090202115604AAM5TgM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Self feeding and regular foods?	My daughter is 7 months old and we have been trying 3rds and she is doing really well, we gave her a small peice of cheese today at the grocery store and she bite and chewed it perfictly fine same with avacado the other night. I understode how to do the baby food and when she was ready to move on. 3 rds doesnt really have alot of options to feed so i guess that means we move on to small peices of real food. she doesnt get self feeding but then again she does. She knows where it goes but it doesnt always get in there. I kinda just put the food in her mouth myself and she chews it up. What do i do now that we are all done gerber?? im confussed on this and need some advice from moms.

20090202120101AAIBg51	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	11 soon to be 12 year old having behavior changes?	We have a 11 year old soon to be 12 years old. Just recently this year he is becoming a behavior problem. His grades are roller coaster and we at least think we are using different methods but he somehow still ends up being bad again. Every time we talk to him when he are hitting him with the truth he tries to pull out of the accountability by saying we are being mean to him when we are simply saying the truth. We have taken birthday parties, xbox time, tv time but still getting the same. He is already two grades behind and his principal and teachers say he has the ability but is not applying himself(a now and then lazy streak) that is hindering him. Now with this last incident at school they are possibly looking to hold him back based on the rules. Any christian advice out here? We could use it. Not interested in grabbing extension cords, 2X4's or irons to deal with it. Let me hear from some successful people who found the methods they used good.

20090202120416AA4qVye	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I need some advice about my first kiss?	I'm fifteen years old and never been kissed. I like my boyfriend and have thought about letting him kissed me. He told me he wanted to do so. He's never been kissed and i'm his first girlfriend. The same with me. I've never been kissed and he's my first boyfriend. So i guess we are good for each other. For some reason my first kiss is a HUGE deal for me. I'm not sure if i want to have my first kiss yet because i have always told myself that i would wait and have my first kiss when i was a little bit older. I told my mom about it and she said that i am older and that maybe i should if i wanted. It's not that i don't want to kiss him, it's just that i don't want to regret kissing him. Do you know what i mean? I know this is all confusing.
20090202120327AALYRop	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Little period blood??? ?	Hey me and my girlfriend have been having intercourse. Well we always use protection(condoms) and we didn't have a problem until this month we were scared just for nothing which was weird but just a weird feeling. She had her period 2 days late but she said it was very little blood. Only when she wiped or peed. only the second day her blood was a bit heavier than the other days. She was like this for 6 days. Is she pregnant or its normal. We were both very stressed and nervous too could  that be what made her period like that? She hasn't felt any other things just this. PLZ HELP

20090202165701AAQgc4F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	2WW...AND I NEED YOUR OPINION PLEASE!!!!!!!!!?	Hi there! I posted before and didnt get any answers from anyone that had ever experienced this so i figured i would try again.    I got my LMP on Jan 17th. It lasted 6 days before it totally disappeared. Then about 5 days after it ended my breasts started swelling... and they are huge right now. They are very sore all the way around and my nipples stay hard. I always get sore and swollen breast about 3 days before my period...and when they get sore, its usually only on the sides. Right now they hurt all around. I never get this when i ovulate. But the weird thing is that they started swelling and getting really sore before i should have even ovulated! Did anyone else ever experience this? And if so, what happened.....were you pregnant or did you get your period?

20090202165558AAivwc1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What is this exactly?	I'm doubting that it is implantation bleeding unless I miscalculated my ovulation day. I was doing my cervix check this morning and afterwards I always wipe my hand off (sorry if TMI, but that is what I do!) and this morning I happened to wipe it on toilet paper. I looked at it because it always just looks wet and nothing else, but this morning it had a reddish tint to it. I know it is possible to have irritated my cervix and couse it to bleed, but the one time I did this it was actual blood, not like a faint coloring. I am currently on cycle day 18. I THINK I am 2 dpo, unless I ovulated sooner than I thought I did. Going by what I think, it is highly unlikely its implantation, but I never ever bleed anytime other than my period. Could this be it?? Also, on cycle day 15 when I wiped there was this like what I'd call a glob of mucus. It was clear and very very stretchy. Like I said, it was a glob. Lol. Weird....any ideas ladies??   I mean, its not even enough to wear anything for. I don't even notice it when I wipe.....I just happened to notice it this time because I checked my positioning and it was off colored. Reddish.
20090202165344AAn1iun	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I had a hot flash today in class?	I'm 37 weeks. Out of nowhere I just got dizzy in class today. I dont understand it because I was well hydrated and the room wasn't that hot. I was sweating heavily and my lips were tingling. I noticed that my baby was moving a lot while it was happening. Is it normal for this to happen at 37 weeks? I did feel better when I got up and left the classroom. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow so no "go to your doctor" answers. I'm just looking for second opinions. Thanks.

20090202120542AATSukk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My husband and I were talking the other day and he asked me an interesting question...?	We don't have kids yet, but he was curious my opinion on this now.       He asked if I would take my teenager(16/17) to get a tattoo if they wanted one. My initial reaction was no if they want one they can wait till their 18 and have more time to think about it. My husband and I both have tattoos, I happen to like tattoos but what I would have liked when I was 16 could be very different than now.      Anyhow he then replied, but nowadays kids can get them when their underage if they want to at a party of a "sketchy" shop so wouldn't you rather take them to a reputable place?      I was torn! But I think that yes I would talk it over with them A LOT and of course they would pay but I would rather take them to a trustworthy place.      What are your thoughts?

20090202121527AA78lQr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	So frustrating!  Is this or is it not labor?	I'm due on Thursday.  I've been having bad contractions that never regulate themselves for 5 days.  Sometimes it will be only one or two, then i'll have 10 or so in a row between 5 to 8 minutes.  Usually taking a bath can get these to stop, but then they'll start up again when I'm done bathing.  These are not the typical BH contractions, but more of a period type cramping associated w/a low back ache.  Last night, however, they were VERY bad.  They woke me out of sleep and kept me up all night.  I was certain this was the real deal.  They were period cramps times 10 and it was almost like they sucked the air out of my lungs.  I found it difficult to breath.  It also felt like I had blood rushing to my ears and was extremely flushed.  I would have these for about an hour at 10 min. apart.  The actual contraction lasted about 45 seconds.  Then they would stop for a few hours, then start again for another hour to hour and a half.  They never got any closer togehter than 8 min.  Today, not much at all other than typical BH.  What's the deal?

20090202165415AAjBgN5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I need any advice.  My daughter is real sick--  any tips?	My daughter is 10 months old. She has a fever of 101.5, runny nose, coughing, pulling at ears, rubbing her eyes, threw up 3x this am, and now has horrible, pure liquid diarrhea.  I took her to the doctor today.  They said that her ears are fine, her throat is fine, and her lungs sound clear.  Nothing much they can do for her.   I need any advice on how to make her get through this (first time mom, and first sickness for baby).    I have done the vapor bath, saline in nose, aspirator, vicks on her chest, humidifier in the room, a vicks plug in the wall next to her crib, elevated the head of the bed...   Anything else???   She also won't eat anything.  She only drank about 4-5 oz of formula today.  She did eat some yogurt, applesauce, and crackers.  And lots of water out of a sippy cup.  She normally drinks 9 oz bottle before bed, and she wouldn't touch it just now.  I'm afraid she is gonna be up any minute coughing, or starving..  Please---any natural remedys, advice?? OH.. i did give her motrin right before bed for the fever.  Thanks

20090202165542AASBUFN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does having a shorter menstrual cycle change your due date?  I am 3 wks pregnant & have positive HCG already?	My menstrual cycles are 25-26 days, maybe 27.  I ovulate on the earlier side, around 12-14 days and then there's still 12-14 days for implantation.        I did a home pregnancy test on day 25 of my cycle and it was positive!  But everything I read says when you're three weeks pregnant like I am you won't have a positive test.  I'm getting confused.  Will the shorter cycle change my due date?  Related to this:  Can I be the equivalent of more pregnant than I really am, a little further along, due to slightly shorter menstrual phases?        I have some cramping and feel a bit funky but I feel sure the home test is right.  I'm going to get a blood test tomorrow.  I was surprised when my OB-GYN told me that they wouldn't see me until a month from now.        Thanks for any information on this you can give.
