I'm far from being sued - I've only missed 2 pmts - but because of my current situation, I may not be able to pay for a long time.        I'm just wondering what happens if down the road they would sue me.      1st of all, do they sue everybody who gets a certain amount behind on their credit cards?      What kind of court do you go to?  Is it at the local courthouse?  Do all the companies have local representatives in all the states, or counties?      If you have no income other than disability, and have no assets or property, what can they do to you?  Can they take your whole disability check, or any part of it?  What happens if you just don't have the money?  Does the judge order them to stop harrassing me, or what?  And what if, God forbid, the court would order me to pay the credit card companies and I just didn't have the money, and so I couldn't follow the court's orders!?  Could I go to jail?      Basically, I just want to know the general procedure and what generally happens at these hearings.

A "real" and proven home business opportunity, in the form of network marketing, requires focus, positive thinking, hard work, brain power, creativity, salesmanship, honesty, client service, a high level of personal ethics, dedication to "cold" market lead generation, and consistent follow up with leads.

To Whom It May Concern                    Dear Sir or Madam      I should like to be considered for any suitable finance and administrative roles that may be on offer at your organization.

Prior to my studying I was an Accounts Assistant for international construction conglomerate,.........., working on the ....... – ...... Oil Refinery contract which is now coming to an end.

I would welcome an early opportunity to expand, at interview, on this letter but – in the meantime – I am including a copy of my CV.      Yours faithfully,

20081029171127AAD7S8M	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	A question about mutual loans?	My friend (incidentally, a finance major) was telling me about mutual loans the other day. Now, I get what they are - that is, a big group of diversified stocks that you basically "rent" from someone much richer than you - but he was equating them to basically a savings account, only higher interest. He said that if I put in $100 a month into a mutual loan for the next thirty years, I'd be a millionaire by the time I decided to retire. Naturally, as soon as he tried to promise me a million dollars, I got skeptical. Can anyone explain to me how that would work, and if that really is the best way to save money over time (instead of, say, a savings account with a steady bank)? I realize with the economy the way it is, buying stocks is optimal at the moment, but I don't want to frantically start putting money into something that won't pan out in the end. Advice?

So this is the deal, My husband(since sep.08-bf since 08/2006)wasn't going to claim us on taxes,since the money was gonna go to child support,I didn't see that fair,so I told him that I rather for him not to,since she(ex's) told him that she wants to get a new car with that money,so that be better claim him because is illegal.It's not illegal since we're not being claim at all.He is doing the taxes,but just for himself.   Yesterday he received a letter from child support saying what we already knew,that they're keeping his tax refund money.Now,at the button of the letter says(my favorite part):If you are married,filing a joint income tax return,and you incurred this debt separately from spouse,who has no legal responsibility for the debt and who has income and withholding and/or estimated tax payments,your spouse may be entitled to receive her or his portion of any joint Federal Tax Refund.      So... Does this means that if he does claim us,child support will only keep his,and give me mine and the kids portion?      By the way,I wasn't working last year because I was pregnant,so It'll be the three of us,me,my son and the baby.

At my bank there is a sign that says "transactions after 3 pm will take place on the next business day"       I have two questions, does that apply to the bank itself?  They process transactions at midnight and post it to the previous day.        Also say if i withdraw $100 (my whole balance) after 3 pm and overnight transactions go through technically according to the bank, the $100 withdrawl should post the next day after any ACH payments or checks go through, right?        Correct me if i am wrong  I want someone else's opinion

20090203115734AAQeM2i	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	When making extra mortgage payments to your principal every month, is it better to do monthy or bi-weekly?	I have $1000 dollar in extra income a month that I would like to send as an extra payment to my mortgage. Given the current housing crisis, I have about $30K in negative equity, and my income is too high to qaulify for any federal assistance programs.      To help pay this equity down, I plan to send an extra $1000 a month to my mortgage.      Is there any benefit in sending this money in weekly payments ($250 a week) or even bi-weekly ($500 every other week) vs. just doing the one lump $1000 payment a month.      I cannot seem to find any amoritization schedule that take bi-weekly or weekly extra payments into account. Thanks.

Now when I first rented the room, I informed she can use it. It is not part of the rent or has been mentioned in the lease as such.   She has decided to move out and has not paid the rent for this month. The wireless router belongs to her so I disconnected it and decided to give it back to her. This morning she has written note stating that "Technically" she is still living there and I should put back the internet connection.    What are the legal implications? Should i put it back even though it's part of the rent-which has not been paid?
