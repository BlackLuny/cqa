How can people who believe the theory of man made global warming actually say that global warming is the cause of any and all extreme weather?

20090128114026AAxhNkE	Environment;Global Warming	Is there such a thing as a good Global Warming Video?	I've been following the Global Warming debate closely for a while now. I've read Houghton's book on it, seen Gore's movie and researched a bit into Lindzen's point of view (who, right or wrong, is incredibly boring to listen to).      I have heard both sides (believe Global Warming is caused by man vs. don't) say that they have thousands of scientists backing their claims, and that the other side is total nonsense. I am pretty well educated, but I am not a scientist. I was wondering if anyone knew of a source that presented both sides of the argument in a respectful manner, without any hysteria? Videos are nice because they are easiest to digest.      I am really concerned about the state of science in the world today. I feel like every time a report comes out (for or against) it is denounced by the other side for being funded by special interest groups... but if everything is funded by special interests, who's looking out for objectivity?
20090128115300AAVd6nj	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	Science/alternative energy question?	A homework problem:      i want to start a company that installs wind power generators on electric golf carts.

Why?

Can you recommend any caterers that offset their energy expenditure?
20090128130400AAMKmPA	Environment;Global Warming	What are some things I can do to help increase global warming?

I just want to do my part to make these winters a little more mild.
