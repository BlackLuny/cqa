It is a learned cultural response, rather than a behavior which would be naturally selected.

TCB2C8NPaa	Interesting question.  I wonder if there would be any huge differences based solely on the notion that most men who choose to be "house-husbands" are likely more domestic whereas women who are the work-force are often there as a matter of necessity (not saying they don't want to be working), and not because they have some inborn desire to be a CEO.  I'm not sure new techniques would develop, but men and women do engage differently with children, so having your father be your primary caregiver could influence development (particularly of personality).  Men are more physically interactive whereas women are more emotionally interactive with their children, so it's possible that kids with stay-at-home-dads might learn some practical skills that they otherwise would not.<br>  <br>  Much as it probably is true that SOME women bring something new to the table, a lot of women do not.  Many women in certain fields of work simply behave like men, because that is what they need to do to get ahead (i.e., Maggie Thatcher).  Those new things that we are supposed to be bringing are often tied to what are deemed feminine traits, but these are overgeneralisations and not all women behave that way (take for instance, Sarah's answer above where she states the house would be messier if a man were the stay-at-home parent -- certainly not true.  There are many tidy men, and even the neatest of people live in a messy home when there are children around).  I'm sure the same can be said for men.  Some men may have some sense of ingenuity in home-making, but I imagine most would fulfill the currently ascribed role without much revision.|`|PSaaCGeAaa	Although there were no children involved, thankfully, my ex was basically a house husband.  The main things I noticed was how dependent he was on me, not just financially, but as far as everything else.  The house was not well taken care of, if the sink backed up, or a door handle needed to be fixed, he waited until I got home and told me about it.  The place was basically a mess, so weekend we would try to clean up, in which I was expected to clean everything he didn't want to (mostly everything) and to put his things away while he piled my stuff up on a table.  From his example, I don't think men would really change things all that much or develop new techniques unless they are shortcuts that don't do as well.Many things in taking care of a household are cut and dry, not many improvements have been made other than the machines we use.  While roles are shifting, I don't think it will make much of a difference in the long run on the home front.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	The only difference I really see happening is an emergence of men in commercials for cleaning products.

Schizophrenics generally only have auditory hallucinations (such as hearing voices) Schizophrenia also do not generally have organized thinking.

3039d068f4b7831ec01ce8cc76fa87c3aa	I'm not positive but my guess is D.<br>  <br>  The taxi companies think that the demand will be the same (inelastic).  Even though the price goes up, the amount demanded will be the same.  Thus, they'll get more money because Q stays the same while P goes up.<br>  <br>  The citizen group feels the demand will lower with the increase (elastic).  As P goes up, the amount demanded will fall down the demand curve.  Assuming it's not vertical (as inelastic demand curves are), the new equilibrium will result in a decreased Q.<br>  <br>  Whether or not the new P and Q mean less revenue when multiplied together is indeterminable.  In other words, P * Q may or may not be less than P' * Q'.  This is because P is increasing while Q is dropping.  If P increases more than Q falls, the revenue will increase, but the opposite is also true.  Without knowing which changes more, the new revenue cannot be determined.|`|93m6VDoAaa	i will pretend like i understood that :)|`|41j6JRaAaa	i think it's d. <br>  <br>  increasing fares leading to lower taxi revenues sounds like demand is pretty sensitive to price; therefore, its elastic...that rules out A & B right away.  <br>  <br>  the local taxi companies think that raising fares will generate higher revenues..this means that demand isn't as much affected by the price.  people will more or less still use the local taxi companies just as much..so, making fares a little higher will not affect the amount of demand but would even increase revenues. this is an example of inelasticity.
8ab9a5cdb36e72e0ec7c96d43b5e5e78aa	Simple. You have had everything done for you and subconsciously you feel guilty. You haven't been taught HOW to do things for yourself, and don't have to, so you don't. Turning to alcohol or drugs won't help you be happy with you, they will only help you run away from yourself. The only problem is, no matter where you go, there you are!  My advice to you is to quit feeling sorry for yourself and get involved in a group that helps people that are TRULY unfortunate. Something like Big Brothers/ Sisters, or YMCA or a homeless shelter for example.Once you quit focusing on YOU , and are able to make a difference  in the lives of others, you will feel a sense of self worth and will be able to put that conscious to bed ! Good luck to you!|`|V0S92gZLaa	I feel just how you do.<br>  <br>  I only stopped cutting about a week ago, and i still think of it all the time. The only reason i stopped is cuz my parents took away all my razors.<br>  <br>  And i do well in school, i used to be one of the high honors kids, but i stopped caring, but still care enough that I hate myself when i dont get the perfect grades i want. But i dont want to do too well or be too successful because I am ashamed of myself and what i have done, and i feel i dont deserve much of anything.<br>  <br>  But i know how you feel. I have the feeling that my girlfriend is falling away because I just want to be with her, not for any specific reason, I just want to be loved by her, and have her tell me that it will be all right.<br>  <br>  But I have that feeling. I feel that I am so alone, and that no one else will ever understand me, and I only felt that my gf could understand me, and now she's fading away....<br>  <br>  But anyway, tell you boyfriend how you feel. Tell him that you really need him. If he really loves you, then he will understand. At least I would with my gf. If i were your boyfriend, asking for help wouldn't be "bringing me down" at all. I would love being with my gf.<br>  <br>  My opinion: tell those you love and trust how you feel. Or, if you have trust issues (like me), tell new people, and have them grow close to you. I feel like a hypocrite saying this, but go to a psycologist and have yourself checked out. They can give you medicine that will make you feel better about yourself, i've heard. I might even try myself...<br>  <br>  Anyway, hope i helped. Just know that people love you, and, even though i don't know you, i still can sympathize with you, care for you, give you a quick internet hug. Not everybody in the world is bothered by simple requests for love.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and i honestly hope you get feeling better.|`|OqveEUqkaa	In the autumn of my life, I have noticed, that when one is given things, without earning them they are not appreciated. It is like drug, more is what  you want, trying to feel that first pleasure. It does not stop, ad infinitum. I suggest that you seek medical help as soon as possible and talk to someone who will guide  you through  to see a light at the end of your tunnel.Make friends with your Mother and talk with her.You are not a hopeless person,you only feel hopeless. Perhaps, volunteering  your services to a charitable group, a nursing home,or hospital .This will help to boost your self esteem and feel a part of the community and not feel alone.Once you become a giver you will be less inclined to seek self satisfaction,and kindness to yourself.

PBjYkapHaa	regarding ur first question ("what is the effect of holding and buying so many U.S. bond by the Chinese govt?isn't that makes the U.S. dollar appreciate and Yuan depreciates?")<br>  no, issuing debt in the form of bonds does not strengthen a currency. and if anything, if you were to predict it doing so- the opposite would be more likely. that the country that is capital rich might increase in strength (parity) because of such a purchase; but again, there's no guarantee either way. <br>  the yuan has appreciated for a few reasons, though currency trading has lesser variables than equity and other markets- attributing a countries price parity to one single issue is probably untrue regardless of which one you see as the answer.

7J6m0L3Haa	Are you kidding or just ignorant? Women flatter men constantly. They squeeze themselves into uncomfortable clothing for their attention. They wear hundreds of dollars of cosmetics that can cause *cancer* to meet the masculine idea of female beauty. They simper and preen and giggle to bolster a man's idea of his strength and virility. They fake orgasms. They raise his children and cook his meals. They do his laundry and rub his feet. They bring him coffee and staple his reports.<br>  <br>  The gender role proscripted for women exists solely to make sure that the man feels that he is stronger and smarter than at least 50% of the population at all times. He conceals his body with clothing that comfortably fits while the majority of the female population starves and preens and paints and squishes and lifts for his viewing pleasure and the approval of his gaze.<br>  <br>  That was a very weak argument you posted there, if I say so myself.<br>  <br>  Edit: yes, because the wage gap, effect of marriage on the average woman's free time and than the effect of divorce on her net worth really illustrates that men take such good care of women. Not. Pray tell, what the heck do women gain from faking an orgasm? That's Stockholm Syndrome of the highest order in which a poor woman is socialized to think that a man's assurance of his virility is of more worth than her sexual pleasure.

I'm constantly complimented on how warm and engaging I am, no matter who I talk to (talking about real life.  Not the ninnies I fight on here) and believe me, I talk to a lot of men.  What right do you have to say I'm not when you've never even met me?  And since you say "women" and not "some women" or "women I've encountered", you can't deny you are talking about me.  I'm a woman and I am nothing like this.  Either frame your questions through your own experience, and call it that, or provide scientific data for your claims. <br>  <br>  But then, you've made it clear what you think of the opposite sex.

u7UnUZXnaa	i don't think when people say their life sucks they actually mean it. i don't usually say it because then i feel ungreatful and snobby. i think people only say it because it's easier for them to do then to actually think that their life could be 10 times worse. my life could be better, but who am i to complain? i have the best friends ever and a family who would do anything for me. just because my dad drinks and im moving to Connecticut in less then i year doesn't mean i should go around and say my life sucks just so people feel bad for me.|`|xvxT46iJaa	My life (especially from looking at it from the outside) is pretty good. I go to a good university, do an interesting course, live in a nice halls, have amazing friends and a family that love me, my parents are still together, i'm dating a really nice guy, i have travelled to more places than most people ever will, i don't (generally) want for much and i'm healthy. I know that i am really lucky and when you lay it out like that, i have an amazing life, but there is more to life than having those things; at times i feel like i am drowning in uni work and that i will never be able to catch it all up; in my flat, we are all barely speaking after a huge arguement a week ago, and i spent the entire weekend working alone in my room; sometimes i am so scared i will fail and disappoint my family that i can't sleep for days; the rest of my family are ridiculously clever and i feel like no matter how hard i try, i will never be as good as them; despite that i am dating a new guy, i miss my ex more than i can say which is made worse by him not even being in the country anymore.<br>  None of those are life or death problems, and to most people they probably seem pathetic, but to me they are important, and although i know that i have a really good life,  the problems i just mentioned negatively impact it. I know loads of people who have worse problems than i do, and the vast majority of the time, i am good at choosing to be happy rather than frustrated and upset over what's not perfect in my life because i know that i'm not homeless, dying or starving, but every now and then they are overwhelming and i just need a couple of days where i don't have to be perfect and smiley.
0XUtrR2Laa	In my opinion, I'd say that you're the kind of person who doesn't have 'shallow' attractions to people; you'll build yours up over time, and it'll be deep and meaningful, rather than a brief "crush", based on personality. Also, I'd say it's an issue of trust, you just haven't found the right person yet. For some people it takes years, and others no time at all. <br>  <br>  I'd say that your depression and anxiety could possibly deepen your problems: you might subconsciously be anxious of being hurt, and therefore distance yourself emotionally. As somebody who gets depressed quite often, I recognise the feeling of not feeling connected and in tune with the people around me, and it can be quite hard, and sometimes it FEELS impossible to shake away the apathy and the feeling of a sterile environment.<br>  <br>  As I said, I think that in your case, you need to find the right person for you. It's not strictly 'normal' to feel 'incapable of feeling attraction' for other people, but it's not abnormal either; a lot of people feel this way when they're dealing with depression. Good luck, and I hope I helped a little (although I may be totally barking up the wrong tree here) =]|`|tOIz5WB3aa	I know how you feel.

VelE30y7aa	That's simple. It's because some dreams mean more to you than others, so it's easier to recall them.

BoqbYQ1Naa	In 1987 I was asked to serve on a committee that was putting together a social weekend for a group I had joined. The chairman had an idea, a vision, that had never been done before, and everyone made fun of him. I didn't know him well, but that didn't prevent me from joining in.<br>  <br>  The weekend was a success. The chairman made his vision a reality and people loved the weekend. But the ones who laughed at him behind his back were still angry at him because he turned out to be right after all. I watched him work hard and keep to his vision and ignore his detractors, and realized I'd grown to admire him greatly. The thought that I might have hurt him because I behaved like a jerk was devastating. <br>  <br>  The group met on the first Friday of evey month for a night of dinner, drinks and socializing. I sought him out, sat down with him and apologized for being such a jackazz and asked if he would please forgive me. He did and we became best friends. For years thereafter, he would bring up my apology and how much it meant to him. When we attended the funeral of a mutual friend on a scorchingly hot day, he let me lean on him. When his only child, his grown son, was found dead of a drug overdose, I let him lean on me.<br>  <br>  Sadly, we're no longer in touch. He developed Parkinson's and when I would call him, didn't know who I was. Last I heard he was in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. Breaks my heart to know that.

The employee then thought it would be prudent to SHOW the email to this mother, who then in turn called me and read me the riot act.  As she should have.  Although it was less than smart of the employee to show the email to the parent, it was my fault for putting something like that in an email.  Needless to say, I was horrified and apologized profusely. Thankfully, the parent and I had a long over due clearing of the air and now have a very open line of communication, but it was a horrid situation for which I was completely responsible
PW8zXjdBaa	It takes as much work and effort and energy to be be balanced or relatively happy as it does to be sad. Believe it or not you set yourself up to be disappointed by determining the outcome whether it is real or manufactured by you. It is trap we set up for our selves as a kind of self fulfilling prophecy.<br>  <br>  It comes from a low self esteem.

DXh2BlCraa	It is a big thing in America that people look each other in the eye when having a discussion. According to Americans, if you look away when talking to somebody, they believe you have something to hide. <br>   Americans make such a big deal about looking somebody in the eye that you're talking to.<br>  <br>  They also think somebody's handshake says something about that person. If you go for a job interview, you're expected to have a firm handshake.<br>  <br>  The Japanese on the other hand consider looking somebody in the eye as very disrespectful, especially if the person you're talking to is your superior. I think Nigerians are the same way.<br>  <br>  So, what obtains in America is more of a culture than anything else. As far as I'm concerned, not looking somebody in the eye while you speak to them is not a sign that you have something to hide.<br>  <br>  I also disagree with the firm handshake theory.|`|Tq6R4DN3aa	in south africa looking in the eyes is very disrespectful,|`|6dd347b7d5174333a63cb804b9699c2eaa	I don't know.<br>  Something, I feel shy when i look at someone straight in the eye.<br>  Mabye it could be intimidation.|`|NuXv6YLWaa	It all strings from guilt.|`|wyGbmN9Taa	You must be free of guilt and have the presence of God in your heart.|`|4CsGde1qaa	This stare is not so hard  for me.

6a1e9cfecba9cca5f73fcc28bd074580aa	Hi Becks.<br>  <br>  You have to be able to turn that obsession on and off at will. You need to have faith in the outcome. If you were to think about something all the time, that something will take over you. You need a break from that constant thought sometimes.<br>  <br>  If on the other hand you learn how to control that obsession you will be a very successful and happy person. If you can have laser focus about the one task you are doing while you are doing it, not only will you be more productive and get more done, but you will be able to achieve greater things.<br>  <br>  ( Some tips on how to control your obsessions.)<br>  <br>  Come to terms with the obsession. You may have trouble getting over an obsession because you think it’s obtainable. To get over it, you need to give yourself a pep talk. For example, say things like, “I know I will never get a date with TV show, or a band), so I must let this obsession go.”<br>  <br>  Distract yourself with something new. You may want to take up a new hobby to help forget about your obsession. Your hobby should involve a lot of brain power to keep you distracted. Good hobbies to try are chess and Sudoku.<br>  <br>  Lean how to meditate. When you meditate, you think about nothing, you are free of the thoughts in your mind. This is a master skill that should be sought.<br>  Remember what's important. Try to stay relax and remember what's really important in life.<br>   <br>   Focus on the outcome and have faith. Have faith that you will find the answer, be happy on the path to success, but have constant faith and focus on already achieving the destination.<br>  <br>  Do something fun once and a while. Do fun things, spend time with love ones.<br>  <br>  Have separate work area and relaxation area. Have an area where you work and do nothing else but work in there. Then leave that area once the work day is over.<br>  <br>  Give yourself time. No one expects you to get over an obsession overnight. The obsession may have taken time to develop, so the same amount of time may be needed to get over it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have faith Princess. Everything is going to be okay.<br>  <br>  Wishing you sunshine, love and laughter. Not just today, but all the days after xx<br>  <br>  "LIVE,LOVE,BE HAPPY AND *SMILE* EVERYDAY..!!!"|`|AA11230878	This is not an obsession its improving your knowledge|`|l5IjG90oaa	I'm like you.. my mum thinks i have asperges!

AA11728784	Did that before, but I think you deserve better. If your not ready to deal with a man with children that are not yours, get out the relationship. Hopefully your just dating and not married to this drama that's not yours. Life is to short to be stressed out. I personally had dated a guy that stressed me out. He had a child from a lady that he still loved and kept wanting to go back in his past while with me. I had to let him go to have a peace of mind. To relieve myself from stress, I did things that made me happy. Such as, taking myself to the spa, going to the movies, or whatever you see as relaxing, fun, and not necessarily expensive.

AA12098193	Not too many words are used as often and in so different ways as the word "instinct". So there might be a scientific definition to the term, and I accept DrDavidCamp's definition as scientifically correct. Unfortunately he includes a "reflex" as an example of what an "instinct" is. So if reflexes are part of behavior, then blinking is behavior as well. So what keeps us from including breathing as behavior? How do we find non instinctive behavior?<br>  The word "instinct" must be used to refer to a specific kind of behavior. Otherwise it will be as it is today, a common sense name for just about anything people like to fit into it. Many times you will find it used instead of "impulses", "natural response" or even of "intuition", "emotions" or your "inner voice"! It might as well be your soul's secret identity.<br>  In order for it to be a scientific term it must be properly defined.<br>  One premise of common sense is that "instinct" is something that all animals have, so if humans are animals as well, then humans should have the same properties that all animals have, including "instincts". But what is it that the word "instinct" explains in animals in the first place? Basic behavior. So what are the basic animal behaviors? Eating? Breading? Fighting?<br>  So I agree, an instinct is a genetically programmed behavior but much more complex than reflexes and much simpler that learned behavior.|`|oZPLI8Y5aa	An instinct is a genetically programmed behavior that is in your genetic structure. Like the startle reflex.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	an instinct is like your inner voice. for example, if your somewhere where your not suppose to be and your body is just telling you, lets get out of here now. thats an instinct. it protects you, but not if you ignore it

I would appreciate if you did not call these people ' crazy' . It is totally insensitive and unhuman. Second of all, they are humans just like us- they have things and dont have other things-and they are not aware of it on their own. Just like we might not be aware of our anger problems until someone else tells us about it. But once you try to explain to them you can see that it is very sad how they respond to it. They tell you they understand you and all of a sudden it hurts you to know that these people are aware of their dissabilites. Life must be very hard for them. They are really nice people and deserve better.<br>  <br>  Sorry I reported this question you insensitive prick|`|8ab40e110856e04b57a0ea78b7f1ea14aa	I guess it's all in what you deem 'crazy'..<br>  <br>  There seems to be a trend in the intellectual society , where, after they retire, they go wacko!!<br>  Maybe not everywhere, but around here..<br>  <br>  Two cases..<br>  First (names changed to protect the innocent.. or me from being sued(LOL) )<br>  Shandee' was an intellect..

If I'm going to hassled & forced to undergo inquiries & checks "in the interest of security" as a facet of everyday living, then I have no problem maintaining that mode & not letting my guard down during my waking hours. Helping others with no official security around unfortunately falls into that category.  You know as well as I do that the worst happens when it LEAST expected.

The older women know that being treated in a chivalrous, respectful manner by men is their birth-right.  The younger generation of women have chosen to forgo theirs in adoption and application of modern feminist doctrine.

Really, if I see anybod physically struggling with something, I will stop and help them. I never even, until reading your question just now, considered that it was a noteworthy event. That's because I'm a man. Men like to use their physical strength to help people. <br>  <br>  Older women especially probably do expect younger men to help them move stuff. That's because younger men SHOULD help older women with heavy stuff. That is one of the fundamental ethics of most civilized societies and cultures.

All any elder wants is a little bit of genuine love and attention and by their age male or female they have learned this power trip over gender is a crock.  Next time you help someone ask them.|`|KwNpyp3saa	I think because she struggled with the bag herself and didn't ask you shows she didn't expect you or anyone to help her. Since you did help her, I am sure she appreciated it. <br>  <br>  I don't think it is a younger/older issue. It has to do with the individual. Haven't you noticed any younger women who expects people to do things for them? Even thought they are perfectly capable. Some people just have an attitude they are entitled to help.<br>  <br>  Basically, young or old, if someone needs help- it wouldn't hurt to help out.
5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Some men and women would like to go back to the supposedly magical days of the US 1950's, when supposedly "all" women were housewives, even if they were single, widowed, or divorced or their family was living in poverty. My grandmother left my grandfather and worked her whole life, starting in 1940. As soon as she could, my step grandmother got out of the house in the 1950's and got a part-time job, she couldn't stand being home all day with the kids. But no one likes to deal with facts..<br>  <br>  The ones who think women should not have choices about what they do with their lives, also don't think men should, so they may not answer your question. IT's interesting how many of the men who say women should stay a housewife for life and should never divorce, were also men left by their wives, and now these same men also say women are gold-diggers who just want to use a man for his money. Just because these men feel used doesn't mean the women they married had had any plans to ever leave them. But as these guys don't see anything wrong they could have possibly done, they certainly can't blame themselves for the choices they made, so they blame women and blame feminism for actually giving women the opportunity to leave them behind. <br>  <br>  I think sometimes the true feeling of these men are "how dare that witch leave me after all I did for her" and they don't get it that their wives probably felt the same way, that they felt unappreciated for all they did for their families. A lot of ppl get lazy and take their partner for granted and resentments grow and so does distance. But it's easier to blame feminism than have to face your own contributions to the mess you've made of your life..<br>  <br>  FYI: For those that haven't heard men or women say that women's primary role should be that of a homemaker, check out this recent college article titled "Belief in traditional gender roles lingers on Hillsdale's campus": <a href="http://media.www.hillsdalecollegian.com/media/storage/paper1270/news/2009/01/29/Focus/Belief.In.Traditional.Gender.Roles.Lingers.On.Hillsdales.Campus-3603584.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://media.www.hillsdalecollegian.com/...</a>|`|V1MptCMiaa	Not me|`|NYU37jfGaa	It would be impractical.  Women have always had to work for a living, and always will.  Single women have always worked, and so have many married women.

What I would like to see is less denigration of housewives (I refuse to use the lame term 'homemaker').<br>  <br>  I think it is interesting that you say 'nothing but' housewives, for instance.

8d8ejHPfaa	Sometimes, a dream really is a wish your heart makes.... based on your wording, you seem to be dreaming about something you don't actually have in your life at the moment.  If you're asking whether this dream will come true, well, it will eventually, but that is up to you, and how you take advantage of opportunities that come your way, it's not a sign, or a prophecy, more a reflection of your desire to be in a loving relationship.  It's interesting that you apparently dreamed it through her eyes one night, and through yours the next, perhaps the stuff you saw through her eyes was a kind of "rehearsal".  If the girl in the dream is someone you know, you may be exploring feelings about her and rehearsing some stuff, mulling over how best to approach her perhaps?  If she is unknown to you, you could be interacting with a more feminine side of yourself, and exploring different aspects of male and female qualities within yourself, embracing them all as part of a whole person...

Then we both went back to the dudes house...or my house...i had a house in Italy.  And my friends were at my house too.  And me and the guy were in this room that had a bed in it and the lights were dimmed and it was really cool.  Then we both sat on the edge of the bed and started kissing, i could feel it!

kiY9kihbaa	Family is very important in Poland.  Nearly all Polish women want a big family.  Women play a big role in Polish society.  Unlike some European countries, the responsibility to provide for the family is not all on the man.  Women are expected to care AND provide for the family.  Polish women are also said to be some of the most beautiful in the world (not sure if that's true).  Add it all up and Polish women are some of the most desirable wives in the world.<br>  <br>  Men are expected to be strong, masculine role-models.  None of the metro-sexual stuff.  I honestly don't know much more than that about the men.<br>  <br>  Children are adored and taught to be very family-oriented.  Like i said, a big dream of many Polish women is to start a family.  Also, divorce is not very popular (frowned upon), and as such is not as frequent as in the States.<br>  <br>  Polish people are very social.  If you've ever been to Taiwan and observed the culture there, it has some similarites to Polish social culture.  What I mean by that is that there are subtleties that are hard to pick up for outsiders.  They grow up trained to understand them.  Public displays of insults are extremely rude and reserved for only people you hate and want to ruin.  For example, calling someone a moron in the workplace would be bad for both sides of the exchange.<br>  <br>  Communication of disagreements in a marriage is almost non-existent.  Couples are expected to care for their partner and not voice any dissent (also frowned upon).  The combination of marrying early (desire to have a family) and little communication leads to some difficult marriages, but this is well tolerated.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Poland is not without corruption in government or law.  As such, both women and men are versed in acts of protectionism (looking out for your own self or your own family).  Fiercely loyal.<br>  <br>  Did that help?
cAMleGWlaa	From a psychological standpoint, love is, as defined by Psychologist Robert Sternberg (who formulated a triangular theory of love) and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components.<br>  <br>  So yes, under the right circumstances, people who are just friends can fall in love.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Yes I believe in the fact that just friends can become more over time and yes I truly believe that from friendship can blossom love.. it can grow..  but I don't see that as the Psychology of falling in love and I don't see it is possible with manipulation.. it often happens and if it happens it does because it's meant to be...<br>  <br>  Well I don't believe love can be won by manipulating it.. that's bull.. otherwise I might as well go to a gypsy and buy a love potion.. I believe neither.. I believe as you said below.. two people become perhaps physically attracted, and they get to know each other better and become friends, they have mutual respect for each other, honesty and trust.. and can talk to each other at ease about everything that matters to them.. plus the physical attraction.. and they both decide to take it to a higher level.. <br>  <br>  Wouldn't it be awful if people got messed around with like this ''psychology'' project suggests.. and a hypnotherapist could hypnotize 2 people and suggest to them.. when both are under hypnosis that when they wake up they will be eternally in love.. maybe before they have not even met.. LOL.. I hope this won't happen.. I already think the idea of cloning is a sick idea.. maybe one day people will be made into robots and get suggested what thoughts to think and whom to fall in love with .. I am scared of that happening.. I hope not in my lifetime... that one can manipulate people like this!!!<br>  <br>  That just friends can become more that just friends has nothing to do with manipulation.. it can happen.. it happened before that 2 good friends became life partners and this happened in a natural way.. because often love starts with physical attraction and being friends.. just friends.. your partner also has to be your friend.. otherwise a relationship is not going to work.. I definitely agree that 2 friends can become lovers as well. but that is something that ''just happens'' one day they know it's more than a friendship.. that it's love.. that they have even deeper feelings for each other.. happens all the time.. that doesn't need psychiatric manipulation.. that needs 2 people thinking along the same lines... and it can happen that friends become lovers and husband and wife...xx|`|856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	"Love is the sincere wish for others to be happy and to be free from suffering. Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We can develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|Ajy2wXiuaa	true love is beyond anyones undertanding. but superficially, yes love is selfless and it makes you surrender your ego, giving you the chance of showing your true self. and sex is only secondary, if any at all.|`|HY0Dxfnqaa	True love is a selfless thing.<br>  <br>  If you REALLY love someone, you love and want for them to be happy, even if it's not with you.|`|ed910418c525aafef203ce51a2249facaa	IDk I KINDA OF FORGET HOW IT FELT...........

(Whether you agree with him or not.) <br>  <br>  Below is a link I found to a list of 50 "classic" works of psychology. Some of them are more modern than others. Some are easy to read, many are not. But it gives you a good start. Of them, I really like the following...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.butler-bowdon.com/50psychclassicshomepage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.butler-bowdon.com/50psychclas...</a><br>  <br>  Oliver Sacks, "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for A Hat"<br>  Oliver Sacks is an amazing writer with broad, varied experiences. His stories are compelling and easy to read. He has numerous books available. I love them all.<br>  <br>  Victor Frankl, "Man's Search for Meaning"<br>  A survivor of the German Holocaust, this book is inspirational and challenging. He also has other books.<br>  <br>  Malcolm Gladwell, "Blink"<br>  A modern book by a modern writer. Very compelling work.<br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Other books I've read and enjoyed...<br>  <br>  "Wasted", Marya Hornbacher, about eating disorders<br>  <br>  "Night Falls Fast", Kay Redfied Jamison, about suicide<br>  .........................................<br>  Some classics I haven't read...<br>  <br>  "Girl Interrupted"<br>  "The Quiet Room"<br>  "Sybill"|`|cAMleGWlaa	Most Psychology Text books will probably be boring. but try "Psychology For Dummies" I found that this is extremely funny but at the same time informative in the field of psychology.

Who gives birth to baby's?|`|NYU37jfGaa	If the parents aren't married, then the children are illegitimate.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Basically, a child is considered to be illegitimate if his/her parents were not married to each other at the time of the child's birth. That said, this a rather archaic term and is not commonly used these days. The fact is that a very large number of children are born "out of wedlock" these days  and there is no longer the terrible stigma attached to this issue as there used to be.<br>  <br>  The important thing is that no matter what the circumstances of a child's birth, it in no way minimises their legitimacy as a person and a citizen.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|Lx9bVRGyaa	An illegitimate child is one born out of wedlock, meaning any child conceived by unmarried parents.  It does not matter the gender, but the situation.  IMO, this is a terrible way to describe a child and I lose a little respect for people who use the term for any reason.|`|096b7gBHaa	supposedly nobody should have illegitimate children. in another words, the process to make a baby should be done after marriage. life would be more proper if all our ancestors, us and the next generations are both made and born legitimately.|`|AA10895669	Can't have one with out the other.|`|ybFxYlHxaa	Sure, a woman can donate her eggs and they can be fertilised and planted in another woman.|`|c6g92RRVaa	not in the victorian times she was shunned out of her family to live on the streets, while nothing happened to the male|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Children are common|`|AA11414292	That's a Bastard of a question.<br>  OF course she CAN if its out of wedlock
XzsvBhJWaa	I totally understand. I have no idea how or why women talk so long on the phone, or why they actually WANT to do that. It's unbelievable. I hardly ever answer the phone because people just never shut up.<br>  <br>  I even know a couple of guys who are like this. They will talk for HOURS, even though you are tired of the conversation after a few minutes, even though you keep trying to hang up. I know one guy who gets mad if I don't have anything to talk about with him, and he constantly nags me about "why don't you ever want to talk!" I'm like dude we just talked for 20 minutes! What more do you want!|`|ZjUL6aSeaa	I do that with my distant family.  But sometimes it's men (like my brother in another state) talking back for just as long.

Humans are social creatures.  I try to keep my cell bill down though.|`|UVnr7wrmaa	It is pretty amazing for us girls. I guess that when we have a lot to say to each other, we talk for ages.

Its not amazing , plenty of stupid birds just cherp and cherp all damn day and crap on my car , its really not that amazing its just down right  annoying. I hate that women do this, stop talking and start DOING so you can invent some stuff and rule the world like men. They just sit there and drone on and on about men.

Okay see you there.|`|cmoGATT9aa	haha. it's one of our many skills. :P<br>  i dont know, everything we have done since we last talked just flows out.<br>   i usualy only stop talking to my best freind on the phone if the battery is running out or we have to get off. <br>  <br>  <br>  haha, good luck decoding the ever amazing and unique skills of the femals species while i try to decod yours. <br>  <br>  :P<br>  xx|`|phH2dVYZaa	My enrichment teacher was saying something about this, though unfortunately I forgot ;] Something about instincts.<br>  <br>  Anyway I think women are more sensitive/read more into things than men, and are more emotional.

Even the Bible mentions the story of Potipher's wife getting mad and falsely accusing Joseph of raping her in Genesis (40 I believe?).  Whether you believe the story is true or not, the fact it's even written there shows that false accusations have been around as long as mankind has been around.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should re-read what I wrote again.  If it was in the Bible back then, somebody had to be aware of it.<br>  <br>  Are you going to get on the answer below mine for using a Bible story, or are you only criticizing men for it?<br>  <br>  No answer.

'Taking back the forum' I see  ; )  I'm not sure that bombarding the forum with your point of view is going to take back anything except maybe take us back to the days when you used to do this all the time. <br>  <br>  Its sad that feminism has encouraged horrible crimes like rape and domestic violence to be used as weapons against men.<br>  <br>  "When it comes to nonreciprocal violence between intimate partners, women are more often the perpetrators". In fact women were found to be the perpetrator 70.7% of the time. <a href="http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/15/31-a" rel="nofollow">http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/conte...</a><br>  <br>  In the US today the term 'domestic violence' has been expanded to include simply being "afraid" or "fearful" of harm from your partner. Two thirds of US states include in their definition "psychological distress" and a third include "harassment". Can you imagine a man insisting that his wife is arrested because he says she is harassing him? There is a good chance that he will be arrested instead, as happens to about 20% of male domestic violence victims who seek help from the police in the UK  <a href="http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/PlightOfMaleVictimsSummaryMay08.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/Pligh...</a>  In the real world this definition of domestic violence only works when the accusation is made by a woman. In the opinion of Elaine Epstein, former president of the Massachusttes Bar Association,  because the definition is so wide, it is wide open to abuse: "In many cases, allegations of abuse are now used for tactical advantage". <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinelawyersource.com/news/false-allegation-domestic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinelawyersource.com/news/f...</a><br>  <br>  Edit<br>  "I prefer credible stats from credible sources". <br>  LOL!

I think you should assess what the costs are for trusting people.  Maybe you are too paranoid.  It is natural to want to protect yourself, but sometimes we go to far.  Some things we try to protect are not worth it.  Try to assess the costs of what you are trying to protect.  Maybe you can survive if people know some of your "business".  Sure, people may make fun of you or joke about you, but if you lighten up and laugh with them and realize everyone has quirks, you can turn it to your advantage.  I mean, some quirks are endearing and make people lovable - and stress their humanity.<br>  I used to want to be a man of mystery when I was younger.  Then a friend told me that I was transparent.

I digress because it's really the business of the yanks and not mine.|`|FUIBscKGaa	Doodlebug,  NOW is a feminist organization.  Of course they are trying to put more women in power.  That's our job.  I keep saying that over and over.  I keep explaining that, yes, when our critics say we've been plotting for decades, they are correct.  We've also been carrying out those plans for decades.  You can sit down and read early feminist philosophers who spelled the whole plan out.  The theory is "the oppression of women is at the root of all oppression".  They felt that if women could secure their rights, and gain eventual equal political power, that all oppression (racism, war, poverty, and many more) would end.  There is solid proof that every single culture equally ruled by men and women are peaceful.  Also, crime and poverty go down in direct proportion to the increase of women in political power.  First step, get the vote.  Step two, gain the right to work and have economic power, free of dependency on men (the laws feminist fought for the protection of women from their abusers is part of securing the right to economic freedom.  There are also others.) Third step, use that economic power to place women in political power, and don't stop until rule is 50-50 between men and women.  After that, all of the ills of patriarchy will end.  Feminist Theory is a scientific theory, because it is testable (real theories must be testable.  You can't say goblins exist, you can't get by with it because testing for goblins is impossible.)  There must be experiments carried out to prove the hypothesis correct.  So far, the earlier feminist philosophers have been correct.  I see no reason to doubt them now, and firmly believe that feminism will be to thank for world peace.  <br>  <br>  In light of the very real philosophies of very real women, NOW asking for anything isn't as sinister as you make it out to be.  Better billions to childcare than making another bomb.  Heck, we have so many of those that the Russians and Americans are now coming up with plans to get rid of some.  (I heard about this right after Hillary became Secretary of State.  Hmmmm.....maybe there is something to that "more women in power brings peace" thing after all.)|`|V1MptCMiaa	Sure, why not?

The livestock pens was low may symbolize things you feel insecure.  As far a s moose and a bear, they may symbolize peer group, the normal ones.

JP7INAvKaa	To dream that you are kissing someone who is not your girlfriend, indicates your wish to be a relationship and to experience the energy of love. You may be sexually acting out. You may also need to awaken your passion. Alternatively, it indicates a lack of integrity on your part.

PBjYkapHaa	No; for one there are a couple of assumptions on your part which shouldn't be assumed as true. A) you assume that there is no cost involved in finding and charging these people or the B) we (government) is already well aware of every single "undocumented" immigrant <br>  when their title alone suggest something opposite (undocumented immigrant).<br>  Another point to consider is the evidence which has been done which show undocumented immigrants as (at this point) a necessity to the American economy. The facts remain, the US could not function properly without them. <br>  Another misconception you have is that undocumented immigrants don't pay taxes (another word for fine) which they do either indirectly (like point of sale tax on every good in this country) and even directly-- as some undocumented immigrants get tax i.d. numbers and actually volunteer to pay income taxes to the irs (usually when they find out that the irs has no jurisdiction to deport them and they are in good economic standing). many of these people are well aware that they wont ever collect social security but pay into it anyways. <br>  further, the costs fully become a citizen when you have no relatives in america or are not a refugee of a civil was (like in darfur) are astronomical as it is; if economics should teach you anything (one case study you could do is on california's economic crisis) is that just charging more in taxes and fines does not fix and certainly does not guarantee anything for a nation.|`|d6Y7zg0caa	I can see where you're coming from with that... and it would help but... there is no real effective way of making illegal immigrants pay unless we were to hold them in the country until they did. The US can't touch anyone outside of the country. It's either hold them here till they pay or send them back and hope they hop the boarder with some money next time =)
bCKHn8Sqaa	dont really understand your question.<br>  <br>  a country does not lends itself money, and does not charge itself interest. if it have money to lend to begin with, why on earth will it need to borrow money from itself? the BOE does lend money to banks, which is slightly different, this is a monetary simulus, aimed at inducing economic growth. at a time where many countries are in recession, a simulus package is needed to get us out of the recession.<br>  <br>  money isnt backed by anything now because theres no point. the gold standard was a bunch of BS used to reduce a country's trade deficit with one another, now most countries have a floating exchange rate, which should automatically fix trade deficits.<br>  <br>  the BOE is not owned by private bankers, but are run by some top bankers|`|trMsK86jaa	The kind of country which considers money to be of the highest priority when dealing with the inadequacies of life.<br>  <br>  Simple answer.
ET1CRiMYaa	Modern women of India are no longer captive of traditions"<br>  This statement may hold true for some specific fields, but taking into account the major parts of the society, modern women of India still have to remain as captives of traditions. For example, 90% of the Indian households are looked after by the lady of the family. The lady of the family has to take care of the children and teach them human virtues and values to make them eminent citizens of the society. It is also the lady who has to perform the daily domestic chores. Women are seldom allowed to work outside their homes or to take up a job. On the contrary, they are expected to serve their husbands as their superiors and work on their orders.<br>  Hence, it would be incorrect to say that modern women of India are no longer captive of traditions|`|ZYp1AEspaa	You should probably just summarise the points you made during the debate, or list the key words, and then just say that they prove that modern women are no longer captives of tradition.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	You might find some ideas here <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/feminism-evaluated" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/feminism-evaluat...</a>

And haven't you realized that you're getting angrier when you're higher, so why do you keep smoking ? Is it for the misconception that weed makes you happy ? Well here are a few other facts about weed : <br>  1. It makes you unsocial<br>  2. It erases your friends.<br>  3. You become dependent on it.<br>  4. You can develop paranoia.<br>  5. You waste your money.<br>  6. You wont be able to eat unless your high.<br>  7. You wont be able to function unless your high.<br>  8. It develops the feelings you have while smoking. It makes you think alot about the certain thing. For examply if you smoked weed while thinking about your ex youd most probably keep thinkinh and having dreams about her the whole time when youre high And now it is obvious that the misuse of weed can be psychologically dangerous.<br>  You need to figure out your problems without the weed. And find peace and comfort in resolving them, You need to talk to a friend or a counsellor or a relative about this. And you need to do the things that calm you down, and reme,ber that weed does not neceseraly make you feel happy.Just be happy man and change your normal day routines. Dont smoke weed unless you are truely happy BEFORE smoking. When youre trouble free and have nothing to worry about. and no other priorities or issues to attend to. You are free to use your free time.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Throw the weed away. It won't do a thing for you. Examine why you are angry and what makes you angry and try to avoid it.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	First, stay away from Marijuanna. It can make everything ten times worse. Although it might seem to calm you it is well known to be a leading cause of schitzoprenia and paranoia. Also it is highly addictive and causes dillusions. <br>  Second honor your feelings, accepting them and yourself as healthy and normal. When we think it is wrong to be angry or upset, we tend to suppress our feelings...this leads to blaming, jealousy, rage, anger, sadness, overwhelming, anxiety, paniac attacks, and on and on. So the solution is to face your intimate authentic self. In defining what is wrong and digging into the issues with intention you get to the root which is pain or lack of. Everything is a lack of some version of love. For example, if you feel rage, you can blame others for treating you badly, then you can follow this to pain about not be accepted, which is a lack of love. The solution begins with identifying, defining and letting go of what it has given you, and then accepting and loving yourself, in this case, becoming your best friend and knowing your strength and integrity. <br>  this is simply a wake up call to connect, accept and love yourself...when you can you will find the pain is released, and the symptoms leave. Also take the time to ask questions and seek answers so you can understand. If you stop to observe, you can almost always see the other person's point of view.|`|yNi1adRqaa	Please see a doctor.

W1tx1p2iaa	I agree with Mistify.  I will add that there is an increased demand for PTs as the population ages and the premature infants that are born earlier and earlier.  An increase in PTAs are a good thing.  PT should be the primary person in musc-skeletal problems.  <br>  <br>  I do not see PT going away.  I think another big threat is ATC used as PTA.  This is not legal but happens.  PT are getting more efficient with evidence based medicine.  Patients are getting better sooner.  We also need to empower our paitents to take ownership on their rehab.|`|gdYN39gtaa	I'm not a fortune teller, but more and more seniors are having<br>   knee and hip replacements, that need some kind of therapy<br>   after the operations. More and more  young people are active<br>   and as a result have more accidents, pulled muscles, or broken<br>   bones, and therefore need therapy afterwards.  I'd say to get<br>   into that field as the time is ripe now. We don't know what could<br>   be down the road in twenty years but start thinking of the<br>   tomorrows, not years. good luck.|`|5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	First, I think one of the threats to the PT profession are POPTS or "physician owned physical therapy clinics."  These are clinics where the physician obtains a profit based on sending his own clients to physical therapy.  It's sort of an act of "double dipping."  First, the patient is charged to see the physician, then the physician refers them to PT.  In these clinics, there is often no consideration for "less is more" and the longer someone stays in physical therapy, the more money the physician makes.  This is referral for profit.  Although already outlawed in many states, POPTS still exist to a great extent.  <br>  <br>  This leads to unfair competition with PT owned clinics.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, yes, reform is emminent...and needed.  There are still too many incentives to provide uncessary medical treatment...this may mean keeping patients in therapy for longer than they need to, or adding on unproven treatments such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation.  <br>  <br>  We are all striving to make what we do better...the right treatment for the right person.  If the government wants to get involved with healthcare, they will surely invest in ongoing PT research (you'd hope) so we can eliminate unecessary costs. What we will have in the end will hopefully be a more effecient and streamlined course of care. I only fear that "outliers" or people who fall beyond the "normal" range of a problem will not get the appropriate treatment.  Medicare is noctorious for this...hence the whole $1750 cap on outpatient services a year...great if you have a small problem, but if you've have a stroke, tough luck.  <br>  <br>  Will other professionals threaten the practice of PT? Let's take a look at each:<br>  <br>  1. PTAs: I'd consider that there will be more use of PTA and PTs will fall into a more formal "diagnostic" and assessment role. However, there are studies that suggest that treatment by a PTA results in less efficient care.  I'd say the jury is still out on this one.<br>  2. Physiotherapist....well, there the same thing as a PT<br>  3. DCs? Hardly, DCs are so caught up in their political warefare over trying to obtain exclusive rights to "manipulate" that they are falling behind on continuing to improve their practice.  The subluxation theory has never been proven and we now know that correlation between x-ray findings and palpatory findings (two of the DCs top diagnostic tools) has really little correlation with symptoms.  Meanwhile, we now know that manipulation is rarely needed or even indicated. An internationally known physio, Robin McKenzie has argued that only 4% of those with spinal pain require a manipulation...I'd argue it's even less than that.  <br>  4. Massage therapists? Heck no...very little VALID research to support what they do leads to long term improvements...in fact, this is why most insurance companies stopped paying for massage years ago.  <br>  <br>  In ten to twenty years, I HOPE that PTs will be recognized as the "best first choice" in musculoskeletal care. Considering that 85% of medical school graduates failed in a study to demonstrate competency in a musculoskeletal exam and that only 1/3 of American medical schools require physicians to take ANY class in musucloskeletal medicine, and that this is one of THEE major foci in a PTs education, this only makes sense that PTs...especially those with the DPT... are qualified to be a portal of entry into the medical system for musculoskeletal complaints and to screen for medical conditions and refer to the physician when appropriate.
dmCyY2SKaa	I have a lot to say about this topic, but I'll leave you with this short article. It sums up how I feel about modern western feminism quite nicely...    "The opinion expressed in ''A Disastrous Loss for Feminists'' [Oct. 19] speaks to the heart of why the feminist movement, as political ideologue, fails. If the person in question was male, this action of choosing family over business would have been lauded.    The emphasis on gender, rather than role and value choice, lets us know how far we have not come. To have praised Ms. Barnes for her decision would have supported her right to make a choice.    When I gathered with the thousands of women in Washington years ago, it was in support of a woman's right to choose, and not be a victim on whatever ''ideological altar'' is the flavor of the day. Unfortunately, the feminist movement has joined the ranks of those who create their own discriminating flavor, in support of their cause, as opposed to supporting an individuals right to choose."  http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.ht...|`|sAbbzZxJaa	Yes I believe feminism is necessary.    Feminism is simply the advocacy of political economical and social equality.     From the political, the majority of leaders in the United States are men. This is not representative of the actual population they are representing.     From the economical, there is still a glass ceiling the workplace and women still make less money.    From the social - all I have to do is look through some of these Yahoo Questions and see many of the sexist views still held.     Women affected by domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment have only recently been able to seek help because of feminism.   Women still face really screwed up ideals of beauty, having the media scrutinize women for any extra pound of fat.    Feminism means different things to different people. But these are just a few of the things that I believe feminism today is aiming to do.     Moreover many feminists DO help abroad, and one of the biggest ways we can help is by being a good role model. But like with anything else, just because there is far greater poverty in Africa does not mean we should ignore the poverty in our own home. Same goes for feminism.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Yes it is still necessary. Women may have full rights on paper but they still face discrimination in all areas. Attitudes on this forum clearly proof that many men do not see women as equal.     If feminists were to disappear you'd be amazed how fast we'd lose the ground gained over the past century.|`|62ZBofvPaa	The reason why there is full rights is because of feminism--it's like saying "we already have voting, so do we really need democracy in America today?"  Yes...    If you mean active feminism....so long as women/men/transgendered are discriminated against on the basis of gender roles, that type of thing will exist.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Yes, feminism is really necessary, in the US and elsewhere.  Since you think "women have full rights in America now", why don't you help women in other parts of the world, while we try to make sure that women and men have the right to access birth control, abortion, equal pay, and can finally find freedom from violence and racism and homophobia. I don't see that as full rights, since I can be fired for my sexual orientation where I live, but I'm glad you have all the rights you need-unfortunately not all American men and women are as fortunate as you. I'll stay behind and fight for the men and women whose rights are missing or in jeopardy in the US.     I also feel that I can be supportive of women and men in other countries, but as many parts of the world have their own feminist groups and know better than I do what is important to them, I don't think I have the right to go to another country and tell them how they should change it. Sounds ethnocentric to me.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	Feminism exists beyond "equal rights."  Doesn't matter what part of the world, there are sexism and gender issues everywhere.    Edit:  What's with the thumbs down?  It's the truth.  Google it, or better yet, go to the library and find out for yourself.    And Nova, correction -- Women are EXPECTED to take time out of their careers to have children.  No one expects the father to do so.  If you really believe there is no pay gap in most careers, then you are very naive indeed.|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	Oh come on, modern feminism is one of the things that is so stupid and easy to pick on, why would you want to take the fun away?|`|lpnvs78faa	Legal equality has been achieved.  Therefore the movement's original raison d'etre no longer exists.  As a result, the movement has moved away from the goal of legal equality and into outright misandry and the promotion of female supremacy, to a substantial degree.  This is a key reason why its support among women has steadily waned.    The idea that discrimination is the reason why Congress is not 50% female is both laughable and risible.  Women readily get elected to Congress when they run.  They do not RUN as often as men do.  That's a choice women make about their lives.  There is no sexist political barrier.    The same is true about the so-called pay-gap.  This exists because (1) women work part time much, much more than men do, (2) women  choose different jobs, by and large, than men do and (3) women take time out of their career path, often, to raise families.  For women who are working full-time, in the same jobs as men and not taking time out of their careers -- there is essentially no pay gap.  The only way to address the pay gap that exists for the reasons noted above is to actively discriminate against men for the crime of working full-time at demanding jobs and not having the biological ability to become pregnant.    Yet, feminism and its hangers-on raise issues like the above as a means to keep the revolution going.  Increasingly, women are not buying it -- because they know better.  They know that they are not discriminated against to any meaningful degree in the United States in 2009.  And they choose to distance themselves from an ideology that does not speak to them and to the choices *they* want to make in their own lives.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	No, its not required in the US where legal equality has become more than just a dream.

Social equality is the same as utopia (i.e. it will never happen).|`|mCAWxobNaa	Not only do I think that Feminism is unnecessary in the US in 2009 AD as it pertains to social issues that concern females but it detracts from the issue of atrocities which are aimed against women being a matter of human concern rather than feminist concern.  Even though I'm not a lady nor can I pretend to know what it's like to know what being a lady is like, I still can recognize social injustic when I see it.  I rather that modern Feminists leave matters that impinge upon female rights as humanitarian matters rather than ostracise those of use who don't affiliate with modern Feminism.  I see Feminism as a way to enhance divisiveness which is a counterproductive mesure for society.  I'd rather that more energy be expended at making certain matters issues of human importantance; not merely feminist importance.    Issues about this FLDS business should be addressed as matters of human civil rights as opposed to feminist causes.    Feminism ultimately should be done away with since no tangible goals exist which can't be addressed by himan rights or civil rights movements.  That would be progressive.    Feminism is, by design, sexist and predicated on the idea that feminists are better than normal people.  It would be much better to unify people into recognizing that the "acceptable" mistreatment of a group of people by virtue of gender, sexual preference or other such issues is wrong.  The solution to dealing with social injustice is to make it clear that social injustice is fundamentally wrong and we have a moral imerative as human beings to fight against it.  All ;that feminism does is that it asserts that only those who choose to afiiliate with this movement predicated on hared of men and supremacy have the vision to recognize human rights violations when they are clear.

xRbL1xJ7aa	After what happened with Bush's bail out plan and what I see happening to Obama's plan, I don't believe in trickle down economics anymore. By the time the wealthy are done taking their share, there's nothing left to trickle down. In the last 4 years I''ve lost 2 good jobs resulting in the loss of my house. I have another job now, but I don't fit into any parameters of Obama's plan. He won't be able to help me. I truly do though hope he helps the country. I've dealt with my losses and at my age realize this is just the way it is. I get sad, angry sometimes, but for the most part know that life goes on.

Sz8Wg1fHaa	you're probably not close to them then. just try to talk to them one day and ask them why. it's good to start the conversation with " i feel..blah blah blah" because that will grab your parent's attention. i know they do care for you and they will want to know how you feel. once u stated ur feeling, ask them WHY they are treating you differently than your sister. and if your parents start to yell at you, tell them "i want to be a better child so im willing to talk to you. and by talking to you, we'd understand each other more. bringing a family bond." or something like that. if you say that, its standing up for yourself. if your parents are asian, they might not care..they'd just yell at you even more. but its okay if they yell becus what matters is that u did something and not jsut sit there right?|`|GR5GK9Y5aa	try outfoxing them Come up with something only you can do, and you do well.

I15Wjrcmaa	If someone can be convinced that they are a victim, then yes...they can be convinced that they will always be a victim. This is exactly how politics works. Politicians convince a group that they are being mistreated...that they are victims...and that this politician is the only one that cares enough to help them. They are shown how other groups are receiving "help" with their victim status and how they should be voting for their piece of the pie too. Is there anyone that the present leadership has not called a victim in some way?...and promised to bail them out or help them in some way? These victim groups never get the help they really need but they keep coming back for more. They will always be disappointed as long as they agree to be  victims.|`|AA11589988	Oh yes. The people at the top doing the patronage retain their power. If an individual advances thanks to something like affirmative action then the elite that pushed that person ahead of others still holds the real power. The elite can say "I put you here and I can put you back down again if you don't play by our rules". REAL power is never handed to anyone on a plate. <br>  This is how collectivist feminism works....the feminists say to women "You can't make it in life without us feminists. You would still be down where you were before if it wasn't for what we do for you".<br>  This is how feminists maintain their power by perpetuating a sense of powerlessness in women.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Yup.|`|G0DP4LSmaa	Not as simple as you state<br>  <br>  You can galvanise someone into action by demonstrating to them that they are being victimised (many don't know that they are) or explain that they are exhibiting a victim mentality and in this respect, by convincing them of this fact they can switch tactics and become the victor.<br>  <br>  The other side of the coin is when individuals or institutions or governments *victimise* their targets and they don't realise it and behave accordingly: like the Jews/Gays in World War II who were beaten down by the Nazis psychologically and physically despite their vast numbers.<br>  <br>  Oppressors will destroy morale but the oppressed can be convinced they are victims and rise up and defeat their detractors - much like I do on GWS, darling!<br>  <br>  *sips tea, file nails and casually flicks through Vogue*|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I like this quote more:<br>  " No one can make you feel inferior without your permission." --Eleanor Roosevelt<br>  <br>  You choose whether or not to believe you're a victim.<br>  And even if you decide you are, you decide how to handle it.<br>  A) Use it as motivation to better yourself.<br>  B) Cry about it and use it as a ploy for sympathy.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Not unless they encourage that person to break away from whatever is victimizing them.
AA11589988	I am an individualist. I do support some collectivist things such as the police force or legal system because they are there to promote individualist aims i.e. to protect the rights of individuals.<br>  I think collectivism has a positive part to play when there is market failure. <br>  I used to work in the pharmaceutical industry and one thing that  struck me while I was there is that cures are not profitable! If you look at the kinds of treatments available for diseases today the most profitable ones are drugs that need to be taken regularly to keep a condition at bay. The most profitable treatment from a pharmaceutical company's point of view is one that needs to be taken every day by a patient for the rest of their lives - at great expense. A cure is a lost customer!<br>  This leads me to think that public money or charity should be used to find cures for diseases because the free market fails in this case.<br>  So I think there are special cases where collectivism is preferable to individualism BUT only because in these cases there is a net benefit to the individual from the support of the collective.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	"You're all individuals!" - Brian<br>  "Yes, we're all individuals!" - mob<br>  "...I'm not" - an individual in the mob.<br>   - Life of Brian<br>  <br>  BTW - I am an individualist.

Socially, I'm more of an individualist, although it's difficult to define a point where the actions of the individual start to affect and change society. I believe that we're all part of society and so we should be required to contribute accordingly through taxes to help others... how much we choose to take part in mainstream society is up to us, but we should make sure it's a decent place. Collectivist cultures seem more supportive. But I don't think anyone should have to give up their basic rights for the good of society.|`|AA10895669	by your definitions, I am an individualist. But I understand that we are not alone, we are individuals who are part of a society so we need to balance our individuality with the cares and concerns of a valid society.<br>  <br>  Too much of either individualism or collectivism is a bad thing.

x0J8S5sWaa	What you are forgetting is that the society where these things are brought into the attention of the media are societies where these boys are considered boys and thus underage. They are not all at a emotionally mature enough level to fully understand the dynamics of their relationship with the teacher, but even if some are, it doesn't change the fact that the adult teacher is taking advantage of them because the adults know fully well what they are doing.<br>  <br>  You are right though, society does treat female sexuality as "giving" and male sexuality as "taking." It's supposed to be both for both though...but that's a separate argument if it's with two consenting adults.|`|SDLzdQV5aa	first of all the majority of teeachers that do molest little boys are ugly as **** or weigh like 200 pounds and is forcing an erection from a boy. the ones that are pretty are the ones confusing the boy and if the teacher gets pregnant then the boy shouldn't be responsible at all. having sex with anyone under the age of 18 is illegal for both sexes no matter who you are or what you look like. that is just like saying men that look like brad pitt or david beckham could get away with molestation because there hot and girls like them. there is no excuse for having sex with a little kid at all if your an adult and if you do then your a pedophile case closed.|`|4jUqOBWZaa	Let me get this Straight Jocelyn.

AHJZeo8Oaa	Yes, it's entirely possible, though unlikely as the US is a global hegemony, and would no doubt seek from the start to dominate their procedings - the US doesn't even listen to the EU / UN wherever possible.  Similar to how it ignored calls to join the earlier League of Nations.<br>  <br>  As for what problems it would face - the UN has great trouble getting consistent support on anything, so it has to modify and water down all its resolutions just to get any agreement.  Its policies of sanctions have also done very little to curb the wars, fighting and human rights abuses which have occurred since its inception.<br>  <br>  Supranational bodies with legitimate authority are a great idea, but we've a long way to go before we experience that situation in reality.

DnYGCIWSaa	Ok, first off you are young still, so you can always find someone else!!! But since you say you love him and want to make it work with him...you guys need to communicate.  You guys are obviously on two different pages.   Now, I don't understand...when you say you have tried to talk to him and it hasn't done much, what do you mean? Like, does he change the subject, avoid the topic, become angry or withdrawn....or do you mean that you have just not physically/mentally been ready to try to sit down and talk about this.  He may be very confused since he said he loved you and you didn't reciprocate.  You have to let him see how you feel before he will show anything back...and if he doesn't after you talk to him or show him..then well, maybe he is over it and not right for you.  You don't want to make it work with someone who wont love you back.  In the mean time while you are deciding and working on this, you should take care of yourself: exercise, eat right, hang out with other friends, focus on yourself and he will maybe see you for someone he will want to be with. Good luck!!!!!|`|cAMleGWlaa	1. He WILL come around sooner than you think.<br>  2.

At the worst that will happen if he's really your friend is that nothing will happen but at least you will know that he knows how you feel. Then you'll have a better chance of moving on instead of wondering the whole time what might have happened. The other thing that might happen is that he will feel the same way as you and you will get what you clearly want. From what you've said it seems like you have a very good chance of the second outcome coming true.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	Well, the first thing that comes to mind is, have you asked him?  You are asking the world, but have you talked to him?  If you have and he has not given you a straight answer either way, that is still your answer.  If he is as old as you, consider that you are still kids in a way.  Your bodies are adult, but your minds are not, and won't be for several more years.  You are backing yourself into a corner, not circumstances by thinking that you do not have a lot of time.  You actually do have a lot more time.  Also consider that men mature more slowly than women and marrying an immature man results in trying to do it over again later.  My advice is slow down your thinking, do some research, and really consider what you are asking.  Make sure you want the answer, or at least the results.|`|6Zuvobqtaa	Well, you certainly have thought it all over in great detail.<br>  I think he would come around but are you sure you want him to? Sounds like you want him as a friend and you know that once you cross that line it might be impossible to go back. So which do you want, a lover or a friend? Do you feel that you love him? If you do then it's not hard to get through to him. Maybe he thinks you are not into him and is afraid to lose you. <br>  <br>  I can't tell you what to do , but doing nothing is not going to work either. Be honest with him and see how it goes. He is your friend and he said he loves you. Maybe he does. Maybe it's just that simple.
2b9d44a2626e8bffeebd493f9eb0199eaa	Developed countries are  gaining from the Third Worlds predicament. The weaker they are the easier it is for us to manipulate them. There is a book called: Bad Samaritans written by Ha-Joon Chong who is a Cambridge University professor. In the book Professor Chong basically states that poor countries are encouraged by richer countries to not produce any goods that would make them any real money. Instead they are encouraged to produce low productivity goods that have a lower potential revenue. <br>  <br>  The above example does however highlight why we have poverty in the first place. It's a consequence of our attitudes towards to each other. Human nature is such that it wants to use and maniupulate other people for its own gain. If we really cared about other people we could eradicate poverty - for starters we could stop spending trillions of pounds per annum on weapons and illegal conflicts. <br>  <br>  All of our attempts to eradicate poverty are destined to fail, because we still have not embraced the fact that we as human beings need to change our nature to one that considers other people not just ourselves. <br>  <br>  Thats the key to eradicating poverty and the way we can do that can be found on the following video: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrdW4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrd...</a>|`|P9RauQ7laa	The U.S. will soon be undeveloped.

VgPG5WMsaa	Yes. Mental health care is a big costly fraud. Have you ever talked to these patients. None are cured and most are worse off. The only winners are the social workers and counselors. Mental health is personal responsibility.|`|fAp0vFAHaa	Yeah if the employees of the mental health care want to get payed?|`|REGTZ79xaa	I believe all of the information regarding all aspects of mental health should be readily available to everyone on earth.<br>  <br>  However, the ability to provide care should be divided between the paraprofessionals and the professionals. At this point, the means of compensation and whether the care should be compensated at all are well within each provider's prerogative (more in the egalitarian sense). If compensation is wished, then it should cover the carer's investments to gain such skill and knowledge and the investments he/she needs to further those skill and knowledge (which include the carer's living cost, health care, further educations, clinics, hospitals, etc). Bearing in mind, the investments are not solely based on monetary value.<br>  <br>  The counterbalance to the value of service is judged by common humanity sense(!) and by those who receive the care (I'm sorry but I hate those "professionals" who charge hundreds of dollars for a test when the results would be in no better quality or accuracy than what is free over the internet).<br>  <br>  The government (or other legal bodies) should help maintain the integrity of mental health providers by establishing boundaries and controlling agents such as laws and code of ethics.<br>  <br>  For those who cannot afford mental health care, provisions MUST be made by the mental health care providers, the government and/or the rest of the population.<br>  <br>  So, I guess, no. Mental health care should not be only available for those who can afford it. I personally don't want a lunatic making camp in my front lawn when my only option is to shoot him in the ...

nRFZwdN4aa	It may be anhedonia. Anhedonia is the absence of pleasure. You don't feel joy over things most people enjoy or that you used to enjoy. Maybe you leave one situation because you aren't content with it, expecting that doing something else will make you feel better. But the anhedonia follows you, so you don't enjoy the new thing. It then results in perpetual oscillation and restlessness.|`|DiFsOj5qaa	It's the feeling of nothingness!

6Zuvobqtaa	No, although I have entertained the idea of my universe as a single entity. Who doesn't think at some point, gee , I would love to live on an Island away from everyone. <br>  <br>  But who would serve me my meals at restaurants if I was the only one in the world...<br>  <br>  It would be really really lonely if I wasn't able to have human contact. Good or bad , we all need each other. Besides, we don't have to react negatively to others ( ie bothered) we can choose not to feel bad at all. I know that sounds impossible but it's true. Anger is not a healthy emotion, which being bothered is.  Letting it all out isn't good either. It is not a catharsis to hurt someone else. You won't feel better, you might even think about it long after the person you hurt has moved on. <br>  Its so much more fun to control your anger and not respond in a negative way or to be bothered by their anger.|`|AA10215545	I dont think I would personally be happier...For me, the social interaction has to be there or I probably wouldnt make it.

It is nice to read about new developments in science and technology, and i could not do that with my mediocre mind.

Humans are wired to need other humans, to some extent.
6GmtcZteaa	Umm. I think believing it and not talking about it is a good thing. Alot of people dont find comfort in talking alot about themselves and the things they love. However :) You can talk about that without sounding selfish ! No wrong in that. Just dont sound too strong in expressing that is the only thing. I really think its a good idea perhaps you might realise who you are better. So talk about yourself and dont let what people say stop you, just say what you think :_]|`|4CsGde1qaa	I used to love to talk about myself a lot, but i cut that out for the reason that people may find it boring, and I may even be judged for something. I get judged for many things but whatever whatever. One time, when I went into a supermarket trying to find a sweet chocolate tasty cereal that provides a good amount of fiber and protein combined, I had to look for the label of each box that is different. An employee thought I was caloric conscious because I looked into the labels of many foods(I like to know what it is I am eating), he thought I was trying to look for a cereal with low calories, and he said, "You are already skinny, why do you want a low calorie cereal geez?" His remark was extremely disturbing. The thing is, people don't know anything about anything. Everything now is an idea of what we think. We are already accustomed to this and it is disturbing. I am comfortable about talking about what I like, only if someone asks me this. I dislike being judged, but I let it pass because people will always think their way. I do appreciate myself, and if there is anything I like to add to my looks, I would ask someone who I feel comfortable with and will not judge with authority, while keeping in mind, I don't mind being teased about what I like or given opinions and suggestions as well, as long as I am not commanded by assumption. Sometimes it is funny.
6Zuvobqtaa	I have often entertained this idea myself. Wondered what it would be like to go back or forwards in time. Backwards I would have an idea of what was going to happen and where to be when things went bad. I would also have a great amount of knowlege and would have to keep it to myself  unless I wanted to make a lot of money at fortune telling. Most likely I would keep it to myself. If we exist in a parallel universe then this might be possible right now. Quantum physics says it is possible but of course no one knows. Perhaps this is why people see UFO's. Maybe we are looking into our future or very very distant past.<br>  <br>  It's an interesting question. The first thing I would do is to make sure I was wearing the right clothing for the day.

DsEEATKSaa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  Stimulants  represent the primary treatment option (e.g., ritalin, adderall).

There are medications that work for Adult ADHD the same ones that are used for Childhood ADHD.  Just different dosages.  These medications were tested on adults before they were given to children because children aren't included in most drug tests. So they just change the dosages for adults and lessen them for the children. Strattera, Ridhalian and What ever else is now available.

yj3GT7jOaa	Praying in tongues was originally defined as a different language native to an individual visitor to a congregation.  The speaker for the congregation would ask, at a specific time during the service, if any speaker would be present who does not speak the language native to the congregation.  The person speaking the unknown tongue would be given an interpreter for the remainder of the service.  If no interpreter would be present, the guest would be allowed to stay and keep their own tongue.  That would mean they would be allowed to speak and no person known to them would be able the hear what was being said.  Some members of the congregation would consider this offensive and call it babble.|`|DsEEATKSaa	It is a spiritual phenomenon, not a psychological one; therefore, psychological explanations are inapplicable.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~

mSaRuowKaa	If the abuse of a child is alleged then it is not proven. An unproven allegation is not grounds to remove a child from custody. <br>  <br>  If this accusation of abuse was taken to court and proved to be unfounded then that leaves (in this example) a man who contiunes to have custody of his daughter having been cleared of abuse accusations, a mother who contiunes to not have custody whose accusations of abuse have been shown to be incorrect and a 7 year old girl who the courts have decided has not been abused. <br>  <br>  While I think that it would be extreme to never allow the mother to see the child again, there needs to be some kind of repercussion for this unproven accusation of abuse otherwise a mentality is created whereby people assume that they might as well make accusations because the worst thing that can happen is that nothing changes.<br>  <br>  "(Bala & Schuman, 2000)" - Would this be the same Bala & Schuman that based this study on only 262 cases? The same Bala and Schuman that openly admit that "this study may not be representative of all cases where abuse allegations are made after parents have separated" which is precisely what you're trying to do?<br>  <br>  EDIT - Unfortunately, like yourself, I can't find anything that elaborates on the paragraph you've cut and pasted that suggest men make more false claims. It would be useful to know exactly how the courts differentiate bewteen 'unsubstantiated' claims (of which women apparently make more according to your source) and 'false' claims (which men apparently make more of). My guess is that it comes down to taking the persons word for it that they had a legitimate concern about the abuse of the child. If this is the case then frankly I'm not surprised that the courts believe women more than men, I could have told you that form the start. Clearly though the result isn't that children are put in harms way because the study you've cited refers to claims of abuse that are all unsubstabtiated and seeks to discover how many of them were deliberate falsifications. However, your conclusion that women are also put in harms way is simply nonsense.<br>  <br>  None of this changes the fact that an unproven allegation isn't sufficient grounds to remove a child from custody or that you're taking as truth something that has been proved to be unfounded.|`|G50ucmllaa	No.  But people don't just loose custody for alleging things, especially mothers.  There is more to this story...a lot more.<br>  <br>  EDIT- None of us know if there is more to this story.  If someone can keep their kids after a school reports him having the crap beaten out of him with a belt (not just on the butt), I KNOW simple allegations are CRAP.  There is far more to this...I'm a teacher...allegations get NOTHING.<br>  <br>  EDIT2-"Men fabricate allegations of neglect all the time (Bala & Schuman), yet they dont lose custody - -- women do, however.".....So you are a troll who looks at individual and specific cases to prove your point....nice.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	IF the allegation proves to be false - yes. That would (help) stop the incredible numbers of false allegations of abuse that magically arise in divorce hearings... almost always against the father.<br>  <br>  If, however, it simply cannot be proven either way, then no.<br>  <br>  Also, if it is confirmed - then the allegation is true... and so no, the accuser shouldn't lose custody.<br>  <br>  But certainly false accusers should.<br>  <br>  It has been long known that some women will use false allegations of abuse to gain an upper hand in divorce hearings. This has also been known to be promoted by feminists and sympathisers.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	"alleged" abuse? No.<br>  Too many sick, twisted people would use that as a ploy for power and control of the children during custody proceedings.<br>  <br>  It's unconstitutional anyway, (US)..we're all guaranteed innocent until PROVEN guilty, not allegedly guilty.<br>  <br>  And anyone who is found guilty of abuse should lose custody and anyone found guilty of fabricating abuse should lose custody.|`|lF65kGdyaa	If someone makes FALSE allegations about abuse, sexual molestation, rape, etc., the false accuser should do time in prison and NOT have custody of their children. <br>  Period.<br>  Those who do make such false accusations, show clearly, the true nature of their character, which is not one supportive of responsible child rearing.<br>  <br>  In cases where abuse IS alleged, CPS (or whatever legal agency is responsible or ensuring the health and welfare of the child) should be brought in and do a thorough investigation; which until concluded, will result in the child being held in the custody of an agreed mutual family member, or private entity of the state.<br>  <br>  Allegations are frequently proven to be false when they rise in divorce proceedings, almost 50% of the time. <br>  <br>  You can site whatever biased pollsters you like, but for every one poll listed by an agenda based organization, there are dozen reputable others, to contradict it.
0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	No I would not support such a bill, because the bill assumes that most couples are just petty arguers who have love left for their mates. Some people grow to hate their mates by the daily dose of BS they receive from them, and in many cases you may be able to forgive but you cant forget, and staying together would be unhealthy both physically and emotionally. Everyone should have the right to get away from a toxic person ASAP. In my opinion any time someone totally transforms into a different person after marriage, it should be labeled as "Marriage Fraud", and the victims should not have to jump through hoops, or feel forced to stay in an unhealthy situation.|`|wkjncmHTaa	No.<br>  <br>  I'd support one that made it more difficult to marry though.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I don't think this bill would apply to couples in which one spouse is an abuser or addict. They'd need serious help of their own. This might only apply to divorces as a result of "irreconcilable differences." Either way, the government has enough problems; they ought to stay out of everyone else's.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Nope, if two people want a divorce, it shouldn't take more money and time than it already does to do it.  Government just needs to stay out of our personal lives and let us do what we want.  It's not up to them to save marriages.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	In the UK, it is probably harder and longer to divorce than to be declared bankrupt, or dissolve a business...so no, divorce laws are fine!|`|FL67UPPHaa	I don't agree that couples should have to pay for it themselves, if it's required by law. That will simply increase the gap between rich and poor children, as there will be more divorces among the poor whereas wealthier people would have the chance to resolve their problems.<br>  <br>  It says that it only applies to no-fault divorces. So, if the marriage was violent a couple wouldn't seek a no-fault divorce. If abuse was the reason, they could divorce as usual.<br>  <br>  For a couple with no children, I would agree that it's their business if they want to divorce. But, again, the law would only apply to those with dependent children, and for the sake of the children it's best if they can work through their differences and re-build a happy marriage. If the course doesn't work, then they can still divorce afterwards.<br>  <br>  So, yes, if a couple have young children and there's no specific reason for wanting a divorce, then they should be required to have some kind of counseling. Marriage is meant to be a commitment for life, people take it far too lightly.|`|AA11071860	I believe the divorce rate, sad to say, will climb to 60% during this economic maelstrom. Many divorces are caused by money problems. Other problems, of course, like boredom, sexual distant, abuse play a role in some marriages, nevertheless money in most is the most serious issue effecting marriages. I know of too many divorces, so I would support something to keep a couple together.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	The present anything-goes divorce laws make marriage meaningless so the "no-blame" divorces should be abolished. Marriage should become meaningful.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it should also be more difficult to get married in the first place.|`|AA11202852	I think the government should stay out of people's personal business, but since it doesn't, I'd have to answer no to your question. But I'd support a bill that makes it harder to get married.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Various types of legal/abuse/family issues are a shambles <br>  <br>  divorce <br>  rape<br>  dv<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  its time the clear he agenda driven sexist bigots out of these areas so perspective and an holistic approach can be applied.|`|AA11550519	Yes, but this is the wrong way to go about it.<br>  <br>  See, marriage is an actual CONTRACT. The climax of the wedding, legally, isn't the kiss, or cutting the cake, but signing the contract.<br>  <br>  Divorce should ONLY be in case of actual breach of....contract, not change of feelings! Abuse, Adultery, cruelty, abandonment..no-one should stand such bullshit. But making this contract easier to dissolve than one with a telecom provider is NOT smart!! <br>  <br>  marriage is crucial for a stable society, and is usually the most significant consious choice a person makes. One govt policy has screwed it up, and i don't think another one will help.|`|G50ucmllaa	I LOVE it!  If you don't want the government involved why are you getting married in the first place?  Want to have your cake and eat it too?  Marriage has become a joke,  If people know it will take more than selecting "uncontested" "no-fault" or "irreconcilable differences" maybe they will actually think about what they are doing rather than acting like a bunch of high schoolers and treating marriage like a fling.  I agree, some people need to divorce, but the idea that you can just walk away from something and have little regards to the effect on children or the other person is selfish and immature.<br>  <br>  I would suspect the government would provide subsidy or something similar to those who made under a certain amount of money.

See a doctor for physical reason but for depression then you need to look at what's causing you depress and realized that you're not the only one going thru it.  We often eat, drink or use drugs to temporary rid of pain but it's short lived so we do it over and over again, in your case eating.

AA11707728	Functionalism - that pathology can be understood in terms of various advantages it provides, even if there are alot of disadvantages that come with it.<br>  <br>  Identity theory - that a good part of the reason that pathology exists is because the person has learned to identify who they are as a person, with the pathology.  Example: a person smokes pot because they think of themselves as a pothead. And smoking pot is what potheads do.<br>  <br>  Behaviorism - postulates that none of that other stuff is important.  Only the behavior matters and it exists because of simple reactions from the environment that either reward it or punish it.<br>  <br>  These three things look at a problem and identify different areas where an intervention can cause change.  Functionalism....teach the person a superior method of getting the advantage without the disadvantages.  Identity theory...help the person replace what they identify with, with something else.  Behaviorism...change the system of rewards and punishments to discourage rather than encourage the behaviors.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	Functionalism basically says that we engage in behaviors that serve a function.  Thus, behaviors that cause the result that we desire are more likely to be implemented in the future.  Functionalism, as a theory, was also applied to biology and was an outgrowth of Darwinism.  In other words, changes in behavior or evolution depended upon its ability to adapt to the environment.<br>  Behaviorism grew out of functionalism in a way and out of Thorndike's Law of Effect.  Basically, radical behaviorism believes that events or actions that result in positive rewards (is positively reinforced) is likely to be repeated under the same environmental circumstances or similar circumstances; those that are negatively reinforced will also increase under similar circumstances (i.e., results in avoidance behaviors for example).  Those actions that are punished are less likely to be repeated under similar circumstances.<br>  Identity theory, I believe, states that people will act in a way that conforms to their concept of themselves; they what they think is good if they see themselves as good, for example, and if they see themselves as bad, they do bad things.  This concept is somewhat opposed to functionalism and behaviorism because it depends upon mentalistic notions: a thinking person.  Functionalism and behaviorism would explain behavior without resorting to mentalistic notions.|`|hhFp7jZSaa	Behaviourism is the theory that we are shaped by our environments,and that all our behaviour is learned through classical/opherant conditioning.The site below explains this,and behaviorism.Ivan pavlovs experiments showed that through learning or training dogs learnt to associate a bell with food.Dogs salivate when they know they will get fed.Every tim they were going to feed a dog they rang a bell.The dog began to associate the bell with food and salivated just when the bell was rung,even without food being given.This proved learning had taken place.Look at Ivan pavlovs experiment,in one of the sites below to see about this.<br>  <br>  Assumptions made by behaviouists:<br>  .Introspection is not suitable for psychology,and should be replaced by a more objective approach.<br>  <br>  .This approach must concentrate on the study of behaviour based upon observable and objective responses to stimuli.Stimuli is food in pavlovs experiment.<br>  <br>  .The basic unit of study is the association between stimulus and response,the s-r.However,there are differences between classical and operhant conditioning,in how the relation ship is perceived between stimulus and response.Classical conditioning Sees the the stimulus as triggering an automatic response.Operhant conditioning assumes a for of associative learning.The liklihood of behaviour being repeated depend on reinforcement,rewards or punishment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope all this helps,check the sites,especially the last one.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Frankly, I'd rather have a bunch of crying women any day over thousands of US men who in a rage are beating, stabbing, shooting and killing others. If that isn't emotional, just what is?<br>  <br>  Coming from a European group that is well known for not showing a bit of emotion, and having spent years trying to show some semblance of an emotion, I find it hard to believe women are really more emotional than men. The first emotions I was able to show was anger and rage. I still find it extremely difficult to cry, no matter what the circumstances. Not only that, I've been around quite a few men who had absolutely no control of their anger or rage and would beat the crud out of whoever was in their path, regardless if they were sober or drunk. Based on facts and personal experience, I think Americans are embarrassed and annoyed by the "weakness" of women's "pathetic" crying, yet love the emotional charge of an enraged man.|`|mCAWxobNaa	Women are, indeed, statistically more expressive in terms of emotion.  That's not to say that men are lacking in emotion; not at all, rather it's that men are not as expressive with their emotions.

Are you saying that women are more sentimental than men and that men are more violent than women?<br>  <br>  Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think women and men feel the same emotions, we're just socialized to express/oppress them differently. To say that one gender feels more emotions than the other is dehumanizing to the other gender. People used to justify genocide and slavery by insisting that the people they were killing or enslaving were less human than they. Feeling the full spectrum of emotions is human and all humans feel emotions, we are just conditioned/socialized to express them differently.<br>  <br>  I remember reading an article that was studying human emotions and facial expressions in nationalities. The article/study said that Americans showed the most facial expressions and outward expressions of emotion, while Russians showed the least facial expressions and outward expressions of emotion. So this socializing/conditioning is not only based on gender, but also culture.<br>  <br>  WSIDR III, Is that an answer based on your intellect or your feelings towards women? What a tool...|`|s0OCyfJfaa	Science has proven that more regions of the brain are affected by emotion in women. Also, i agree that had it not been for the traditional gender roles and expectations that we have created for ourselves, the difference would not be so noticeable. Us men do have the potential for emotion, however, society deems it unacceptable, so for the very emotional movies and such, we "hold it in". In these kinds of situations i would usually rapidly blink to expel the tears before anybody noticed.<br>  <br>  So id say about 90% of the emotion difference is based on stereotypes, and 10% is science.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Thank you Edith :)  Men and women are both human beings who operate mostly on emotion. That stereotype is ludicrous. Some women openly cry more often maybe because they were not punished as severely as children in general for it, and men openly show anger and aggression more often maybe because they were not punished as severely for that as children. I know women who don't cry at all, also, and I know men who very rarely show any anger. I also know women who openly cry to manipulate others and I know quite a lot of men who openly display their anger to manipulate others. But the range of emotions for both genders is pretty much the same, and intellect is secondary in BOTH. Otherwise we would be VULCANS and we would not have a RECESSION, or GANGS, or DIVORCE, or anything else that is obviously a result of a LACK of someone's use of their intellect. It's all behavioral, not actual emotions. Humans are so emotional they have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning without them.
EmgiGg17aa	Unfortunately, there is a couple of sides to this.  A lot of people open their mouth with confidence but know squat so talk B.S.  But they believe themselves, and that is what counts.  And that is what makes them comfortable in their own skin"as you say".    However, if they say these words in front of somebody who in fact does know all about it they would look foolish.   So they pick and choose what to say and who to say it to.<br>      Stop dreaming unless you are going to specialize in it(then it is research, research, research what others have done- in other words read, read, read, and listen.)<br>      If you exude confidence you attract people around you like flies to honey.

cJDcoBiyaa	ohh repeating this story ALWAYS makes my face really red cuz it was so mortifying back then!! haha but I'll tell you. but I'm gonna try to put off the embarassing part for last... (this is really long and it gets worse as you read on hahaa)<br>    <br>  SO...<br>  I was 15, and it was an early saturday morning. I was signed up to take the driving portion of driving school, like where you drive around town with the instructor. and it was my first time. no one in my family had told me what it was going to be like, or where to go once I got to the place, so I was on my own pretty much. but I had been dreading this for a long time, and I just wanted it over with.<br>  my mom drove me to the driving school place, and back then, I was all about being independent and doing stuff on my own. I didn't want my mom walking into the driving school place with me, cuz that's just..weird. I say bye to her and walk towards the driving school CLASS. because I was not aware that you meet the instructor in the car, I assumed the building was some kind of office. I was WRONG. *dreadful feeling*<br>  what was weird was, I saw that there was already an instructor with his student in one of the school's cars. and that car seemed to be the only one for students. I sort of ignored that fact and walked into the ... class. it was no office.<br>  there are like 15 different teenagers in desks taking the written part of the driving course. they're all like public school students, totally not paying attention. being the sheltered little private school girl I am, I'm totally intimidated by these scary people and I totally forget WHAT the HELL I am doing. the teacher is with some kind of overhead projector thing and is just as utterly confused as I am.<br>  well, because I interrupt the class, everyone /stares/ at me. I look so out of place!! omg I just want to stop writing right now hahah. this is where it gets horrifying.<br>  this is obviously not the right place. I had already taken the written part of the course. and I just wanted to die on the spot! all the attention was on me. now, because I am an idiot, I spot an empty desk in the corner of the tiny room. I can't even remember why I am doing this, but everyone's bookbags and stuff are in the aisles. and I stumble awkwardly all over their stuff to the empty desk. naturally, everyone is still staring at me as I sit down. I don't mind being the center of attention on a stage, but this is totally different. after an *eternity* of awkwardness and wanting to die, the teacher is like "Um.... can I help you? ... Are you in this class?" NO. I'm NOT. but I couldn't choke anything out!! my eyes are all teary, and if I even try to talk, I'm going to cry. so I'm like "Umm...."<br>   <br>  the teacher's like, "What's your name?" (remember, everyone is still staring at me. like... b*tches! totally ignoring the fact that staring is rude!!) my throat is all hoarse from trying not to cry. and I croak my name... "Sorry...you're not on my list...we've been here since 9. but I mean you can join us if you'd like..." NO. so I re-stumble all over everyone's stupid bags and books and stuff. more staring. ok, somehow on the way up there, I got TOILET PAPER on my SHOE because the bathroom is right in the back!! I didn't notice because I was so mortified and embarassed at this uber awkward moment. so I'm up there, with like toilet paper on my shoe, in front of all of the scary public students. I don't even say anything to the teacher, I just hand him the paper I have with my registration code on it. he is like "oh...shoot!...wait here a second.." and runs out the door. he left me with those scary people!! and I still don't know I have toilet paper on my shoe. my throat is literally like burning from trying not to cry. I just wanted to leave and never come back! <br>  so as I'm standing there, staring out the door, this really, really cute guy was like "ummm...hey?... you have toilet paper on your shoe...." and I look back... and I see it... idk how I didn't start bawling at that moment but I like ripped it off and just kept looking out the door! I didn't even say thanks.. I do remember saying "oh......... that wasnt there when I walked in." so bad!! so so so SO BAD!!! of /course/ the cute boy is right there! I think he knew how embarassed I was. I regret not telling the people like sorry I'm supposed to be taking the driving part... whatever.<br>  <br>  after like a whole horrifying minute of standing there, the teacher walks back in and beckons me out. I'm like already crying at this point. and he explains somehow my driving part got scheduled over another student's driving time. but I wouldnt have to pay for another driving time. I just had to reschedule it. <br>  I honestly dont remember what exactly he was saying, cuz I was so so so embarassed about what just happened!!! of COURSE I had toilet paper on my shoe. I mean ... really? that's never ever happened to me ever. luckily, the mall was only a minute away, and I called my dad to pick me up... if anyone mentions driving school, I'm immediately reminded of this moment.<br>  (Aunt M Rosa, that happened to me too. :P but luckily at an all girl's school, it's not a big deal.)<br>  In a nutshell, my life sucks. xD|`|256891400379bbbbbce12396d37ae520aa	when ever i us to talk about some one in some one Else's home and they had  that person visiting sitting in another room and come out when i was talking about them iv do not talk about any one now so i do not have to worry now.|`|JiH5nJYaaa	Having my monthly(period) and not knowing.

Km6QTk9Caa	Fear of the unknown.  A common and basic fear.   None of us know what awaits us around the corner.  None of us.   We can speculate,  and hope.    With medical problems,   we can research as much as possible,  we can educate ourselves about the subject,  weigh up the pros and cons,   check out the statistics and make a conclusive decision and be resolved with that choice.   That is what I would suggest in regards to making a decision about the surgery.    What are the statistics for successful surgeries,   and improvement of the quality of life.    <br>  See if you can find people who suffer similar condition as yourself and who have received the same treatment and see what their out come was,   get some feedback from real people.<br>  <br>  As for wasting time and not doing enough.   I think you are doing plenty.  You have a giving nature and are generous with your time.  I don't think you are wasting it at all.  But that is my opinion.  If you feel that you want to do more,  where does that drive come from?  Who or what is pressing you to fill your life with so much?<br>  <br>  You seem to be a great person,   and are achieving much already.<br>  I am not sure why you have dismissed your friends.   Remember not every one is going to have the same drive as you,  maybe it frustrates you to see others waste their lives,  and you vow not to be like that yourself.<br>  Try and be patient with the 'jerks'.   hopefully you will also make new more worthwhile friends who share common interests.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day only you know what you are capable of doing physically and mentally.    Life is a journey and it seems you are embracing life quite well,   try not to look so far ahead.  and enjoy the present.   I know that is easier said than done.

There's no way I'd be a surrogate mother, risk my health and waste a year of my life for a kid I didn't want. There is no way that I would ever support women being forced to bear children against their will. It's barbaric.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  <br>  Marx - <br>  "Yep Yep Yep!!!!<br>  And the opposite too would be handy; to be able to sign off his parental rights/ financial responsibilties if he does not feel ready to be a parent (just like women can = equality).<br>  Granted - it's not "his body", but it IS his DNA floating around in there. The death/murder/abortion of a baby isn't "her body" either... it's the baby's body that is being killed."<br>  <br>  So you think a woman should be forced to bear a child for a man if he wants it ... but if she wants the child he can just walk away??? How exactly is that 'equality'???|`|3862H0WVaa	I don't think we are that far away from technically being able to transfer a fetus into an artificial womb and this would make the playing field more level.<br>  <br>  However, we don't know the negative effects of this on a child emotional well being, so I would be very careful about doing this.<br>  <br>  No if a women does not want her child so be it. She has to live with the decision for the rest of her life knowing that a good proportion of the population thinks she is  a murderer.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I'm not sure. I think it's horrible if a woman aborts a child the guy wants and would look after (if he could sign it and be held accountable to this, then great) but it's really wrong to force a woman to go through a pregnancy, so no because it's just nor fair.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|V1MptCMiaa	Yeah, and then they can transport the baby to his body and he can carry it for nine months.<br>  <br>  No, sadly, there is no way men can have a say in what a woman will do with a baby that he wants after a certain amount of time passes.  He can adopt or they can get a surrogate.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	No, the woman has the right to do whatever she wants with her body regardless of what her parents, grandparents, or husband says. Mostly because there's still a chance of death(her death) in giving birth.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Yes.|`|AA10712251	i am 1 of those people that believe in sex for the pure pleasure of it.  society should stop the beleive that it is the womans choice and only her choice. there are 2 peoples lives that will be changed forever with the decision. unmarried people should have to sign an agreenent that they both want the child or if she chooses to have the baby without his agreement then it is hers alone and he should have no responsibility for it. people often say it is his fault; he should have done, but at the same time say only she has a choice. it takes 2 to make a baby it should not be forced on 1. if a man wants a child without the mother there are thousands of women that have babies they dont want,  he can adopt or hire a sarrogate.|`|CspMhUPoaa	Yes, this actually happened in my family a long time ago.<br>  <br>  A few years ago, my grandfather told me that, back when he was young, he got his girlfriend pregnant. She wanted an abortion, but he didn't. In the end, they came to the agreement that he would take sole responsibility for the child as a single father.<br>  <br>  She carried the baby to full term and gave birth, after she left the hospital, she moved to another state and moved on with her life (Nobody has ever heard from her ever since) and my grandfather raised the kid by himself, it wasn't easy, but he did a good job.<br>  <br>  This is not something that will work 100% of the time, but I think it's worth trying at least.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	It would be nice if it was that clean and cut dried.  Unfortunately you are missing out the emotional elements that go into bringing a child into the world.  For many women, an abortion is preferable to having a child and then not knowing what happens to that child. <br>  The trouble with pregnancy is it is very visible  and women would have to spend the rest of their lives with people asking her what happened to the baby and where it is.  You're dropping a tremendous pile of guilt in a woman's lap when she is already in turmoil.  And of course, one day there will be a knock on the door ...<br>  Life is too complicated.  Maybe we should go back to the old days and only sleep with people we really love and who love us in return.|`|AA12144404	No...the woman should not be used an an incubator for a child she does not want...under any circumstances.<br>  <br>    If she wants to hire herself out in that capacity, I am sure that a contract could be arranged through a lawyer that would make it profitable to her.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	If his was the body irrevocably altered by going through pregnancy then of course, but it is not so agree with bonanza, support the woman or walk away, you have that choice, she can't!|`|G50ucmllaa	Yes.  He should be able to pay the woman to carry the child to term (until we advance a bit more in science) and the have her sign over her rights.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yes, the baby is his child too.|`|tYTfT5Hjaa	yes<br>  <br>  i do think that the father should have power on the choice of whether to abort or not..... half of his DNA is in the child<br>  <br>  if i was the father, sure i would sign something like that, no problem, as long as it stops the abortion<br>  <br>  i guess its not a bad idea<br>  <br>  if my wife was considering abortion, i would do anything to stop that from happening, anything, i would kill myself to stop the the abortion<br>  <br>  if the mother really doesnt want the baby, but the father does, than yeah he should sign the papers to have responsiblity for it.... unless he still lives with his wife... then she should pay too|`|VvUWs1veaa	If the man is demed by a judge to be a suitible father and financially stable enough to support the child and if the pregnancy wasn't a result of the father raping her then yes, the mother should be legally required to go through with childbirth and hand the baby over to the father.|`|PRBjG2c2aa	In a perfect world yes he should, but since the woman is the one carrying the child, it is her life that is being changed during the pregnancy, her life that is being disrupted the final decision is hers unless he can figure a way to have baby without her. Just my opinion.|`|E76r5xSxaa	Yep, if he has equal responsibility for raising the child (or paying for it), then he should have an equal say in whether it gets born.|`|S7yN7xnnaa	its the womans body so i guess rationally speaking he couldnt do anything.<br>  <br>  however he should have the choice to opt out of unwanted parenthood.|`|nwZ1ZtRbaa	Sounds like a good compromise to me.

I think the days of a woman depending on a man to "support" her are long over.  My opposition to Feminism has to do with a doctrine that I believe is dangerous, full of fallacies, hypocrisy and encourages hatred of men.<br>  <br>  I think you're confusing opposition to Feminism with some form of third world society where women are treated as second hand citizens.  I believe in equality and it's precisely for this reason that I oppose Feminism, i.e. de facto supremacy by a group of women who feel they're victims of a delusion.|`|wkjncmHTaa	I think they'd be happy to see them euthanised.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	You don't have to be a feminist or even believe in equal rights to hold down a job; I've had several jobs in my lifetime, paid my own bills and rent, yes, I've even lived on my own before getting married; none of them had any bearing upon what I am or what I believe in. <br>  You know there comes a time when a good dose of independence is good for the soul; gives a person a chance to get to know themselves, to know life from their eyes as opposed to someone else's.<br>  No, disability when its not truly needed, will only pull a person down; it's better to fight a situation than to throw in the towel. <br>  Life is full of many challenges, then again that's what life is all about challenges. So, we might as well gird ourselves up and go out there and meet them head on. That's what I did.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Women already have the same rights and opportunities as men in most western societies.

GR5ZUZQkaa	Most boys are wanking before that age, fantasizing about this very act. I don't see how the actual thing would be damaging.<br>  <br>  In my state it is legal for a 16 year old to have sex with someone up to the age of 29, given that the adult is not in a position of power. What is so drastically different between a 14 year old and 16 year old?<br>  <br>  Boys and girls are different. I can rightfully understand why this situation could be damaging to a girl if the genders were reversed, but this isn't the case for a boy. (And I notice most people saying otherwise are females.)|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Well first just think about it the other way around. A 26 year-old man and a 14 year-old girl. I would imagine you might say that this is a man taking advantage of a young girl. Maybe she would go along with it. Maybe she has a crush on him. Maybe she likes the attention. Who knows? Anyway, how do you think this girl will feel about the situation later in life when she realizes she was taken advantage of by somebody who is basically a child molestor?<br>  <br>  Now, consider the same line of reasoning but switch the genders.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Let's keep in mind - apparently, women & men are equal... <br>  <br>  I think there are many areas where this is true... and some where it clearly is not true.<br>  <br>  However, feminism promotes that everyone should be treated the same (except for when a woman may come off worse by having to do exactly the same as a man... e.g. criminal punishment)<br>  <br>  Thus, I'd suggest we treat the boy as being unable to give 'meaningful consent' just as a 14yr old girl would be.<br>  <br>  The woman is clearly a 'rapist'.|`|AA12144404	Well, I don't believe that there would be any damage at all, however it would still be illegal, and therefore dangerous for the woman. <br>  <br>  As for why it would be illegal...Laws do not have to make sense, they just have to be written by legislators. This is just another one of those cases where a harmless act is banned so as not to offend a legislator who is probably offensive enough already.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Are you naive enough to think males are immune to psychological problems?

She is obviously not interested in his 14 year old body, which means shes more interested in completely dominating his mind and making him dependent on her, which is sick and abusive!|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Let me answer your question like this, reverse the roles then look at your question.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	It is abusive behaviour...whether in a position of authority, or older person it is abuse of power.

At the end of the day, he is a child, and being sexually active involves so much more than knowing what bit goes where!<br>  Will just add one thought though, in repsonse to the kneejerk rubbish criticising feminists and claiming equal numbers regarding this issue...what do you think the criminal justice system would do if all underage sex cases...male older, female younger were prosecuted? If I hear one more time..oh! he's 21, she's 15, well girls mature so much faster than boys...we have to make our mind up, what is legal and what is not!|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Damaging? According to the law it is statutory rape. It applies to either gender not just females. Sex with a minor (never specifies either gender) is illegal. If it is illegal when an adult man has "intimate relations" with an underage girl then it is just as illegal the other way around. End of story.|`|NYU37jfGaa	At 14 he is under the age of consent.

Just because you are more productive doesn't necessarily mean you'll also be happier.  We could try to look at survey data that measures all these variables.  We could compare climate with GDP (an estimate of productivity) with happiness/satisfaction surveys.  Or if you think those surveys are too biased, you could invert national suicide rates, and call that an approximation of happiness (but then again, suicide rates can be bogus too).<br>  <br>  In any case, I don't think there is a strong correlation between any of these things.  I think happiness is probably more related to how cultures deal with their climate, than with the climate itself.  Some cultures may have a more positive outlook on winter than in the US.<br>  <br>  Of course, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is supposedly a real thing.  So maybe it's not even climate, but the amount of light.

Alternatively, you may be running from some situation or from temptation. Or it may also mean that you need to hurry up in making a decision.<br>  <br>  To see your grandmother in your dream, represents nurturance, protection, and unconditional love. <br>  <br>  To see or dream that you are on a couch, represents rest, relaxation, laziness or boredom. It may also mean you need to clear you mind and thoughts. Consider also who is on the couch with you as the dream may also have sexual connotations.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are crying, signifies a release of negative emotions that is more likely caused by some waking situation rather than the events of the dream itself. Your dream is a way to regain some emotional balance and a way to safely let out your fears and frustrations. In our daily lives, we tend to ignore, deny, or repress our feelings. But in our dream state, our defense mechanisms are no longer on guard and thus allow for the release of such emotions.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are hugging someone, symbolizes your loving and caring nature. You are holding someone or something close to your heart. Alternatively, it may indicate your need to be more affectionate.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are entering through a door, signifies new opportunities that will be presented before you. You are entering into a new stage in your life and moving from one level of consciousness to another.<br>  <br>  To see your father in your dream, symbolizes authority and protection. It suggests that you need to be more self-reliant. Consider also your waking relationship with your father and how aspects of his character may be incorporated within yourself.<br>  <br>  and with the talk part your subconsious makes ups metifors (ex. theres bugs in your dream- its telling you to say bug off)<br>  <br>  and i think its very normal to know when someone dies who is close to you (same thing happened to me and my mom )<br>  <br>  the second dream i think was foretelling the future they are called Prophetic dreams, also referred to as precognitive or psychic dreams, are dreams that seemingly foretell the future. our dreaming mind is able to piece together bits of information and observation that we normally overlook or that we do not seriously consider. In other words, our unconscious mind knows what is coming before we consciously piece together the same information.<br>  <br>  so maybe you saw something on that chain or something
45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	Through some more bright diligent experimenting, through more than shallow reflection and re-reflection about your feeling awkward or boring, through the more astute management of all those bunches of questions that may pop up within your own mind, you might become able to acquire some more experience and thus feeling more merry more fierce and more exciting within the warm throbbing vaults of your own chest and consequently perhaps also in the company of others, of lover, of family, of friend, of colleagues and even of strangers.<br>  <br>  Through more diligently dedicatedly experimenting on a path towards the things or the goals that you may want to reach in your life, and through deeper reflections with all the good astute resources of your own mind, and with a rich portion of good luck, you might succeed in achieving what you very much would like to achieve.<br>  <br>  While feeling awkward and boring, or while simply suspecting that you might be awkward or boring, you might resolutely daringly try and place your own felt awkwardness and all those troubles that are nagging you<br>  <br>  out of yourself for thus more objectively looking at your life, seeing if you can experiment more with some dreamy solutions, thus perhaps achieving some sense of possible glowing success. If you find no other glowing way or dazzling path, you might decide that all you will want to do is to try and to build up some good glowing memories for a future.<br>  <br>  Allow me to wish you a great good laugh when suddenly feeling yourself like having become a lot more exciting and merry person.

qXjw8acUaa	I think a big part of the reason you can't get over someone who walked all over you besides the fact that we simply want what we can't have is partly do to the fact that you don't love yourself enough to get over him...don't take that the wrong way, let me explain...if you were confident enough in yourself and your own self worth then having a "successful man" by your side would just be icing on the cake that is your life, and if he's not there then ya it sucks, but it's no reason to stop eating and not know how to go on anymore...you're a good person and good people will always gravitate towards each other... the fact that you even have the capacity to care for this person this deeply is reason enough for you to go on, it shows that you are a nice, loving person...when you find a man who's at that same place in his life that you are you'll look back at this over the hill 'success' and laugh at the idea of feeling like you could ever NEED something so sad!|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Hopefully learn from it sweetheart,but please don,t think all men are such pigs. xx|`|6Zuvobqtaa	Make sure you are not just angry with him terminating the relationship. Are you thinking about him because you had this ideal of what he was like and he disappointed you and now are angry and hurt or do you really feel you miss him. <br>  <br>  You feel played, that is your question. It's also your answer. <br>  <br>  Look a bit deeper to what you posted. You are reacting to what he did to you but other than his good looks and financial success is the guy a winner? Lots of Enron CEO's probably looked good and had much money. Sure you want a guy that preys on young women and sounds like he is looking for women he can control. Your not like that, be greatful he is no longer in your life. <br>  <br>  Go out, have fun, make new friends. You are much too young to worry about some guy who is afraid of growing old. Which is why he keeps looking for young girls.

Anger is a defense mechanism people use when they feel threatened in some way or just want to elicit a response from another person. I find it best not to get angry back at them, it just escalates things. Keep to the subject at hand if it is a subject you are discussing and do not react if that person says something negative to you or seems to be trying to get you angry. They just want a negative response to their own negative feelings. It's like a magnet. <br>  <br>  Do not be offended by them either. Often they really do feel that they have been through things you have not been and they feel their anger is an entitlement of sorts. It is not. Anger is not a good way to be, it's not healthy for the body or mind. Not for you and not for that other person. Move on, understand that you might not be able to convince them that the world or fate is against them. If you do not do this you are entering their world, getting sucked into it and you will be angry too.|`|S8mAO0L5aa	usually they're as angry as any normal person but they have a worse way of handling it, they have to tell the whole world that this or that happened to them, complaining all the time about little things that happen. Sometimes it may be hard to do but confront them. Tell them that they complain way too much about little things that happen to everyone. It's also good to throw in about how other people have it worse. If they start complaining just throw in random facts such as, "Do you know that so many people in Africa die because they don't have the right medical attention? Yet you see pictures of them with huge smiles on their faces, you know why? Because they're happy they're alive." Hopefully they'll get the hint, if not try helping them deal with anger the same way that helps you. If they get angry during bad traffic, tell them to listen to relaxing music like Enya or go get a massage or more sleep. Things like relaxing really helps make these angry people less stressed. Hope that helps!|`|KcxzHceIaa	Let me first mention that anger is aggression,which in turn is a symton of frustration,which is caused when someone is trying to do something which they believe will satisfy a need that they have in there life and something or someone is preventing them doing it.Normally they direct this anger at what is obstucting them.Fixation is another sympton which is when someone repeats their actions even although it is getting them nowhere,ie being angry at everyone.The other three being,rationalation,trying to explain why they cant do or get it,resignation,not even trying any more,regression,childlike behavior ie crying.People who are angry all the time mainly display the first two behaviors.The trick is trying to find out what need they are trying to satisfy, and what they are trying to do to achieve this.Once and if u can figure this out can you remove the obstruction or find something else that will satisfy that need.Also is the need that important anyway,sometimes people attach too much importance to certain things ie a football fan,and i do like football myself but sometimes we take things too serious and the above starts to happen even though we mean well and slowly we drive people away from us.A final thought,if someone is constantly being frustrated,they are filling up with bad feelings which in the long run will start to damage their health.Hope this answer has been helpfull to you and best of luck in future.|`|NnG5GBGAaa	Generally speaking I tend to avoid people with "issues".<br>  Its not my job to fix people, or convince them of anything.<br>  However, if its someone close to me, dealing with anger, who I care about...best way is to defuse the situation. Stay calm, rational, level headed. The last thing an angry person needs is a confrontation.

LsBS5bOCaa	((((you're thinking too much)))<br>  <br>  Why don't you stick it out through school with medicine so at least you have a degree in something. In the meantime, keep brushing up on your writing or song writing and apply it via small avenues, like a publishing your book (small press), or try to get a song published for someone else to sing (a local-around-the-way band you know).....you don't have to go wild and crazy... take baby steps. In five years, after you graduate, then proceed onto your hearts desire, sounds like you come from money.....so....what's the problem?  <br>  <br>  And that part about you saying "I'm too old to go in a new direction at 23".......

If writing is what you want to do then I would say go for it!!! But if the lack of security is going to bother you than I think you should get a degree in something now just for the steady income and write on the side.  Especially with the way the economy is going.  Go on a trip, get away from school for a while...make some close friends somewhere and really find yourself.  After you come to terms with things within yourself and become happy with yourself then knowing what you really want to do will be clearer.

WomRzhxPaa	Try these two meditations if you want....They will release negative energy and give positiveness.<br>  <br>  Jyothi Meditation<br>  <br>  Based on Bhagavan's step-by-step directions.<br>  <br>  Jyothi (flame) Meditation is the foremost spiritual discipline geared towards gaining inner peace.<br>  <br>  1) We should have a fixed time and place every day where we sit for meditation either in the morning and/or evening.<br>  <br>  2) We should sit on a thin mattress for this exercise.  The sitting pose or asana should be comfortable both for our mind and body.<br>  <br>  3) We should then chant Omkar, the Universal Mantra glorified as 'Nada Brahma' at least 3 times but preferably 21 times.  The mind under the influence of this divine sound slowly loses momentum and becomes more and more tranquil and steady.<br>  <br>  4) The next step is to put the breath in rhythm.  The easiest and the most effortless method is to watch the breath, thereby the process becomes normal, that is, longer and calmer.  When we inhale, the breath sounds 'So' and when we exhale, it sounds 'Humm' which means 'He' i.e. "God" and 'I' respectively or "God am I".<br>  <br>  5) Accordingly, synchronizing with these two breaths, imagine that the flame 'Jyot' is within us.  Feel that the light of the flame is in our heart, right in the centre of the Lotus.  Gently move the light to other parts of your body -- the stomach, the limbs, the eyes, the ears and the tongue.  Feel that the entire body is illumined thereby. Rejoice that the light is the light of love; it removes hatred; it dispels darkness and doubt; it reveals that all are Divine.<br>  <br>  6) As the light fills the eyes, you must feel that they have been purified.  They shall no longer seek to look upon evil sights.  When the light lights the tongue with love, decide that there is no more scope for uttering harsh words.  Similarly, once the radiance of the divine light bathes the arms, they can no longer delight in performing harmful deeds while the feet can no longer move into polluting areas and places.<br>  <br>  7) Now visualize the light as surrounding our physical body and spreading far out to family members, neighbours and even those whom we do not like.  Every object is enveloped in that divine effulgence.  Isavaasyam Idam Sarvam.  All this is illumined by God.  This is the stage of bliss.<br>  <br>  8) In this manner, the ONE flame on which we concentrate can cleanse our mind and body and spread its light and radiance to include our entire environment.<br>  <br>  9) Finally, take the Jyot on to the figure of our Ishta Devta or the Deity of you choice and/or fix our vision on the Jyot, and commence meditation or silent sitting for a few minutes, followed by Japa of our chosen Mantra with the full understanding of its meaning and firm faith in its power and benefits.  It should be inter-woven with our breathing process of inhaling and exhaling.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise on Jyoti Meditation. Instructions compiled from Sri Sathya Sai Discourses<br>  <br>  1. Let us close the eyes and chant Omkar (OM) 3 times<br>  <br>  To make the mind become tranquil and steady. <br>  <br>  2. Keeping the eyes closed, let us put the breath in rhythm<br>  <br>  To make it normal and calmer.<br>  <br>  In our mind (mentally) repeat "SOHUM'. (1-2 mins.)<br>  <br>  As we inhale mentally repeat "SO"<br>  <br>  As we exhale mentally repeat "HUM".   (1-2 mins.) <br>  <br>  3. Let us mentally bathe the senses in the light<br>  <br>  Look at the Jyoti, imagine that the flame is ablaze in the <br>  <br>  Lotus of our heart.

Open the eyes and look at the Jyoti. (2-3 mins.) <br>  <br>  5. Now imagine the figure, of the form of your choice (Baba), for worshipping in the Jyoti.  (2-3mins.) <br>  <br>  6. Effortlessly repeat OM SAI RAM or your personal mantra. (2-3 mins.)<br>  <br>  It should be natural and without tension.  Relax. <br>  <br>  7. Slowly close the eyes and meditate for a few minutes. (15-20 mins.)<br>  <br>  8. Keep the eyes closed, stop repeating the mantra, or having the flame and form consciously.   (2-3 mins.)<br>  <br>  9. End meditation.

Things will get easier and after a few meetings you will relax. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|xYQlrqBiaa	its because your so concerned about being accepted(relative term) and being liked by these new people, that your afraid to say what you truly believe, and therefore replace your true feelings with ones that coincide with theres. basically your trying to be a likeable person by agreeing with them all the time, which makes you boring, but your too scared to voice your true personality, because of the consequences, and social reprocussions it might have. you have no fear with your family because your not afraid to say anythign, but when your at school(in case of your example) your constantly evaluating the next thing your going to say. dont think too much, and be confident about what you say. dont make statements, that have the tone suggesitng a possible question mark at the end. this indicates insecurity. your BE CONFIDENT.|`|4vg6ANwLaa	i have the same issue,<br>  when im around my family i scream, shout, tell jokes and sometimes be a little obnoxious and drive people crazy<br>  but at school im so shy and quiet people always ask me stuff like "omg i have never heard u talk before", or "say something?!, can u say hello?"<br>  but when i feel comfortable around them and really get to no them i can start talking to them without worrying about saying something stupid or doesn't make sense.<br>  so all you have to do is really get used to being around them more, by the end of the school year you should be more comfortable and free spirited around them, i only really have about 6 close friends that i can act goofy around because i no their personalities- i got to hang around them in P.E. and got to no them. i went from thinking that their unfriendly and unsocial but when i started talking to them more we became closer, we share the same habits and dislikes so we always get along and now we hangout with each other any free time we have.<br>  but if your looking for someone different and more exciting and out going then put yourself out there- one of my best friends whom ive known for 8 years (that goes to a different school)  has a completely different personality and attitude than me- i dislike pepperoni and she loves it, she loves to act and dance and i hate it, shes daring , boy-carzy, neat and im insecure, artistic, and shy but what i like about her is that shes also very social, out going, and she inspires me- almost like shes my rolemodel and i look up to her- when she gets goofy and crazy when were in public it makes me feel like being goofy and crazy so we have lots of fun together, and that's what gets me used to being myself more often- it may also be because you need more sleep-when your tired during the day your quiet because your sleepy and later throughout the day you gain energy and when you get home your more energetic and talkative- you wish you could be like that at school so people are more interested in you.<br>  remember to always be yourself- this is how you make friends with similar personalities as you so you can open up to them about anything and they will understand completely|`|vDg3SHdqaa	Ahhhh, dude, that's how i act at school, i'm shy at school, but so funny and outgoing with fam or anywhere else but school..<br>  <br>  you should bump into him accidentally and get stuff going from there(like drop your books and let him pick them up haha)|`|AdhtCYQOaa	try talking about the things you do with your family. its your family's environment and personality that makes your personality|`|51ebf28f8fd55015dd1aa2e036383229aa	Be yourself and don't stop for anyone.

That was his choice.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Since when does forking over money every month equal shouldering ALL the responsibilities?  And I don't use the "it's my body" argument to allow abortions I use the "why the hell should the government or any man have ownership of my uterus" argument.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Why do men want sole rights to abortion? If two people are irresponsible enough to have sex with no intention of being accountable for the outcome, then they shouldn't have sex because they are still children. If the man wants the child and the woman does not, then it's my opinion that the man should be able to have a say and raise the child on his own without the mother. It's nuts to me that it's not already common practice.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's the woman's body when it's a foetus in her body, when it is a child and has been born it is no longer her body her choice, it is a child that needs to be supported by BOTH parents.

It's hypocrisy.  Basically, it's not a woman's right to decide what to do with her own body, it's a woman's right to play God with a child's, and ultimately, a father's life.  There are no real logical arguments here.  <br>  <br>  I don't support fathers being able to walk out on their kids and think those that willingly do are scum, but at least the child is alive in that case, unlike when abortion is done to the child, which, when you get down to it, is a way for a mother to avoid responsibilty to raise a child.<br>  <br>  Answer above mine- You do know women have that choice before sex too, don't you?<br>  <br>  Kathryn, men don't have a say.  That is my point.  The woman has total control in this situation.  Therefore your argument is pointless.|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I'm a firm believer in Choice for Men.

BwPmFhkxaa	I'm thinking you are probably talking about yourself here.  Suicide is extremely selfish.  If you are depressed about your situation do something about it.  You have no family, make a family.  You live in a bad area, get educated and get out.  There is always hope.  And something I always tell myself when I'm down is this, "God would never put you in a situation he doesn't think you can handle".  That always gives me comfort, maybe you can use it too.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Suicide is selfish. If you/your friend are going to do it thats natural selection.

Pull yourself out of the gutter & do something about it.|`|68etazoGaa	People commit suicide to get away from life. If you kill yourself then you're going to be in hell forever. Wouldn't you much rather live? At least in life, you can fix things and amount to something. If you kill yourself, you'll be miserable forever, no joke. You'll hate yourself for giving into the devil. It sounds like you or who ever it is on the verge of suicide is in a bad situation, but you'll pull through, it won't kill you. And if it does kill you, at least as long as you're saved you'll go to heaven and not hell. Don't ask why I responded, but I saw the question and couldn't avoid replying.

vijGOcPCaa	Having a certain sexual fetish does not mean you have a mental illness at all people just say you are weird, because some fetish's are more obscure then others, like yours is less common then something your friend might share, etc. so it does not mean you are mentally ill, you just have a fetish that your friend did not understand. People fear what they do not understand, is an old saying, and i think it fits very well into this situation.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	you are a typical fetish masochist but the bum is highly sensitive and if smacked there obviously it is very close to a females genitalia and the vibrations of it cause arousal. You don't walk alone. Now if you cross over into severe pain issues that is when you have a problem. Severe masochism can get you killed.|`|0ksJVQ04aa	No, its not likely anyone can help you th eliminate this fetish.  The experts believe that if you  have this desire imprinted on your personality then its always going to be there.  So, I suggest you make sure that your man desires your best interests and is careful not to cause any  permanent injury to you. Also, a limber leather strap could satisfy your love for pain more effectively than a bare hand.
4dXcZhuTaa	no, not in any way.<br>  it does not prepare you mentally let alone physically.|`|QqoIJNXBaa	I don't really think you would have any kind of advantage. Maybe a little bit because you would understand the language of war, you would be basically familiar with what different kind of guns do, and you would have some basic idea of strategy.<br>  <br>  But the differences between sitting on a couch using a video game controller to shoot computer-generated images, and actually suiting up, carrying heavy equipment, seeing comrades die and actually being faced with shooting another human being... that difference is just so huge. There's really no way of knowing how you would react.|`|9O5Y1Kavaa	Most of those games are extremely unrealistic. My older brother used to play those games all the time. When he went to fight in war, several of his close friends were horribly wounded and one of his best friends died right after they got in a fight. In the video game, you don't develop close bonds with your so called "comrades." Nothing in the world couild prepareyou for war. Most soldiers are scarred for life after seeing what they see over seas.|`|Ab4HRBFpaa	Well, you would learn some war-related things about guns and technology since some stuff in games is factual in amongst all the fiction. But the fictional elements might breed bad habits like charging into a room, ready to take a few bullets as long as their is a med kit nearby and you dont lose all "100" health. Needless to say, that kind of mindset would get you killed. But the majority of people wouldnt be that stupid either I guess. So it depends on the person, but any difference any way is most likely only marginal.|`|m16dhfrGaa	No.  I think you would get a completely false idea, and the more games you play the more rooted that notion would be, which would leave you completely unprepared for the reality of the situation.

QqoIJNXBaa	As far as I know, crying is just like laughing in that most people don't really know why they do it, it's just an instinctual reaction to emotion. It's a way humans communicate because laughing and crying are both universally understood.<br>  <br>  I seem to remember learning in a psychology class that no one has been able to explain why we laugh. If someone knows the biological reason behind crying I would be very interested to hear that.<br>  <br>  As for why we cry when both happy or sad, I believe that crying can be brought on by any intense emotion, so it makes sense that it happens when both sad or very happy. I think it's beautiful when someone is so happy that they cry.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	normally when i'm hurt or depressed.<br>  but sometimes when im really really happy and over-powered with someone's kindness.|`|4c692d7ab158ee64f8b0f7a892d3e769aa	both|`|V0S92gZLaa	I just got hints that my girlfriend might not love me anymore.

Nldx247Yaa	get rid of the negative attitude and stop focusing on your failures. be assertive and focus on what you can do not what you can't... your negativity will rub off on your actions and then failure will be inevitable.you can't let that happen, so have a little faith in yourself and stay positive... and remember to learn from your failures so you don't repeat them, never ever dwell on them. <br>  at this point, it's about not thinking bad things about yourself more than thinking about good things.. yeah, it's kinda awkward to think this way, but you seem to think more about bad things about yourself, so i think it'd be easier to just forget about all the bad, and sooner or later, the good will follow. <br>  good luck :)|`|fkQUCwUhaa	i like failing a lot to, but i believe  god will  make it so i win something eventually|`|AA11324847	F*** if I know, I'm the same way just plugging through life...|`|QqoIJNXBaa	I find it hard to believe that you're failing at ALL you do.

qXjw8acUaa	the thing that always worked best for me in college was to go to the library with at least 2 hours more time than i actually needed to study...so for example, if i needed to do 2 hours of school related work i'd go to the library with a 4 hour block of time to be there....the point was for the first entire hour of being there i would do NOTHING to do with studying or homework, if i saw people i knew there, i'd go socialize, then i'd get online and do email, read blogs, write blogs, myspace, whatever it was that kept my mind off of school, basically treat myself to fun...then once that hour was up, I'd be bored of messing around the internet and talking so now it's time to get to work...then i'd do school work for another hour, so now 2 hours down, 2 to go....then i'd do it in half hour increments for the rest of the time left...half hour play, half hour work, half hour play, half hour work and before i knew it i had all my homework done and had lots of fun in the process!|`|AA10387019	action and replace your distorted thoughts with rational thoughts

I can't think of many positive reasons other than that, and I don't think that's positive at all.<br>  It's negative because that independent thinker often thinks out of the box even if they are not team players.<br>  It's negative because there is no one personality that will fit any organization.<br>  It's negative because it stereotypes people.<br>  It's negative because you are given a label.
qXjw8acUaa	I would say that your body is reacting to being without not only medication but also cigarettes as well...This is all the more reason for you to STAY OFF BOTH OF THEM FOR GOOD! These 'symptoms' you describe are temporary and the longer you continue your medication and/or cigarette smoking the longer you put off the inevitable which is what's happening to you now...just stick it out and be strong and know that when the anxiety happens due to your imagination it's normal and it's not real...also try to write while feeling those feelings...open up a word document on a computer or snag a pen and paper and start putting your feelings down, also try to write down things you are greatful for...it'll be hard to force yourself to do these things but well worth it I promise!|`|5f9hg9craa	-------------<br>  |VROOM  \<br>  |--o-----o-----]<br>  <br>  You yourself know the answer, and it is up to you to really find the answer.

No, I do not agree with this statement. Anytime a woman has educated yourself via, college or trade school etc. to gain knowledge to do a respectable job this is a very good and wise choice. If you are happy with your occupation, simply never mind those woman. They probably sit at home and wait for their husbands to bring home paychecks so they can go to the spa and acquire your services. And may have been upset that a man was not the one servicing them with a massage. Due to the lack of attention they receive from their husbands. They prefer the attention of a male massage therapists. Sounds as though they were simply a bit jealous and envious of your career.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	Sorry; I have trouble believing this actually happened.  <br>  <br>  Massage therapy is a perfectly respectable profession.  I've known several massage therapists who (were feminists and) were always treated like the professionals they were.  They and their services were very much in demand.<br>  <br>  And if those wealthy, educated women were anything like the wealthy, educated women I know who have the time to frequent day spas, their heads were too far up their butts to make snotty comments about you.<br>  <br>  edit:  No, they WEREN'T feminists!!|`|6qPTQDdZaa	They are idiots, particularly if they're actually getting massages.<br>  <br>  Also, feminists did not give women the right to work outside the home to whoever said that.

And you're so detailed.  You are really able to so perfectly recall the conversation of two women that perfectly?  Your scenario does not ring true.  Which said what?

When you provide a feminist from the real world who would ever say anything as stupid as that, maybe we can analyze your complaint.  Considering that we want women in as many well paying jobs as possible, no feminist I know would consider a massage therapist anti-woman.  They would have to include physical therapists, and any other therapists who touch people, anti woman.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	No, they're stupid. They're just unhappy people who have to put others down to make themselves feel better about themselves. Why would they have to talk about that while in a day spa?..

And so thank god for people like you.|`|5c936a54fb80e00b663741498162c091aa	its good that you have a job. it took feminists YEARS of fighting to even allow women to work outside the house.|`|wkjncmHTaa	I think that's bizarre. Massage therapist is a perfectly respectful profession.|`|V1MptCMiaa	A massage therapist has to go through a lot of school and training, call girls don't.  Obviously message therapists are very important even to the two ladies who were degrading your career while they waited to get a massage.  They're idiots, don't listen to them.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	I think you're job is great and these people are dumb, and if they have EVER had a massage, they are also hypocritical.  As a person who gets a weekly massage and tremendously enjoys and believes in the benefit of massage, I thank you for what you do.|`|AA11589988	That was a very ignorant comment from those "ladies". My massage therapist (a guy) is highly educated in anatomy and he's helped me a lot.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	No, I don't.

Yep, sure you did...and they were in the spa for a feminist meeting were they, not some sort of therapy or treatments? These wealthy, bluestocking, university educated radical feminists out for a hose down..please!<br>  Ok to curry greater approval, you are telling the truth, there is no such thing as sisterhood, feminists declared war on masseuse just after they called for all male firt born to be killed...was that Dworkin or Pontius Pilate, I can't remember. And that's ok...that you are forgetting that the gender who has the reputation for sexualising any profession which may involve a woman's hand coming into contact with another human being naked or otherwise is not usually women, ok? <br>  One questioner on here asked if you did extras? So, who would you take your chances with in your spa? The two spiteful gits, or the men on here who smile nicely and tell you they respect the noble profession they value...but do you do extras?
UkVUCN5Maa	Through high school. especially after running for office, you will grow out of your stutter.<br>  <br>  I used to stutter way too much. I was told to be grammaticaly correct, but that made it worse. The main reason you stutter is because you have two different sentences in your head<br>  <br>  ex:<br>  Can you tell me where the candies are?<br>  + Can you tell me where the candy is?<br>  = Can you tell me where the candy are?<br>  But then you try to correct yourself, leading to a stutter.<br>  <br>  Remember, most people aren't always grammatically correct, so don't worry! Thinking about the sentence in your head doesn't help too much either.<br>  <br>  %One way to help the stuttering is to formulate your mouth better, like with tongue twisters! <br>  <br>  %Reading aloud also helps! Try reading this answer one more time aloud. This gets your brain used to finishing sentences,<br>  <br>  Don't feel self-concious! I used to stutter, and I ran for school president and won! Isaac Newton stuttered, and he is considered the most influential person in history!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0UHzfM59aa	How old are you? You can always self-refer yourself to the speech-language pathologist assigned to your school. She/he could probably evaluate you and maybe give you small group or one-to-one lessons if you qualify to help your stuttering. Also, I don't think there's any evidence to back up left handedness being linked to stuttering or your cognitive abilities (sorry!).|`|PbI9jGYkaa	I'm 13. Gosh, last year you have no idea how bad I stuttered.<br>  Don't think about it. Just don't care about it.<br>  <br>  If I worry about it, it comes.<br>  <br>  I speak fine now.

Y1npBMS0aa	first off you wrote everything PERFECT! GOOD JOB :]<br>  secondly Pride and Prejudice i believe uses language from a  long time ago so it would be really hard for me, even though ive lived here all my life and english is my first language. dont even start to feel unsure you are amazing at english and dont let anybody tell you different:)<br>  but if you really want to learn how to do that just practice practice practice. but maybe by yourself first or a friend incase you are afraid of embarrassing yourself. well good luck sweetie :]|`|IHw2qUtcaa	My grammar and spelling is worse than yours and I've lived in England all my life. Don't stress about it.|`|m16dhfrGaa	So, you are fluent in English and Chinese and you think you have a problem?  Your grammar in your question is almost perfect ( I would have put a comma between 'grammar' and 'mainly') and there is no need for you to be incorporating phrases from English that was spoken 200 years ago.  If I were in your position I would be looking for work translating, as there are comparatively few people who know Chinese and have such good English.<br>  <br>  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Your question has better grammar and spelling than many questions, or answers, from people born and bred in the US, who are older than you!  Remember that language evolves and if you are getting a negative reaction to your classic phrases it is because that form of English has become outdated, and the people around you probably haven't read the classics like you have.|`|QqoIJNXBaa	You definitely shouldn't worry about your English! There are people who were born and raised in English-speaking countries who have far worse grammar and spelling than you!<br>  <br>  There was nothing in what you wrote that stuck out at me as incorrect.<br>  <br>  Please don't feel unsure about your English! You're only 13, it will continue to get better. Especially if you continue to read and write.
jgahsdXOaa	set weekly, or even daily goals. but weekly seems to work better for me. say to yourself "i'm not going to get anything lower than a 94 this week" and tell all your friends. then at the end of the week you can be liek "yeah i got all a's this week! you didn't :P haha :P" and if you didn't stick up to your goal your friends will make fun of you and they will be like "haha you are lame you didn't make all a's you are ALL talk. " that's enough motivation for me, cause i get embarrassed easily. and it works for me. I got all A's last week :D
uVH3IoTjaa	As far as suggestions go, people who bypass your blocks cannot edit their responses, so it is quite easy to chew them out however you feel like after they post, secure in the knowledge they won't be able to update any comments they made.<br>  <br>  It can be quite fun watching them create account after account just to have a new identity to post another comment with.<br>  <br>  We all know what GWS has degenerated into, there hardly seems much point engaging here any more.  At one time it was a place for information sharing and exchange.  I honestly don't understand how you can find the will to keep engaging with it as much as you do.  Other places may be imperfect but you would be hard pressed to find such a pointless waste of space as the one here.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	The only purpose served by blocking is to stop them reporting you. They can still go ahead and answer if they want. Consider them to be similar to those people who constantly write letters to the editor but don't have any actual power. <br>  <br>  You can also answer theirs if you want to, even if they block you.<br>  <br>  So the answer is yes indeedy, some people really are that arrogant and disrespectful on here! This is a practically impossible place to police, especially when not everyone being policed has the same view of what's acceptable. <br>  <br>  It's very anarcho-democratic. The only serious downside is that the lowest common denominator tends to repel others and multiply itself, so one ends up with a fairly repellent nest of .. er..people with issues.<br>  <br>  At the point where you can't take it/don't feel like bothering, you have the option of leaving.<br>  <br>  This is like a bushfire. You have the option of staying and fighting, or leaving. But it's unlike a bushfire in that these options always stay open. In a bushfire, when you can see flames it's too late to leave.|`|AHJZeo8Oaa	You don't have an option to block them.  You have an option to stop them viewing your question whilst signed in, thus preventing them from reporting you.  It's harsh but true - if you don't like certain people on here answering your questions, then you'll have to stop asking questions on here.  I learned the trick from trolls who answered my questions whilst blocked, and now I use it against people who have me blocked.  Life is not always fair, but sometimes you can use it to your own advantage  :-)<br>  <br>  Hey - at least take some comfort from the thought that they can't edit their answer to you, so if you make snarky remarks to them, they can't answer back|`|3wWpKexoaa	The Yahoo community doesn't allow it, simply put the Yahoo community (which just means people who click on yahoo every so often) can't do anything about it, because Yahoo does not make any effort to prevent or stop it.<br>  <br>  A place where dissenting views are treated with respect, and moderation exists would be nice, instead of the low level argy bargy and stupid point scoring here. People of ideas and intelligence with a real voice would be welcome in such a place.<br>  <br>  It's worth thinking about, anyway.<br>  <br>  Cheers :-)|`|vvgmyX04aa	Yes it is disrespectful. They are blocked so clearly their input is not wanted by the individual. It is like persisting in haranging someone who clearly doesn't want to talk to you.<br>  <br>  But then we are talking about a group of disturbed men who obsessively come to an online space where women gather so they can harass and whine and also to gang up to try to bully and intimidate us.<br>  <br>  They know perfectly well they are not welcome by the majority of normal people with their behaviour and they would be asked to leave if this were a physical gathering. They do it because They Can.<br>  <br>  <br>  Re blocking: it is an availavle option and anyone has the right to use it for anyone they don't like. It is like the ignore option in a chatroom or a killfile in a newsgroup.|`|PymVygFraa	They may just care about you?<br>  Also, you can set your questions to private (=<br>  xx|`|G50ucmllaa	I think the pot is calling the kettle black.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Hello Jo<br>  <br>  simple answer, take me off your blocked list.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do you have webcam?|`|a66UyAh8aa	"Are people really that arrogant and disrespectful on here?"<br>  <br>  Yep.

I can tell you what my father did when I was very young (I have my own child now). He played a game with me one night before bed. It was an "army game" where i pretended that my bed was a tank.

Then he told me that anytime I was scared at night I was allowed to play that game. It did the trick...when I got scared I would just get into the tank...i didn't go wake my dad up anymore. I suppose that if you had a girl you could tell her that she is in an enchanted tower or something like that. I would also make sure that they are not watching anything scary on TV or playing any scary videos games.|`|AA10806706	it happen to me once.if you get them to stay in a dark a<br>  area for a while for a period of time,they will over with it.|`|VZRJZQxKaa	I think so|`|c0gLj6Paaa	of course! all kids go through that, it ends at age ..10
6kUx7fwcaa	To make it somewhat easy on you, imagine that the child is adopted.  In that way none of the parents genetic characteristics have any influence on the child's development.  On the other hand, any genetic influence on the child's development will not be known.<br>  <br>  The parents are professionals with stable jobs.  They have a good relationship with their families, both coming from families where they were the first college educated members.  Both parents helped to support their way through college.  Both parents came from moderately large families and maintain contact with their brothers and sisters.  Both families accept the concept of adoption.<br>  <br>  The child is adopted at one year two months of age and end up suffering from separation anxiety.  The child becomes extremely attached to his mother (it is a boy).  On the other hand, he is quite intelligent.  His separation anxiety results in slower social maturity.  Since he was exposed to a foreign language at a critical point in development, he develops a lisp because he cannot properly discriminates the sounds of language.  He is provided with early childhood intervention to assist language and concept development.  Despite these problems, with the help of loving parents, he progresses fairly well in protected surroundings (private schools).  He continues to show insecurities in life, but he tries hard to surmount them and they become minor problems.  He is slightly hyperactive, but appears to control his hyperactivity in school and the school does not require medication. <br>  <br>  Well, use your imagination for the rest.  You will have to organize it better, such as in Cognitive Development, Social Development, Language Development, Emotional Development, Academic Development.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Of course it depends on whether you want a well adjusted child or a juvenile delinquent, etc. (which no matter how someone is raised is a definite of how they will turn out) to be in your papers.<br>  The parents could both be brought up rich and somewhat spoiled, and have children just because they believe in the "perfect family" syndrome.<br>  Then they could have children that think that they deserve everything and have always gotten everything they wanted, yet are unhappy.<br>  OR... Two people fall in love even though one is from a poor family and one is from a rich family. The richer family is of course not in favor of the marriage. But the children are brought up to see both sides of the spectrum and are well adjusted. Or....the child was raised by totally poor parents and realized that they don't want to live the rest of their life that way and gets grants, goes to college and becomes successful. <br>  There are so many different situations, and like I said, you can't predict how a child will turn out just on the way that they were brought up.<br>  I have been kind of vague, but I'm just giving you some thoughts.<br>  Good Luck To You!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	give one or both of the parents a psychological disorder.<br>  OCD, depression, manic depression, anxiety disorder..<br>  something that could be passed onto the child...<br>  nobody is perfect and most families have psych disorders, which of course as i am sure you know are hereditary|`|jaBjb6Nsaa	Anything really, you can have a single paper because the other ran off, you can have a happy mother and father i nthe perfect relationship, a religious mother and father, a druken father who beats the mother, a stay at home mom, a stay at home dad, a mom and dad who fight all the time.

AA10461474	Your first priority should be your nephew. In all likelihood he is being neglected & exposed to drug-taking & even drug-dealing and now is about to become homeless. Talk to your parents about your concerns. You'll need their support to bring your nephew (not your brother) into your home. The alternative is calling CPS. Unfortunately, your brother will have to hit his own rock-bottom and it may mean being homeless & losing his child. From what you've said, he does need straight-up rehab. Remember, the interventions you see on TV are scripted.|`|qXjw8acUaa	the only way you're ever going to truly HELP your brother is when he wants to help himself...if that requires you guys figuring out how to get his son out of a dangerous situation then so be it...WHATEVER it takes to give your brother a 'sneak peak' at what life will be like if he continues down this path of self destruction...if it's opiates he's destroying himself with your best option AND his is to find a methadone clinic where he'll have an option to not only receive counseling on a bi-weekly basis but also methadone or suboxin whichever him and his counselor see best for his situation...if it's something else he's struggling with then I suggest if you want to help him you get him to go to a couple local AA or NA meetings with you and have him listen to stories of people who's lives have been flipped upside down as a result of living a life of drugs and how much better sobriety is....but bottom line is HE HAS TO WANT TO HELP HIMSELF FOR YOU TO EVER BE ABLE TO HELP HIM!

srIMFTb8aa	Unfortunately, that's just not practical.  There are men who would abuse that right and father countless children with no intent to support them.<br>  <br>  One of my best friends (Jenny, as a matter of fact) got pregnant from a one-night-stand with a guy who took the condom off when she wasn't paying attention.  She now has a 10-year-old son, and she's never seen a penny from the father.  And believe me, she's asked for it.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine how much more often this would happen if it were legal?|`|V1MptCMiaa	But he IS the father of the child.  There are already men who have gotten a woman pregnant and haven't had to fork over a dime for something that both of them did.  Men have to be given some sort of responsibility in these situations.  Women are.  When you have sex, you better be prepared for the consequences, if men knew that they could just opt out of supporting his child, what good would that do?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No. The woman has the choice because it's her body. It's not very fair but there's no way to make it any fairer. If a child is born, both parents should support it regardless of what the guy wanted. he knows this when he consents to sex.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|qgL98Wv2aa	YES YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES.................<br>  <br>  if women want TRUE EQUAL RIGHTS then there should be no problem with this AT ALL......i have said time and time again if a woman has the right to use abortion as a form of birth control so should a man by declaring himself during the same duration of the pregnancy as a woman can.......if she lies to him about her pregnancy then tricks him into child support then he too must BE GIVEN  the options to declare himself "LEGALLY ABORTED FROM THE FETUS/CHILD" just like a woman can.......if that were to become legal watch the number of 'UNWANTED PREGNANCIES" decline.....i am a woman and mother and grandmother EQUAL ALL THE WAY OR NOT AT ALL.......|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Yep Yep Yep.<br>  <br>  Equality - yanno.<br>  <br>  <br>  (watch feminists boo hoo about men receiving equality)|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It only makes sense to me that a guy should have a say and I'm a feminist. It is his baby too.|`|FUIBscKGaa	The mras are talking about this idea called "male abortion".  They want for men to be able to walk away if a woman gets pregnant by him.  Seems like a simple condom would fix that trick.  And if he doesn't want children, get a vasectomy.  It's pretty irresponsible to not not control where your sperm is going (just as it is for women who don't protect themselves against unwanted pregnancy)  Some men think that "but she told me she was on the pill" thing excuses them, and that birth control is only required of women.  Interestingly, when researchers were developing a birth control pill for men, the market research showed that too few men would use it.  The drug companies dropped the idea for just that reason.  Go figure.<br>  <br>  So no, I do not believe that people who make babies should be able to walk away.  Doing so was once very common among men, and women had no recourse.  Thankfully, that is no more.  Thanks to laws pushed for by feminists, men and women are legally obligated to financially support any children they bring into this world.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Morally, I don't think so.  It's not in the best interests of the child.<br>  <br>  Legally, I don't see why not.  Women already have a highly immoral choice for themselves that results in no child at all.  Which is worse, not living or living with only one parent?  If women don't want an abortion, they should take steps to prevent getting pregnant.  It's not her body she's aborting.<br>  <br>  You know, the more I hang around here, the more I begin to understand exactly why so many fathers feel helpless and unimportant.  I have also pretty much lost all sympathy for pro-choice single mothers I used to have.  It's your "property," remember?  You deal with it.

F4ptJH67aa	To help remember? One strategy is to incorporate the subject of study and relate it to your life. Maybe the subject your studying reminds you of a song, or a bird, or maybe even a person.

QqoIJNXBaa	Because of the very "open" state of mind that an individual enters into when hypnotized, they are very susceptible to suggestive and leading questions. Individuals who hypnotize others have throughout the history of hypnotism very often unintentionally placed ideas (even false memories) in the minds of their subjects. This clearly is a huge concern if hypnotism were to be used in court cases.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the same "open" state of mind allows some people the opportunity to speak about difficult subjects that they would feel uncomfortable or unable to speak about under other circumstances. A child who is kidnapped may feel ashamed or too scared to talk about the ordeal. An experienced and responsible hypnotist could help a closed-off child to be more open about what happened to them.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	These are two separate issues, although I can see how they might be related.<br>  First, recent research has found that the more often memories are remembered the more corrupt they become.  Using hypnosis to access memory does  not assure that the same phenomena does not take place.  It is very easy for the hypnotist to suggest memories when pulling them out.  All memories are interpretations of what is remembered and most memories are remembered in terms of words.  Thus, the experience is translated and in that way is an interpretation.  Remembering it required a re-translation.  Thus, as a means of determining the truth, hypnosis is not exact and open to problems.<br>  Using hypnosis as a therapy, however, does not suffer from these problems because a person's interpretation of an experience is what has to be resolved; it is not actually necessary to determine the actual events.  Resolving people's thoughts and their coming to grips with what happened and learning to cope is what is important in therapy.

AA10461474	Yes, prior to listening to someone use a microphone, practice some relaxation exercises - just deep breathing may be enough. Then, if it happens, immediately begin deep breathing/relaxing again & let it roll off your back. Start doing this immediately in your college class & see if it doesn't help there, too. In fact, prior to going to class again take about 10 minutes, close your eyes, get relaxed and picture yourself in class & imagine the jolting outburst while simultaneously feeling relaxed. Try to practice that every day before class. You'll be surprised how it can help.

You might have a different problem that could be chemical in nature. In other words you have an imbalance of some type in your brain and that can be fixed with medication. I think you are terrific for posting the way you did. It was not rambling, it was orderly and coherent. You were bullied when younger and don't want to have contact with people now but that is not the same as autism. <br>  <br>  You think you are different but you might not be that different. Maybe a bit deeper in that you think about so many things in so many ways. Thats not something negative either. <br>  <br>  Please see a psychiatrist and write down exactly what you posted here. Give it to him or her and they will help you understand what is happening to you.|`|S8mAO0L5aa	Things like Asperger's aren't really things you should really worry about, I mean, yes you should try fixing your social behavior but don't try making reasons for the way you behave, it will only make you more of a loner. If you start saying, oh, i can't be friends with this person, i have asperger's so i'm bad at making friends, you'll only be making it harder on yourself. <br>  <br>  When you say "I just know I am different" well, everyone is and you have a problem seeing that. Maybe if you realized everyone was different and unique you could start seeing the differences and making friends that way. Such as asking people about something they really love that you've never tried or heard of. <br>  <br>  Also, stop beating yourself up. Most people who are bullied bully themselves, that's why other tougher kids pick on them, they see your weakness. You need to have more confidence in yourself. Stop looking at the negtive side of everything, you have good SAT scores, you obviously have concentration enough to go through an SAT test and get an almost perfect score on it! You have a great memory, that's something a lot of people lack. Your organized, every job loves that about an employee. <br>  <br>  A way to get friends is to find a group of people interested in something your really interested in. A good way of doing this is going to a camp or joining clubs. I met a lot of my friends this way. There's always someone out there--actually i bet many people out there--feeling the same way you do. Stop thinking of yourself as a loner, go out there and find those people you have a lot in common with.
AA10461474	Personality is the whole combination of complex behaviors, temperament, emotions,  and thoughts we have. We all display "different personalities" in different situations. For example, we might have a "public face" vs. a "private" one because there are many things we wouldn't do or say in public that we might do or say in private. The same thing might happen when we meet people for the first time. Even if you're outgoing, you might be reserved in unfamiliar situations. All this is normal although it can be confusing, too. It sounds like you have some great personality traits in being observant & insightful combined with outgoing. Its okay if people think you're shallow in the beginning...they don't even know you & that's just the outer layer. You could work on changing that if you want to, or not!
