axxQzOCHaa	hockEy shinpads .. like the other contributor said, the length of your legs is the main factor. try them on with skates on (I assume this is for ice or roller hockey) and whether if you wear them inside or outside your skates .. make sure the knee pad covers your entire knee, and it's an added bonus if there's a little extra padding on top of the kneecap.|`|5kUk6A8Baa	All depends on ur leg legnth usually a medium or a small if ur short like me

Ucbnl7VJaa	You couldn't buy one yourself but your parents or grandparents could buy it and gift it to you. Technically it would probably be considered owned buy your parents in trust until you are 18 as most places say you can't legally "own" a firearm until then. But they can transfer one into your possession for legal uses such as hunting, target shooting(including informal stuff like plinking cans, clays, etc.). This includes handguns unless you have a specific state or local law prohibiting possession of firearms(or handguns if specific) So check out the laws for SC AND your city/county.  All of these yes you can have one deals are voided instantly if you carry it concealed or commit ANY kind of criminal act while in possession of said firearm.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	You cannot legally own a gun until 18. BB and pellet guns don't classify as firearms. If you were 18 then all you would have to do is go to a store, fill out the 4473 and walk out with your purchase.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	Typically, in most states, you can possess a rifle or shotgun at 16 but can't buy one until you're 18.  You can possess a handgun at 18, but can't buy one until you're 21.  If you're under 16 you can have a rifle or shotgun while hunting only if you're under the supervision of an adult.<br>  <br>  I just looked at the South Carolina state website and couldn't find a single thing regarding ages in the gun laws section.  I was quite surprised by that.  The easiest and surest way to find out would probably be to call local law enforcement.|`|119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	You are not allowed to purchase a pistol until the age of 21, so you would be limited to a rifle, which you can't purchase until age 18.  Your parents can purchase the rifle for you since you are legally allowed to hunt at age 16.  However you have to be under adult supervision to carry it though.  The pistol if your parents were to purchase it for you would be illegal also.  A minor in possession of a pistol is illegal and your parents would get into serious trouble for purchasing it for you.  However if they purchase it for themselves and take you out and let you shoot it, that is not illegal as long as your parents are with you.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	You need to bo 18 or over to buy a rifle and 21 to buy a hand gun. Law very from state to state so you need to look up the laws in your home town. You could just call you local sporting good store and ask them they will ba able to tell you.|`|OrvTG44laa	You can't legally handle a handgun until you're 21 and have a license for it.  You can handle a rifle without any license, except when you're hunting.  So you can get a .22 rifle, but not a .22 pistol.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	you would not be able to buy 1 but you could hunt with 1 by yourself|`|PcOEPKfIaa	you need to be 21 to buy a pistol 18 to buy a rifle . you can use the rifle in some states. but should take a state approved hunting weapon course. a parent or guardian would be able then to help buy a rifle.|`|AA10200748	You cannot buy rifles and shotguns until you are 18, and 21 for handguns [Federal law]. However, to use one, laws vary in evry sate and municipality, check with your city and state authorities.

If ur bass fishing then use normal baitcaster and med-heavy rod.  12-17 pound test line for the bass.  If ur looking for the biggest freshwater pole to use just get a ocean pole.  If ur fishing for sturgeon big cats or paddlefish. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  Good luck out on the water.|`|xtdeTwYmaa	well a good median action rod and reel your choice if its bait casting or spin casting the line should be between 12-17 lb and a 6'6" rod|`|SEpHGcnKaa	Big fish tend to need heavy equipment.

kqP7GwOcaa	Because Evander Holyfield is one of boxing's all time best, and those types don't get KOed easily.|`|kBScgrVMaa	In my opinion, Lennox Lewis failed to knock out Evander Holyfield because he refused to commit himself to the cause. <br>  <br>  During their first fight, in the fifth round, Lennox had Evander in serious trouble against the ropes, yet, didn't throw any punches to finish the fight, because he was worried about Holy's awesome counter punching, and he knew Holy had the power to KO him, so he wouldn't take the risk. <br>  <br>  In their second fight, Lennox wanted to do just enough to win on points, to make a statement that the draw result of the first match was a robbery, but in actual fact, the second fight could have honestly been declared a draw. <br>  <br>  Overall though, Lennox Lewis was well able to have KO'd Holyfield, he just went a bit gun-shy during their encounters. <br>  <br>  Did you see the state of Holyfield's face in the post fight press conference? It looked like he had put his face inside a wasp's nest!!<br>  <br>  If Lewis had gone in there with the same frame of mind he fought Andrew Golota, then the fight would've ben over inside 5 rounds, with a Lewis KO victory, of that, there is no doubt, even Evander Holyfield knows this.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Lewis was simply too smart to really go at Evander.  At that point in his career, Holyfield could only generate strong punches and combinations by counter punching.  Beating Tyson was no trouble because Iron Mike kept attacking, and all Holyfield needed to do was stand his ground, block and counterpunch.  Lewis would have taken a nap had he attacked Evander, and so he chose to fight a range fight, passing up opportunities to attack.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I think the reason is that it was his mindset coming in and he went into a fight he thinks I am not getting knocked out tonight. When someone goes into a fight believing that you have to put everything you have into your fight to stop him and Lennox settled for the point win.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Because Holyfield is just too tough and he's got a solid chin, one of the best in the business.|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	I agree with most boxing fans saying Evander don't get knocked out, although I have never been a big Holyfield fan I must say the man has always had a big heart that's why I believe Evander did not get KO'd against Lewis plus Lennox was always gun shy as someone else posted.<br>  <br>  In my opinion Lennox Lewis was never a devasting puncher.  A devasting puncher I would say was "Iron" Mike Tyson in his prime days!  Until this day now I know I am running off topic but I have to include this part, if Lewis and Tyson would have fought back in the 80's Tyson would have KO'd Lewis no doubt!|`|3q8LkLLDaa	Rick is right lol<br>  Evander is the real deal man!<br>  i think people will realize his real value in few years from now!<br>  people rank some dudes like joe louis  or mike tyson or foreman or dempsey or frazier over Holyfield they are so wrong!<br>  Holyfield vs valuev at the age of 46 he proved so much to me!<br>  he is a legend and legends do not get Koed so easily if u know what i mean ;)|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	Because Evander Holyfield is Evander Holyfield.

But I can share with you what has worked for me over the last few decades.<br>  First day, run slowly, with your mouth closed, breathe only through your nose. Do not go all out, stay within your limits. Run as much as you can, comfortably; you shoud not feel exhausted after the run, just pleasantly tired.<br>  Day two: increase your pace slightly, but again, keep your mouth shut, try to go about 10% longer in distance that Day 1.<br>  Day 3: Repeat Day 2, stay at 10% more than Day 1, or you may go up to 15% more than Day 1 (no more). Again, and this is very important, mouth closed, no panting and gasping for breath.<br>  Day 4: rest, do some stretches, or exercise to strengthen your core. No exercises to strain you calf muscles, no stand-up cycling or walking up the incline on a treadmill. A rowing machine is okay.<br>  Day 5: Run slowly, go up to 25% more than Day 1, keep your mouth closed, breathe trhough your nose only. If you find yourself opening your mouth, slow down.<br>  What you are doing is getting your body ready to take on more strain, but easing into it.<br>  Day 6: Repeat Day 5, but increase distance by 10% as compared to Day 5.<br>  Day 7: Rest<br>  Day 8 : Run the distance you have to run, but go at a speed slower than you can, hold yourself in check, be careful not to walk, keep running, but as I said at a slightly slower speed than what you can.<br>  Day 9 : Rest, get your body to recuperate.<br>  Day 10 : GO FOR IT....<br>  Note from Day 5 run onwards, increase the incline on the treadmill by 0.5% every second time you run.|`|82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately two weeks is not really long enough for any, or sufficient, changes to occur. The best thing you could do in two weeks is go running 3-4 times a week. Make each session at least 30 mins long, and maintain a steady pace throughout, slightly increasing it towards the last 5 mins. Make sure you do proper warm up and cool downs or you will get injured and you'll find running harder.<br>  <br>  I would assume you have been doing some sort of previous training so far, if not do not be surprised if you don't see any changes in your performance.<br>  <br>  You should also start devising a regular training programme to effectively build up your endurance, especially if you want to make and/or stay on a team.|`|GElfG0Vlaa	With two weeks left it is really too late to prepare. Also track isn't as much stamina as it is speed. (Unless you are running the 2 mile) Do something like this.<br>  <br>  Mon- 3 miles easy<br>  tues- 1 mile hard<br>  wed. 5 miles easy<br>  thur- 5 miles easy<br>  fri- 4 x 800 hard<br>  sat- 5 miles easy<br>  sunday - off<br>  <br>  do this for the next 2 weeks and take the day off before your first practice|`|Vm7vpqsmaa	...well...the whole point of stamina is really that it's built up...over time. You can START building stamina by running every few days. Try starting off at about one mile, three or so times a week, then you can build up your mileage over time. Just make sure that, if you do decide to take the running route (which I highly suggest) you stretch. A lot. Because the absolute last thing that you want to do is get injured. And don't try running like, 5 miles on your first run. You'll end up hurting yourself. Running is something that you have to work into, you can't just decide one day to go run for that long, your body isn't ready for it!|`|btCc2CRNaa	Jog around your block for an hour everyday. The first day will be incredibly hard but you'll see improvement very quickly.

LIKkt8djaa	THe Rome lofi is a decent park board for the ladies, I would checkout these boards over it though.<br>  <br>  GNU B-street<br>  Libtech Box scratcher<br>  K2 Va Va Voom<br>  Capita Horrorscope - mens board but comes in a small size with a narrow sidecut and a very soft flex.

Pretty much all the brands sold there "Lamar,LTD,Sims,morrow" are low end garbage decks that any boarder planning to go a lot shouldn't bother buying, They'll only end up holding you back.|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	any burton boards are good for park but if your looking for something under 400$ the a rossignol would be good for you|`|HVpeJzM4aa	take advice from anyone else that except for the idiot that said "any burton board" will be good because a park board is designed differently than a mountain board. Park boards are softer in their flex and are not ideal for mountain riding and vice versa. Only a complete noob would advise you to go with a brand that's highly recognizable. Second, any REAL snowboarder on a slope who see's someone with a burton board usually see's them as a poser anyhow. The k2 www has great reviews but they seem to only come in men sizes everywhere i've seen them but i could be wrong. just get one that fits your weight properly and has a mid to high flex and you'll easily find one for less than $400. <br>  <br>  go to sierrasnowboard.com for best prices of up to 50% off!|`|WPof1jcxaa	Okay, im gonna try to keep this simple so your gonna have to trust me or do some research.

1UID5JtNaa	those classes are very high intensity-  difficult for beginners.  Your nausea is due to an accumulation of lactic acid, a byproduct of energy metabolism when you go into oxygen debt.   <br>  <br>  Keep the level of pedal resistance easier next time and try not getting out of breath and don't worry about the standing position- do only what you can handle.  It's not a race!  That way you will be able to do the class 2 or 3 times  a week.  I'd also not eat any snacks in the hour before your class, and allow at least 2 hours following a regular size meal. <br>  <br>  The more deconditioned you are, the quicker you will see results (compared to world class athletes that must train very hard for 6-12 months to see only marginal improvement in their fitness).  If you haven't been doing anything you'll begin to notice improvements by the second week.  After 2-3 months of regular training you'll be amazed!|`|cA4IznZlaa	i'm sure you were not the only person nautious during the class.  you might have been nautious because you did not eat anything before the class, and your body was running out of energy.  i find i can get a littel nautious if i dont eat anything before a ride.  next time bring a small snack bar and eat about half before nad the rest during or after if they dont give you a break.  also drink waster throughout the day and during the class, dehydration is also a big contibutor to fatigue.  if you couldnt stand up that means your tired.  thats fine try to stand up for as long as you can because it works different muscles and you should work the whole leg not some of it.  <br>  as for getting easier it shouldnt.  everytime you go you build muscle and you will have to exert yourself more each time.  so you will be setting the "gears" of the bike higher to get the burn that you would get on a lower gear the few previous times.  now to do what you did the first time gear and speed wise if you did that everytime then you wouldnt gain any muscle  wont lose any weight and of course then it would get easier.  the burn after your workout that comes the next morning that will def get better with a few more rides to the point you either wont notice it or not get it at all.  that is because your working the muscle way more than ever before so give that a few more times like 3-4 before it starts hurting less or not at all the next day

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	In the first place neither the 49ers or Vikings have said they will pursue Vick, that is speculative of the media and an offhand remark by Singletary. The Viking have flat out refused comment but the Lions did come out and say they have enough distractions without adding Vick to make more. No team will pay the money due Vick so trading for him simply wont happen....why risk 10 million per for a guy who hasnt played in 2 years and had problems with the passing game in the first place? 2 years older and away from football usually isnt a good combination and since Vick relies on his legs he wouldnt stand a chance behind the Lions line in the first place. And the Lions have had enough character issues as is...why add a bigger one? And attendance is down now...how many more wont buy tickets if he ends up there? But the biggest issue everyone who seems to want to speculate on where he will end up with forgets one really big matter....he is still suspended. And because he testified in his deposition that he was the money man in the gambling portion of the dog fighting that very likely insures that Goodell has just cause to never reinstate him. Illegal gambling (which this was....he may still face charges for that, they never charged him on those issues) has proven to be the hardest issue for any athlete in any sport to overcome and so far Goodell has flat out refused to discuss that aspect....wonder why? Very little to no chance he gets reinstated this season in the first place so it wont matter who may or may not be interested (the Falcons merely are exploring trading his rights, it would be up to a new team to help him get reinstated just like the Cowboys did with Pacman....and dont think that Pacman not behaving wont impact Goodells decision with Vick).|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, there really aren't any reports of any teams going after Vick, so we really don't know if they are or aren't.  There is a lot of speculation that the 49ers and Vikings could use him and might pursue him, I've even heard the Raiders, but no one has publically said they want Vick.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I were the Lions, I would consider it.  I mean, first of all, you can't get any worse.  Secondly, Vick would do better than Matt Stafford will, as I predict Stafford to be the next Ryan Leaf.  If they were to go after Vick and use the #1 overall on someone who will truly help the team, it would be better than not getting Vick and taking Stafford.  Either way, the Lions need a lot, and if they do take Stafford #1 overall, they're likely to win 2 games at most next year.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	Vick's a joke... he can't throw with any real accuracy... the only way he would be any good if he got faster and stronger in jail and could be a running back who can throw the ball...no one would be able to tell if he was running or passing|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	Last I knew the 49ers had said no to Vick don't hear anything about the Vikes if the Lions go after a QB it would be someone with out the baggage that Vick will bring with him. The Falcons are trying to get draft picks for Vick and the Lions need every pick they have so don't look for Vick to be in a lions uniform.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	because vick won't help them win, and they know it.  the only teams that should be looking at vick are teams that feel they're one playmaker away from making a deep run.  the 49ers are looking at him because they have several needs, and don't want to get burned on a qb in the draft again|`|HotGquqTaa	I pray to god that the rumor of the vikes and vick is JUST a rumor.  I will disown them and I love them with every ounce of my being... (yea, I mean it like that).|`|20zLmf3Laa	They will, right after Barry Sanders comes out of retirement. Trust me when I say, no NFL team is going to rush out to get Mike Vick whenever he's eligible to play in the NFL again. He carries more baggage than any team is going to be willing to take on. The only way he plays pro football again is in the CFL like Ricky Williams did when he was suspended by the NFL. Besides, I think Daunte Culpepper is a better QB than Mike Vick is and the Lions already resigned him.|`|e00627d6bcb03c3c3a41eb2fe611f647aa	the lions really want to start from sratch and bring in a young QB. Vick would just delay the process. Those other teams have more talent than the lions and might be able to go somewhere with a Vick (if he can be somewhere to his old form). After 0-16 an organization wants to draft a young QB like a stafford or a sanchez and build around them. There is no point of building around vick because he is gettn old and his talent is questionable at this point.|`|1RGABRNRaa	Theres actually a couple of good reasons:<br>  1. Theres no point in doing backflips to get a player who wont make a difference since the rest of their offense is terrible.<br>  2. They cant negotiate to get vick from the falcons since the falcons want  draft picks and draft picks are the lions only hope to get back in the game.<br>  3. Theres a good chance that Vick wont be half the QB he was due to poor jail conditions and no training.<br>  4. THE LIONS ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS!|`|oXnsELl9aa	Because all Vick does is cause problem and they dont need a quarterback when you think about it and anyway they are going to draft stafford or sanchez.|`|lKQPPifDaa	The Lions basically need a fresh start.

Besides with the first pick they could get Stafford.|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	Where did hear the Niners and Vikings are going after him when he won't even be able to play until 2010, if then?

I think Swagger will retain, or even possibly Finlay could change back to being a heel by causing Swagger to win. <br>  <br>  They kind of seem like that's what they're going for. Remember the tag match they had last week with Christian/Finlay against Swagger/Henry?<br>  <br>  Finlay almost didn't let Christian tag him in. I think if Finlay does interfere, they could announce it will be Finlay vs. Swagger vs. Christian at Wrestlemania. They can even turn it into a Fatal Fourway.<br>  <br>  Christian vs. Swagger vs. Finlay vs. Tommy Dreamer. Dreamer said he'd retire if he couldn't get the title by, what. . June? It'd be a good match, I think, especially if Finlay went back to being a heel. <br>  <br>  BQ:  I have no doubts they'll have a storyline in the future.

They have the offense to compete with anybody but they have a defense that makes it so everybody can compete with them as well. Fix the defense and 10-6 or 11-5 isnt out of the question, if they play defense like they did last year 8-8 or 7-9 isnt out of the question either. They will win their share of shootouts but to take the next step they better draft defense, defense, defense! Passing records are great but the one fact of every team that gets close to those passing records....all owned very poor defenses and none was ever a threat at playoff time. Seeing Brees throw for 4200-4500 yards would be better than challenging the 5000 yard mark...it means they are able to run more (balance) and stop the other team on occasion.|`|q6NGxNR3aa	they win the divsion because the loser of the division always wins the division or at least makes the playoffs plus they get tracy porter back.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	i'd say 10-6 and win the division.<br>  they've got THE best offense, and hopefully their defense will get better.|`|xgBNImTHaa	8-8|`|oXnsELl9aa	Depends on the draft and the off-season.

CE4hcUmhaa	You are much better off locking in your tee times before you arrive.  If you are looking for bargains, try to call after your morning round and see what some of the courses you would like to play are offering for the afternoon.  You can sign up at clikitgolf or lastminutegolfer for coupons for the Myrtle area.<br>  <br>  But, if you want to do a replay of the course you played in the morning, they will usually just charge 20$ or so per person.  This works out great if the course has 2 or 3 different layouts, you can run a foursome around three different courses in a single day if it isn't too crowded.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	In my humble opinion I would prearrange everything...you could always change after you arrive, but that way you'll be set either way.

Anything more then a 3-9 or 4-12 x40mm or 42mm is not needed. A 4x32 or a 2-7 or 2.5-8 power is all you need for nearly all big game hunting in North America. <br>  <br>  Drop if you mean trajectory relative to line of sight(LOS) varies depending on where it is zeroed. That said most spitzer flat base designs from 150-180 grains weight drop somewhere in the vicinity of 23-26 inches below LOS at 400yds if zeroed at 200.<br>  <br>  Depending on bullet weight/shape/muzzle velocity a bullet from a .30-06 can reach 5-7,000 yards with the bore elevated to the optimum angle. Reasonable effective+humane+responsible hunting range depends on the game and bullet type but even in truly expert hands is not much beyond 500 yards and for the vast majority of people it's more like 300yds which still is a rather long range for most big game hunting.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	Nikon makes great scopes in that price range|`|gE5n79m7aa	The Nkkon Buchmaster and Leupold may be over your budget.<br>  <br>  Best recommendation for under $200 are Nikkon Prostaff 3-9x40 BDC or <br>  TASCO Varmint/ Target 10-40x50<br>  <br>  Pick the one best for your application/use.|`|PcOEPKfIaa	a Leupold 3-9 makes a good do all scope , also a Burris 3-9 . a 30-06 depending on bullet weight will drop 22"-48"maybe more with 220  bullets. depending on angle fired can go several miles.|`|F8Ac1pPNaa	Check out this article about scopes.

5mxy4WaMaa	No.  Upland game are Pheasants, Grouse, Partridges, etc.  6mm is a rifle cartridge and so is the 7mm.  It is illegal to hunt upland game with a rifle.  Get a shotgun if you want to hunt upland game.  Either a 20 gauge or a 12 gauge.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes the 6mm is recommended by the Winchester Product Ballistics Service Manual for Black Bear, Whitetail Deer, Antelope, Mule Deer, Groundhogs, Fox, and Coyote. Excellent Choice.* Magnums are not necessary or needed for the above Animals.*|`|UrNVuFx6aa	Depending upon the size of the game, the distance you are shooting and the ability you possess, 6mm should be fine. Among the 6mm caliber there are several competent rounds. These include .243 Winchester, 6mm Remington and .240 Weatherby Magnum; all excellent rounds. The 6mm Remington has perhaps the best ballistics but for some reason has fallen into a "lesser used" category. Personally, I prefer the .243 Winchester on animals up to white-tail deer size if they are not over 300 yards away.  <br>  <br>  You can read about the 6mm Remington at this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.huntingmag.com/guns_loads/6mm_remington/" rel="nofollow">http://www.huntingmag.com/guns_loads/6mm...</a><br>  <br>  Happy hunting and be safe.|`|uzNm9KtYaa	To understand the full context of your question, I have to ask what YOU consider as "upland game"?  The 6mm would hardly be considered a rabbit and squirrel gun.  It would be best suited to hunting predators like fox, coyote, etc.  It would also be a fairly good round for smaller big game like antelope or deer.  Beyond or below that?  There are better choices to be made.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Upland game?  Well by definition those are birds so you're better off with a shotgun but the 6mm Remington is right decent deer caliber.<br>  <br>  H
tvuhGTD9aa	The first league recognized as being "major" level (how this is determined I have no idea) was the National Association in 1871.<br>  <br>  It folded in 1875, and the National League, the one still in operation today (albeit evolved), took the field in 1876.<br>  <br>  The American League was founded in 1901, and the two worked out cooperative agreements over the next decade, eventually birthing Major League Baseball as a business entity.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	1903, When the American League merged with the National League.<br>  <br>  Teams we're <br>  <br>  AL Boston Pilgrims Now the Red Sox, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, Washington Senators Now Minnesota Twins, St. Louis Browns Now the Baltimore Orioles, and the Philadelphia Athletics Now in Oakland CA.<br>  <br>  NL Boston Braves Now in Atlanta GA, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Brooklyn Robins Now the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Giants Now in San Francisco CA, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals|`|kHYRznVBaa	The answer IS: 1870; although the Cincinnati Reds started out as a pro team in 1869.

Truth is rodents are nutritionally excellent for large predators besides being rather tasty. They make excellent tortilla soup, squirrel and dumplings, stew, tamales, etc. I don't hunt them, but any of those fuzzy tailed rats...or tree rats...or what ever you want to call them...that get ideas about setting up house keeping too close to the house go to the freezer. When enough accumulate in the freezer (like a dozen or so...) we eat a mess of squirrel. Lst batch became squirrel mole tamales....|`|AA11694178	I definitely feel that they are worth the effort to skin them.  My preferred way is to make an incision through the skin around the hock of one hind leg.  I carry this incision across to the other hock which I cut around.  I then cut around the anus and sever the tail bone.  Next I place my foot on the tail and pull up on both hind legs.  If you have done as I have told you, you will have the squirrel skin pulled up around the squirrel's neck.  If you wish to save the head to cook, you will have to work the skin over the head.  If you do not eat the head, and some people do not, you can just sever the neck and remove the head and the attached skin.  Gut it, wash off all attached hair and it is ready for the pan or freezer.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	Squirrels are excellent eating. The easiest way to skin them is to cut through the skin across the back, insert two fingers under each dise of the cut and pull. When the skin is pulled all the way to the feet/ tail anf feet/head cut off the feet, tail and head. Then turn the squirrel over, slit the belly from end to end and remove the entrails. The heart, kidneys and liver are also good to eat so toss them into the bowl as well. They can be fried, boiled until tender to make gravy, grilled, baked, etc. for a delicious meal. Usually it takes one squirrel for each person being fed.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	I can tell you what not to do: <br>  use a fillet knife; push the fillet knife tip into the squirrel's skin and push it firmly through the squirrel skin and into the meat of your hand.

yUHh1Q8Qaa	The reason you are bruising is that you are blocking at right angles to the attack and using too much energy.  We all do this at first. <br>  <br>  Quick story:  I was working with someone from another dojo at a workshop doing bo drills.(that's staff to all you Chinese practitioners.)  He would hold his bo at right angles to my over the head attack and try to stop it cold.  All I did was let my bo fall onto his bo without swinging at all.  After about 5 or 6 repetitions he complained that I was swinging too hard!  All he had to do was angle his block a few degrees and he wouldn't have felt a thing.<br>  <br>  Blocking is about deflection and avoiding not stopping the incoming momentum.  (there are desperate situations when you do have to sacrifice one body part to protect something more important; but these are the exceptions.)<br>  <br>  Every style has ways of addressing this and achieving it so I won't give details.  Ask your instructor to give you details that are appropriate for your style  If your instructor is telling you to block hard at right angles, get a new teacher|`|LPO8RlVdaa	Okay, first I have to make the point that a lot of blocks, even in jiu jitsu, should not require you to block an attack with such force that it injures you. Are you blocking using the right technique? (Palm forward so you block with the side of your forearm, not the muscle/flesh?) Or are you simply so new that you are just not used to the contact yet?<br>  <br>  If the latter is the case, then simply carrying on practicing your technique with a partner will 'toughen you up' over time. Other than that, try blocking and striking a havy punchbag or sandbag using your forearm.|`|G1nPkwivaa	the traditional way is the best way, I spent some time on youtube trying to find examples of some drills to practice but I havent had any luck<br>  <br>  the best one was suggested above, get a  friend and stand infront of eachother swing one arm forward and connect with the top part of the forearm, then come up like a upper middle block hitting with the outside of the forearm, then come down like a low block hitting with the inside of the forearm, then repeat with the other arm, if you cannot find a partner you can practice with a small tree or a pole of some sort, remember start off slow and light and gradually build up to faster and harder.|`|fVnbFLsQaa	Hi, the old way was to stand opposite your partner and smash forearms together! ie like, you are both blocking! very crude, but effective, other thing is, buy some forearm guards and take the stick that comes with them!|`|Y26eOD9Caa	Do some heavy forearm training to pump up the muscles, and practice forearm strikes on a heavy bag.|`|bhlbwoIeaa	Encase them in steel...|`|HqQmZfA6aa	Hard to be specific without seeing how you move or knowing which techniques you use.<br>  <br>  Work with a partner and starting slowly, block arms against each other. Do a down block, then a middle block against his arm. Get in a rhythm. Inside middle block, outside middle block, downwards block. Do it 10 to 20 times until your arms get stronger then build up. Careful of the angle because you don't want to clash bones and get injured.<br>  <br>  Then look at your blocking technique too. You shouldn't be bruising when you block a roundhouse kick, or any technique for that matter. Don't block with the bone, use the meaty part. If it is a high kick, use both arms. One stays next to your head and the other can redirect his leg after you block. If you train bare-handed, make sure the blocking hand is very high, above the eyebrow line. So if he is kicking with his left roundhouse, your right hand is high on your head, elbow in, and your left comes over and blocks as you angle forward to your left into his deceleration zone.<br>  <br>  Move INTO him at a slight angle as you block so you reduce the impact.<br>  <br>  Ask your coach for guidance too.|`|UJVONGL8aa	OK Try this out my man, <br>  1.

xhPKkkELaa	There is only one reason to wear a wetsuit. It is to keep you warm while, surfing, swimming, scuba diving etc. in cold water. I have been wearing wetsuits in cold water for over 40 years, and that's all there is.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	They allow you to swim in frigid waters.|`|RZfoszJFaa	I hate hypothermia.|`|AA10409832	Wet suits are somewhat bouyant and helps to keep one afloat in the water.  They also provide a degree of warmth in cooler water.  The cool water gets between the suit and your body.  When that happens the heat of your body tends to warm the water a bit, making the water you're in seem a little warmer.|`|Op1WIwyPaa	People do not wear wetsuits to keep their swimsuits from falling off.<br>  <br>  People wear wetsuits to stay warm when surfing in cold water.<br>  <br>  The Surfboard Man<br>  <a href="http://www.thesurfboardman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesurfboardman.com/</a>|`|oYGtkVwOaa	there for keeping you warm while surfing.<br>  i don't really like them cuz there sorta weird looking but you gotta have one if you live in cali or you'll freeze<br>  my advice get one that looks good|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	Wetsuits help to preserve body heat by trapping a layer of water against the skin; this water is consequently warmed by body heat and acts as an insulator. Water conducts heat away from the body approximately 25 times more efficiently than air, so an unprotected individual can succumb to hypothermia even in warm water on a warm day. Wetsuits are made out of closed-cell, foam neoprene, a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material. Nitrogen gas has very low thermal conductivity, so it reduces heat from the body (or the water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) from being lost to the water outside of the wetsuit. Some wetsuits of late have even begun to incorporate Merino wool and titanium fibers to add warmth characteristics, while keeping the thickness of the suit to a minimum. A wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently; too loose a fit will allow water to escape from between the suit and the body, taking the body's heat with it. Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in the water retention. Neoprene is very buoyant, helping swimmers to better stay afloat, and for this reason divers need to calculate extra weight values based on the thickness of their suit to achieve neutral buoyancy underwater. The suit loses buoyancy and thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth. Originally, wetsuits were made only with raw sheets of foam-rubber neoprene that did not have any backing material. This type of suit required extra caution while pulling it on because the raw foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin. Stretching and pulling excessively easily caused these suits to be torn in half. This was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver's body with talc to help the rubber slide on more easily.<br>  <br>  Backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon sheeting applied to one side of the neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the tough nylon took most of the strain of pulling on the suit, but the suit still had the black sheet rubber exposed on the outside and the nylon was very stiff and rigid, limiting flexibility. A small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles.<br>  <br>  In the early 1960s, the British Dunlop Sports Company brought out its yellow Aquafort neoprene wetsuit, whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety. However, the line was discontinued after a short while and wetsuits reverted to their black uniformity. The colorful wetsuits seen today first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed. Now the foam-rubber was sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers, greatly increasing the tear-resistance of the material. An external layer also meant that decorative colors, logos, and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes. This growth from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits. Wetsuits come in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which it is intended. The thicker the suit, the warmer it will keep the wearer. Because wetsuits offer significant protection from jellyfish, coral and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (often called a "bodysuit") even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments. A thick suit is stiff, so mobility is restricted; at a certain thickness the suit would become impractical, which is why drysuits must be worn in particularly cold environments. A wetsuit is normally described in terms of its thickness. For instance, a wetsuit with a torso thickness of 5 mm and a limb thickness of 3 mm will be described as a "5/3". With new technologies the neoprene is getting more flexible. Modern 4/3 wetsuits, for instance, may feel as flexible as a 3/2 of only a few years ago. Some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back.<br>  <br>  Different shapes of wetsuit are available, in order of coverage:<br>  <br>  A sleeveless vest, covering only the torso, provides minimal coverage. Some include an attached hood. These are not intended to be worn alone, but rather as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit. <br>  A jacket covers the torso and arms, with little to no coverage for the legs. Some jackets have short leg sleeves like a shorty, others feature leg holes similar to a women's swimsuit. A third style, the beavertail, which was quite popular until the 1980s, had a flap which closed over the crotch and attached at the front with a fastener. <br>  A shorty or spring suit covers the torso and has short sleeves for the arms and legs. There are also forms of spring suits with long arms and short legs. <br>  A long john or farmer john/jane (depending on the gender the suit is designed for) covers|`|Tz5Q8uc5aa	The make the water seem warmer and protect you from cold water.<br>  <br>  They make you float somewhat because of the material they are made of.<br>  <br>  You don't hurt as bad when you take a bad fall surfing or hit the water hard.<br>  <br>  Some people like the look of them, I personally don't.<br>  <br>  A few reasons I can think of :P|`|dY8Op79faa	keeps your body warm.<br>  people who wear swimsuits while scuba diving are prone to freezing in cold water.|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	in California you wold freeze without one|`|TwHqhG0iaa	it keeps your body warm in the cold ocean water

Pick out some lightweight gloves if its really windy, because if your hands feel frozen during a run, it makes your whole body feel a lot colder.

Tight layers are always better though.<br>  <br>  BUT... seeing that its going to be 34 degrees, i wouldn't say that was too cold.

He could be a 5th round talent, and you got him much later.  And Nathan is of course fantastic as a reliever.<br>  <br>  On the hitting side, the outfield is one of the best you could possibly get.  All three guys are fantastic.  The infield is a bit weak, though.  Morneau will be solid, but there's a lot of question marks outside of him.  Particularly with your middle infield situation.  Cano and Drew are not much of a combo.  Encarnacion is a question mark at best.  Soto is pretty solid as well.<br>  <br>  But any problems you have there will be masked by a phenomenal outfield.

Ep2Nwzltaa	The most important thing is to keep your head down and your knee over the ball as you are striking it. Your shots will tend to go high if you are leaning back as you hit the ball. For a good low power shot practice taking shorter steps  as you approach the ball, place your plant foot aiming where you want your shot to go, point your you toe downward, lock your ankle, and hit the ball with your laces. Strike through the ball keeping you head down and you want to land on your shooting foot after following through. Work on that and you will get and accurate powerful shot.|`|6243CJhbaa	the most important thing is your follow through, when you don't follow through, the ball tends to go straight and high, make sure you strike with the inside of your feet though, not your toes. as for accuracy, the direction of your shot is mostly depended on the direction your weak or pivot feet is facing as well as your body. so make sure your weak feet and your body is facing in the direction you want to shoot at. it might be hard at first, but keep practicing and you'll definately get it right. PS good soccer shoes/cleats can help too|`|jDwX2HE2aa	practice hitting the ball with your laces (instep) just practice shooting it against the wall once you master that...try practice placing it with the inside of your boot :D|`|vj6YpJn8aa	Practice driving the ball against the wall but focus on getting your knee over the ball and keeping your toe point towards the ground throughout your follow through.|`|N0sbhRu6aa	You need to shoot laces.

hWaynBpMaa	I am a Man City fan and you have to expect this now we are owned by multi billionaires. Chelsea spent ￡600 million on players under mourinho liverpool have spent ￡360 million over the past five years. Arsenal are owned by Billionaires but they only see it as a share holding investment. Wenger has made money for Arsenal. Man Utd have spent on dome pretty decent players. ￡30 million each for Berbatov, Rooney, Ferdinand and maybe Tevez at the end of the season. he spent ￡28 million  on veron but got ￡18 million straight back selling stam to them and the sold Veron to Chelsea for ￡18 million. He got the best out of and his money back on Van the man, He has to be admired as unlike Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal he is bringing down man united ￡2 billion pound debt. down to ￡850 million. Cherlsea and Liverpools debts from transfer fees are laid off against the clubs themselves. Man Citys owners are spending their own money and are not laying any debt onto to the club. thats why they go for KaKa at 91 Million. The Papers and TV pundits say that youth will not get a chance at city now, but youth is only brought into a successful team. City need results but have playred some of their kids regulary. City will be the biggest team in europe in 2-3 years. People like Platini never said a word when Italian and Spanish teams and even Chelsea spent Millions and paid wages even Man United couldnt afford, but it was ok with that french poser with over rated talent until his precious Italian and spanish teams cannot compete with true financial powere. do you think he would be complaining if Milan or Madrid were taken over by billionaires. .............Nah  neither do i.

mwxKnUleaa	As of now I would also take Blake Griffen with the first overall pick. This is not as deep a class as in years past.

0R46pYb3aa	Yes. Spool it with 18lb mono.  You can use braid or fluorocarbon, but since you are new to bait casting I would keep it simple and inexpensive so you don't loose expensive line when you backlash, and you will backlash, it's part of learning.  Flourocarbon has advantages in being less visable to fish, so you can simply use it as a leader instead of sooping your entire reel with this type of expensive line.|`|uWulIssraa	yes the pole is good i would spool it with 14 pound florocarbon
n0nT5rTCaa	Go with braid. Best of both worlds. It doesn't tangle as easy on a baitcaster as mono and it's much stronger and more abrasion resistent. I prefer Power Pro 30 lb. braid for multi-species angling. Casts great and can handle toothy critters.|`|B62KOzsdaa	In general I would use the lightest line I could to get the job done, a lot also depends on wind and current. Lighter line gives you longer casting & more transparency.  The Mono vs Braid debate has been going on for a long while and will probably never end.  Mono stretches more and is therefore more forgiving.  Braided gives you more lb test/ diameter but you have to be more careful with the knots you use.  Try them both and see which one you prefer.|`|bDIj2E9aaa	IF YOU ARE GOING FOR BIG FISH  YOU SHOULD USE BRAIDED LINE  IF YOUR FISHING SMALL FISH  USE MONO  YOU SHOULD TRY SPIDER WIRE  FOR BRAIDED ,AND BERKLEYS  TRILINE  FOR MONO|`|z4IcQZGdaa	i like 14lb for my baitcasters, it always works for me, especially trilene or suffix, never tried braided so wouldn't know if its any good|`|933YqFLNaa	I like firewire 20lb test... great line.
mqgS6Dfxaa	So why ask this question in the baseball section to people that don't know you, don't know your interests,don't know you work experience, don't know your skills, don't know where you live and don't know how old you are?

Asking a career question in baseball isnt exactly a ringing endorsement of yourself. But I will admit...baseball fans are a pretty smart group so on second thought.....! Okay....I guess I will throw you a bone. Find a career counseler and give them the details of what you know and what you might enjoy, they can match you up with some ideas that you maybe dont even realize are jobs you might enjoy.

oAjbBLDpaa	This looks like Stone Cold's last match possibility. It fits storyline with his hall of fame induction, fits history between the two, and Stone Cold need someone he can trust in the ring and who but Jericho can provide him with that. <br>  <br>  I don't want to see Rourke do Wrestlemania 25. Jericho shouldn't be lowered to jobbing to someone that isn't even a wrestler. <br>  I don't want Flair because it ruins his send away match with HBK that told such a great story. <br>  I don't want Hogan because he was only an entertainer when he was in the company, this would be a step down from Rourke in my opinion. Jericho deserves someone good not a washed up entertainer that can't let go of parts of his life.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	1. Undertaker<br>  <br>  2. Hot Rod<br>  <br>  3. Batista|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	not-roddy piper i think he will face hulk hogan at mania|`|CJzbIhWuaa	hopefully stone cold, maybe hogan|`|pZJPz6CGaa	i think hes going to face Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania.

I think they're still trying to convince Mickey Rourke to wrestle him, but Mickey keeps refusing. If Mikey continues to say no, they'll probably change it to Jericho wrestling a legend at Wrestlemania. Right now the rumored opponents are Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, and Stone Cold, although that one is a serious doubt considering Stone Cold's neck problems.<br>  <br>  2. I wouldn't want to see him face someone lame. It seems like they might end up coming out with some lame guy no one really remembers. I definately wouldn't want to see him wrestle Mickey Rourke.<br>  <br>  It'd be cool to see Hulk Hogan in person, although I think he's VERY overrated as a wrestler.

oqQjnpfGaa	First of all, good luck with your season push. Hope this advice will be helpful. <br>  <br>  I will rank the four choices in this manner: <br>  <br>  (1) Ryan Gomes<br>  * It is hard to ignore the fact that Gomes is playing so well since Al Jefferson was injured.  He will help you in FG%, FT%, 3pts, Rebounds, Steals...and will hurt you in occasional bad FG% and TO<br>  <br>  (2) Tyrus Thomas<br>  * Similiar to Gomes, Tyrus is playing quite well lately.  He will help you in most categories plus blocks.  However, I don't think Thomas is consistent enough with Brad Miller playing more minutes. <br>  <br>  (3) Kendrick Perkins<br>  * He is still the starting center for the Celtics, but he will hurt you in FT%, TOs, but is good for blocks, rebounds, and FG%<br>  <br>  (4) Aaron Brooks<br>  * I like Brooks, but still needs to prove to the league he can be a leader for the Rockets night in and night out.  He is an interesting kid with lots of upside for assists, points, 3pts, FT% but will hurt you with TOs and the occasional bad FG%. <br>  <br>  Overall, most of the players are serviceable in most average size league. Hope this was helpful.|`|XAFeyn3yaa	def roll with gomes or thomas. gomes will prly remain a starter the rest of the season. thomas may or may not. aaron brooks im apprehensive bc of kyle lowry. they split duties at the point.|`|GOMKQ8MXaa	i really like gomes. with jefferson out he will be playing a larger role in their offense. he can score and will even contribute some 3ptsmade. tyrus thomas is coming into his own as well. id still pick gomes though. good luck.
39Huh1kgaa	Antonio McDyess is most likely to come through for you, Spencer Hawes' numbers look pretty good at first (free agent in our league) for a free agent, but I picked him up for 5-6 weeks, and he decreased my team's strength pretty dramatically. Ryan Gomes Is someone I'm neutral about, but Antonio I t really think you should add.|`|GIVarsPnaa	Hawes will have all the playing time now that Miller is out. Gomes is a nice addition for someone who needs scoring. McDyess is the worst of the three fantasy value wise. Go with Gomes on the safe side unless you need rebounds then get Hawes.|`|KDHfoyy1aa	Get Mcdyess. He has good FG%, solid rebounds, and low turnovers. Hawes will kill you with TOs and missed shots. Gomes does not provide enough boards, steals, and blocks to make up for his misses.|`|oqQjnpfGaa	First of all, all the players you listed are good players to consider since they are starting or playing heavy minutes due to star player injuries on their team or big trades. <br>  <br>  This is how I rank the following players: <br>  <br>  (1) Ryan Gomez<br>  * He will help you in most categories, will have the occasional TOs, and bad FG%<br>  <br>  (2) Spencer Hawes. <br>  * He is struggling with his shot right now, but since he is the starting center he will only get better.  He will help you in more categories (like blocks, steals, assists) than Antonio, but will hurt you in TOs, inconsistent FG%, FT%. <br>  <br>  (3) Antonio McDyess<br>  * He is playing better right now, and will impress you with points, rebounds, but is still a little inconsistent, but McDyess can really step it up for the Pistons. <br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.

RJ5Bevmpaa	The only big name I can see moving in right now would be Niedermayer returning. Their forward lines are stacked beautifully and I can't see them messing with chemistry, their goaltending is loaded and I can't see anything moving there so the blueline would be the place and I can't see them making many gambles so the most likely thing would be a familiar face returning home.  <br>  <br>  The Devils are so nicely set up right now, I can only see Niedermayer as a missing piece for them that they know won't risk chemistry issues.|`|aisrOOjOaa	Easy answer, NONE, when was the last time the devils traded at the deadline to get a piece they think they need to win the cup?|`|jRTJbmEDaa	First of all the devils wont trade Gio. They wont make any chances they dont have to.

The use of  'mag reels' which provide an adjustable degree of magnetic resistance in 'free-spool' & good quality ball bearing snap swivels at the beginning of your terminal tackle which cut down on line twist also help.<br>  <br>  I assume you are not talking about spinning reels which are generally very hard to get bird nests with.|`|69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	First, run the line off a rotating spool (stick a pencil through the spool) so it doesn't twist.

RzY6EbVUaa	This happens to me every so often.  It occurs because you tie your shoes too tight.  Since you are left handed, you may be pulling on the laces on the left side harder than on the right.  When you run and the shoe is really tight, it cuts off circulation from your body - thus, a feeling of numbness.  Even the slightest cut in circulation from the body can be felt, especially in the foot since it is so far away from your heart.  It makes sense that the foot falls asleep after four miles, as you have already been running for a little while.<br>  <br>  Loosen your shoes.  Tighten them all the way from the bottom of the laces to the top.  If you just tighten just the part around your ankle, it will cut off circulation, and will not provide support on your foot.  Also, let your foot kind of wiggle around in the shoe (just a tiny bit), because when you start running your foot inflates.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	That happens to a lot of people on my track team. Whenever we do long runs a bunch of peoples feet fall asleep. I think its pretty common.|`|CI5qOBcDaa	it could be your shoes being worn out, this was the problem with my shoes a week ago. You should really only have shoes for one season, 3 months, then you need new one so if you've had them for a while that could be the problem.|`|lYlZTIIHaa	If you have had your shoes for a while it is most likely your shoes. Your feet are worked hard when you run so they need the best they can get. It is probably a good idea to replace your shoes. Also make sure you are not tying your shoes too tight or favoring your left foot more than your right when you are going up hills, stairs, or whatever. Try to ignore it unless it is painful. Sometimes the mind plays trick on you, most likely this is a phase and if you do everything above it'll run it's course then stop. Good luck.|`|yQetxSD0aa	omg that used to happen to me!!<br>  <br>  i don't even remember what foot it was in but i think it was my right.<br>  <br>  just try to ignore it, i promise it will go away.<br>  my foot stopped falling asleep after a while.<br>  and its harmless|`|tQACzIljaa	This happens to me too!!!!

NmXKPDoIaa	Crazy...I almost asked the same question!<br>  <br>  Here is what, I would do......<br>  <br>  -I think the first 7 seeds should be determined by record<br>  <br>  -And the teams ranked 8-11 should have a single game elimination tournament (to determine the last playoff spot). This would add only 3 more games to the schedule, and would give young players more experience in big game situations.<br>  <br>  -It would also encourage teams to play harder in the regular season, instead of giving up, and trying to win a high draft pick.|`|Zt1VDawZaa	Aye do you still have Elizabeth's profile?<br>  <br>  EDIT: I know she doesnt maybe an email might bring her back lol<br>  <br>  We need ADAM back too|`|8s9q4V03aa	it wuld take all of the viewers out of the nba playoffs|`|o6KAdVUSaa	yes it gives the other teams a chance to feel like winers|`|uxregJ0faa	No. Its basically them competing who is the best out of the worst. Not worth watching|`|ujMsLUcNaa	Corey, your idea is quite intriguing.  However, I don't think it would be that much enticing for a team to win this small consolation prize versus obtaining a high draft pick in June and setting themselves up to compete with the big dogs for a championship the following year.  Of course, the younger teams like Oklahoma or Memphis would be tempted to run their young guns out there and see where they measure up against the bottom tier teams - which isn't saying much.  Plus, how much heart do you think these teams/players will really have towards competing in an inferior playoffs where most viewers probably won't even watch.  Besides the true fans of these respective teams, most basketball fans would probably tune into the actual playoff games where teams are fighting tooth and nail for a championship.  Would Phoenix be inclined to continue running old man Shaq out there and risk injuring him long-term or rush Amare back for this consolation playoff?  I doubt that would happen.  <br>  <br>  I understand your reasons for this suggestion and I would have loved to see the Warriors continue competing last season, after they won 50 games and still missed the playoffs.  However, I doubt these playoffs would be as exciting and intense as the regular championship playoffs.  I wouldn't want to risk injuring some of the key players on my favorite team for anything less than a real championship.  It would also be bad business practice for the NBA and not cost effective, to take away viewers from the championship playoffs and cause the playoff ratings to plummet even more than it already has.<br>  <br>  What do you think of this idea?  You know how the All-Star game every year chooses it's candidates based on their team's winning records.  I was thinking, why not have a second All-Star game (or something similar) where the league would select players from teams that don't make the playoffs.  This event could take place before the championship playoffs starts or after the NBA Finals.  I know what you're thinking.  How would a second All-Star game make any sense at the end of the regular season?  <br>  <br>  First off, it serves a few purposes: 1) It gives the star (or key) player(s) on losing teams like Al Jefferson (before he got injured), Deron Williams, Kevin Durant (as well as all those underachievers who got snubbed for the mid-season All-Star game) some recognition for their efforts in putting together a successful statistical season and commends them on their strive for improvement; 2) It is less costly for the NBA to have 1 game dedicated to those teams who missed the playoffs versus planning another bracket group of games that may not even sell out or generate enough viewers;  3) Having a second All-Star game that disregards defense instead of adding an extra 4 to 16 games to a team's schedule may be more beneficial to teams looking to rest their stars, injury-prone players, or aging veterans; 4) Last but not least, it doesn't divide or take away viewers from watching the championship playoffs while still giving fans of non-playoff teams a treat to look forward to after the regular season ends.<br>  <br>  Just my 2 cents.<br>  <br>  <br>  GQ:  If this consolation playoffs were to take place, I believe that Golden State would meet Chicago in the final round.  I feel that the Warriors could beat the Suns as long as they don't have Amare but we would have a tough time matching up against the Bulls depth and size in the frontcourt.  Chicago would win this series eventually.

L9A81Xvvaa	Brandon Roy!|`|ulIZ38jVaa	i'd go with cp3... or maybe d will lol i think overall cp3 is better but d will has that edge when the game is on the line, like a last second play or shot plus he's more composed in late game situations, but still id pick cp3 coz there are 82 games and i think cp3 is more stable than d will : ) so i go with cp3|`|dDhTMacAaa	Chris Paul.<br>  <br>  I'm a big fan of DW and Brandon Roy, but Chris Paul is a truly unique player. He is an underrated shooter and that just compliments his unstoppable passing skill and he is a smart player as well.|`|XT8eNPhVaa	Well it would either be D Will or Paul just because they re point guards... and a good point guard = a good team<br>  <br>  Im gonna go with Paul just because hes as quick and as good a passer as D Will, but hes a better scorer, so hes better overall|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Brandon Roy look ive seen all of these players and of course their all great player but Roy just has something better about him self then Paul or Williams and i see alot of great potential in Roy but Paul and Williams will be great players also|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Paul because he makes his teammates around him better. He turned David West into an all-star|`|y8qGjcZyaa	I would love either Kobe Bryant or D. Howard to lead the team but anyways...<br>  <br>  I would take Paul|`|uoIV59V6aa	idk|`|Hvhynlftaa	Id take D Williams.<br>  <br>  Id take him over Paul and Roy cuz he is a great PG, Also he is leading his team to a play off run, with out Carlos Boozer. Strong built for a point guard, means strong on other guards, and plays Good Defense. He is a great leader. And is very unique player. Good question btw.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	I'd take Williams. He's a good PG and he could lead a team easily and play good. Only problem with him is that he would have to stay off injuries and play good. <br>  <br>  Roy is also good, because hes a great leader, but I think Williams would be the best pick in this situation.|`|Q9eXXF46aa	Paul and it's not even close. Replace Paul with Williams or Roy on New Orleans and they would fight for the eighth seed in the West. He makes everyone around him way better. When someone has a PER of 30, you don't replace him for anything. That puts him among the best of all time.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Chris Paul: He is one of the better PG, I have seen in awhile. Probally will finish in the Top 5 All-Time among PG's.<br>  <br>  I normally would choose a SG over a PG, but for Paul I'd make an exception, he is unique special player.|`|qbOEN99Vaa	I would take Chris Paul because he can create on fast breaks, he can get others involved. He is also a knock down shooter, which can help your franchise win a lot more games, and he loves to have the ball in pressure moments.|`|ZcsMSSwOaa	chris paul of course as one guy said point guards win games and he is one of the best if not the best point guard in the game he is a great overall player. roy and d-will are ood but not good enough to carry a beginning franchise|`|bQqkdPL9aa	Easy answer CP3.<br>  <br>  He does everything on the court, Passes the ball, he's a complete scorer (drives and shoots), and he rebounds and steals. Wat else can u ask for?|`|6yoQhXsOaa	I WOULD CHOSE DERON WILLIAMS EASILY! HE IS THE BEST LEADER OUT OF THEM! DID YOU SEE DWILL OWN CP3 LAST NIGHT AND ITS BEEN A WHILE BUT THE JAZZ AND DWILL OWNED ROY TOO!|`|QVDJi2GTaa	Thats an ill question.<br>  <br>  <br>  Um, I would say D.Will. Point Guards win championships[Unless you have te money to be the 3 biggest players in the game*ahem*]|`|8lslTphBaa	CP3|`|HP4eFPHjaa	Good question but i think i would go with Chris Paul over the rest|`|uSwQcMj8aa	Paul|`|pNMK9jDTaa	cp3 duh!!!!!!!!1|`|d9j0pkSJaa	i would say paul but id settle for d-will or roy any day|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Yes and out of those 3 I would pick D.Will cause he is the only 1 of the 3 to have gone to the WCF and finished 1 game away from the NBA Finals. He can score and is a very good defender and is physical and strong and puts it to good use. I would pair him up with Tim Duncan - whom is the epitome of a winner and consistency and is also fundamentally sound.|`|GswnLKtQaa	between cp3 and d-will, if i would start a team i'll get a good leader and both cp3 and d-will have those qualities. the 3 of them are very talented but cp3 and d-will are leaders, not saying roy isn't but he's still young.|`|mwxKnUleaa	If I started a franchise I would take Chris Paul to lead my team because he is probably the best and has the best all around. He can improve a team with his presence on and off the court. I think he would be the quickest to make a franchise better so that is why I would choose him, though I think Deron Williams and Brandon Roy are terrific players.|`|1Cuca96caa	Chris Paul because he has the best Defense out of all of them. I think he went 100+ games with at least one steal. Also he is a pure PG and averages more assists and points than roy and D Williams. Williams would be my next pick since he is the guy wh ocarries the Utah Jazz.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	It's a tie fight between Deron Wiliams and Cp3.This guys can lead the team and have same leadrship skills,so it's one of them but Roy isn't going to out fotm this.He just needs a little more expirence to lead a team and he's young too|`|c3tADklmaa	I'll pick Dirk because Im the one who starts the franchise.

Porto have beaten Arsenal in UCL, but I don't think they will win now.  Segio Aguero and Diego Forlan will each have  goals.<br>  <br>  1-2 Lyon v Barcelona: Lyon haven't lost in Ligue 1 since December, and Barcelona haven't won in their last 2 games in La Liga.  But I think Barcelona will take the negative energy and use it defeat Lyon. Karim Benzema will score for Lyon and Eto'o and Messi will score for Barcelona.<br>  <br>  0-0 Arsenal v Roma: Arsenal has not scored in the Premier League since January.  They don't have Fabregas, Walcott, and Rosicky.  If they can't score against Sunderland, don't expect them to score against Roma.  Roma has not faced Arsenal, and I don't think they will do well either.<br>  <br>  2-0 Internazionale v Manchester United: Both teams have done well lately, but I think Inter will win the first game at home.  Manchester United have not done well against Italian teams.  Ibrahimovic will score a pair of goals for Inter in their win.<br>  <br>  3-1 Real Madrid v Liverpool: Real have not loss since "El Classico" against Barcelona.  Liverpool drawed against Man City.  Real Madrid als ohave the home side and Juande Ramos has been fabulous since his arrival at Real. Rafa benitez on the other hand has been under heavy fire.  But Klaas Jan Huntelaar will not play in UCL at all.  But Real will still win, with Higuain, Raul, and Robben all scoring a goal.  Torres will score one for Liverpool.<br>  <br>  2-1 Chelsea v Juventus: Chelsea have Guus Hiddink as manager now, and he has had a successful managing career for average teams.  I don't think Juventus will be a problem at Stamford Bridge.  Nicolas Anelka and Frank Lampard will score for Chelsea and Del Piero will score for Juve.<br>  <br>  2-0 Villarreal v Panathinaikos: Panathinaikos will not last long in UCL, and Villarreal will kick them out instantly at home.  Rossi and Santi Cazorla will score one goal each.<br>  <br>  1-1 Sporting v Bayern: Both teams are not at top form, so Sporting will not play their best, even when they're at home.  They haven't faced a real challenge at all during the UCL because they had a pretty easy group (Barcelona as the exception, but FC Basel and Shakar Donetsk were in Sporting's group).  But Bayern have lost their last 2 Bundesliga games, so they are not good either.  Joao Mountinho will score for Sporting while Ribery will score for Bayern.|`|4oeZL5plaa	Atletico Madrid vs FC Porto (2:1)<br>  Lyon vs Barcelona (0:2)<br>  Arsenal vs Roma (1:2)<br>  Inter Milan v Manchester United (3:1)<br>  Real Madrid vs Liverpool (1:1)<br>  Chelsea vs Juventus (2:1)<br>  Villareal vs Panathinaikos (2:0)<br>  Sporting vs Bayern Munich (0:1)<br>  ____________________________________<br>  FC Porto-Atletico Madrid (1:1)<br>  Barcelona-Lyon (2:0)<br>  Roma-Arsenal (2:0)<br>  Manchester UTD-Inter Milan (1:1)<br>  Liverpool-Real Madrid (1:1)<br>  Juventus-Chelsea (2:1)<br>  Panathinaikos-Villareal (0:1)<br>  Bayern Munich-Sporting (3:1)|`|a3y63ODRaa	Atlético v Porto 3-1<br>  Lyon v Barcelona 1-3<br>  Arsenal v Roma 2-2<br>  Internazionale v Man.

ciQFlpuLaa	1) the Cavaliers forced the series to go to 7 games because Ray Allen was struggling really, really badly. he was missing wide open shots.<br>  <br>  2) same for Paul Pierce, he scored 41 points in that game.<br>  <br>  3) i'm slightly worried. that's why the Celtics need Joe Smith and Stephon Marbury.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	The Celtics will have reason to be afraid of the CAVs, if they meet during the playoffs.  One reason is the health of the aging Garnett and Allen.  Garnett is unable to play now and the teams can't afford to lose him at any time during the playoffs.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I think they should but Boston is still good so good matchup|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Afraid is probably the wrong word.  They'll have to be aware that they almost lost the series last year, especially if they don't get the home court, since the home team won all 7 games in the series last year.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, don't forget that Boston also went 7 games against the freaking 37-45 Atlanta Hawks, and 6 games against the Pistons.  Boston didn't really hit their stride until the finals, possibly because that was the first playoffs their big 3 had played together in.  If the Celtics start the playoffs playing the same way they played against the Lakers, I think they'll be much better in the early rounds.|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	Yes and only for 1 reason....<br>  <br>  The series would most likely be another LeBron James Love Fest with the refs giving him every non-call. <br>  <br>  I still remember last year... James drives, no contact, stuffed by KG, foul called.<br>  <br>  If the game is called fairly, C's win easily in 5. Otherwise... ugh... Let's not even think about it.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	no celtics can do work.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	yes,cause cavs beat the celtics this season.<br>  <br>  But that dont matter lakers will win finals they beat:Cavs twice and broke their home winnig streak.They beat celtics twice and broke their two big streaks<br>  <br>  LAkers in 09!!!!!|`|NFzgUqzvaa	I thnk boston celtics should be afraid of King James now because he is better now. The only team which does not need to worry about James is the Lakers. They have Kobe!!!|`|AyFAiS4xaa	Not if they wanna win.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Yes
c17x6L4baa	Possibly.  It would have been a great thing.  But, since Jim Brown, a man among boys, holds the career record in yards per game (104.3) and per carry (5.2), a better "IF" might be how long would we still have to wait before someone broke his record if he had continued at his pace for a few more years and stayed close to that for as many games as Emmitt ended with??  Over 23,500yds at his pace.  A lbit less maybe as he aged.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Part of the reason why Emmitt has the rushing record is because of his toughness and durability, Earl Campbell was great but he lacked that.|`|cqps4ujeaa	I think Earl Campbell would if he did it for 12 years, but he couldn't do it that long.  Emmitt Smith simply played the record.  I believe Barry could have gotten it if he played longer, but he didn't see the point in playing on a crap team for any longer just to get a near useless record.<br>  <br>  I have hard feelings against Emmitt, but I'm an Eagles fan, I can't help it.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Possibly. But it was Campbell's punishing style that led to his shortened career. He was so physical that his body broke down much quicker than the elusive Smith, Barry Sanders, etc..<br>  <br>  Smith had the benefit of a great line most of his career; but he was still a 1,000 yard back late in his years in Dallas; when the line was a shell of what it was from 1991-96.|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	he didn't so the question is irrelevant
SEzMrFrbaa	yes..."smackdown!!2003" for pc and ps1...jeff and matt both are in it.its a very good game|`|oAjbBLDpaa	I don't remember many...but I do remember him being in WWF Wrestlemania 2000 and WWF No Mercy.|`|kbLcAZYgaa	Everyone who says why don't you get the svr 09 game well listen there these could be the reasons why.<br>  1) No game System. Maybe PS1 and for sure PC (how else did he ask this)<br>  2) Doesn't want to spend $60.<br>  3) This is the biggest reason.  as soon as Smackdown vs Raw series started and THQ left the SMACKDOWN! series their games have gone downhill.  SVR 09 is the game going back up the hill but trust me i have it and i'm already bored even Online Play sucks now........<br>  <br>  I'm not that sure but i think maybe Raw 2 or WM 19 but if i pick any Wrestling game i say WWF No Mercy i think that is the best game THQ made.  As far as the others i'm not sure.  I stopped caring about the games later on in 2002 until Smackdown vs Raw (1) came out i bought the game.  But i hated it so until now i picked it up SVR 09 i admit it's good but it doesn't meet my expectations for a Wrestling Game (TNA IMPCRAP DIDN'T EITHER) Their biggest feature was Create A finisher and it was a big dissapointment.  Your options were very and mean very limited.  Other wise the game is a good game but i think after a month you lose interest and start looking at other games.  Because it's the same thing every time you turn on the game.  <br>  1) Pick a Match<br>  2) Pick your wrestler<br>  3) Pick Your Oppenent<br>  4) Pick your arena<br>  5) Set the rules<br>  6) Play and fight<br>  7) Go to Step 1 and follow back down.<br>  <br>  Road To WrestleMania was good but i got sick and tired of it since it's only 6 storylines and only 7 wrestlers.  <br>  <br>  Inferno Match was actually better than it looks so i say that was a thumbs up.<br>  <br>  Overall: AWESOME THQ DELIVERED A WRESTLING GAME FINALLY BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU GET BORED AFTER PLAYING IT FOR A WHILE.|`|dDbOsESqaa	He was in WWE Crush Hour.|`|OuFhcdX9aa	why not just get svr09. jeff's in that. and the graphics don't suck.|`|DvNZr4TAaa	y would u want a game from 2003?

AA12103453	If you WERE the #1 Redwing fan(and you aren't) then you'd keep up with OTHER hockey news well enough to know what that was about. He's a jerk is basically the story. The NHL FINALLY found something to suspend him over, since there is no rule against being a jerk and being hated, and so they took advantage of it. In this case it was about his comments about his ex girlfriends, and doesn't matter if they are basically true.|`|AA10068004	Are you serious???|`|UULgRsDSaa	He made a "rude" comment about his ex-girlfriends dating other NHL players, like Jarome Iginla.
YzROGXS1aa	I don't know ...there was a article that was talking about Marmol being the strong possible ace closer for the cubs...|`|Cu5GB2wfaa	Yes, TRADE.  Flyod had a great season last year, and their is no reason why he can't have another one, if not better..  Also, Marmol may not be the Cubs closer, that spot may be occupied by Kevin Gregg.|`|aiBSMFWmaa	Depends on your needs. If you have a ++ SP satff  then keep Marmol. If you need some SP then Danks is your guy. <br>  <br>  Marmol (although the fav, doesnt yet have the job). Danks, however, is gaureenteed to be starting!<br>  <br>  -Withiout know ing anything Id holdoff, and keep you RP for now! Great ERA, WHip and will be the closer.|`|rdqHOdEmaa	NO. buckeyes suck

qAzFPINKaa	well its AL davis wat do you expect|`|4f39b99c52a20630de221dd45e127722aa	i don't think heyward-bey is as bad as everyone makes him out to be. it seems the entire football watching world has a major man crush on michael crabtree. most likely because of that one catch against texas. good as that was it's not really a measure of future success. pete prisco at cbssportsline seems to be the only guy who likes the pick. he said what i heard from a lot of other people--crabtree had no 40 time, an injury, and character issues. maybe al davis learned from the whole randy moss thing. <br>  if heyward-bey can be consistent then he's a better fit than crabtree or maclin. downfield speed is what the raiders need. you can have the best wr's in the world but if you have no one to open up the field then it's easy for the db's to sit 10 yds down field and wait for the pass to come. remember when the raiders had rice and brown in their super bowl run? they were not speed receivers but they had jerry porter to open up the field. <br>  i say give it some time. the raiders have had enough uber-talented prima donnas who stop producing when things go bad. hopefully this guy will just go out and play.|`|nBnAFkisaa	Heyward-Bey was probably a good pick. He is fast, big, good hands. People say he is inconsistent, but I think NFL coaches will fix that. As for the other pick, i have no ******* clue...|`|4XVRlnNIaa	I agree with #13 its al daivs what else can i say|`|1sTaefg6aa	As far as the raiders pick, more then half of the first round are busts. Forget first or second round projections by the so called experts. The only question is why didnt the raiders try to trade the pick and grab heyward bey later on. I think this is going to be one of those Mario Williams-Reggie Bush picks. Everybody questioned the texans on choosing Williams over Bush but now it was the right decision. Watch out for Heyward Bey cause he will prove everybody wrong. Big and fast with good hands and just inconsistent. Well NFL coaches will make him consistent.|`|SJr2tYeTaa	the experts all had bey going ahead of harvin<br>  <br>  crabtree said he didnt want to play in oakland<br>  <br>  maclin is overrated in my opinion. slot reciever at best<br>  <br>  we didnt trade down because after sanchez went fifth no teams wanted to trade into the top ten. we tried to trade the pick but there were no takers|`|KzlyHEgraa	Al Davis took Hayward-Bey over crabtree because he didnt have a 40 time on him and everyone knows Davis likes to run a track team not a football team.|`|0d8b6ef7af18728f4f1f6c4f667d7194aa	The Raiders should just,just,just..... give up.|`|AA10130483	Mitchell was a horrible pick... Heyward-Bey might not be as good as Crabtree or Maclin, who I think were the best 2 WRs in the draft, but he'll be okay... Mitchell in any round but the 7th was a reach...<br>  <br>  <br>  I still think they should have used their first round pick on BJ Raji... The Raiders needed a guy here badly, and Raji was their chance to get it...|`|7V79OMMHaa	One of the analysts said it was a typical Al Davis pick, and the state of the franchise should reflect how well that has been going for them.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Stay Cool
0MJRD9sYaa	None|`|xQFWjFyZaa	In a dynasty league, you keep your entire roster from the previous season, and draft from the available rookies at the start of each season. <br>  <br>  In a keeper league, you get to keep the designated amount set by the league Commish. It could be 4, 6, 8, etc. Then a draft is held for all of the people who weren't kept, as well as incoming rookies.

Lol0iLfgaa	You need to keep running 5-6 days a week.  This week, you need to try and get in a good workout because it is truly your last chance before the race to really get your legs moving.  <br>  <br>  I'd suggest something like a interval run two weeks before the day of the race.  Something like 1 minute hard, with 1 minute running rest X 6-7 times.  Treat this workout like the race, so warm up, wear your race shoes, and do whatever you traditionally do for a race.<br>  <br>  The rest of that week, do a long run whenever you can (not the day after the workout, do an easy run the day after wards) with the rest of the week, just do a few easy runs.  Be sure to give yourself 1-2 days off.  <br>  <br>  The week leading up to the race, do a easier workout 5 days before your race.  Don't over do it.  It is just to get your legs ready for the race.  The rest of the week just take it easy, and do a super easy run the day before the race.  <br>  <br>  Shin splints are often caused by the shoes that you are wearing, how long have you had them?
9ujT56Maaa	You can never go wrong owning a Miro Satan jersey|`|xHc3KGDmaa	Sidney Crosby he is the best player in the NHL|`|xIfvXy4waa	I have a Crosby! The only thing is there are so many of them. What about Sykora, that would be original.|`|G33E41IBaa	You should get a Lemieux jersey (unless you already have one).  Even though a lot of people probably have his jersey, I think it's just a classic; you can't go wrong with Lemieux.  But if you would like a jersey of someone on the current line up, go with Malkin for sure.  He's doing better than Crosby this season, and plus EVERYONE has a Crosby jersey and it's really getting old...You should be a little different.  Plus, for the most part, I believe fans of other NHL teams like Malkin better than Crosby.  Don't get Fleury; he's not doing that well this year, and throughout his career he hasn't been very consistent.|`|DvBPLP4saa	Not a Crosby jersey. Please no. There's too many of them as it is. They breed like rabbits. :P <br>  <br>  I would recommend a Gonchar, or a Sykora (my favorite), or a Orpik, or a Cooke, or a Kennedy, or a Talbot or something. A key member of the team who is amoung the fan favorites but it not a jersey you see a million of. <br>  <br>  Or you could always go out school. Get a Lemieux or a Jagr, maybe a Francis, Trottier, Samuelsson, Barrasso, Coffey, (Phil) Bourque, Errey etc. Or maybe you could go very out school and get a Larouche. <br>  <br>  Anything you want. Who's your favorite Penguin player? Who is your favorite past player?|`|YsAEPYwOaa	Neither...get a Lemieux jersey instead.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	66 as in Mario to show your True Colors  BLACK AND GOLD.|`|5P4FySVAaa	I just got a new Malkin home jersey for my birthday and i love it.  I love Sid and everything but I think i like Geno more, plus EVERYONE has Crosby.  I wanted something different but wanted to pick a guy who i knew was going to stick around for a while so i went with Geno.  Staal wouldn't be a bad choice but maybe wait til after the trade deadline to see what happens with him.  I would expect Flower to be around for a looong time but ive heard his jersey is tough to find.|`|ec3E6gSbaa	HM I would go with a Crosby one. My second choice would be Malkin. <br>  3rd choice Jordan Staal<br>  4th Gonchar<br>  5th Fleury<br>  6 Talbot<br>  7 Whitney<br>  Sorry just giving you some ideas, just in case they don't have any on the list.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	EVGENI MALKIN!!<br>  Crosby<br>  Sykora<br>  Fleury<br>  Letang|`|QO1jEBdFaa	You should get a Lemieux jersey.

vY0aIjuAaa	Shay Given.<br>  Mark Schwarzer.<br>  Rob Green<br>  <br>  :) my opinion.|`|MxfjoVrMaa	The best 3 goalkeepers outside the top 4 in the Premier League are Robert Green of West Ham United, Brad Friedel of Aston Villa and Shay Given of Manchester City. When Green is playing his best, he is fantastic and no-one can score past him and I think that he should be England's number 1 international goalkeeper. Brad Friedel has been consistent since joining Aston Villa and was fantastic while at Blackburn Rovers. Shay Given was fantastic at Newcastle United over the years and made some fantastic saves, and has carried that form onto when he joined Manchester City.|`|A1l4U6l6aa	Shay Given - Outstanding goalkeeper, maybe should b part of the top 4.<br>  <br>  Robert Green - Most underrated goalkeeper in football when he is at the top of his game.<br>  <br>  Mark Schwazer - Great goalkeeper, keeps Fulham in loads of games with some out standing saves. brilliant goalkeeper.|`|qwTbgoXGaa	definately cech is the best keeper today in modern football..although he is having a recent slum of form..but it does happen to even the best..and then definately shay given and brad fridel..although van der ser is doing a decent job he will never be in my top 10..all credit goes to vidic for his record breaking clean sheet..loved him in his fulham days though..|`|CdSGNBbpaa	1 - Tim Howard<br>  2 - Tim Howard<br>  3 - Tim Howard <br>  <br>  Go EVERTON|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Super Tim Howard<br>  Given <br>  Freidel|`|6KZA7D97aa	Shay Given <br>  Brad Friedel<br>  Jeskalinein|`|j19YIgAVaa	i cant believe this but nobody has said Chris Kirkland <br>  definetly shay given and david james|`|FYQftU4taa	cudicini<br>  given<br>  howard|`|whRqI4Boaa	Shwarzer, Shay Given and Friedel. :)|`|uXXbegw5aa	Shay Given<br>  Mark Schwarzer<br>  Tim Howard|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	Mark Schwarzer<br>  Robert Green<br>  Chris Kirkland|`|tfotPdeZaa	Aww.

1fwo8HqMaa	I think they will narrowly miss the UEFA cup spots and finish 9th or 10th!<br>  <br>  It would be better for them to finish just shy of the top 8 so that they don't get overwhelmed with too many matches next season!|`|qO7nbSQVaa	I think they have peaked , a mid table finish would be a good achievement after last season . well done Roy Hodgson.|`|p6E7g6CWaa	maybe 6th or 7th especially because of their clean sheets,. they have a tidy defence|`|NgZlz5K7aa	10Th, you heard it here first. 51pts|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	11th

3XedDHrUaa	what your doing wrong is your kicking the board down and it prolly spins and u land it with your back foot right, well u need to flick out on an angle . you need to have your foot slightly pointed forward and more over the edge . u pop it and flick out and it will spin . try learning them on grass to get the landing and while learning it put your foot hanging alot over the edge and flick faster it wont go as high but u can work on it by moving your foot in which takes alot more leg|`|2Ffisho5aa	Try jumping higher it helps a lot.|`|trX5SFxHaa	flick up not down i usued to have a problem with that! haha but u have a long way to go till you learn it, its good that you land on back foot so you can stop the spin off drops and stairs good luck bro!!! and have fun with it
KOsGtal8aa	he is probably the worst player i have ever seen wear the arsenal shirt|`|HxET88bDaa	I think the fact that he plays with such good players at Arsenal makes him look a bit poo to be honest, if he was at a lesser club he would be better.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	His dribbling is better than his striking, i can see him as a right winger not a striker|`|wurimjbnaa	Hes a little too lazy|`|CVQjYVJJaa	He is a complete rubbish. No potential at all.<br>  <br>  He has very poor finishing ability - something that a striker should not have.<br>  <br>  His dribbling is also very very bad. Not to mention his pace and acceleration.<br>  <br>  Maybe playing for lower league clubs is best for him.|`|8hReZeN1aa	he has the potential to be a better player than he is now prob as good as ashton but definately not a superstar and i think wenger likes him cos he offers them something different to the rest of their strikers, he is worth keeping hold of, as bad as his finishing looks sometimes he can still improve on it|`|XV3opft8aa	I ask this for the second time: Who is that guy??!!!

He has a shockingly crap finish, and is too lazy, staying offside a lot.|`|GuXKPVgjaa	Im a pretty impatal juge and I have to say, he is not of Arsenal grade. They should drop him off in some mid-table club.
LIKkt8djaa	Emmm you go practice your balance on a balancing board, You could pickup a skateboard for the freestyle aspect of snowboarding and a Freebord for the carving aspect of snowboarding.. You'll need hills for that though, I ride it myself and it is pretty similar to carving on a snowboard, you can even do some butters on the thing similar to snowboard butters.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Plan a few trips throughout the season at a variety of mountains and practice your riding.  New York, Vermont and Maine all have great resorts that you would have a lot of fun at|`|HVpeJzM4aa	skateboarding and longboarding are VERY different philosophies than snowboarding. The ONLY way to get better at snowboarding is to keep doing it to the point where you can apply the basic fundamentals of weight shifting and make it part of your second nature. For instance, you don't learn to ride a motorcycle by riding your mountain bike up and down the street...they're too different.

He wants to be able to spend more time with his family. People have been asking that question a lot because pictures of him don't show the SARA tattoo on his neck anymore. WWE has the tattoo removed from some pictures of him and sometimes asks him to cover it up when going to the ring because they want to continue to strengthen his dark and deadly persona and that's hard to do with his wife's name tattooed on his neck for everyone to see.

HqQmZfA6aa	Wow, open-ended question. They are very different so hard to say because I don't know your personality, attitude, goals etc. Why do you want to train? What are your long-term goals? Why do you even want to do a whole bunch of stuff instead on concentrating on just one?<br>  <br>  A good BJJ school is going to teach you great skills that are practical from the start but you won't learn to punch. Muay Thai will get you fight fit but you won't learn to grapple the same way. Aikido will teach you to relax but won't give you any really practical stuff very fast. Judo is hard and tough and is an Olympic sport so gets good backing and is usually cheaper. <br>  <br>  I would tend towards BJJ or judo because the grappling skills don't come as easily as the stand up skills like punching and kicking, so they need more work. If you have the time/wherewithal, I would do 3 to 4 BJJ/judo classes a week and 1 Muay Thai.<br>  <br>  Depends on the quality of the schools in your area too. Where are? Some schools offer a wider range too.|`|c4d3e30573f7765b16b9bbddef2168d6aa	I would go with Jujutsu or Judo depending on the instructors in your area.<br>  <br>  BJJ- Very specialized and not very realistic for street.  (Unless you get into one on one in a street in which case it's good)<br>  <br>  Muay Thai- Very good striking style, but it's specialized toward stand up.  I would have this style as a follow up to Judo if you end up with that.<br>  <br>  Aikido- Good philosophy and good theories, but just not enough of realistic training.  I would see Aikido as a graduate school where you can discuss philosophy, types of attacks, ideal defense, and the other good stuff that would be of good use if you already know what real fight looks like first.  If you don't it's just going to go right past you and it'll be useless.<br>  <br>  Jujutsu- I believe they have strikes, locks, throws, ground work, and even weapon.  It sounds like dream come true, but there is a catch.  Because most JJ had died or moved on, in form of Judo, it is hard to find a real JJ school.  It exist to be sure, but there are a lot of posers who claim to be JJ but are not. (usually basic judo with some made up strikes thrown in and claim that they're JJ)  Also the reason why Judo became quickly popular in Japan when it did, was because Judo people went around a beat all kinds of JJ people who practiced as realistically as Aikido does today.  So if you can find a good legit JJ school you are set to go.<br>  <br>  Judo- If you don't like the feel of JJ school around you, Judo is definitely a good back up. (Or not even a back up)  Judo is sort of sport and gi oriented, but they will teach you good throws and they also will teach you a touch of ground work. (After all BJJ began from Judo) They practice their technique competitively so you know that if you can throw Bob from your class you can throw anyone like him as soon as you can grab him. (I say 'as soon as you grab' because it's hard to grab a outside boxer and it's hard to grab a sleeve in summer.)|`|LCsPPhXqaa	Tae Kwon Do is a very good start off... and even good for some experts...<br>  lethal and effective martial art but you have to find a good place<br>  <br>  By good place i mean...<br>  they dont give you badges like "ASITANT INSTRUCTOR!!!!"<br>  <br>  this isnt boy scout camp... this is martial arts|`|eKbWhBqIaa	judo|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	try aikido it would help allot in a self defense situation|`|yGfmofHUaa	KUNG FU PANDA!|`|Dae7Afpqaa	I have practiced different arts and have hi ranking in most of them.  The first thing you have to understand is that one thing is fighting and other is self defense.  For fighting Stand up I prefer Kung Fu. But don't matter if is Karate, Kung Fu or Tae Kwon Do. What you should seek is that the stand up system that you chose to practice do kick boxing, no point sparing, that don't work in the street. <br>  When comes to self defense.  About one of the best is Jujitsu.  I am a Vee Jitsu  and sanuces Ryu Jujitsu practitioner.  Okay the other end.  I have practiced Brazilian  Jujitsu. And is Great. And my thinking is that I don't want to go to the floor in a Fight.  But if I have too.  I want to know more of the floor than my opponent. I think is not easy to find a system that covers all but now you can find schools that teach or integrate more than one art.  But remember a kick and punch system and a self Defense system like japanese jujitsu. And from Art of Jujitsu is where judo and Aikido came.  Judo is the sport art of jujitsu and aikido is the soft part. when you practice a good jujitsu you will all most cover judo and aikido. dwizard2001@yahoo.com|`|Km9QC8a9aa	For "well rounded" I would go with Aikido.<br>  <br>  Empty hand and weapons.|`|LUnscegvaa	Japanese Jiu-Jitsu<br>  <br>  I'd suggest.<br>  <br>  Why : It's an all rounder.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|r2bbLMUZaa	Depends on what you want to do with it.<br>  <br>  For self defense i recommend Aikido, for winning fights, judo.<br>  <br>  Judo is an extremely effective counter against most grappling or wrestling styles, and as such, is perfect in a brawl.<br>  <br>  Aikido works much like judo, but you put your opponent down through manipulation of their joints instead of their momentum.|`|a0ZGMrwmaa	If you don't want to insult the escaped Tae Kwon Do monkeys of the world, I'd recommend Tae Kwon Do lol. It's easy but gets more and more challenging. It's fun, and a great workout. You get to break boards and spar plus it's not just defense or just attack you learn both so it's great for scary, rare situations.|`|AA11334468	BJJ is Judo and Jiu Jitsu combined into one art form learn that and you will be fine|`|xzZYf2X5aa	judo: strengthens and improves speed!|`|RXBb8kx7aa	I would recomend Juijitsu. It's a very well rounded style that heavily teaches the most common way to fight: on the ground. Most fights are eventually brought to ground scuffles. Muay Thai is a very good practical art; basically a powerful, balanced form of kick boxing that is usable in most any situation. I'd go with either of those. Aikido is not a great art to focus on. It is very good to learn and use, but mostly make good supplemental martial arts. Aikido, in order to be truly effective, must be used in conjunction with other arts. My personal preference would be to take Juijitsu and then Aikido. Aikido is one of my favorite arts but is too conditional in various aspects to be able to rely on it. Basically, Aikido involves manipulating your opponent and breaking thier joints. Teaches some great catches for punches, holds, how to flip your opponent and basically force them to do whatever you want. A great supplement, but in any sort of organized combat, it's not the best choice. I don't know enough about Judo to say anything on it.|`|fVnbFLsQaa	A well rounded martial art? start off with Karate, Wado Ryu, this style is easier on the knees and is more akin to jujitsu, it's probably a mixture, this is not about sheer power, unlike say Shotokan, and is more evasive but still hard hitting and effective. I may be biased, this is my style!<br>  Also consider Krav Maga, the Israeli unarmed combat system, very effective!|`|zE8sk1NJaa	I like judo myself it gets you in really good shape and you learn how to take a fall really well like even in other situations like snowboarding, skiing, doing whatever.

Steroid abuse is overdoing them.  They are like diet pills in that they can be taken safely for a healthy adult male in specific doses on cycles.  But over doing them can cause health problems.  Eddie also had a history with recreational drugs.  And that rock star lifestyle took it's toll and he had a heart attack and died.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	Remembering Eddie Guerrero <br>  <br>  This past November 13, 2008,  marked the three year anniversary of the tragic, yet seemingly commonplace tragedy: The death of a wrestling superstar. Eddie Guerrero left this world in 2005 but left behind a tremendous wrestling legacy. Born in 1967 to a wrestling legend in Mexico, Gory Guerrero, he began his wrestling career in 1987. It was a wrestling career that would span about eighteen years, right up until his untimely death. He was survived by his wife, Vicki, the current General Manager for the Smack Down brand WWE television wrestling program and three children. His nephew and former tag team partner, Chavo Guerrero Jr. is currently still wrestling with the WWE.<br>  <br>  In the book called Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, Eddie describes how he had become addicted to painkillers and alcohol. He was four years sober when he passed away but the years of abuse from wrestling, travel and the addictions wreaked havoc on his heart and ultimately led to his death. It was his nephew Chavo who found Eddie passed out on the floor of his hotel room. He tried to perform Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR, but Eddie was pronounced dead at the scene.<br>  <br>  He has wrestled all over the world and was a part of every major wrestling company in the United States, save for TNA Impact. Eddie Guerrero has also held numerous championship belts in all of the organizations he wrestled in. How many people can say they did the same? He was extremely popular in the WWE including when he played the part of a heel. He was loved by and will forever be missed by just about everyone in the wrestling universe. His in ring antics will be missed as well. <br>  <br>  One popular thing he did that went along with his “ I Lie, I Cheat, I Steal” mantra was when he would wrestle in a match, he would take advantage of the referee being distracted. He would get a steal chair, slam it down on the mat and then toss it to his opponent. He would then lie down on the mat and pretend he was hit by the chair. The ref would turn around after hearing the banging noise; see Eddie on the mat and his opponent holding the steel chair. The referee would then think the opponent hit Guerrero with the chair and disqualify him, thereby causing Eddie to win the match.<br>  <br>  Eddie Guerrero wrestled in the ring like he lived his life. He was fast and wild. Ultimately it caught up with him and he paid the price for it. Fast living often results to a fast end. Eddie Guerrero was loved by all and was posthumously inducted into the WWE’s Hall of Fame in 2006, just months after his death. Long Live Eddie Guerrero.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	SmackDown.!<br>  <br>  He passed away.

There wasn't a brand split during the time when he left the WWE. Wrestlers were in both shows during the attitude era. When he came back to the WWE, there was a brand split. He ended up in RAW when he came back and attacked RVD. Then later feud with The Rock & Stone Cold for a little bit but it didn't last long since the plan didn't work out because of Stone Cold leaving the business. Later he ended up going to Smackdown! with Chris Benoit. Pretty much he was a smackdown guy through 2002-2005.<br>  <br>  RIP EDDIE!|`|Bp3bt5bCaa	He did not leave the company, He died 2 days before Survivor Series 2005. He was currently on Smackdown! before he died. He died of an acute heart failure. Chavo found him unconscious and tried CPR.

Kaeding is a solid kicker most of the time.  Likewise with punter Mike Scifres.  I wouldn't get rid of a punter that averages 50 YDs a punt.<br>  <br>  However, I would get rid of either Matt Wilhelm or Mike Goff and hope for something good in the draft.|`|qsKOlpUyaa	Oh, and the quality of play by other players on the team had nothing to do with ruining the Chargers Super Bowl chances?|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	sage rosenfels, he's a good backup but we could draft say graham harrell to put at # 2 and have a QB for the future.|`|AA12022123	how did he ruin it he tied the game against the colts to go into overtime and win it|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	every time someone's team loses they have to find someone to blame it on<br>  it's called lack of self esteem and the need to live vicariously with a winner<br>  <br>  .|`|YPUu34G0aa	New England -  Matt Cassel.<br>  Get rid of him already.. send him to detroit or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tom Brady will be ready to go for next season.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Dallas T.O.|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	Dan gleck from eagles the full back can't do anything hes such a waste he uh I hate that guy|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	None<br>  Pats are perfect in every position|`|xgBNImTHaa	al davis-raiders lol jk<br>  <br>  <br>  jamarcus russel-raiders|`|R8iZu0Pbaa	Tampa bay bucs <br>  Luke mccown <br>  Bring back garcia|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Michael Vick.  I mean, he's obviously never going to play as a Falcon again, and he's really useless on our roster.<br>  <br>  As for your choice in Kaeding, I dont know, I mean he's really a good overall kicker and although he's missed a few key FGs, you can't really put all the blame on him.  I mean, there are plenty of factors that determine the outcome of a game, and you could just as easily blame Rivers for not throwing a TD pass in the play leading up to the missed FG attempt, as a TD would have made the FG attempt moot.  Just trying to say that just because he missed on the final play of the game, doesnt mean the previous 59+ min of play that your team didn't outscore the opponent is his fault.<br>  <br>  Edit: Wasn't necessarily saying you should blame it on Rivers, but just using it as an example, that had he thrown a TD, Kaeding wouldn't have had to kick.  I know its his only job to kick but generally those last second FGs aren't really chip shots, and there is a lot of pressure.  I know it comes with the job, but there arent a lot of kickers who are better.  There are some, but not a lot.
AA10291522	Sorry, I have to disagree with you.<br>  <br>  Ronaldo, unlike Ashley, has proven himself on the highest levels of European football. Has Ashley ever won a Champions League? How about a Premier League? Has he even won an FA/Carling Cup? Until he leads his team to such successes--or at least until he proves himself with the best of the best--he will never be rated highly amongst the footblling elite.<br>  <br>  Apart from accolades, I personally think that Cristiano is a much better player. People criticize hm for diving--which he has doe in the past--but many, MANY other players--such as Steven Gerrard and even Ashley Young--are guilty of simulation. Speaking of free kicks, did you not see the one Ronaldo scored against Blackburn yesterday? Absolutely spectacular! I can't see Ashley scoring from such an angle (at least not yet, lol). Pacewise, Cristiano is much faster than Ashley (and even faster than Agbonlahor). In terms of delivery, Cristiano by far. Because he knows his teammates and knows how to play one-touch football, he can make accurate, no-look, intelligent passes on a regular basis--I really haven't seen too much of that from Villa. Work rate--that's a tough one. I'll admit, Cristiano is a bit cocky at times, but it is his ability to step up--like he did against Blackburn--that sets him apart from the rest. In terms of skill--uh, what do you mean MAYBE Ronaldo? Cristiano is probably the most skilled player in the Premier League. Why do you think he's always double or triple-teamed during matches? He's very hard to keep up with; those step-overs can throw any defender off.<br>  <br>  I may seem to think that Cristiano is a better player, but don't get me wrong. I absolutely love Ashley as a player. He has an incredible amount of talent, and I can definitely see him being transferred to a larger club than Villa. Players like him, Agbonlahor, and Walcott are the futures of English football--and that future is looking very bright right now. =)|`|cxd2kSaSaa	Atm, there is no contest. It's like when Martin O'Neill said Ashley Young was on par with Messi. I had to laugh. He's still a good player though, so give it a few years, he might just be as good as Ronaldo.<br>  <br>  However he will never be better.|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	At the moment Ronaldo is better but give it a couple of years n we will c. At the moment Young seems 2 play great against lower clubs but when it comes 2 playing a team from the top 5 he seems 2 not b involved in the game very much.|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Ashley young is more consistent yes....

CttL3LmBaa	There are a lot of good bikes between $700 - $1000.  Unfortunately you are looking a bit late.  Quickly check out your local bike shops.   See if there is anything in your size and to your liking in a left over 2008.  Prices jumped like crazy for 2009.  In 2007 you could get an aluminum frame with carbon forks and stays with all 105 for $700.  Now that same bike is about $1300.  You should be looking for Shimano 105 group on what ever brand you like.  I like Bianchi, Trek, Specialized and Fuji.|`|Iptnp2zCaa	I started out on a trek 1000.  It's a very entry level road bike.  I didn't know if I was going to like it or stick with it.  It served me well for a year or so and I just recently moved up to a Trek Madone. I completed my first 180 mile bike trek last summer.  I am hooked!    I love the Trek line.  <br>  <br>  the best advice though, is to go to several different bike shops and let them fit the bike to you.  Tell them you want an entry level road bike.  Then I would check out Craigs list or something similar.  I sold my 1000 on craigslist to someone just starting out, like me.<br>  <br>  Yey for your new hobby!  You'll love it.|`|885c0806c9b2d818c143ed380999933daa	As a cyclist, I prefer Trek. But Trek is like Mercedes, in that it's top-of-the-line. Unfortunately, just like a Mercedes you are going to spend top-of-the-line money as well. <br>  <br>  For your price range, Giant makes a wonderful bike, and for about half of what you would pay for a Trek. You also might want to look into a company called Felt; their bikes are all over the Southern California area, and, from what i've heard, they're very inexpensive.|`|o7zCOsUjaa	I recommend the Trek 1 series, possibly the 1.2 if your just starting out. It is a little over you budget at $879 but it is good value, has okay kit on it, and you may be able to find a better deal in a shop. I have a Trek 1.7 and i like its really good all round, but unfortunately they don't make this model in th U.S. My dad has the 1.2 as a winter training bike as you can also fit permanent front and rear mudguards. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps ;)

The DVD featured clips of his more notable feuds and matches along with commentary from WWE stars past and present (most of which are unflattering). The DVD has provoked some controversy due to Warrior's own allegations of libel by WWE against him. Originally, Warrior was asked to help with the production of the DVD, but as he refused to work with WWE (citing he did not want to be associated with their promotion), there has been some resulting animosity between Warrior and WWE over the content with Warrior claiming bias on the part of WWE. <br>  <br>  Warrior Hates Vince Mcmahon And WWE|`|6f6424d780bead8a8c5b0c1806400109aa	oh, you mean the worst wrestler ever who broke character and came to the ring wearing a baseball cap and had a disappointing match at wrestlemania because it only lasted for under a minute?<br>  that guy will never come back.<br>  in my book, he is only a legend because he gave the WWE an extreme amount of money from his popularity. other than that, he sucked.|`|HvnFTNmCaa	No please no...<br>  <br>  Have you seen his so called match with Orlando Jordan last year ?

0R46pYb3aa	Neither rifle is Japanese, so forget anythuing you may have heard regarding that.  They are both decent guns and can be accurate rifles.  If you are looking for a hunting rifle they are not ideal for that purpose.  The safety operation is not the greatest for a hunting rifle and scope mounting can be less than ideal.<br>  <br>  The cartridge is excellent for deer as long as you use the proper bullet, and not FMJ or military surplus ammo.|`|QrjuueMCaa	The first one 'looks' a bit better, but honestly, I wouldn't buy either. $60 bucks gets you $60 bucks worth of ****. Just depends on what brand of **** you really want.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Those are old russian military rifles.<br>  That old russian cartridge is low powered, rare, and getting rarer.<br>  If you must buy an antique get a '98' from Mitchells Mausers.<br>  The actions are stronger, and there are more parts and accessories, (scope mounts etc). and ammo available.<br>  Base prices for 'shooting condition' models are comparable.<br>  If you want a 'shooter', 98 'Yugo' mausers are available in .308 NATO.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	The first one. What really concerns me on the second is the seller's claim of a 'new bore'. Let's face it, if it was made in '43, it saw action in the war and it may have a nice, but not new bore.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	I would go with #2(if all #s match)simply because of Wartime manufacture|`|HdSaN24caa	well, they're probably both just 'SHOOTERS" so if you want to save money, buy the cheaper one and you can make it look like new with cold blue and wood stain.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	These are both Mosin-Nagant 91/30 rifles. They are chambered for the 7.62X54R ammunition. The more expensive one has better finish, but they probably shoot nearly the same. As with most war-time used weapons there can be both good and bad within the same lot. I bought a K98 Mauser that looked nearly perfect but was not at all accurate. My buddy bought a K98- for less than half of what I paid- that looked like it had been dragged down a mountain by a tank; it shot perfectly. Personally, I don't care for the 7.62X54R as a hunting round, but others have had excellent results with it. The round has the potential to be very accurate in the right hands. I just don't happen to have the right hands, I guess.|`|OrvTG44laa	What kind of gun is the second one?  Couldn't see where it said it.

dfBwVxXFaa	looks like a semi auto 20ga. of some kind.|`|AA12034449	it looks a lot like the sporting version of a Browning Automatic rifle to me.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	you need to give us a better picture- not so grainy and not soo small|`|DM2M5LK4aa	Can you get a clearer, closer up picture?  It seems to be semi-automatic by the look of the action on that gun.  I own a Browning BAR Belgium rifle and it looks very similar to that gun, so take a look at the browning.  Another possibility is that it is a semi-auto shotgun, as the barrel looks a bit larger than that of any rifle.  Like I said though, it is hard to tell from that picture.  Look into the Browning and also check out a Remington 7400 which looks very similar to that in the picture.<br>  <br>  As for shotguns, if it is indeed a shotgun, then take a look at the Tri-Star TSA semi-auto shotgun, the Remington Model 1100, or the other auto-loaders by remington.  I apologize for not being able to give any better of an answer but I really can't tell from that picture.  I hope that helped you out a bit, good luck.|`|ZDOUwJsbaa	This is a Browning semi-automatic shotgun, not a rifle, if you look close you can see the vent rib barrel. Rifles don't have vent ribs. It's most likely an A-5 in either 12 or 20 gage. It also may be an A-5 clone there are many companies that make guns that look very similar to this one.|`|AA12211483	It looks like an old browning shotgun to me|`|SeLytr1Uaa	you can just look on the side of the barrel and it will tell you it also gives the gauge cartridge size serial number and model number

OfNTLq3Qaa	I have never thought of that before but you might have a point. The AWA focused more on wrestling than useless storylines. I still watch reruns of AWA Classics on ESPN. They had storylines but the whole show did not revolve around them, much like RoH.<br>  I just hope that when Ring of Honors tv program hits, they don't water it down with a bunch of storylines.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Thing is that AWA was once on the same level as the WWF(at that time)and the NWA.ROH never got that high.We do know what happenend to the AWA & NWA and not being able to change with the times.ROH has no network contract a must to be able to keep big stars.Otherwise it is just a training ground.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Don't know as i've never seen it. I would like to though.|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	It's one of the closest things to it. I haven't seen a whole lot of either promotion from start to finish but I just got done watching AWA this morning and was thinking the same thing. ROH has a lot more relavance to today and so that itself creates more of an elemant of storytelling and showmanship that was seen a bit less in AWA. That atmosphere in ROH is much different than AWW, and more so like that of an ECW arena. It's also smaller scale in comparison to the way AWA was viewed by fans.
JJ0OIiZ1aa	If your getting tennis elbow, you should think about switching to a diff. racket. It could be the racket or even bad form. Try Prince O3, thats a good qualtiy racket, light and should help with your elbow. As for strings more durable i'd recommend Big Banger, or sweet 16. Go to tenniswarehouse.com and check out the reviews on durable strings, you'll find one you like. Best of luck. :)|`|s4wHrUB3aa	use luxilon big bangers..and decrease ur tension then if ur getting tennis elbow|`|XzWTt9Z1aa	I used to use wilson stamina and wilson sensation, but, like you, i found that they only lasted me at most 3 weeks. Now, i switched to Luxilon Big Bangers Original 16g and haven't broken them in 3 months :) they don't move around either and keep tension really well. However, they are known to make tennis elbow worse if you string them at a higher tension, so i would recommend stringing at 95% of your usual tension.|`|iUtb3sq5aa	get a Prince raquet<br>  they're amazing.<br>  <br>  i've been playing tennis for 11 years, and out of every type of raquet i've ever used, Prince was seriously the best!
qbbNtGVcaa	well my high school squad does tumbling..but not EVERYONE does. like some girls do back handsprings, round offs, cartwheels, and some can even do tucks or fulls. but only like 5 or 6 girls can do back handsprings/fulls/tucks<br>  <br>  you should be able to at least to a round off and cartwheel. and a forward roll. maybe a back bend too..but won't need it for try outs<br>  <br>  most of the stunts they do are libs, pyramids, basket tosses, sometimes scales..almost like a scorpion.  we do a lot of arabesques. also they do twist down extensions and sometimes even elevatorsrs. we do a lot of chair sits too. and sometimes do this stunt called a quarter up. i know it sounds like a lot. but its not a very big squad or school so we don't to TOO TOO much.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! :)|`|MIDJjZlqaa	1. Most likely not, it really depends on your schoool.<br>  2. If it is, most likely just a back handspring, again, depends on your schoool.<br>  3. Like the others, haha, depends on your schoool, most likely they might do liberties.  and Maybe, maybe, maybe, pyramids, but most likely not anything too hard like a scorpion.  Most freshman teams, aren't too over the top with stunts, but they try to challenge you enough to get you ready for varsity or junior varsity.|`|8M1pYeeoaa	1.yes it is<br>  <br>  2.back bends,cartweels,roundoffs,front handsprings<br>  <br>  3. if you have a skilled team then yes but for the new coming flyers they will, have you probably be doing liberties then youll work your way up<br>  good luck

plhLIIeAaa	It might be a good match, but the problem with these 4 are Henry is used too often in the title picture, and consistently lost to Matt Hardy. Christian would destroy Swagger on his own, and Finlay is a mid carder at best. I say put Tommy Dreamer in instead of Henry, and have Dreamer win, retire after the match, and then have a tournament towards the next PPV for the title.Otherwise, Dreamer's promo on I need to win the title one more time would be looked upon as a pathetic excuse for his retirement. Why put out a promo like that if the writers won't give him one more title.<br>  <br>  Boogeyman is a mid carder as well. He is there for comic relief.

ZB0ITe2Oaa	Where you play depends on how strong your arm is. Do you throw hard? If you do, you would be best either in the outfield, short stop, or third base.

p11sk9qhaa	Get a good pair of running shoes (not cross trainers) and try the Couch to 5K (C25K) program from the link below. It's a program that supposed to do exactly what it says, get someone from being a total couch potato to being able to run 5 kilometers (3.1 miles). I would suggest taking it slow like the program calls for. If you try to go out to fast, you risk injury. <br>  <br>  I know that you say you only NEED to do a mile but trust me, you'll be better off being able to do more.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|eKbWhBqIaa	just keep running until you cant not the first time you want to stop but the next time and every time after that you can run longer and longer|`|1UID5JtNaa	Two questions- do you smoke are you overweight?  Both have a dramatic affect on your ability to run.   <br>  <br>  You only need to average 9 minutes per mile, not very fast so it's a matter of improving endurance, not speed.   I'd make it a goal to cover 3 miles by using an interval program- run 2 minutes, walk 30 seconds.   When you can do that, bump it up to 3 minutes, then 4.   After that you can start going continuous as long as you can.  <br>  <br>  You also should do these workouts on a track or measured distance and wear a sports watch so you can time yourself.   It's possible that you are improving and don't even realize it. Lets say you run a mile in 10 minutes at a heart rate of 170 bts per minute.  The next week you run a mile in 9 minutes and your heart rate is still 170 beats per minute.  The effort feels the same, but you've made significant progress.  If you hadn't timed your workout on a measured distance, you'd have no idea that you got faster because effort feels the same. <br>  <br>  Keep working- it is also a good idea to cross train on a bike.  Run 3 times and no more than 4 times per week.  More than that and you run the risk of injury.   <br>  <br>  Hopefully you are not breathing in thru your nose and out your mouth- I can't tell you how many marines I've come across that were told to run that way.  Makes no sense to limit your supply of oxygen.<br>  <br>  Finally, work on your running form- you likely overstride and land on your heels out in front of your body.  Shorten your stride and land under your hips- your stride frequency should be at about 180 steps per minute.  (watch the shin split video)|`|MDQtJ0lmaa	Run for a twenty minutes everyday and then work your way (gradually) up to running for two hours. Also go to the gym and run there if you don't like the outdoors. Also try the website below!|`|GElfG0Vlaa	Forget about speed.. you need to try to run further every day. If you need to run a mile and a half at 9:15 pace then you need to train by running double that 3 miles at 10-10:15 pace|`|JCaAqF1vaa	Try building up your cardio with a spin cycle class at a gym. That will also strengthen your legs. Then mix in some long runs to build endurance.|`|tQACzIljaa	You have to set yourself small goals. Start out and run it at a normal pace and clock yourself. Match that pace for a week or so, then try to shave 15 to 30 seconds off it. Keep going in increments as long as you do it everyday you will improve.
VIfXKhmNaa	There are many exotic fish that can be found on Maui.<br>  <br>  Ahi, also known as "Yellowfin" or "Bigeye" (Because of its long bright yellow fins, and its big black eyes) is one of the most popular fish in Maui. It can weigh from 3 pounds to over 200 pounds and is a popular dish at local restaurants.<br>  <br>  Mahimahi, Also known as the dolphin fish. In the water its colors are brilliant blue and silver dappled with yellow, these fade once they’re caught. Most of the fish are between 8 and 25 pounds.<br>  <br>  Ono, commonly known as Wahoo, is a close relative of the king mackerel. Ono may grow to more than 100 pounds, but the usual size of the fish caught in Hawaii is 8 to 30 pounds. Ono is a Hawaiian word meaning "good to eat." The Ono was said by the ancient Hawaiians to be the parent of the Opelu, a mackerel scad of great importance to the subsistence of the early Hawaiians.<br>  <br>  Onaga (Also known as Ruby or Long Tailed Red Snapper) is a fish that can usually be seen during the winter time. Most of the Onaga caught off the Hawaii shoreline range in size from 1 to 18 pounds.<br>  <br>  Opakapaka (Also known as Pink snapper or Hawaiian pink snapper, as it is commonly called) has light brown to bright colored skin; however the flesh is a clear, light pink, hence, the name. Most Opakapaka taken in waters around the inhabited Hawaiian islands weigh from one to five pounds.<br>  <br>  Ulua (Also known as Pompano or, when under 12 pounds, as Papio.) Ulua can be caught by rod and reel from shore and are the most sought after inshore fish in Hawaii. <br>  <br>  That is just to name some of the major fish that can be found in Maui, but they're are plenty more to be found!<br>  <br>  Have fun! =)
AA10702710	Since it is a new rifle, it may still have some cosmoline on it from the factory.  This is what you want to do...<br>  <br>  Use a standard .22 cleaning kit and clean the bore of the gun, all the way down to the chamber area.  I recommend Hoppe's No. 9 gun cleaning solvent for this job.  Then, use some more Hoppe's No. 9 on a clean soft cotton cloth and clean around the loading port area and the bolt.  Run some dry patches down the bore and also clean the in and around the bolt and ejection port area.  Finally, use some light lubricant on the moving parts near the bolt area.<br>  <br>  Buy some different types of 22 LR ammo; Remington, Federal, Winchester.  Try the rifle again.  I have 2 of the Ruger 10/22 rifles and they pretty much shoot anything I feed them.  It could be that you just got a lemon...or that there is an issue with the magazine.  (The only problems I have had with the Ruger 10/22 were related to dirty magazines that were not feeding the rounds properly.)<br>  <br>  Lastly, you gotta love the guy on here that owns 18 of them!  I thought I was obsessive-compulsive.|`|8MUj24s6aa	Make sure it is well cleaned and make sure you are using good ammo. Go with CCI high velocity mini-mags...they work the best.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	First, disassemble it and clean the heck out of it, <br>  especially the extractor and it's groove in the breach.<br>  Follow the manual.<br>  Then polish the feed ramp of the magazine with very fine <br>  (400 grit or more) emery cloth. Don't get any of the dust <br>  into the Mag. body.<br>  The grease the inside rails of the receiver, (where the bolt 'rides'), <br>  and the spring/rod on the handle of the bolt mechanism.<br>  That should help.<br>  My 10/22 'likes' high velocity lead round-nose ammo.<br>  Try some.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	What kind of ammo are you using? I own 18 of them and have never had this problem  with one exception! I bought a bunch of bulk .22LR that came in a tin. It was not made in USA and it did not shoot for crap. Fouled everything and did not shoot in any semi auto with out jamming. <br>  <br>  Use only name brand ammo in a .22.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	Welcome to the world of the 10/22!For a reliable self-loader,Try to find a Remington 550.Tube magazine,nice wood,and a floating chamber that allows Shorts, Longs, & Long Rifle ammo to be interchangable.<br>  Mine is close to 30 years old& it's never jammed.Taken several stray dogs at over 80 yards with my old K-Mart 3-9 scope.|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	read my answer here-(7th answer down)she has the same problem as you ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgMM4jUAKdJROUc9xj8m.R3ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222125333AA3vsIz&show=7#profile-info-sRvfF732aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Lube it, if that doesn't work change ammo, if that doesn't work try another magazine|`|FhHIAbmLaa	Don't lube it. <br>  <br>  First clean it and put very very little oil on the bolt.<br>  <br>  Then try shooting CCI, or Remington Yellow Jackets.<br>  <br>  Today a lot of 22 ammo will not cycle 10-22's, as that they are a bit under powered.<br>  <br>  It is not an issue in a bolt/lever/pump gun, but may be a problem in and auto.<br>  <br>  So while you store the gun, prior to trying new quality ammo, load the mags and let them sit loaded. Sometimes the spring is so tight on a new mag,that it needs to break in a bit. If you can get a hold of an old mag, try it. If it jams then its not the mag.<br>  <br>  If this does not work, send it to Ruger. I have a 20 yr old 10-22, and a target 10-22, and both never jam on CCI stingers, or Remington Yellow jackets, or Remington Vipers; Vipers seem to shoot the best from all my .22s.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|0TuWYaneaa	My first guess is the ammo your using.Most autos don't like hollow points or all lead heads.Try using some gun scrubber in the ejection port to clean any debris it may have gotten from previous jams.Then go get some Remington full metal jackets and try them.I've found that Remington ammo works the best in most firearms,especially my older ones with a lot of wear an tear.If it still persist I would contact Ruger and have it fixed.One thing I've found out about rugers is that they don't like cheap ammo.|`|AA12211483	When purchasing a new firearm yu shuld always clean it and lube it and break it down BEFORE you take it to the range.  You then need to shoot a round and clean, then 5 rnds. and clean, 5rnds and clean, repeat ten times.  Thats how you break in a rifle barrel.  Good luck.|`|AA10200748	This is a rarity indeed. Rugers are known for their super reliability.  Try other ammo. If bad ammo is not the case, send the gun back to Ruger. They will fix it free, and get it back to you right away.|`|KQYFZWD6aa	You are probably shooting  cheap winchesters or cheap federals.

mnahpvtOaa	The mah of a battery has nothing to do with the ROF, but the voltage does. So the 11.1v will have a higher ROF, then only downside is that if you don't have extremely strong internals it will blow all of them and it will be very costly to replace. So if it's a stock gun: go with the 9.6v battery, if they are not stock go with the 11.1v battery.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

DG67iN4Haa	I'd have to say Boston this year. They're getting the best goaltending statistics all around the league with probably the best two-man tandem right now, have stronger depth than even Detroit, have a play-maker arguably as talented as Joe Thornton in Marc Savard, a Norris and Hart trophy candidate in Zdeno Chara, and are full of young talent to keep them strong for years in guys like Lucic, Krejci, Wheeler and more.|`|GMA9erCDaa	I think that Detroit has the edge because of experience and all the offensive weapons.  It is surprising how poorly Detroit has played defensively so far this season, but you see glimpses of their capabilities in key games.  I think the defense will tighten up and when they get past February's doldrums they will be really tough.|`|jBXutMblaa	Well I'm biased and saying the Caps.  They have a lot of depth in Hershey players, and whenever a guy's recalled, it's an easier transition because they play with the same system as the Caps do and Bruce knows most of the guys' tendencies.  We have Ovechkin, Backstrom, Green, and Semin.

Ice hockey goalie equipment is much more durable and thicker to absorb the force of a heavier puck.

I f he went to the Braves he  would have to play the field, because there is no DH. But with the Mariners he can play the outfield, but also be DH.

AA12370193	ahh its good to hear some praise about Eboue in his natural position rather than just saying he is crap get rid of him. As I watched the game yesterday and saw how poor Sagna is getting forward I couldn't help but wish it was Eboue instead. <br>  We should not get rid of him by any means whatsoever, cause say Sagna gets injured, who's his replacement RB?<br>  As you say we should keep him and switch between he and Sagna depending on the type of team we are playing against. For opponents like Chelsea, Man Utd and Europe Sagna will be better defending against strong wingers. But against the smaller clubs Eboue would be much more effective offensively helping earn us more shots at goal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  @Earshot, for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2EeVnS9WP8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2EeVnS9W...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pm09dT2Lwg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pm09dT2L...</a><br>  Eboue kicked "Invincibles" Lauren to Portsmouth, ok. I don't believe I need to say anything more. <br>  Unless you want to hear me say he is better than Neville/Rafael, I don't even know who Villa's or Everton's Right backs are but they are nobody worth mentioning, and Bosingwa has never did strike me as anything special, he only started due to Scolari.|`|7Xridrxaaa	he isnt that bad on the right wing either. Defensively speaking he shut down C Ronaldo everytime we played Manchester United. I think we should keep him. His problem is that he is a diver and commits stupid fouls. If somehow he manages to fix that. He can be a good player. He is a good benchwarmer and somebody we could bring in when we are winning games.|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	I know you'll be shocked but i would play him at rb instead of sagna... the first season sagna was brilliant but now I'm not impressed at all he hardly gets forward and when he does his final ball is rubbish, at least Eboue tries.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	Yes i agree hes a defender not a winger.

Eboue was quality at RB and now he's pants according to Arsenal fans. I think he could do a job at RB at another club. I'll swap you Arbeloa for Eboue...heck, I'll even throw in Dossena and Lucas. What do you say? ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: You can have Lucas, if it's a midfielder you're looking for ;-)|`|iQvkT8Doaa	Right back, OK. But anywhere else,no. I don't want to see that muppet on the field ever again. Some good news, Rosicky, Cesc & Theo will be back in 4 weeks time. <br>  <br>  Chig I have the same question to ask from you and Wenger, do you think Eboue would EVER get a start at clubs like Chelsea, Man Utd, Villa, Everton ? Jesus the guy turns out to be a f*cking embaressment on the pitch and I don't want to see him ever, again. Buy Delap for ￡1.5 mil or something I'll be happy

qO7nbSQVaa	It is the Liverpool way|`|aGXankr2aa	They've improved year on year since Rafa took over, they are now 8 points and 2 places better off than last year.<br>  <br>  Ferguson's first 5 years at Manchester United, 11th, 2nd, 11th, 13th, 6th.<br>  <br>  It took SAF 7 years before he rebuilt Manchester United into a championship winning team, Rafa has been at Anfield for 4 1/2 years.  Ferguson won 2 trophies in his first 5 years, 1 FA Cup and 1 Cup Winners Cup, very similar to Rafa's 1 FA Cup and 1 Champions league.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Poor management, weak squad and obsolete tactics.|`|nwwhfuADaa	cause that is the characteristic of an inconsistent team|`|AA10291522	Because they lack the experience of competing for the title; Liverpool is not used to the pressure, whereas teams like United and Chelsea are. Apart from lacking any experience--it's been what, 20 years since they've won the title?--Liverpool is seriously lacking in squad depth. Now don't get me wrong, Liverpool are a decent side (this is coming from a United fan), but they rely WAY too much on Stevie G. and Fernando Torres (both of whom I like and respect) to bail them out of bad situations--you take both those players out, and Liverpool will inevitably struggle (even with the likes of Kuyt, Babel, Benayoun, and Alonso as back up). Even if you were to remove to two best players from United or Chelsea, there are still enough players (QUALITY players, both young and old) to get the job done. When Rooney was injured, Carlos Tevez--a player who, in my opinion, is as good as Rooney--came in and took care of business (even if it led to 1-0 victories, 3 points are still 3 points, right?)<br>  <br>  So, my point? Liverpool need to strengthen their squad in several areas. Selling Keane, in my opinion, was an unwise move on Rafa's part. Oh, and speaking of Rafa, they may want to sack him, too: his antics are only adding more pressure on a cracking Liverpool side--a side that needs inspiration as soon as possible.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Because Rafa feeds them too much from his caff|`|EIsnATLxaa	They aren't consistent enough....its been so long they cant handle the pressure

ozVqauMXaa	Sizemore is an ELITE outfielder in fantasy...grab him while you can.  Hunter is nice, but is getting old.  Lowe and Pettite would be a wash.  What Pettite won't get you in Ks, he'll get in wins pitching for the Yanks.  You are stealing Sizemore in this trade.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	you do have enough quality SP but i don't know your OF. with sizemore you're getting .300 average along with at least 30 HRs and 90+ RBIs. Hunter is also on the decline. I would make this trade.|`|5R8ciX8raa	Yes no question|`|eFQXl7uyaa	I would do the trade. It's easy to replace Lowe. Most leagues I have seen there are still a couple of quality starters left that are capable of putting together 11-12 wins, which is about all you are going to get out of Lowe. Pettite is too inconsistent to rely on full time - he's all over the board, he will shutout Boston on Monday and give 7 runs in 3 innings to Baltimore on Saturday. Jair Jurrjens should give you about 18 quality starts as well. You can dig pretty deep and get solid production or speculate a little with guys like Mark Buehrle or Aaron Cook.|`|AA12253571	No question.  Two mediocre players for one great one is always a good deal.|`|6kNXhPH6aa	no doubt about it...100%...make this trade|`|rvyvF3KAaa	I would definitely do the trade. Sizemore is one of the best players in the league because he can steal bases and hit homers. Hunter and lowe are good players, but if Pettite is available, it's worth it.|`|7sI4TtEIaa	hurry and make that trade.  sizemore is awesome!

jIONJZSJaa	Vince Young in two full seasons as a starter turned the ball over too much.  In 2006 he completed barely half his passes (51.5%), threw 12 TD passes to 13 INTS, with 3 lost fumbles.  Granted in 2007, his completion percentage improved (62.3%), but he turned the ball over even more: 9 TD passes, 17 INTS, with 3 fumbles lost.  And he basically started the 2008 season the same way.  Kerry Collins was able to hold on to that job simply because he didn't put his team in bad situations or made a ton of turnovers.  Until Vince Young can prove he can do that on a consistant basis, he won't be starting in the NFL anytime soon.|`|AA12103453	I won't eat my words. My words are he wasn't ready for the NFL, and he PROVED it. First off he wasn't that great as a passer. Second he got booed and cried and his mommy came to his defense. That shows EVERYONE he wasn't ready to be an NFL QB. He was protected in college and got welcomed to the NFL. Maybe now coaches will stop telling reporters not to call the QB soft.|`|7V79OMMHaa	Honestly, what he will more than likely have to face a great pass defense, and the pressure will cause him to want to kill himself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stay Cool|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I hear you.  Its never enough with most people.  The wagon comes and goes. Another example...............Vick went into Lambeau and beat the Pack in the playoffs and also made the Pro Bowl.   People say he sucks simply because of what he did off field.  That makes NO sense to me.|`|91vuNupCaa	Kerry Collins did a great job.  There is no reason to believe that he will lose the job to Young who does not appear to have the maturity, temperament or ability to play under pressure like Collins does.|`|JTSNljLhaa	lol|`|tzrLDbHWaa	You could very well be right, but I don't see it happening.  I mean Kerry Collins was far from spectacular last season, he wasn't even that good, but he kinda reminded me of Ben Roethlisberger in his first SB run.  By that, I mean be a part of a team with an amazing running game that pretty much tells you to go out there and not lose the game for the team.  Collins did that, only throwing 7 picks all season and having one of the lowest INT% in the league.  He doesn't really help them win games all that much, he just doesn't lose them.<br>  <br>  Vince Young may have a chance to win his job back, seeing that Collins is 36 and wasn't very impressive last season.  Young even completes a higher % of passes than Collins.  The problem.  Young has NEVER in his pro career, thrown more TDs than INTs.  His high amount of INTs means he's more likely to lose the game for the Titans, and when you have 2 beasts running the ball, you want to give them a chance to score, and they can't do that when you're throwing picks all the time.  Even in college he threw the pick more often than his counterparts.<br>  <br>  Now, I see the Titans as wanting to do the same thing they did last year, and thats run the ball and ask your QB to not lose the game for you.  While Vince Young may have matured and may be able to bounce back, when looking at his career as a whole, he is prone to throw a lot of INTs, and if your gameplan is to run the ball and have a QB who wont lose the game for you, Collins is the obvious choice.  Young has more upside, but they're looking for the safe pick, and thats going to be Collins.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	He deserves another chance he just had some personal problems he had to take care of.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	i think vince should be the titans starter, that way the titans wont win the afc south.

By the way, I am a Braves fan so no bias here.<br>  <br>  On to A-rod and the hate he recieves from all the other posters here. Just because the guy took steroids in 2003 and 2004 doesn't mean he isn't a good player. Steroids help you recover faster. The last 5 years from what I believe as drug testing has been pretty trustworthy, he hasn't used roids. A-rod is a good ball player and a good hitter.

TAKE A LESSON!<br>  The majority of people who don't take lessons end up hating skiing and getting frustrated because they aren't getting any better and then never ski again.  While your friend may be able to teach you, you are much better off in a lesson.  You will get better faster and have more fun.  You can suggest that you and your other friend take a lesson so that your expert friend can have a little time to do some tougher slopes before they are confined to the bunny slope with you guys.<br>  <br>  My biggest tips:<br>  -keep your weight in front and your skins touching the front of your boot.  It won't make you go faster as long as you know how to stop <br>  ,which you will learn.  <br>  -DON'T use poles.  They are used for Parallel turning which you won't even start to learn on your first day.  It's really dangerous for a beginner to use poles and they are just 2 more things for you to worry about.  They will be flying in all directions.  <br>  -TURN!!!  It will always make you slow down and it will be 10 times easier on your legs.<br>  <br>  <br>  In my opinion falling on skis isn't that bad because they just pop off your feet.  I fall all the time when im racing and I have never had a serious injury.<br>  But that said, be careful!  And watch out for other people.<br>  <br>  Have Fun!  I hope you love skiing!|`|d1475d20ddab3186851b941a0dfec528aa	There isn't really any way to describe skiing - you have to do it and get a feel for it. Expect that you may fall a few times, but that's how you learn. When my dad was teaching me how to ski, I was sometimes afraid to do anything too tricky so that I wouldn't fall, but he pointed out that falling is good because it means you're learning and pushing yourself to get better. <br>  <br>  Just start out on the easy runs until you are comfortable. After awhile I bet you'll get bored with the bunny runs and want to try something faster.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Save the friendship and take a set of lessons from a qualified professional instructor. They are trained to teach you to ski safely and as fast as you can learn.  Unless your friendship is something you and she are willing to throw away, take the lessons.  Get the smallest boots you can fit your foot in without extreme pain. Be certain the boots are tight around your foot and ankle.  Save the friendship take some lessons. <br>  The tricks I do on skis include on snow spins at a medium speed, linked down the hill. I dance on skis, mambo, charleston and  short swing.  Also  Reuel Christies in a spread position.|`|qyATAaeXaa	Good skiers do not mean good teachers, especially 14 year olds. Your friend may be a great skier, but most likely lacks the patience and teaching skills to do you and your other friends much good. <br>  <br>  Friendships are great things, don't wreck one by putting stress on it from a bad skiing experience.<br>  <br>  Just get some lessons. Sure, it costs a few more dollars but it will let her get out on the expert terrain for some of her own fun and it will give you some time to focus on the basics. After your lesson, you can join up and stick to some easier terrain.

Well, as long as your best is better than everyone else's.<br>  <br>  The NBA is no different than any other sport.  The NFL has a Super Bowl MVP, which is pretty much play your best in one game, which is also like all of the All Star game MVPs.  Baseball and hockey also have their finals MVPs, though I prefer the NHLs version, since its the MVP of the entire playoffs, not just the finals, and since the playoffs are essentially like another season, its fitting.

This stuff needs to be addressed. I work in a school environment and have also worked with my kids middle school in developing and implementing a bullying policy. If your school does not has a Respect program shame on them. <br>  <br>  Also, my recommendation to you would be to get involved in a martial arts program either at the YMCA or at a local dojo.

It is but water to a duck, and he had the good sense to quote DH Lawrance.  I am tall, and was very thin when in school.  I got teased bad, with terms like "stickman" and of course much worse.  When I turned in to an adult I also turned into a karate teacher, and the teasing just became different.  The kids picking on you have "issues" of their own, and are making you a part of that.  It has no more meaning to you than you assign to it unless it is physical, in which case it isn't "picking-on", it is assault. Grow thick enough skin for it to run off like the duck that was wisely suggested.   boker_magnum makes an excellent point also, quell any chance of such a rumor by talking to your counselor.  J|`|AA11729094	Go talk to the schools guidance counselor and explain to him what is going on, in advance of some school rumor starting about you bringing a gun to school.

Explain to him, that in todays world where school shootings are very real, you feel that anyone who jokes about such things is probably more apt to bring a gun to school than anyone else.
PvIFahGjaa	Attend as many showcases and camps as you can. Go to camps that have college and professional scouts and coaches. I went to one earlier this year and there are college coaches and scouts all over the place watching you field, hit, throw and everything. Also if you want to you can send a video of you playing to a college that you are interested in or invite the coach to come watch you play in one of your highschool games. And whenever you are playing in a game or even at practice, never mess around too much. You still want to have fun but be serious because you really never know whos watching you. Scouts just look like regular people and they'll just wear regular clothes. So in pregame warm ups don't go easy and lazy. Do it just like you would in the game. If you are taking groundballs between innings throw the ball hard to the first baseman. Dont lob it over there just because its warm ups. And make sure you arnt wearing your hat backwards with messed up pants and your shirt untucked. Look like a baseball player. Scouts even watch what you do on the on-deck circle. Observe the pitcher and get your timing down and watch the pattern of pitches he throws. <br>  <br>  Remember, whenever you can go to showcases and camps, go to them. Get your name out there. Make your name be heard.You'd be surprised how many coaches communicate and talk with each other from different colleges all over the country.|`|gMTatFZBaa	Neither college or the MLB looks at 15 year old sophomores. Get a clue.|`|02hspQaBaa	Most people think that going to a big school gets you a better chance of being noticed.  This isn't always true.  Talk to your coaches because they are the one's that recomend you to colleges.  Talk to other admins of your school for college info and then find a school you'd like to go and on a college day, speak about your intrest in baseball.|`|xpR64O9Maa	There is almost no way that someone could tell if you could be a professional some day... my advice is to play on select teams and they will get your name out to colleges far better than your high school team will.  I have had friends that were phenoms in high school that ended up not playing well in college and not even making it to the pros.  Just work hard and let everything else fall into place.|`|wFzW3Aqvaa	Well at one of your games a college scout or something like that should come and watch you play and then the person can see if your good enough for college|`|iYc1HLmmaa	Start sucking penis's boy.<br>  <br>  :)|`|QSpPxc6kaa	i am in the same boat as you, just i play 3rd and pitcher, and i am 5'11" 180 running a 4.8. One thing you may want to work on is your speed which is completley do-able. If you can place yourself into a good agility prgram you will rapidly see improvement. i did this and went from a 5.2 down to a 4.8 40-yard dash in a matter of months. If you can participate in local showcases do that, i know alot of scouts show up to those. Also, try to get onto a summer baseball team that will take part in showcase turniments. This is a very good way to get noticed, infact this past summer my best friend got noticed by the Cinncinatti Reds organization. I am lucky enough to play on a team coached by John Carter who was the number 2 prospect in all of baseball behind manny ramierez in his draft class, so he has good hook ups. I wish you the best of luck and hope you take my advice seriously.

If his little "I'm sorry and it'll never happen again." speech gets him off the hook, it sends a bad message.  He's a criminal and that's the bottom line.  If you or anyone gets pulled over, you can't just say sorry and get away with it.  There needs to be some consequences.  And who knows what els he does.  Did he really win those medals naturally?  Now we don't know.|`|QgD4Cbb7aa	No Michael Phelps doing pot so what Obama did crack.|`|AA11626262	I don't know if it's really a big deal. How many people smoke pot every day? Yeah exactly. For him though, it's foolish considering what a popular public figure he is now. He's correct in saying that it was bad judgement. If he cared about his reputation, he should know better than to do something that naturally is going to cause conflict.|`|rZV2cUhdaa	no michael smoking pot is not a big deal at all. about 80% of people i know in their 20's have at least tried weed once. who freaking cares if he got high? its not like its personally affecting our lives. people just need to get over it and stop constantly trying to criticize and find dirt on people in the limelight.|`|pF63IMyVaa	who gives a rats ***. he smoked pot.

YrxLbfiIaa	No --- and lets be real here.... There are millions of firearms owners in this country and few to almost none of the millions let there children have free access to them.....<br>  <br>  Of course the liberal media will try to spin this as an epidemic problem when there isn't one......|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	No.<br>  I do believe that kids should be able to shoot guns with parent standing right next to them, or they are trusted.<br>  But having free access to a firearm, absolutely not. My dad owns firearms but I don't have instant access to them. They are in a gun safe and the Ammo is put outside in a cabinet I do know where the key's are but I don't plan on shooting anyone or anything in city limits. <br>  And whoever told that child that he can shoot whenever he wants is a dumb ***.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	No, and no parent should give a child unrestricted access to firearms and ammo.  Most states (like FLA) have a law about adults being responsible for children's safety, and here in Florida there are laws that actually mention firearms.  <br>  <br>  It's a crime in Florida to give a child access to guns and ammo without supervision.  However, in ten years, I've never even heard, much less read, about any adult being charged with a crime when a kid used a gun.|`|vea6mqPZaa	This is where most laws play so they can get passed.<br>  <br>  Yes, kids should be allowed access to firearms just as much as they should be allowed access to the keys to your truck.<br>  <br>  My kid goes shooting or hunting anytime she wants as long has she asks me.<br>  <br>  There are a few stipulations.<br>  1 - She is not grounded<br>  2 - She has her room clean<br>  3 - She asks, and I get her rifle or revolver out of the safe<br>  <br>  Other than that there needs to be some ( age appropriate ) supervision.<br>  <br>  -------------------<br>  Adding an example<br>  Last night my 10yr old daughter was at a friends house, who also has a range, shooting her rifle with her friend and her friends father. On her way home she was walking down the street with her rifle and her range bag. She was stopped by the sheriff and asked why she had the rifle. She told him why and he followed her to the house, asked if I knew she had it, I said yes. He and I chit chatted for a few and he left.<br>  <br>  Got to love Texas|`|fUDlbOP0aa	if my child was mature and responsible enough to use a firearm safely, I don't see why my children may not have access to firearms. <br>  <br>  now, if i had children, I would consider letting them have guns of they show an interest and they understand what guns are and how to use them safely. also I would live in a state without nosy people forcing laws to micromanage other people's lives; forcing their opinions as a law to control other people's lives. <br>  <br>  generally home shootings are accidental or the parents has failed to properly store firearms in the house of a child that has not learned firearm safety or proper use. <br>  <br>  In California if you live in a city giving children (anyone under 18) a firearm is an absolute no-no. In a another state where people are different, doing the same exact thing is an accepted norm. To some people from their background to them its if wrong. to others its is right, and for some its a family tradition of some kind. For me, I keep an open mind and make my own decision, most people in my area would say its illegal and irresponsible, I say the opposite.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	No. Children should only have access to firearms via an adult.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Depends on the kid, not so much age, but maturity.  There are adults that shouldn't have firearms after all.  While access to the firearm, ei in his/her room, doesn't mean ammunition would have to be present.  If the firearm "belongs" to the kid his is responsible for the care of the firearm so why wouldn't he/she have access to it. <br>  <br>  Legal stand point depends on what state your in and what laws are in place forcing one to lock up or secure firearms.  <br>  <br>  I ask you this, "If the step mom was stabbed to death, would you want the child's access to kitchen knifes blocked?"|`|CoAvkZpraa	i am 14 and have had a small rifle of my own (.22) since i was 12 and i have recently aquired a shotgun and a high powerd rifle. i believe that a youth should be given the responsibility and honer of using a rifle. but i believe that a parent should judge wether the child has common sence and is responcible and mature enough to even hold a firearm. and the person should have much quality practice and safty talks and experiance with a elder who has knowledge on the topic.<br>  <br>  youth have to know that once you screw up someone might not have a dad anymore or a sister etc. firearms are made to kill and they should be treated as if they are loaded all the time. no exceptions.|`|KQYFZWD6aa	You better believe they need to have guns. Because thats how they get good with them and would be less likely to have accidents. I have slept with guns in the bed with me for the past 8 years and i am only twenty and as long as you can tell if there is one in the chamber of not you are good to go. Now if someone is aiming guns at people or doing that kind of mess then I dont think it is a good idea. Alcohol is also not a good combination.|`|52ML3pmSaa	I'm 15. What if a family member was attacked by someone who was robbing the house? Shouldn't I have a gun? I do, my home defense pistol is a RIA 1911 in the massive .38super. I practice twice a week with it, reload my own ammo, clean my own guns, and repair minor problems. Sure, my dad has guns, but the family thinks it's better to have me "someone who treats guns with uppermost respect", diagnose problems and store them.|`|JnUPvuvRaa	No way. I keep all guns, even pellet guns locked in my safe. My 16 year old has been shooting with me for 6+ years. If not with me, with another adult, like his air rifle JROTC instructor. He is a good shot. He is very responsible. If he does something stupid, its on me. I'm not going to let that happen. If he wants to be stupid when he's 18, then he can go to jail and/or court, not me!|`|bgxYKsGiaa	hey im 14 and i live by my gun we live in the backwoods of Tennessee and we usually eat what we kill and i keep my gun loaded all the time and i carry a revolver on my side <br>  but you need to teach kids how to use them like we do|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I have had access to guns for as long as I can remember and I have not shot anyone, save with a paintball gun but that does not count. I have two bolt actions and a shotgun on my gun rack and no one was hurt|`|OrvTG44laa	Kids should be able to use guns.  But no, they should not have unlimited access.  For example, the ammo and gun should have been in separate safes.|`|CbbVUB4Waa	I am a parent and i enjoy shooting my firearms but i think that when it comes to a child they should be taught to respect what a firearm is capableof. As far as letting them keep them in there room that is up to the parent but when doing so that is putting aallotof faith in such a uinexperienced mind. I do believe that a perent should oversee evertime that a child has a gun in there possession, and should watch in the manner that it is being used and correct the use if necessary but i am just one parent from the south and not everyone thinks the same way that i do.
AA10702710	Those all look like pretty decent knives for the price.  As you already know, you get what you pay for.  I have to admit, I own a few cheapies myself.  Harbour Freight Tools sells them around here for about $8.<br>  <br>  One of the best survifal knives I ever saw, years before the Rambo movies came-out, was the Marine Corps 7 inch fighting knife by KaBar. (Get the KaBar and not the Camillus.  The KaBar is heavier.)<br>  <br>  Look around locally and see if any sport shops sell the same things to save on shipping costs.  Like I said, my local Harbour Freight store sells them and they are ok for the $8.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Jesus, Junior!!! How many times are you going to ask this friggin' question!?

No hunter really uses one of those.  They are for kids and guys who are wanna be's.  Here's what to look for in a good knife.  Carbon steel is best for taking and keeping a sharp edge but they will rust so you need to keep a coat of oil on them.  You will see stainless steel knives, there are numerous variates of stainless.  The cheap stainless knives are hard to sharpen, bend easy and are inferior to higher quality steels.  Look for blades marked 440c at minimum, the blades marked "surgical" and 440 are usually just for looks.  For hunting purposes a skinning style that is 4 to 5 inches works well, anything bigger becomes cumbersome when cleaning game.  Good luck.|`|CutogVC1aa	If you have to choose one of those knifes go for one or three, never get a hollow handle knife, there's a good chance that they will break there if too much for is one the knife, you want a full tang blade, meaning that the blade is one solid piece of metal and runs into the handle. My advise, go surplus, like this.<a href="http://www.campingsurvival.com/noname15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.campingsurvival.com/noname15....</a> or <a href="http://www.campingsurvival.com/gipilsurknif.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.campingsurvival.com/gipilsurk...</a> idk why there's a price difference but there is between the two. There the same knife. for a survival knife you want it to be high carbon steel or harden stainless steel for strength and able to sharpen and keep a point, either a drop-point or a clip-point blade tip and a saw back, like the knife in the link. a U.S.A.F Pilot Survival Knife.
0Dm3WEMcaa	We all ignored the "don't try this" adverts when we where younger right? i got sent home from school once for taking a powerbomb on a concrete floor, not my smartest moment. I have seen little to say they are aiming at kids though, Hornswoggle is really the only thing for me, what i see is a promotion that has got more mature which in turn makes it more kid friendly. When the action is put into context, which any parent should do if they are letting them watch it, i don't see a problem with that.  it's only kid friendly in a non swearing and half naked women sense not a lot else has changed.|`|JiCfYfLraa	because kids always buy there merchandise. you see the teenagers and the adults are smart we watch wrestling we dont give a damn about the merchandise. so the teens and the adults not buying the merchandise were causing the wwe to lose money especially with the economy being bad and the budget cuts so the wwe started to brainwash children to get the kids to buy there stuff. kids being wwe addicts and john cena fans forcing whining and complaining to there parents "MOMMY DADDY BUY ME THAT BUY ME THAT!!!!!

fbab15f26e728d911d457229472e3429aa	Well, the rule isn't that the player has to go to college. The rule is he has to be either 19 years old and 1 year removed from graduating high school. So you don't have to go to college necessarily. You can go to college, go to a junior college, play overseas if you get a contract, just wait it out chillin, or (and to answer your question) play in the D-League.<br>  <br>  (Remember Brandon Jennings last year? He was considering playing in the D-League before he went to play overseas. )|`|l0iCqzlQaa	well regis, i would like to ask the audience|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	yes i heard about that to that rule is kinda good to have because some kids wouldnt even go to college so they go and get an education but no not the d league either they have to go to college|`|Lnsm1rm4aa	I think the answer to that is no!

There are also what is called a butterfly knife. The actually have to be opened by a quick play of the handles. But the one that opens with a push of a button is called a switch blade.

ySFQ2TDWaa	Practice every day|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	There are many philosphies on how to throw harder.  I believe core strenght is your starting point.  It is the hub and your arms and legs are the spokes.  From there leg power is important (plyometrics).  And throwing the ball hard and far everytime you throw is important.  Genetics may have something to do with it also.  When you throw also try and put as much back spin on the ball as possible as it releases from your hand.  More spin means more velocity.|`|qIrumd2Gaa	If you want to pitch faster in baseball the best thing to do is run a lot and get your legs strong. The reason it is so difficult to be a pitcher is because pitching requires your whole body's strength for one throw; and push and extension that the pitcher does of the mound with his legs is something that helps a lot with your velocity. So run a lot and practice you push off the mound to increase your speed.

tzrLDbHWaa	He's had a long line of problems.  After the national championship game that he won against Miami, there were a lot of talks that he was getting special treatment in classes when a teaching assistant told reporters that he was being treated special because of who he was.<br>  <br>  Following that, he was suspended for several reasons related to a false police report he filed.  He had said that over $10,000 worth of clothes, CDs, stereo equipment and other stuff was stolen from a car he was using while on campus.  That brought up questions of how a college athlete who isn't supposed to be getting money or gifts from anyone, would have $10,000 worth of stuff in the car.  It was later discovered that he lied about the value of the items.  Furthermore, there was talk that the fact that a local dealership let Clarett borrow that car he was using could be an NCAA violation, since car dealerships aren't generally in the business of just lending out cars they're trying to sell, and that it was a perk for being OSU's star athlete.  <br>  <br>  Clarett did try to sue the NFL to get in to the draft, since he didn't qualify by their rule that you have to be out of high school for 3 years.  He did win, but the decision was overturned on appeal.  He eventually waited his turn and entered the draft, but was VERY slow in the 40 then just decided that he wouldnt work out anymore.  He was drafted, but came to camp overweight and was awful.<br>  <br>  As for his arrest, he was originally arrested for armed robbery.  During his trial, while out on bond, he was arrested again for making an illegal U-turn and evading arrest and leading the police on a chase that only ended after a police road block stopped him.  They found a katana, a loaded ak-47 and open bottles of alcohol in the car and had to subdue him with mace (they tried tasers, but they didnt work because he was wearing body armor).  With the new charges on top of the armed robbery charge, he made a plea bargain since he was pretty much SOL otherwise.|`|nDzenpkwaa	I don't know but that guy really f'd up his life...<br>  <br>  I remember him in college, he was amazing!|`|fcb1efacb648b3f1b1c0eff5cf18ba7daa	Why was he suspended?<br>  <br>  Basically because he was stupid.

42ef902b67cef343060a46d1d7776268aa	PRINCETON, N.J. – The ECHL announced that the Board of Governors approved a revision to the Kelly Cup Playoffs format for the National Conference and the South Division in the American Conference at its Mid-Season Meeting in Reading, Pa. on Wednesday. <br>  <br>  If the fifth-place team in the West Division has a greater winning percentage than the fourth-place team in the Pacific Division then the fifth-place team in the West Division will become the fourth seed in the Pacific Division. <br>  <br>  It was also announced that the Kelly Cup Playoff participants in the South Division will be determined by winning percentage instead of points. <br>  <br>  The tiebreaker for the National Conference and the South Division if two teams tie will be: 1. Points, head-to-head; 2. Wins, head-to-head; 3. Goal Differential, head-to-head; 4. Coin Toss. <br>  <br>  The tiebreaker for the National Conference and the South Division if three teams are tied will be: 1. Winning percentage, games between the teams; 2. Goal differential, games between the teams; 3. Winning percentage, division; 4. Winning percentage, conference; 5. Coin toss. When two teams remain after the third or other teams are eliminated during any step above, the tiebreaker reverts to Step 1 of the two-team format. <br>  <br>  The Kelly Cup Playoff participants in the North Division will still be determined by points and there were not any changes made to the tiebreaker for the North Division. <br>  <br>  The Division Semifinals will have the first seed meeting the fourth seed and the second seed meeting the third seed in a best-of-seven series. <br>  <br>  The winners of the Division Semifinals will advance to the Division Finals which is a best-of-seven series. <br>  <br>  The winner of the American Conference and the winner of the National Conference will meet in the Kelly Cup Finals, a best-of-seven game series. <br>  <br>  Home-ice advantage will be determined by regular season winning percentage. <br>  <br>  2009 Kelly Cup Playoffs Format<br>  <br>  Division Semifinals (Best-of-Seven Series) <br>  No. 1 Seed (Division Winner) vs. No. 4 Seed<br>  No. 2 Seed vs. No. 3 Seed<br>  <br>  Division Finals (Best-of-Seven Series) <br>  Semifinals Winner vs. Semifinals Winner<br>  <br>  Conference Finals (Best-of-Seven Series) <br>  Division Winner vs. Division Winner<br>  <br>  2009 Kelly Cup Finals (Best-of-Seven Series) <br>  National Conference Champion vs. American Conference Champion<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  So if that's the same as the NHL, yes...if not, no.

AA11729094	I have several mosins, only 2 of which are exceptionally accurate, one is a finn m39, the other is a tula m44. I have a yugo M59 thats accurate out to 200 meters, hitting 8 out of 10 shots on a 10 inch steel circle. I also have a couple yugo m59/66's that are 3moa at 100 meters!|`|U0Rvsabdaa	The Mosin. Closed bolt has advantages over semi-auto.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The Mosin is more accurate...... The SKS uses a 7.62X39MM cartridge which is accurate but only to about 200 yards and in an SKS about 100 yards......<br>  <br>  The Mosin uses a 7.62X54MM cartridge which has more than triple the reach (with associated recoil) but in the Mosin I find its more accurate at longer distances.....<br>  <br>  Both rifles are what I call minute of paper plate accurate but the Mosin Nagant has a bit more accuracy at longer distances.....|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Neither are considered very good quality guns.  Both or sort of throw away type guns.  But....unless I'm wrong (which could be the case) isn't the nagant a bolt action rifle?  If that the case then it will be more accurate since no gas is used in ejecting the spend cartridge and piping another.  Hence it will be more consistent.|`|AA12034449	either will be well within the expectations of service grade rifles.<br>  <br>  I would not expect to win a shooting contest against Sprinfeilds Garands or most Lee Enfeilds with a Russian style rifle... but you could hold your own.|`|QNX9NET3aa	I would say the Nagant is more accurate. Neither is a target gun but some Nagants can shoot pretty well. The Russian arms tend to exhibit a degree of variable quality not seen in most other guns.|`|kvWSrGBMaa	I general bolt action rifles are more accurate. The Moisin Nagant is a bolt action rifle. Additionally the Russians used the 91/30 model as a sniper rifle during WWII. An SKS has not been used as a sniper rifle.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	mosin. higher velocity cartridge, bolt action. course, the condition of either individual weapon will have more to do with it.|`|AA12211483	Mosin Nagant
YrxLbfiIaa	Better? ---- Not sure --- I purchased the M44 because its shorter......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosin-Nagant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosin-Nagan...</a>|`|U0Rvsabdaa	The best Mosin is a 91/59. These were 91/30 rifles cut down and issued to Border Guards after the war. They have a well-deserved reputation for accuracy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I do love my M91/30 though, more so than my M44. You can't go wrong with a Tula 91/30. A 91/59 is just better.|`|JnUPvuvRaa	The one that isn't a worn out piece of junk. Seriously, they have 1000's of rounds through them. A young one is 60 years old. Most have seen better days. Spend $100 more on a new Stevens short action 200 in .308 or .243 it is much better than a worn out Russian rifle.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	I like my M44,because it's a carbine,easy to carry thru the woods.The accuracy is excellent out to 200 yards.Only drawback is recoil(a bit <br>  on the heavy side) and the God-awful muzzle blast.But it's a damn-fine rifle....at only $90.00.|`|VLXFPMOqaa	its actually a 91/30 and it could be considered better as its longer thus more accurate (genarlly) it also recoils less. <br>  <br>  m44 is more handy though
YrxLbfiIaa	If shots are going to be at closer ranges then forget the scope..... For longer distances then put a scope on if you can..... Sight it in at 100 yards...|`|U0Rvsabdaa	You could. But make sure its a scout mount that doesn't harm the rifle.|`|L8I2D74yaa	yes, i do believe that using a nagant would be a decent deer rifle. it is cheap and the ammo is cheap. if you find a round that the rifle likes to shoot and you can get good groups then go for it. if the shots are at a closer range then you can skip the scope of you want. the nagant will easily bring down a deer.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I use my scoped nagant for deer duty and it performs admirably and the mount still allows you to use the open sights.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Sure thing. There are plenty of MNs out there that are quite accurate and perfect for deer hunting.|`|AA12211483	sure!!|`|7UbfExoKaa	It's definitely a cheap way to get a hunting rifle.<br>  <br>  I've seen some very accurate 91/30s that I wouldn't hesitate to use for hunting, but I've also seen some that couldn't keep all the shots on a 3' x3' target at 200 yards. <br>  <br>  If you've got a decent Mosin, and have found a suitable hunting round that it shoots well with, why not?<br>  <br>  Just remember that that there are other more modern rifles that can probably do the job better.

xgBNImTHaa	yea|`|7Vka1VcOaa	I guess I'd be curious to know what position you'll be playing down the road when you're fully grown. You're already a pretty good size for 13. And you'll probably get stronger naturally as you grow, even without going overboard with a ton of weight training. In time, you might find that throwing the football (and trying to break records in the 40-yd. dash) might be de-emphasized. You might fill out to be a D- or O-lineman.|`|GpX3R4reaa	well first off, these stats are pretty impressive for someone who is thirteen. the first thing to do to increase your speed is work on explosiveness...this could be done by using a harness and running as hard as you can while dragging someone behind you or some weights...you can buy a parachute at any local sporting goods store to help with the resistance running...after that, just run more often. then to increase your triceps do dips, these are the best exercise to increase tricep strength.|`|WdzACevnaa	Run a few miles a day and do push ups.

yikZNA7aaa	If its a keeper league, no. HOwever, both have similar stats in GAA and save percentage, Rinne being slightly better. With Conklin's team aorund him though, he has a much higher potential for wins, so it really depends what you need. If you need wins, do it, if not here really isn't an advantage to it.|`|QKc5VFK5aa	I would do the trade.  As a wings fan the only "consistent" goalie we have is Conklin, and I can see him being the lead man down the stretch.  He can probably get you 10-13 wins, if he becomes the Wings main goalie before the playoffs.  Otherwise with him and Osgood switching off every other game you are looking at less wins obviously.  But i have a feeling that you will benefit either way.  Good luck|`|64LZW2y8aa	I would. Conklin is definitely going to win more games for the Red Wings of what's left in the season for the Wings. I'd do it.|`|UoUaO52taa	Definatly|`|bPJk3yrXaa	dude, im surprised he want one of your pikachus for rinne.<br>  see if he has a a bulbasaur and trade your pikachu and rinne for his conklin and bulbasaur
O3oqZsR3aa	Way too many college baseball teams. Think about it, if a school is there chances are they have a college baseball team and a college basketball team. Also because many of the college baseball players will not go pro and even if they do, they won't make an imediate impact. So college baseball doens't have the flavor that football and basketball do where guys make an imediate impact the season after they are drafted. Simple as that. However when the college world series comes around its a pretty big deal. I love that time of year.

XrNVTTnTaa	short sticks are more for offensive players that like to stick handle a lot and i mean a lot. longer stick are for in my though for defense men for the poke check. that's just my opinion. but i think it really doesn't matter one the length of the stick. it just might be your shot. try out different sticks. like if u have the money to spare look at the difference between like same company sticks but different Models for example: check difference between the easton stealth and synergy. or the nike bauer one 95 and the vapor 40. i went from a easton synergy sl grip to a warrior royale and my shot drastically went down as  of speed. because the sl had a lower kick point|`|rvE7gyuUaa	That is a great question, I used to use a stick that was an inch too long and when I purchased a new stick, I left that inch off and I had better control.  I tried to cut another inch off and it was too short, I was losing pucks off my stick when stick handling.  Without skates the stick should be just under your nose running up your body and just under your chin on skates.<br>  <br>  Do consider flex as well.  You should get a little bend with your flex to get a harder shot.  Most shooters wind up and think that is were power comes from, but let the stick work for you by putting some whip into the puck from the flex.  <br>  Check out this Kovalev video on flex:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9ydbx_tkZQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9ydbx_tk...</a>|`|QO1jEBdFaa	It's really just personal preference. Personally I like to a longer stick because I'm defense and need the long reach. Forwards tend to have a shorter stick. I used to have a sherwood focus and it worked fine for me. It might be that you are not utilizing the flex of the stick to get power. <br>  <br>  If your stick is long right now try cutting it shorter, and if it is too short you can purchase a butt end that you heat and stick inside the top to add length. They are about $3 at any sports store. Vise versa, buy a butt end to make your stick longer if it is short now.|`|ec3E6gSbaa	For me I like my sticks short. I have more control and I get a better aim, having a big stick takes me a while to get ready to shoot. What I always do is buy senior sticks  and cut them because I like the curves better than int. and Jr. You should try a shorter and lighter stick. I don't know how light your stick is now, but it seems that its a little heavy. Having a lighter stick would make it easier to wind up and get more power out of your shot.|`|I1DvpgY3aa	smaller
f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Although Rhode Island is a shall issue state by the 'local licensing authority' (RI Gen Law 11-47-11), they will revert you to the Attorney General when applying which is a MAY issue licensing authority (RI Gen Law 11-47-18). The local Police Chief has to sign ones application to 'verify residency' before one can submit the application to the attorney general. But, before he signs the application he may have you take an NRA Safety Course from a Certified NRA Instructor within the state. After one receives the training, the local B.C.I. unit may also make you wait four to six weeks to get ones fingerprints on a F.B.I. card needed for a new application. The whole process could take around three to four months before you can submit the application for consideration and then you will be told to allow up to ninety days for a response.<br>  <br>  Massachusetts Law requires firearm owners to be licensed through their local Police Department or the Massachusetts State Police if no local licensing authority is available. A license is required by state law for buying firearms and ammunition. An applicant must have passed a State approved firearm safety course before applying for a license.<br>  <br>  All applications, interviews, fees, and fingerprinting are done at the local Police Department then sent electronically to the Massachusetts Criminal History Board for the mandatory background checks, and processing. All approved applicants will receive their license from the issuing Police Department. All licensing information is stored by the Criminal History Board. Non residents who are planning on carrying in the state must apply for a temporary LTC through the State Police before their travel.<br>  <br>  There are four different types of Firearm licenses issued in the state. The most restrictive license, the Firearm Identification License (FID), only allows the ownership of long arms (rifles or shotguns) that hold 10 rounds or less in their magazines. The Class B License To Carry (LTC) allows the ownership of handguns which hold 10 rounds or less or long arms with any capacity magazine. The Class A LTC allows the ownership of any capacity handgun, or longarm and the ability to carry concealed. Licenses are valid for 6 years.<br>  <br>  The issuing authority official may restrict the Class A LTC as he wishes, such as target and hunting only, which may effect the authorization of an individual to carry concealed.<br>  <br>  The final license is only issued for "machine guns."<br>  <br>  A license to possess or carry a machine gun may be issued only to a firearm instructor certified by the Criminal Justice Training Council for the sole purpose of firearm instruction to police personnel, or to a bona fide collector of firearms upon application or renewal of such license.<br>  <br>  A "bona fide collector of firearms," for the purpose of issuance of a machine gun license, shall be defined as an individual who acquires firearms for such lawful purposes as historical significance, display, research, lecturing, demonstration, test firing, investment or other like purpose.<br>  <br>  For the purpose of issuance of a machine gun license, the acquisition of firearms for sporting use or for use as an offensive or defensive weapon shall not qualify an applicant as a bona fide collector of firearms.<br>  <br>  All private sales are required to be registered through an FA-10 form with the Criminal History Board, Firearm Records division. The state has an assault weapons ban similar to the expired Federal ban. Massachusetts is a "may issue" state and all classes of LTCs, are issued in a highly discretionary manner.<br>  <br>  FIDs are "Shall issue", except if the applicant fails a background check. Massachusetts law does not recognize the Firearm Owners Protection Act. State law requires all firearms to be stored ) in a locked container, or with a child safe trigger lock. If in a vehicle, firearm must be carried in the trunk of the vehicle in a locked container. Unless the licensee has a Class A unrestricted license, in which case the firearm must be under his direct control. Any firearms that are found to be unsecured may be confiscated by law enforcement officers and license may be revoked. In the event a license is revoked for any reason, law enforcement will confiscate all weapons and store for 1 year before destroying them unless the revoked licensee transfers ownership to a properly licensed party who then claims the firearms.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	If you move to RI and live there X many days most places consider you a resident.  Are you keeping a place in Massachusetts?  If no then you would most defiantly be a resident after X many days.  If you are having your driver's license address changed to an RI address, you'll be a RI resident.  <br>  <br>  As for moving back to Massachusetts with you firearm in a few years.  I really don't know.  And what is legal today might not be legal in four years.|`|OrvTG44laa	If there is no need for a license, you only have to be 21.  So if you don't need a license, and you're 21, yes, you can buy one.  I don't know the laws of Massachusetts, but if they require you to have a license, you need to get one in that state.  Other licenses aren't good.  <br>  You also need a carry permit to take it to Massachusetts.|`|CbbVUB4Waa	The best thing for you to do is to go to your local gun or sporting good store and they should be able to tell you everything that you need to know about your situation|`|5e222e64f1d8a945c888f07f0b21e0e4aa	a gun store should be able to help with most of your questions and you could also look on the NRA's website

c4r6jwLjaa	The key to break the press/trap is to get the pass off *before* they trap you.

You could also drive in, then dribble a step back and shoot. <br>  <br>  Practice is the best way to get better...keep working and you will be fine!
Y4mz8BShaa	1. Hobbytron is the worst airsoft retailer there is. Period. They don't know ****, and that's all they sell. I'd rather hand a straight razor to a convicted serial killer than trust anything on their site. It's all junk, it's all overpriced, it's all lied about.<br>  <br>  2. That M700 doesn't shoot 720 FPS. Maybe if you use .02g BB's, but that's just impossible.<br>  <br>  3. The normal BAR 10 has a longer inner barrel than the G-Spec. Longer inner barrel = greater accuracy. And it doesn't have several upgrades, it has every upgrade. See the inside? Yeah, you can replace all of those.<br>  <br>  4. Your best option is to buy the JG BAR 10 and spend the rest of your money on upgrade parts. Fully upgraded, it will out shoot most (everything but ARES manufactured and the Mantis) gas sniper rifles.

Hurdelers went to the hurdles (me) and distance practiced running 5 miles, ect. We have different schools so it's probably not going to be the same. If your practicing indoors I would wear shorts, a t shirt, and tennis shoes. Make sure your shoes are tired and your not wearing hot clothes because I remember running and I got really hot. We had to run 30 minutes straight and then do seven minute wall sits. When you go outside pack a pair of sweat pants and under armor. Maybe a sweatshirt too. I would actually bring that everyday just in case. Also, bring water. I always forgot mine and I hated it, lol. You don't have to go and buy all new things.

There are a lot of "wildcat" rounds, some of them have made it to mainstream use, like .243 and 6.5 Grendel, others faded into obscurity.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Do you mean a "wildcat rifle?"<br>  <br>  Some reloaders have special tools, or they have them made to change existing cartridge cases in order to create a new cartridge.  For instance, the 7-08 is a .308 Winchester case that's been necked down to 7mm (.284).  A .243 Winchester is a .308 Win necked down to 6mm.

vTzUYsiaaa	If a team owner wants to take the PR hit and sign him then by all means let him play. I don't think any team would really want him at QB unless they were very desperate, seeing as that would greatly lower their image and he has not played football in awhile. If he did manage to stay in shape I can see him coming back as a safety or something like that, maybe a backup QB.<br>  <br>  He has the athleticism to play but he will be rusty his first season back. He has only been away for two seasons, its not like his legs have fallen off.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	If a team wants to give him a chance, then he deserves a second chance.  I mean we have murderers in the league, rapists in other sports, people who have physically assaulted women and they play.|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	If a team is willing to sign him and play him, he should be allowed to play. He has done his time. I personally believe that what he did off the field (however heinous) should not have any impact on him on the field. It's not like he is racing dogs, horse racing or any other thing that involves animals.  Let him play.<br>  <br>  GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|nDzenpkwaa	You're right, why kick'em when he's down.  We should do what he would do to his dogs.  Shot'em when their down!!!  There isn't a question of allowing him to play.  The question is, Is he capible of playing at the level the NFL demands?"  He has been away for a while and he isn't the same Vick.  Now that being said, the old Vick wasn't that good to begin with.  He had his moments but his teams never did anything significant.  He wasn't a leader for the Falcons.  If he does get hired, he'll have a lot to prove to become a starter.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	A lot of these athletes beat people up and abuse their wives and girlfriends.

VeLdDMbgaa	Usually when sleepiness hits its because of the circadian rhythm. I think it has more to do with the time and sleep schedule than whether you are running. When you find yourself getting sleepy, take note of the time and it could be that you typically feel sleepy around that time of day. This can be especially common if you get up extra early.|`|96ndKQncaa	i have heard of a guy who has narcolepsy which is a form of EDS (exsesive daytime sleepiness) your eyes can be effected. like you just said. your eyes really feeling heavy, if your body parts become effected like feeling like they have dropped from tiredness..it may be narcolepsy<br>  and he had a 5 minute run in the park and came back home and needed a power nap<br>  or maybe your just really tired! see your doctor about this and find out why exactly your eyes are doing this|`|XXjfUKvLaa	Well it depends what time you do something if it was early then that's why or you need to get more sleep.|`|TIwaUBpTaa	i think not

Don't take any trade unless your 100% sure it won't come back to bite you! Good Luck in the season!!!|`|zCIdn7QPaa	no.<br>  <br>  David Wright is a beast.

Keep him at all costs.|`|1ClM9iKfaa	It looks like you could use a 1B who can mash, so if you think you need to trade Wright, you can probably do better than that offer.  If not, I'd keep Wright and keep an eye on some sleepers.<br>  <br>  It also depends on what categories you are already strong in, what the type of league yours is, etc.|`|IidWjPaeaa	No dude. That is a terrible trade. Lee can get hurt, Shields is a set-up man and worth nothing to fantasy and Reynolds strikes out to much and both his and Lee's numbers don't come close to Wrights and Youngs.|`|qIrumd2Gaa	Do not trade David Wright he is a really valuable player<br>  seriously this guy is a yankee killer|`|tkhlRVn4aa	no because david wright is awesome

Couple that with the fact that the Chargers' front office probably doesn't see Sproles as an every-down back, and I can definitely see the Chargers going after a back in the draft. Just someone they can groom for a year or two, because the Tomlinson-Sproles tandem still has at least a year, maybe two left in it.|`|AA11502346	If "lights out" is healthy enough to play, we'll be back in full form in the coming season.<br>  <br>  Still, we need a better secondary and better linebackers.|`|exOOXAkBaa	You can never have too many running backs.|`|BV3g3vA5aa	LT and darren sprols are getting old|`|ZWkX43zMaa	Ask the Denver Broncos why.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Who said the Chargers are drafting Moreno?

Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	that's impressive dude umm go out and do some leg workouts and just jump alot and your leg muscles will build up or you can get jumpsoles i have them and im 5'9 and i can touch rim almost grabbed it just go to google and type in jumpsoles some f the pros use them they will work for you they work for everyone Trust me with this one|`|1DL9pUsEaa	im also 6'2 and i have just got it..i have an adjustable rim...i put the rim to 9Ft and practiced for an hour or so, then i put it up to 10Ft and i can now always dunk<br>  People keep saying its about leg muscles but its usually technique<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Lnsm1rm4aa	buy some jump shoes and ankle waits and just run and jumprope with them on. those things kill but your calfs will get way bigger!|`|E8vG5bsPaa	Squats|`|SmWUB3ddaa	I know a guy that walked around on his toes all day and really improved his vertcal thouhg a less radical from would be to do calf raises.

iCvIQugXaa	First of all have fun! Don't stress.<br>  <br>  With a gymnastics background you won't be going into it completely with blank skills. Tumbling will be easy. Just don't let it fall to the side because you already know how. Practice it too, safely of course.<br>  <br>  As for your jumps, stretch and practice. Again with your gymnastics you should be pretty flexible, but getting height might a problem. You can work on that by strengthening your leg muscles. Try doing deep leaps. They will probably let you know which jumps are expected to make the squad ahead of time and show you how they are done. There are two ways to go into a jump so be sure to pay attention to which one they want. When you start your jumping remember to point your toes.<br>  <br>  Also, work on your motions. Sloppy motions can be the down fall of anyone. Sharpness is key. The best thing to do is stand in front of a mirror and go through each motion of your cheers. Watch your wrists and arms, they need to be straight and turned the right way. Make sure that you punch and follow through with each motion. Remember keep it sharp. All this applies to your dances too.<br>  <br>  Another thing that alot of people forget to do or even mention is, BE LOUD! You're a cheerleader, that's what cheerleaders do, CHEER! Do not sream though, yell. Yell using your diaphragm, like opera singers. Work on not singing the cheers. Pronounce the words. Make them sharp just like your motions. If you do, believe me you'll get noticed.<br>  <br>  The advice I give you is to walk into those tryout workshops with your head held high. Go to the front to learn everything. Pay attention and ask questions. Practice. That way when the actual tryouts finally come around you will be in the know and ready to go. It will help cut down on your nerves, also. Do your best is what it comes down to.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and hope my tips help ya.

JnUPvuvRaa	Forget the worn out Russian rifle pushing 60. Buy a new American 22. Ruger, Marlin or Savage.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	SKS rifles aren't too expensive in most places.... Its chambered in 7.62X39MM and is cheap in bulk......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.samcoglobal.com/sks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.samcoglobal.com/sks.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.the-armory.com/shopsite_sc/store/html/762x39_ammo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-armory.com/shopsite_sc/st...</a>|`|fUDlbOP0aa	a .22 is a great beginner rifle, if your first rifle was something like a mosin nagant and you haven't mastered the basics yet shooting a mosin nagant can ruin your shooting enthusiasm because its so much more powerful and not shouldering it properly (established during practice with a .22) can cause serious injuries. <br>  <br>  .22 ammo is very cheap and highly affordable to shoot in extremely large quantities. if all you had was $20 a month to buy ammo, at walmart you can get about 1000 rounds. once a week practice give you 200 rounds for practice to work with. If you bought something like a 10/22 it would make 200 round seem like nothing. A different rifle like a Marlin 925 , which is bolt action 200 rounds is more than enough for 3 hours to practice. <br>  <br>  for the biggest "bang" for the buck, I'd advise a used lever action, like a Henry in .22, unlike other rifles it will shoot all the .22 rimfire ammo (except magnums), maximum ammo interchangeability. So .22Short, Long, LR, CB, and BB. As well as .22 shotshells. The average price for a used good condition .22 lever gun is around $215. Marlins are more well known, Henry lever action is less well known but more affordable. <br>  <br>  Lever action is a part of history, so is the .22 rimfire caliber. lever guns was one of the earliest forms of repeating rifles, rimfire was among the earliest of cartridge ammunition, .22 rimfire dating back to the 1880s and the lever gun from the 1860s. So owning a lever gun in place of a much more modern 10/22 carbine or similar would be like having a piece of history, even if the gun itself isn't really all that old. <br>  <br>  calibers are not exactly interchangeable, two guns of the same caliber like two pistols, both in 9mm, most of the time ammo is interchangeable. sometimes its not, caliber isn't the cartridge the gun is chambered in, so if one pistol is in 9x18 Markov, its not interchangeable with the other pistol in 9x19 luger, even though the caliber (9mm) is the same. Caliber isn't accurate either, 7.62x39mm caliber is .308, but the bullet's actual caliber is .311 (7.62mm = .308")<br>  <br>  If you really want to shoot something like a mosin nagant, after you've gotten the basics down with the .22 rifle buy a 20 or 12 gauge shotgun. it will help you get used to the recoil of a Mosin Nagant rifle, which in my opinion is very violent. Then you can buy a MN (Mosin Nagant) rifle, like a M44 or 91/30. Ammo 7.62x54r isn't that expensive if you know where to get it cheap. in my local stores its $32 per 20 rounds. But online or at a gunshow, you can get 300 rounds for $50. The difference? the expensive stuff is modern manufacture, generally hunting or target. the cheap ammo is corrosive (not that big a deal), military surplus, not reloadable, and not as well performing as modern made ammo. The accuracy difference isn't that big a deal unless you're shooting at long range, in a competition or target shooting.|`|T7vuRDCVaa	If your budget is that low you'll be lucky to keep in .22 Ammo.<br>  <br>  If you're thinking of an Enfield you're probably wishing you could blast away with a .303 British all day. Let's be realistic for a moment.<br>  <br>  500 Rounds of .22 Cal   = $12-$16<br>  20 Rounds of  .303         = $18.99<br>  <br>  Blazing off 500 rounds in an afternoon of plinking is very easy.<br>  You're either going to have to re-think this or come up with a LOT more money.|`|2k4hWLYwaa	plink with a .22<br>  Anything bigger is too powerful for plinking and the ammo's too expensive.   I just wasted 15 shots on a groundhog an hour ago and didn't give it a moment's notice.  One 12ga shell would have cost me more.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	Plinkin? Seriously stick with the .22<br>  Go cheap get a Henry, or Stevens by Savage.|`|OrvTG44laa	Marlin 795 or Marlin 60.  Both good guns for good prices.  <br>  Savage 64fxp is 145 bucks and comes with a scope.  All 3 of these guns are semi auto.<br>  I don't know about the Ruger 10/22, but have heard mixed reviews.  A lot of people say it is great, but some people say you have to do a lot of costly repairs to it first.  <br>  Crickett rifles are very cheap- cheapest one is 130 bucks- but they are single shot.  <br>  I don't understand your second question very well, but I'll try.  If you are asking if a .22 cartridge could be used in a rifle with a different caliber- like a .223 or .243 or .270, then no.  If you are asking if 22lr ammo can be used for all 22 long rifles, then yes, of course.  Sorry if I didn't answer the second question.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	if you want a military rifle that uses inexpensive ammo for plinking, the SKS might be better than a mosin, but i also think youll spend more than 200 bucks on that these days unless its in very poor shape. it will use 762x39, which is weaker than (and incompatible with) the mosin (which is 762x54) but definitely higher power than .22. <br>  <br>  .22 LR weapon takes 22 short and 22 LR. 22 short weapon takes only 22 short. 22 magnum takes 22 magnum and the other 22 weapons won't accept 22 magnum. look at the barrel or receiver of a gun and it usually reads everything that it will accept.|`|AWFVa8NKaa	well...$200 wont take you very far. and yes, you can use any bullet, as long as it is the same caliber as your rifle|`|bgxYKsGiaa	marlin 60 or a henry
B8sJEBxTaa	Get someone who can throw and practice. Try catching with your FINGERS, not your body or palms. Like some people say, form a triangle with your hands and let the ball get in there. Also, once you're comfortable with that, try doing the same thing, but moving towards the ball. It's better to move towards the ball rather than to wait for the ball to come to you. Also if you have a third person, you can have whoever is throwing the ball to throw high balls so you and the other person can fight for the ball.|`|KyGhcrzLaa	PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE|`|3toXMPx9aa	Try to put your hole body square to the ball when you catch it, if the ball is comming at you from the left, square your body to face it, this way, your body acts as sort of a back up to your hands.

The proper catching position would be facing in the direction the football is coming from with your legs slightly bent and your feet shoulder length apart. <br>  Also, you want to always try to separate yourself from any defenders. Defenders will do any and everything possible to keep you from making the catch. <br>  <br>  Once you've gotten yourself in a good catching position, raise your arms for the football slightly bending your elbows and focus your eyes on the target. <br>  <br>  One of the most important tips to remember when catching the football is how you should have your hands as the ball approaches. Experts always say to make sure your thumbs and index fingers on both hands touch, forming a shape similar to a spade in a deck of cards between your hands. This spade shaped area is where you should attempt to catch the nose of the football.<br>  <br>  But, as Barlow stated earlier, you have to be ready for any type of pass. "If it's a very low ball below the knees, you might have to body catch it" he said. "Any ball that is above your waist, you'll want thumb to thumb when you catch it. And for any ball below the waist, you'll want pinky to pinky when you're catching it."<br>  <br>  In order for a wide receiver to be successful, he must have what football players call "soft hands". Meaning, as the ball is approaching him for the catch, he should be sure to cradle the football instead of fighting against it. Many experts say that the football should be treated like an egg as to ensure a solid catch. <br>  <br>  According to Barlow, having soft hands will usually get you assigned to the hand's team. "The hands team is basically a bunch of athletic guys who coaches think have pretty decent hands," he said. "That ball on the onside kick comes up pretty fast and hard, so you want to have some guys who can be able to retrieve it and bring it in."

c5d46e3c7eb9fa9356007718f6f2444caa	It is certainly a pre-64 rifle, they were only made between 1941-1844.  There were several variants (8 I believe) and 3 offered calibers (.257 Roberts, .270 Winchester and .30-06 Springfield).  Some figures indicate that 4000 rifles were manufactured, but just less than 2500 were shipped according to existing records.  They are fine rifles, quite collectible and unfortunately I cannot tell you what yours is worth.  It is necessary to know the variant, condition and any historical data to properly assess the value.

That being said if he decides to take less money next year it is possible for him to end up on a team like Utah, New Orleans, Toronto, or Phoenix. These teams all have good point guards which is something Allen Iverson needs so he can strive and be allowed to play his game without having to worry about managing the game and giving guys their touches.  If he asks for a huge contract again he will probably end up on a team like Charlotte, Minnesota, Memphis, or New Jersey.  I think if the Knicks have the money they might take him as well though.  I also think that if he decides to take less money and play off the bench Boston or the Lakers could take him as well.|`|bABkMrADaa	iverson is going to probably a bad team like timberwolves|`|tloiSeoQaa	retire he said so when he was in Denver that 08-09 was his last year|`|EcCmhdvKaa	Retire.|`|qWI3XBnCaa	return to phily, or go to a contender.|`|QJ2fwil9aa	COME BACK TO PHILADELPHIA!

SoKd4jGAaa	Keane's best move would be back at Spurs and possibly to get revenge on his boyhood team again!    Arshavin is an awesome player, Arsenal fans are in for a RIGHT TREAT I tell you, he really is worth a good 20million. I have watched him play 6 times and he has always impressed. The Russian league is notoriously rough and the skills Andrei possesses are amazing. He can unlock defences better than Robinho. His age does not matter, Hleb is around 27 and Arshavin is a direct replacement for him, with Nasri replacing Flamini but more attack minded.    Their midfield -  Sagna Gallas Toure Clichy  Walcott Nasri Fabregas Arshavin      RVP Adebayor/Eduardo    Look out next year Premiership, your all in for a ride when this team strolls into town!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I think Spurs need their heeds looked at for re signing that wee judas|`|mRF1xv7iaa	really??    yippee arsenal have finally bought arshavin!    but if you look at it, that is the only player we have bought in a year full of major injuries to major players.    ahh well  :)|`|4VgPiwRqaa	Arshavin will boost arsenals young squad and Keane really hasnt done anythng for liverpool and will love a retuern  to whit hart lane...|`|HEEXkiihaa	yup..heard that in the news too..heard keane going back to spurs and arshavin failed in the arsenal talks. i think its good for keane as for arshavin no idea wheres he is going

AA11528760	There's a good chance of that fued taking place in near future. The WWE could already be planning that storyline. I say so because, last week at the RAW/ECW House show in Bristol, Tennessee; the IC champ CM Punk defeated Kane.<br>  <br>  If they go ahead with this fued at Mania, it'll really be great. And BTW, this will be the 3rd time that Kane will be fueding for his 'love' - (v/s X-Pac, Road-Dogg for Tori & v/s Snitsky, Edge for Lita). So, he's kind of a 'veteren' in such 'love-feuds'.|`|5ba51502fbd70638a9f0bc992a48b870aa	NO Definitely not.<br>  CM Punk is doing fine on his own. <br>  Why would he need her out there to distract him & make him lose matches?<br>  Kane should be fighting for one of the Heavyweight Titles anyway.|`|JiCfYfLraa	that sounds cool kane needs a push by the way and cm punk needs some better competition.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	That would make seance.......I hope wwe creative will come up with the same idea you did.

AA10068004	Your right...Detroit has done nothing for him.<br>  <br>  Was there last night and it was pretty cool. They didn't do anything over the top. He just came out a red carpet before the game, after Pat Foley read off his career achievments and dropped the ceremonial puck.<br>  <br>  One thing I can say is this event helped support the argument about fighting in hockey. Before I left for the game, there was mention and discussion made on this event during the NBC broadcast earlier in the day and on NHL Network. At the game, Probie got a great, long standing ovation. When Foley read his stats and clips played throughout the game, the crowd sounded like a crowd watching a fireworks show. All i could think was yeah right... people hate fighting in hockey...lol.<br>  <br>  Also, just my opinion for the few who said all he did was fight/enforcer. Well thats the point. That was his job...he wasn't there to give ya 20 goals a year. He also played at a time when the role of the enforcer was part of the game much more than it is today, in my opinion. A day when allmost every team had a well-known heavyweight who's purpose was to intimidate the other team and also protect your best players. Given that... he should be recognized because he did in many fans and players opinions the best job at that.|`|5llBXFF4aa	In my opinion, Probert had a lot of potential, and wasted most of it.  He was a benefit to the Wings at times, and a severe detriment at times.  He had some decent years, some bad years, and his career ended a little later than it should have given all the circumstances.  There are many more deserving players who wore a Wings uniform, in my opinion.|`|AA11881188	I think it's really cool. Sure he had his problems but I sure enjoyed watching him play. I didn't realize he spent so many years with the Hawks, maybe because he spent so many here. I wish the Wings would do something for him, but it seems like if they did it now it would only be because Chicago did. Always a fan favorite though. In January '07 when the Wings retired Yzerman's number, Probie got the second loudest ovation of the night when he was introduced (behind Stevie, of course). Good guy, good teammate and always fun to watch play.|`|UADHt07Zaa	I don't think Detroit has done any Bob Probert night (I could be wrong but I don't think so).<br>  <br>  Was Probert even on the Blackhawks long enough to have a Bob Probert night with them?<br>  <br>  Added: I knew he was long gone before the Wings started winning.  I just didn't know how long he continued to play for.  Thanks for the info.|`|AA12089021	I think it is a very good thing.  Probert was a very talented, multi-dimensional hockey player who did good things in Chicago.  If I were in Chicago, I would go to the game specifically to see it.|`|UdoLcwm4aa	I wouldn't look for Bobby night in Detroit anytime soon. What a waste of talent. He was mostly an embarrassment; I've seen him many nights so coked up he couldn't feel a thing. I think Chicago's reaching for something that isn't there.|`|AA11674745	I don't know what he's contributed to either franchise that has to do with anything other than being a fighter / enforcer.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I see him more as a Red Wing, maybe Boogaard could challenge him to a mock fight = it would be one of the best since the famous Probert / Domi fight at MSG.<br>  <br>  Off-ice problems aside I still think Probie was one of the most skilled among the goons of his era. Didn't he have close to 30 goals one year while still having almost 400 PIM's?<br>  <br>  edit .. Verified my 2nd paragraph just now and in 87-88 he was 29-33-62 with 398 pim's.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Will they be serving knuckle sandwiches and coca cola?<br>   <br>  <br>   I have never heard of Detroit doing something......you might have thought they would have this Night vs. the Wings, no?|`|G33E41IBaa	I'm surprised the Red Wings haven't honored Probert.  He put up much better numbers in Detroit than he did in Chicago (especially in '88 - he had the most points AND penalty minutes of his career).  At the same time, Probert was still a great player in Chicago.  I think it's great that they're giving him the recognition he deserves.  No only is he arguably one of the toughest guys to ever play the sport, but he also put up pretty good numbers.|`|lYnkvRASaa	I liked Probert.  He was one of the best in his role and he could score.<br>  <br>  That said his best years were as a Wing and I think of him as a Wing and Not a Hawk.  I would have expected them to do something first, not sure if the have.  <br>  <br>  I assume he was a fan favorite in Chicago so it makes sense to do something.  Its good to see the Hawks do something for the fans.<br>  <br>  Like Bob I think it would have been nice to do it with the Wings in town.  Sort of like the Canes having their Wesley tribute with the bruins in town.  Unless those Wings games are Chelios appreciation night..........|`|m6lDXAmoaa	I don't think that they ever have.I know he's on the Alumni Association and participates in the Alumni games and everything but as for actual honors or recognitions...probably not. Considering his exit from Detroit as well...<br>  <br>  "This is the end," said senior vice-president Jim Devellano. "[In] my 12 years with the organization ... we've never spent more time on one player and his problems than we have on Probert."|`|O5Q4GP59aa	i agree

Y4mz8BShaa	As I'm sure I've told you three+ times before...<br>  UTG is a rebrander. They buy airsoft guns that have already been manufactured, slap their name on it, repackage it, and sell it for an inflated price.|`|eFW5O92Yaa	UTG gets some of their guns from other places(such as DE). So it might not be a UTG MADE gun. Leapers is the biggest person UTG gets their gun from.|`|P8Mg8tApaa	Most definatly not!<br>  <br>  UTG and DE are two seperate airsoft gun companies.
VbvrG9NJaa	Okay well for 13 year old quetion no your not to old I know people much older. <br>  Then some of the things for you to get some of the things like for the splits when ever your doing homework or something like that just sit in your straddel up to the point where it hurts a little and stop there and just sit there then when it stops go farther and so on.<br>  or <br>  Get a punch of pillows and go down in your split and hold it for 30 seconds with hands and 30 seconds with no hands and then take a pillow away when your done with that and do it all over again, until your out of pillows.<br>  And then some of the things to front and backwalkover would be to practice your bridges and just hold it. <br>  or<br>  go to the end of your bed up to your shoulders and go back so that you land on your hands and flip over, so that you land on your feet, and stand up and then go back only this time you go foward.<br>  Oh yeah and no handed cartwheel is called an aerial, and it isn't that hard if you have strong calfs, like one time I finnaly got it down and I was so happy about that well I tried it again and again until one time I went to far and I over rotated and landed on my side, and I was only in 3rd grade at the time so I was crying just out of fear. <br>  <br>  So if you are going to try these things then practice a lot and if you have a tramplion then just try doing it on there.  Oh yeah before you go to a gym you want to work on getting a little flexaible like not a lot just a little, so that when they have you do some of the skills you won't be so soar.  <br>  Oh yeah one more thing, you might want to bring a friend with, because in gymnastics ,at least when I was in gymnastics, you talk to your friends a lot and that stuff and its even more fun! <br>  Good luck :)|`|raVSbfPOaa	of course. just join a gym and they will put you with kids your age working at the same level your at. you wont immediately get all the tricks you named, but you'll work toward them and get them after a while.|`|RE4N7m8Oaa	Of course! If you do end up having little kids in your class, just ask your mom if you can do provate or semi-private lessons! Best of luck!|`|nuFCByKJaa	your a little to old i think you should take private lesson and get good then join your age group|`|Wwry0QIlaa	Of course you can! I was 14 when I started and I kept practicing and working hard and now I'm around a level 7. Maybe you could take a class or go to a private lesson with a gymnastics coach to help you. <br>  <br>  "Don't let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game."<br>  <br>  <br>  :)
uxregJ0faa	Are you serious?|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Not me, they are really underachieving this year. They have not played well this whole year.

Watch, they'll win with marion|`|ZdNSSm0waa	I hope we will<br>  <br>  but we won't|`|Fat6h6aRaa	theyre 22-36, probably not, 2nd worst in the east|`|fZ38PPgSaa	i dont|`|jnZOyKkQaa	they have sucks for heads!! go utah!!|`|bQqkdPL9aa	if they dont earn it why would i want them in?|`|JD5NQxeNaa	They have absolutely no bench. I can say this positively for only Jason Kapono and when healthy Kris Humphries are the only good things on your bench. Graham is eh and the very fact Jake Voskul is on your 12 man rotation and not on the IA shows the little depth the Raps have. Also, the Raps are soft.<br>  <br>  Softer than the Knicks (my favorite team) defensively, which is a huge understatement. Yeah, Raps beat the Knicks today. But, that was because they played in Toronto and Knicks are bad on the road. This past Friday, the Knicks completely obliterated the Raps by 30 in NYC. Showing, they are the better deeper team. Hence, a more deserving playoff team this year than Toronto.
uxregJ0faa	Aw I want them to be in the playoffs. Knicks failing|`|ZdNSSm0waa	I was at the game<br>  ...Trying to get Nate's jersey|`|yt05KPhBaa	NO|`|Fat6h6aRaa	toronto got bosh back but he put up low numbers
uxregJ0faa	Because its human nature. People always want to be on the winning side. They ruin it for others but what can you do really.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	I have never rode the bandwagon. I have been a die hard Knicks fan, since 1993. Seen them through 2 NBA Finals letdowns, tough playoff defeats when they were for many seasons the better record team against MJ and his Bulls, and more recently years when they have been a laughing stock. This year they are not terrible and may make the playoffs w. a possible winning record, which I am thankful for their improvement. But, their defense makes me cringe. Nothing, like the 90's when teams feared the Knicks and their stifling defense.|`|dDhTMacAaa	It's called "fans" or "fandom"<br>  <br>  don't be mistaken for the words fan and fandom|`|yt05KPhBaa	There really shouldn't be anyone calling anyone else a bandwagoner. People automatically assume all Laker, Cavs and Celtic fans are bandwagoners.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	Never been a bandwagon fan, always liked Lakers cause Kobe was there even when they didnt make it to the playoffs in 04-05.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	well i didnt really know but i think because people dont like to lose|`|24f7ccd30903117cb281195784155d22aa	Sports is a business. People pay to get a good product. If a team is good, and entertaining, and winning, people are more apt to spend money on that team, buy their gear, and root for them. If the team isnt that good, most people will find more fulfilling things to spend their money on, something that may not be as dissapointing such as a movie ticket, or a weekend in the mountains or something.  A good product sells, a bad product doesn't. Sports is the same way, GMs spend most of their time to create winning organizations who will bring in more fans such as bandwagoners who may end up becoming loyal fans during losing times, and draw more interest, and bottom line earn more money for their organization.|`|NALuet7Zaa	There is nothing wrong with a bandwagon... I like bandwagon more den die hard fans... they are hella annoying to the point where they'll cry if they don't get to to see their team play on t.v...|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Johney bravo: your just mad lakers beat your warriors .|`|AO44fEv4aa	I dont know, people do in for football all the time<br>  i think its because they dont care enough|`|KLpN10Icaa	Tell the Celtics "fans"|`|9UhoUcM2aa	no bandwagoner here|`|Fat6h6aRaa	they hate losing|`|W7IKifoEaa	I don't i've been a lakers fan since I was a little boy.|`|ZYzLTZm6aa	ariza beast 3<br>  <br>  wow trying to say not all lakers fans are on the bandwagon, look at your answers, your answer to everything is ariza hahaha

His last 2 victories where against former UFC champs.     3. Silva... Yes he has has looked impressive but everyone who knows MMA usually agrees that his division is the weakest.      I think Dana White only calls him the best lb for lb because he is the LEAST marketable champ out of all the current ones... I don't know why!! He usually gives people a good show.       4. Penn! The guy is head and shoulders better than anybody in his division. As a matter of fact if he stays here he should be the top lb for lb in no time. I think he is that good.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	I would go with GSP. But Anderson Silva is just as great.

GSP said himself he's not ready for spider and would hve to train for months and add muscle. dana white said as of now silva would destroy him. and he would. that stuff GSP did wont work. silva is just one of those guys who you cant beat.

6tGYe5roaa	1. C. I already have a bad attitude and that is probably the reason I have been benched. I wouldn't want to make more trouble by spewing threats or making demands.     2. A. If you play for a place like New York, you should be well aware of what you are getting yourself into. You really should be able to not let the fans get to you when they are booing. Just give them the curtain call. Why piss them off more?    3. C. I went with C out of the options you gave but I would do something different. I would probably confront the situation in an interview but not in a mean way. I would say something along the lines of how our team is better than trash talking. We just like to settle our differences on the playing field.|`|yk4S7uuraa	C. ask for your playing time, and then expect to hear why you haven't been played if there's a problem, then deal with it and keep your mouth shut.    A. Give them the curtain call, if it wasn't for them, the problem player wouldn't be so "overpaid." Don't be selfish on the field, save that for the contract negotiations.    C. keep your mouth shut, and wait for the right time and place to take care of this crap.    Does any of this have to do with Delgado?|`|BD7yd8D4aa	D. I am thinking that I will get my shot eventually if I shape up.  (in real life I would not have a bad attitude unless I played on a     really bad team)    2. A. Give them the curtain call. Why not? They already pay my exhorbitant salary.    3. B (minus the hit in the face part - maybe a hard slide would be warranted if they played infield).|`|4SKmjYrsaa	1)I want a trade to someone who respects my game!  2)Give em one. and then dont sign an extension when the time comes and tell em the fans never accepted you  3)Take a trip to shutty town, i dont say anything. i just hit a line drive off thier pitchers knee opening day lol|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Huh! Are you kidding.  Answer follows: All mimsy were the borogroves etc.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	A,A,C|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	C. If I have a bad attitude, hopefully I'd still have some smarts   and realize threats, tantrums or sulking won't get me anywhere. I'd kindly ask the manager, no harm, no foul. That way I know what the deal is.    A. I've been waiting to show them, and now I have. Hopefully this changes their attitudes towards me. I've seen what happens with players that hold grudges and they always end up worse off.    C. Don't say anything. Or at least make myself look better than them if confronted by saying, "Everyone has something to say and I understand that. My teammates and I stand by each other and don't want to comment. We hold ourselves to a higher level than that."    Cool, fun|`|5xIroQjMaa	1) Go to the media and speak through them to the manager, demanding to be put in the game (or better yet traded).     Not everyone fits in on every team, and if you're not playing when you deserve to, you need to get out and find a new place. To a large degree, you have to be selfish, or you'll just be forgotten.     2) Give them their curtain call, then flip them off.     Saw Benito Santiago do that in San Diego, and I just laughed and laughed. Definitely the way to go.     3) Stay silent, and make sure they get brushed back during the first game. Or if I'm not a pitcher, I'll make sure to hit that catcher hard, going into home.
uzNm9KtYaa	Selling ANY product is sometimes as much about what you put ON the box as what you put in it.  Have you ever stopped to think about how much you pay for the full-color, close registration, photo-quality printed box your cereal comes in?  The box and its special liner may be almost as expensive as the "ounces" of cereal that actually end up in it.  It's called advertising and part of the packaging is part of the way in which manufacturers advertise and present their product to us.  The more attractive they can make it look, the more likely they are to get us to buy it.  It's all about numbers.  The more "numbers" of product they can get us to buy, the more they make and the profit margin increases.  It is highly probable that they have figured their packaging costs to the micro-penny and know EXACTLY whether or not the addition of plastics to the equation is worth their time and money.  Evidently, their math tells them it is.  And so.......|`|PxrJZMPaaa	cardboard would be cheaper but I buy cci half due to the fact that it comes in a convenient carrying case half because its damn good ammo.|`|KQYFZWD6aa	Because you can control how many you get out at once.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	because there the best and use the best packaging|`|JnUPvuvRaa	Some Remington does too. CCI is darn good ammo.|`|QrjuueMCaa	I personally find the CCI packaging convenient since all the rounds are stacked 'rim-up' and you can grab a certain amount instead of a pile. I would highly doubt that it has much of an affect on price. CCI is worth the money.

CoAvkZpraa	my only recomendations for a knife are a Gerber LMF or a Leatherman full size multitool <br>  <br>  and in pellet guns if you want a good one i would go to cabelas but if not able to go there look for over 700fps. .22 &.177 are good if you are serious get .22. Get a scope.|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	Okay that's simple go buy yourself a BB gun but have your Dad there with you. That's not hard at all but start saving up to so when your 18 you can buy a bigger gun.<br>  And the knife thing? Come on buddy what do you think your gonna do stab a big *** bear with that little thing?<br>  No not gonna happen whatever wild animal decides to have you, it's gonna have you and stabbing the thing will make it even more pi$$ed off. If you subscribe to Game and Fish magazine or Wildlife magazine they have pages in there on what to do if something were to happen and trust me I've read them and none of them included stab the thing with your knife.|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	What are you trying to do, chop down a tree? Stab a bear? If you are trying to skin small game, then a big old knife like that wouldn't be much help. I'm not much into knives, but I would say a high quality folding pocket knife would be a better buy. Pellet gun? If you don't have one already, save up till you are 18 and buy a real gun. 50 to 75 dollars that would go to a pellet gun is a good start for a gun fund. Trust me, the gun will be an investment that can last a lifetime, a pellet gun will sit in the closet after a year. Delay your gratification my friend, it will be worth it.|`|PcOEPKfIaa	you won't need a knife larger then 3 inches ,even on the large deer we get 3" is plenty. in most states you may not be able to hunt with a pellet gun . you and dad should save your money ,a 22 rifle would be a good choice. glad your taking up hunting welcome aboard, hope you enjoy the sport as me.|`|SeLytr1Uaa	buck makes good knives, also gerber, if your looking for survival try Swiss army
eFW5O92Yaa	You aren't likely to find one under $100 that are good guns. The best ones under $100 that you can get would be maybe a Voltage from your local WalMart Superstore, and keep your receipt in case it messes up. If you could I'd save up and get the the 98 because it's a very common starter gun.|`|vF5lU8zeaa	Good Guns That are under $100 are JT Tac 5 and an another gun is the Icon they are both dependable guns that are worth getting to start out with i started out with the tippman and it was good and is a popular choice to start out with . But for a $100 you wont find many reliable guns.|`|QWkI9Nw1aa	You should get a tippman 98 custom if you decide to save up, but with your money, I recommend getting a spyder pilot acs. It is capable of 20bps.
LxZFioqwaa	One is for cricket, one if for football<br>  One is fat and old the other is bald and young<br>  <br>  Referee's seem to be more involved whereas umpires are rarely called upon.<br>  But thats because of the nature of each sport. They do the same job though - keeping the game within the rules.|`|7m4NbvU2aa	yes an umpire is for baseball and a referee is for basketball and football but they both od the same thing, they both control the game and make calls.|`|OIG4yT3gaa	duh... an umpire iz with baseball or softball referee......... wrestling|`|KLpN10Icaa	Umpires tend to be more out of shape than referees.  thats the only difference.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	In football, yes.  The referee is the "boss" or the head official.  He's responsible for the overall supervision of the game and he has the final call on all calls.  The umpire is the guy who stands in the middle of the field that many WRs use as a screen, and he's responsible for holding calls, other penalties for the O-Line, making sure there arent too many men on the field, and player equipment.<br>  <br>  In other sports, no.  Baseball has umpires as their officials, basketball has referees, hockey has a referee and linesmen.  They're all officials, but it depends on the sport as to what they're named.  Football is the only sport that has both and umpire and a referee.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	It depends on the sport. I baseball, there are umpires. Football has a referee and an umpire and each has a different role.

There will probably be a ton of 13 year olds dont worry. <br>  That's weird that they don't go by mite, squirt, peewee, bantam, midget, adult. That's the way my rink does all camps, clinics. Etc.<br>  <br>  YOU should play down. I know your not talking about leagues it just that usually clinics set the age levels like that so every one fits in perfect. Anyways  playing down would be better because there would be more kids around your age. There will probably me more new 14 year OLDs too. Playing with 20 year olds would be awkward.
zNajmAYFaa	Snitsky is going to retire. He is 39 years old. Snitsky was a great wrestler when he was getting a push. "Pain is my Pleasure" and "It wasn't my fault" those were cool. He is in very good physical shape. But, when I see him beat by SANTINO MARELLA (I like Santino), that's telling me that he'll never make it big. Actually, he might go to TNA, because they always hire the old and washed up wrestlers.

1bAFv3Yqaa	Darrius Heyward-Bey ran a 4.30? That's slow. Every day there's 6 or 7 HS freshmen and sophomores on here who run the forty that fast.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No, not at all.  Other WRs are putting up good #s in the 40, but we already knew there was a lot of speed in the draft, so thats nothing new.  We also knew Crabtree wasn't even close to being the fastest, if anything speed was the only knock on him, yet he was still picked as the top WR in the draft.  The injury may make Crabtree fall a few spots, but not out of the top 10 and he'll still be the #1 WR taken.|`|mqQUqXxNaa	No one expects Crabtree to be one of the fastest.  They new before the combine that this was going to be one of the fastest WR groups this decade, but they still had Crabtree at #1.  <br>  <br>  As long as he runs below a 4.70 at his proday he will still be the first Wr taken.|`|BZpF8nSsaa	no it doesnt change anything, he is the most talented WR out the, and Macline, Hayward-Bey, or Nicks are not really close to his level..and there is not way he will fall out of the top 10, and probably not even the top 4|`|g4cYFVrmaa	Crabtree will still be the first receiver taken in the draft.

BUvhn83raa	I've done some study on the FR 205, but I don't own one. I have a feeling it has no HR support even if you wanted to upgrade and the product page does not make it obvious either. <br>  <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&pID=348" rel="nofollow">https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=...</a><br>  <br>  If you want a HR monitor with GPS, you might be able to pick up a Forerunner 301 cheaply (under $100 USD) on Amazon or eBay. It has most of the same sports features as the 205, but is quite bulky and the GPS signal quality, weaker. <br>  <br>  If you just want a HR monitor with no GPS, then there are plenty of cheap watches around. Like the Timex Ironman T59751 (around $50 USD). <br>  <br>  I have a Timex Ironman HR Monitor page on my website, if you want some ideas: <a href="http://www.sportswatchinformant.com/timex-ironman-heart-rate-monitor-watch-models-compared" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportswatchinformant.com/time...</a>|`|Lol0iLfgaa	Check the watch.  Some of them are compatible, while some aren't.  I have both a 101 and a 305.  The 101 you can't get a heart rate monitor for unless it is a special type of 101.  On the other hand, any 305 is compatible with a heart rate monitor.  I don't know much about the 205, so just go into the "Settings" and then into accessories and see if you can connect a heart rate monitor.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	I don't think you can add a heart rate monitor to the Garmin 205
AA11528760	Not unless the WWE goes back to having an Undisputed World Championship. IMO, the reason why they've still kept that funky WWE title is because they have another World Title in the form of the Big Gold Belt. The funky belt keeps the kids happy & the Big Gold Belt makes the older fans feel good.<br>  But, I think there's a little chance of the WWE unifying the two title belts, 'coz there are way too many Main-Eventers in the WWE.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	no they dont ..but maybe they will change it to a new stuff..<br>  <br>  wwe dont look back|`|NXktxy8jaa	I Wish They Would, But They Won't. The Old WWE Championship Was The Classic One. Many True Legends Held That Title That ACTUALLY Deserved It.

Just Like it Always Has Been - The WWE Championship has Changed Designs 6 or 7 Times Since it's Inception. It Happens.<br>  3 - Why Does Everyone HATE the Cena Spinner , Yet LOVES the "Rated R Spinner"?<br>  4 - The WWE Championship Belt (Spinner or Not) is THE Most Sought After Replica by People When WWE Goes to Children's Hospitals & the Make-A-Wish Foundation.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is Nothing Wrong with the WWE Championship in Principle , It's The Guy Who Brought it In , Like it Always has Been...|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	The belt on your icon is gay and boring the new one is cool|`|U6tE9LhJaa	I hope, cena ruined the title|`|4YcZv0d7aa	I never liked the new belt. It wasn't just the way it looked, to me it was too flashy. I felt that the belt was something to be honored. It looked like it was meant something and not looking like a toy. I didn't like either inception of it (Cena and Rated R). I wouldn't mind seeing it with a better design, but less diamonds. I like the new ECW belt, its simple but it seems like its more of a trophy.<br>  <br>  How would you like to see the Vince Lombardi Trophy with dubs? Maybe the Stanley Cup all covered in "bling" like Lil Jon's Crunk cup?<br>  <br>  I just think that there should be some things left more regal and classic. Championship belts should stay simple and classic. Not a big fan of the "Diva Championship" either. The Women's Championship is good.<br>  <br>  I just like tradition. sorry.|`|xJ1qhXwVaa	Maybe, I would like something new. I'm not saying the spinner is bad, But it only fit Cena. And now it doesn't even fit him. The spinner just looks really weird, I would rather have the old title back. But i think bringing a new title onto Smack down could bring in a lot of hype especially going into Wrestlemania.|`|r6ol5qXmaa	Highly doubt it. With the PG rating and stuff, all those spoiled kids are gonna find the current WWE Championship belt more flashy.

oAjbBLDpaa	Edge will most likely stay on Smackdown. Triple H may suddenly move because I would think that Stephanie would ask for it from Vickie for her protection from Orton. Vickie would accept since Triple H had been tormenting her for weeks before the Rumble. <br>  Stephanie might offer a trade for Triple H, maybe John Cena because RAW's center stage seems to be Triple H and Orton while Cena still has his rematch with Edge.

ZpH2PFF9aa	to late i am in "Spring Training|`|s4VzPulYaa	Ahw I am so sorry I know about some of the stuff you are going through.<br>  Although I play fastpitch softball, I can kind of relate.<br>  Last year I had the worst 'summer ball' coach, his daugher sucks, and i seriously emphasize SUCKS! he put her in to play over me just because she was his daugher, it didn't matter how many times she struck out, or how many popflies she missed (we both play centerfield) I always went home and got with my high school coach to practice, so that way I would be more in tune when I got to summer ball, well it didn't matter how good I did, his daughter still got to play. I left many many MANY tournaments last year in tears, softball is my life, and messing with my talent, with my mind, and my emotions was not the thing to do, he made me feel like I was the worst player EVER, and so I cried, I would go home and think that I had to do so much practicing to prove that I was good, my high school coach finally just said that my summer coach didn't matter, not to listen to him because he was a jerk. There were so many times that summer that I thought that my parents were going to "have words" with my summer coach, but that never happened. <br>  What you need to do, is to work when your at home, and when your stupid coach sees that you are really good, you might not get as much of the stupidness of your coach. I'm sorry that you have to go throught this like I had to go through, it was the worst time of my life, tears are actually coming to my eyes just telling you about this. <br>  I'm getting on a new team this year, so I can be around a posative atmosphere, and also my parents said that I couldn't play with them anymore, because it hurt me so much.... All the tears was worth going to another team. This year I think I'm going to play up a level, so I'm excited!<br>  Just keep practicing, that's the best advice I can give you.<br>  I wish you good luck!<br>  and I am truly sorry that you have to go thought this also.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	I am guessing that your mother is a single parent. She may be a little self-absorbed think that as long as you are playing ball she knows you are safe and she can go do other things. I once had a player who's parents thought that as long as he was with me he was OK and they could go to the bar.. They thought baseball was their babysitter. I told them that he would no longer be allowed to play unless they were at the game (I couldn't actually enforce this rule but they didn't know that), they came to their first game and I told him that he gets to play anything he wants - he was our starting pitcher that day. I pulled the team together and told them that it was his day and his parents were getting to see him play for the first time and they were excited to help him look good and impress them in their first game as spectators. We lost that game by 3 runs (this wasn't a hollywood story) but his parents were so excited about the game that they never missed another game or practice.<br>  <br>  You have the right attitude. You are around the wrong coaches. Too many people who coach at your level are more concerned with their own ego and winning than they are about teaching the game - and more importantly, teaching kids to love the game. IT IS just a game. <br>  One of the most influencial moments I have ever experienced in coaching happened because I spent time with less talented players - I used to create drills that were fun just to keep the kids involved. One drill is called "dive drill" - I had all the players doing full layout dives to catch balls in practice and it didn't even matter if you caught the ball or not, the whole team judged you on form - slide length.. whether you put a knee down etc.. It was fun. What they didn't realize was that I was actually teaching effort without fear of failure and rule number one on any of teams is that you cannot criticize anyone else on your team and it is your responsibilty to help everyone else. The coach who made you cry is an idiot (please quote me, print it out and take it to him - tell him he is free to call me but he is a F$%& Up as a coach and should not be allowed to coach baseball and has no idea what he is doing). Some of these coaches are more motivated by their egos and do not know the differnce between coaching talent and developing talent - it takes less effort to coach the best players than it does to make them. I have coached several players who are in MLB but my most moving moment in coaching is actually about the kids that most people say suck at baseball.. In our city championship my right fielder who only played the minimum and was not well coordinated, he was the "worst" player on the team - he may have been considered one of the worst in the league but his parents wanted him to join something - He sucked all year, but I made him play anyway.. I also made him try and made everyone else encourage him to try. 5th inning of the championship game he made a laid out diving catch of a fly ball against the right field fence to save a 1 run lead with 2 on and 2 out. It had nothing to do with talent it was about encouragement and effort without someone making fun of you for trying. That game was tied in the next inning and we had a weak hitter up. His mother was a little afraid of him playing because he had never played before and was not very atheletic.. not the guy you want hitting here but I could have substituted for him and he thought I was going to when I called time out but I was more determined to make him win something than I was to win the game (I used to play a BP game where I loaded my glove with 8 balls and told them if they knocked the balls out of my glove they get another 8 balls in batting practice)-but they have to swing at every pitch - he always hit well in BP but could never do it in a game. I called time out as he hit the batters box and whispered in his ear that he only gets 3 pitches - he will swing at every pitch, I don't care if its in the dirt, hits you.. hits me at 3B.. whatever. I taught you to hit anything thrown and I know he is going to grove one to you - If you stike out on 3 dirt balls, it's my fault and I will tell everyone it was my order but you will swing. He hit the first pitch 2 inches from the top of the center field wall. The biggest hit in his life - he stood at 2B and jumped up and down and his mom was in stands standing up yelling that's my son.. I didn't care if we won, I had to leave the dugout to cry.<br>  <br>  The game is small. You like playing for the right reason - you love the game. So just show up, play your best, love the game and ignore the other people.<br>  If I were still coaching, I would take 9 of you before I would take the 9 best players in your town - and I guarantee I would win.
5zQbG8TDaa	I would try to get them to 299 dollars. Still good at this one but try to get it down a little more.
PMwg1hWAaa	They are in a unique situation.  They have got some key players in certain areas.  Getting rid of Herm Edwards was a great start.  Dorsey went under the radar last year, but he showed some flashes of potential.  Brandon Flowers is a star in the making.  On D they need to address defensive end and linebacker.  Possibly a safety.  There are some big names at those positions hitting free agency this season.  They really need to make a move.  On offense.  Keeping Gonzalez happy must be a priority.  The guy still has a lot left in him and has always been one of the emotional leaders of the team.  They need to treat him with a little more respect.  Dangling him on the trade block mid-season was dumb.  I don't even want to get started on Larry Johnson.  He's a whole topic by himself.  Just get rid of him.  His trade value can't possibly be that high right now, and it's only going to get worse.  Enough said about that.  Now, Thigpen played decent, but I never see him as being capable of taking over a game.  He can manage well, but is definitely not a game changer.  Croyle isn't the answer either.  I don't think they should gamble in this years draft unless Freeman is still available in the 2nd round.  There are a lot of good QB's coming out in next years draft, maybe even see what free agency has to offer by then.  Getting another good receiver is a must as well.  Bowe and Gonzalez are double teamed to often.  Of course, there's the O-Line. They aren't what they were when LJ ran for almost 2,000 yards.  I think that's where they will need to focus in the draft.<br>  <br>  Like I said, they are in a unique situation.  They are in a rebuilding process but have some key pieces in place.  Don't look for them to turn it around next season.  But I think they will definitely be contenders by 2011 season.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	They can make a draft pick.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	i bet they can tie their own shoes|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	play football|`|vnzSTerjaa	they already got a new coach... so, that.<br>  i love when the chargers play the chiefs, its always a great exciting game!

Really confusing to me and as a liverpool fan I'm very unhappy about that. If he goes 5 million will go to waste and I don't think he should buy anyone now because he's already got enough players like Babel, Benayoun who are really good and don't get full 90 minutes to play most matches. So probably now I would just put Gerrard & Torres upfront as we have good midfielders like Mascherano & Alonso.|`|mKazB56xaa	No way

Wear girl shorts not basketball shorts and a t-shirt with hair up high and white running shoes. When they teach you jumps or dances, try to be as tight and clean as possible. (meaning hitting the motions nicely and sharply).. when you stunt use your legs to shoot up your top, and carefully listen to the coach telling you what to do. If you top, jump into their hands and push off their shoulders with your hands, just like you would go through a tube or something. squeeze all the muscles in your body then hit a high v. if it starts to fall bring your hands above your head with clasped hands making it easier for your bases to catch you.

GmRscBkPaa	Take him to a local gun shop and let him try several handguns for fit and feel.  He'll probably want something in 9mm as a minimum for defense.  Other popular calibers are: .40, .45acp, .357mag, and .44mag.  <br>  <br>  Revolvers are simpler to use and maintain.  Most modern pistols have hi-cap magazines which can come in handy.<br>  <br>  The gun dealer will show him all his options so he can make an informed decision.  Stick with a reputable brand.  The quality is better, and the resale will be better if your dad doesn't want it in the end.|`|6RNQDRjvaa	Smith & Wesson dbl. action 45 cal. revolver with 3" barrel.

(still not a rocket science though). they come in larger calibers, too, and will hold more rounds.<br>  <br>  if this gun will just sit in the closet and never be worn outside, you might grab a simple pump action shotgun and save cash, like a mossberg 500. that will be much more effective, but obviously it is heavier and bulkier. it will also be easier to return fire on someone who is farther than 5 yards away (which might be important on a farm)<br>  if you think range would be more important, you could get a ruger mini14. that should be enough range and its still a reasonably simple gun.|`|8MUj24s6aa	Your dad needs to be involved.

RE4N7m8Oaa	First, Do a back bend kick over.<br>  Then, Do that with one foot slightly in front of the other<br>  Next, AS SOON AS you hand hit the ground put the front leg up and kick over.<br>  After, RIGHT BEFORE you put your hands down put your leg up SLOWLY.<br>  Finally, Move your hands and legs with each other- when you touch the floor, your leg is STRAIGHT up. <br>  Volia! A back walkover!<br>  (Email me with questions- rachelw13@yahoo.com)|`|Wwry0QIlaa	Stand up straight and tall with your hands to your ears and reaching for the sky. Point one foot and hold it slightly off the ground.  As you bend backwards, look at your hands and push your hips out. Bend from the top of your back and not the lower back.  If you don't push out your hips as you bend, you will fall flat so make sure you push them out! As you bend backwards, lift the foot that was slightly off the ground and it will help carry you over. I was just working on this yesterday and this is what my coach said.  Hope it helps!!|`|VbvrG9NJaa	Okay this is how I got mine at home. <br>  Go to the end of your bed, so that your shoulders are a little off, and flip over so that you land on your hands and then land on your feet and stand up, then go foward and try it! <br>  It helps a lot because your kicking over and stretching out your back. <br>  Oh yeah backwalkover is all one word lol <br>  Well good luck :)|`|raVSbfPOaa	First practice kicking over back in forth from a back bend position.<br>  Next, practice going backwards with one foot in the air. <br>  When you get good at that then practice by eventually using more power and picking up the other foot. (suggest a coach)<br>  You also want to stretch often and practice often.|`|z98UFPmIaa	i taught myself before the gymnastic coaches could teach me.<br>  you could just practice kicking your leg up and eventually you would get stronger at it. what i also did was had my legs up on the couch and hands on the floor in a backbend and kicked my leg over getting used to that and slowly set my feet closer to the ground.|`|JNTQwvtTaa	Type your question into YouTube.

cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Oh yeah you sound like a real expert on football. No wonder Philadelphia fans are rated the worst. Let McNabb go and who are you going to have replace him? Did you figure that out yet? Probably not.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	It's not really fair.  The Eagles for some reason like a pass-happy attack, and that just isn't McNabb.  You can see when the Eagles run it at least 50% of the time, they are more successful.  McNabb can carry a team, but he shouldn't have to do it all the time.  If they had a bruiser type back, like Brandon Jacobs or Michael Bush, and keep Westbrook for the screens, outlets, third down, etc., they can be more competitive with McNabb at the helm.  Balance, no matter what team you are, is a good thing.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'm not an Eagles fan, but I think you should keep him.  I mean, yeah, he lost in the big game a lot, but hell, Jim Kelly is in the HOF and he lost 4 SBs in a row, and noone in Buffalo would have given him up.  Football is a team sport, and you can't blame McNabb alone for those losses.  <br>  <br>  I mean, first of all, McNabb threw for almost 4k yards, and nearly a 2-1 TD-INT ratio.  He had a good year.  Yeah, they lost in the NFC championship, but I blame the defense, not McNabb.  He threw for 375 yards with 3TDs and 1 INT, he did his job, the rest of the team didnt.<br>  <br>  In the SB against NE, he threw for 357 yards, yeah he threw 3 picks, but also threw 3 TDs and was forced to throw more times than any game that season, 51 times.  If anything I'd blame Westbrook for his awful rushing performance.<br>  <br>  Overall, he's had good games, but his team hasn't when they needed it.  Their WR's really arent good, and McNabb has a good year despite their poor WRs.  If you want to get rid of him, prepare to go 5-11.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Are you crazy. Im a Cowboys fan and even I know they should keep him. He led them to 5 NFC championships. if you were a true Eagles fan than you would understand how valuable he is.|`|AOA8TJraaa	yes...|`|PMwg1hWAaa	I'm not an Eagles fan by any means. But I must say this.  HOW 'BOUT YOU UNGRATEFUL, WHINERS GET OFF HIS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Look where HE has brought your franchise!  Or are you still one of those who thought Ricky Williams would've been a better choice?  Five f'n championship games.  That is unbelievable.  And I'm afraid you are mistaken about the good WR's.  Jackson is good and will only get better.  But who are these other guys you speak of?  Tom, Joe, Larry............ just some bum's off the street.  But, I'm more of a McNabb fan than an Eagles fan, so I hope you do get rid of him.  You ungrateful "fans" don't deserve him.  Can't wait to see how Kolb turns out.  What a waste of a badly needed second round pick.  From the boo's on draft day through the present, he has been shown nothing but disrespect.  He deserves better and will flourish even more than he already has with an environment that appreciates him.  F#CK YOU!!|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	only if the EAGLES want to have winning seasons, for a bit longer. <br>  if the management were really concerned about having more success, they would have given Him some receiving help by now. Mcnabb, is a top NFL quarterback but, everyone in the league has figured it out by now. stop Westbrook and, stop the EAGLES.|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	I to am a huge eagles fan yes but then when sam bradford enters draft trade mcnabb to be able to draft bradford then have mcnabb retire after draft so he still retired as an eagles its win win for us<br>  <br>  But i say we need a WR and RB in this draft beanie and heyward-bay once we get them next year we focus on OT 's cause I agree curtis is way underrated but he's getting older|`|nfLd3ngraa	Depends on if they get a replacement or not. If kevin Kolb is gonna be the only option then that would be pretty bad. If the eagles can trade McNabb and get a vetern free agent then yeah i say go for it. A good vetern to get for a replacement would be Kerry Collins.|`|fcb1efacb648b3f1b1c0eff5cf18ba7daa	Yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  duh|`|2VYjOqnpaa	Yes. He will also take them to the SuperBowl.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	if they want to win games, then yes|`|785ucP3uaa	Yes i am a huge eagles fan and without mcnabb we wouldnt of even probably made it to dat many nfc championships. Look at kolb, we put him in at the of the the cleveland game b/c we were winning by a lot and the first thing he does is throw an interception for a touchdown. Mcnabb may be inconsistent at times but a lot of the time it isnt his fault...we had some dropped passes dat for sure could of been game changers. All we need is a star wide receiver and a power runningback behind westbrook and the eagles will be super bowl champs next year|`|Me2R46RZaa	Are u serious. if the eagles let McNabb go where would they be?!?!?!<br>  What is Kevin Kolb the nest big thing..hes  a joke<br>  <br>  The Real problem is the eagles management.<br>  Once they get a SOLID #1 Receiver then they will get a SUPERBOWL.<br>  They also need a power back Westbrook is to small to get anything done on the Goaline.<br>  <br>  Once the eagles management stops beaing cheap and bring in a good receiver lIKE TJ HOOSHYAMAMA  who said he wanted to play for the eagles then they can get somewhere.<br>  <br>  Theres no way u can blame McNabb for the eagles problems|`|ZtoXM6jbaa	They have to keep him...kolb in crap and they don't have anyone else.. plus he has just about every single eagles passing record which is sort of overshadowed by all the nfc championship and superbowl losses.. not to mention the injuries<br>  <br>  <br>  but maybe if they get houshmanzadaeh from the bengals or boldin they can make one or 2 good runs with him still|`|CSuP72lOaa	I like McNabb. He's a good guy. But i do think his time is running short. He's on his downslide to the end of his career. I think the Eagles should at least give him one more year. After that, if he's still inconsistent, I say they should let him go. Ol Fab Mcnabb....I'll miss him. Ha.<br>  <br>  E-A-G-L-E-S<br>  EAGLES!|`|cj7zKW06aa	i am an eagles fan to they are my  number one team and i relly do think we should kepp him he is agreat QB yes he  messis up sometimes but nobodys perfect|`|ILW3vkhEaa	I'm not an eagles fan but they should keep him cuz they don't have anybody else they can depend on|`|9gIsxKdWaa	I can't wait to hear what Eagles fans say after McNabb is gone.

L0NG5I9eaa	carry your stick around with you when you are walking around and just keep cradling (both hands and single hand)<br>  <br>  An exercise that helped me was cradling up against a wall so that when I cradled my stick would bump the wall. It should help you keep the ball in your stick especially when you do have contact.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Get your gloves on and start carrying a stick around with a ball. Only use your left hand. Constanly practice cradling. Cradle in your offhand when you run. <br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is get on the wall. Throw, catch, cradle, repeat. This one is goof becuae it will work your passing and catching as well. <br>  <br>  Really, it just comes down to forcing yourself to use your left hand.|`|u2XdPAk6aa	Practice cradling lefty with your gloves on and try to cradle non-stop. A good way to practice cradling is when your watching tv just twirl around your stick and get used to the feel of cradling with your left hand.

kYBlgFQAaa	I think there were higher expectations and pressures on him in GS.  Being a #3 draft pick, people expected him to come in and be the type of player he was at Duke (Larry Bird-esque).  When that didn't happen, the fans were pretty hard on him.  He was booed and made a bit of a scapegoat for the Warriors troubles.  This really affected him and his play, and he needed a fresh start.  Indiana has been a good fit for him.  <br>  <br>  Also, GS wasn't really a high octane offense when he played there.  He played the majority of his GS career for Eric Musselman and Mike Montgomery.  He only played about half a season for Nellie before being traded.|`|NRiSJewTaa	he was a pretty good player with the dubs.... the warriors sucked back then and the coach was horrible.... he left i think half way through nellies comeback season|`|H8u7gMAYaa	He was actually a pretty good player in GS. His team just wasn't any good.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: When he was in GS, he was still a pretty good player. Averaging about 13ppg during his career there. So, he was no scrub.|`|Zt1VDawZaa	I think he needed to have time to get things together.
dDhTMacAaa	I didn't believe you?<br>  <br>  I thought they would be fine without KG and I predicted a big game from Rondo!<br>  <br>  booya!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	They looked good, but seriously, they played a team that really has no concept of team defense.  No offense to the Suns, but they're just an open high paced offense that likes to run and try to outscore their opponents.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think they'll be fine without KG, he'll be back in time for when they really need him anyway.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Because they got Pierce, Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo Nobody will stop the Celtics even without KG.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Celtics in 2009 with or without KG. <br>  <br>  Now, I want you to process that statement in your mind. Just think about what you said.<br>  <br>  YOU CRAZY!|`|urqGJPwpaa	So you're saying Phoenix is better than Denver?  <br>  <br>  I think Billups > Nash and Billups plays defense better than Nash too.  Rondo won't explode for another career high and it will be more difficult for Boston.  I think Boston can win, but I don't think I'd be as confident as you are if I were a Celtics fan.<br>  <br>  Lol and Celtics 2009 without KG?  Didn't you guys lose to the Lakers when they didn't have Bynum?  Imagine when Bynum comes back, and you guys don't have KG.  Then the Lakers will have Bynum and Gasol, 1 guy will have a mismatch when Garnett isn't in there.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	They are already a good enough team without him but it will still cost them a game or two......but other than that they should be just fine<br>  the biggest problem though would be that the cavs now get an oppurtunity to clinch that #1 spot so the celtics wont get it this year|`|6yoQhXsOaa	GO JAZZ!|`|yt05KPhBaa	I want to see them face a real defensive effort.|`|NzS7yD32aa	no there losing tomorrow <br>  <br>  Bet on it|`|5FypDafWaa	Shut your mouth they will not be champions in 09|`|i2NFartOaa	there going win the that that appear rondo is on fire|`|okECVBkzaa	They will be just fine. My man Leon Powe is more than capable of filling in for the Celts till KG gets back.|`|Uh6qQ3RHaa	celtics are 13-2 without kg... theyll be fine but they need him if they want to beat the cavaliers and eventually win the championship|`|kmBdx2koaa	the suns dont have amare so i dont noo i think there gonna lose against denver.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	They should do fine during the regular season, although it could put thier chances of securing the home court throughout the playoffs in jeopardy.  Aside from that, it could be seen as a blessing in disguise.  As was the case last year, it gave KG a bit of mid-season respite.  Assuming he at full strength going into the playoffs, the extra rest should pay dividends during the post season.  <br>  <br>  Also, it will give the bench players more playing time.  Powe really stepped his game up last year during KG's absence.   He might not have ever had the opportunity otherwise.  Today, we saw Rondo kick it up a gear, taking on more of the scoring load.  <br>  <br>  Celitcs should be able to win without KG, but with the tight race this year every loss is significant.  KG is the anchor to that defense, so he will definitely be missed.  The margin for error is a lot smaller than it was last season.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	they played against the Suns without Amar'e the real test will be Denver Orlando and Cleveland

2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	What? Mo Williams is our starting point guard, and Delonte West is our starting shooting guard, and our best perimeter defender. <br>  <br>  They are both in the starting line up, and when our guards get it going, we are pretty hard to beat. <br>  <br>  I'm so excited, Cleveland finally has their starting line up back! :)|`|56Mb4BXIaa	Barea reminds me of a younG Jason Kidd. <br>  <br>  I think Mo Will has a lot more fire power then West. He can score 20-30 points with 7 assists and take nothing away from lebron's game|`|yt05KPhBaa	Rodney Stuckey looks like 50 Cent.<br>  Blake Griffin looks like Taylor Griffin|`|fZ38PPgSaa	rodney stuckey hella looks like 50 cent rofl|`|Fat6h6aRaa	kyle korver looks like ashton kutcher<br>  greg oden looks like lebron|`|IiWz11Kraa	I think Mo as a sixth man, b/c he always starts off good, and is lost somewhere in the 3rd, so i just  think it'd be good if they let him start late.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	Joey Graham and Stephen Graham<br>  Brook Lopez and Robin Lopez<br>  Jermaine O'neal and Emeka Oakfor

z7JsVzcnaa	Care? Sure. But sports shouldn't be coming at the cost of paying the rent or buying food. Even though times are tough for some people, watching a game can offer a tempoary release from what's going on, allow a person to have some fun for a few hours.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	people with jobs aren't in an economic depression.  people have different priorities as to what's important.|`|u2XdPAk6aa	I think that you should put your needs...ex.- Food, clothes, shelter, etc. before you wants but i still think that you shoudl care about sport but dont sacrifice your needs for you wants.
PxtmMAMnaa	first of all, make sure it is safe for you to do it on the ground first. doing a back tuck is all legs and your core. so do strengthening in those areas. its gonna take a while.. be patient|`|FrojZ51oaa	i wouldn't try it at home unless you have real Equipment.|`|5FbDXzr6aa	try to get ur backhandspring 1st|`|pC6KstvHaa	Get someone (dad, brother, even super strong sister or mom) to spot you, preferably on a mattress =]
