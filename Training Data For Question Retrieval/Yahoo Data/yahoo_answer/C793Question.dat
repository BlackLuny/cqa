Cooking it in a pan on the stove always makes my breading fall off, and I want it to be crunchy! Not as crunchy as Kentucky Fried Chicken, but just a little crunchy.      It's boneless, skinless, thawed, unbeated chicken breasts (I always forget to include this info and then people ask lol)      1. Cover in flour   2. Dip in egg   3. Roll in breadcrumbs (with seasonings of course)   4. Put foil on cookie sheet   5. Spray cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray   6. Put chicken on foil. Cook at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes.      I want it to be juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I heard that wrapping the chicken in foil, and then taking it off 15 minutes before it's done would help. But I'm only cooking it for 20 minutes!  Someone help me out with the oven times and the foil situation!!

20090227112801AA2Avzl	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	Is Lipton iced tea unhealthy?	I've recently started going to the gym and so naturally I also want to start eating a bit healthier too. I'm not obese, a little overweight though I think. Anyways, I love to drink iced tea, mainly Lipton Iced tea.   Image: http://www.americansweets.co.uk/ekmps/sh...    That's the exact one I drink. It's a mix that you add to water. Anyways, a friend of mine recommended I stop drinking it since she said it has a lot of sugar and it is very bad for me. I'm not so sure though. I mean, it's tea right? And I only put about 1 and 1/2 table spoons per cup so it's not like I'm pouring a ton of mix into the cup. Anyone else drink this or know if I'm alright drinking this. I usually drink about 2-3 cups of this 5 times a week so that's a good estimate of about how much I drink this. Thanks for the help.
