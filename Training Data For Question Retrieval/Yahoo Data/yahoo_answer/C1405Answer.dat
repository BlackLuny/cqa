AA10895669	No thought involved it has. Equal out come is a contrived interpretation by the socialist, lead by the feminists. The constitution spells out all the specifics and should have only had the term man defined as mankind and used in the context of persons. This would have eliminated the needs for the equal rights amendment. All persons who are citizens of the United states would then have been covered and represented by the Constitution.<br>  <br>  What we see happening has been the result of an incremental appeasement of specific voter demographics in order to gain favor with that demographic which has lead to a divisive climate in our country and the removal of rights from all peoples or at least the desire to up hold the rights of certain peoples..<br>  <br>  As well as the desires of some with agendas and the backing of coalitions to be punitive as well as advantaged.|`|asYc2Khfaa	I am for equality of opportunity not outcome<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  however modern day feminists ask questions like why there is wage difference, why more men in politics, why no equality of OUTCOMES<br>  <br>  I AM AGAINST MODERN FEMINISM|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	If it is going to be amended into the constitution I do not think they should refer to females specifically because further down the road full equality may be achieved.|`|9w9Q83tFaa	When Mikhail Gorbachev stepped down as president of Russia, he went to the U.S  and, from the Paradisio building in San Francisco he set about selling the idea of one world government to the U.S and the rest of the world.<br>  The last speech that he made to the Kremlin was that: "I am as I always was, a commited communist.<br>  Since coming to the U.S he has been feted , listened to and  encouraged to make his views known.<br>  It is an inevitibility that one world government will become a reality and, it will be 'socialist'  in it's ideals, at the right time it will be the vehicle for the antichrist to take full power, if anyone doubts this look at the real reason for the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, only one regime is left that opposes the West in their quest to subdue that region and that is Iran, they will be forced to submit or be conquered.<br>  It is not about the U.K or the U.S or any other goal, it is about world domination.<br>  Already in conjunction with the United States Dept of Agriculture and Monsanto, they have taken out a patent to include all seeds and plants to be modified in such a way that they will die and be sterile after one season, this means that you have to go back to the patent holder for more seed, not only that but you have to spray the seeds with a chemical patented again by these two entities to make the crop grow, I do not need to tell you what a potent weapon this is in the hands of your government,  OMEN!|`|AA10262819	It would be socialist if women were not already given a crappy deal.  The best interpretation of this would be if hypothetically women and men were going to play baseball together.  Women would be given women bats which are lighter and not as effective.  As if we were handicapped.  We want one bat for everyone.  Just like men have to, we would practice until we were strong and skilled enough to swing it properly.  <br>  <br>  We want the disparity taken away because it is not based on fact.  Women are not encouraged as children nor given the opportunity to try, fail, try again. If we fail it's because we are a women, not because we are inexperienced.|`|xsyAljhaaa	Eh, I thought we were already basically living in a socialist state. I honestly thought they gave up on that ERA foolishness over 20 years ago. I think if that garbage ever managed to pass, and it is very difficult to pass an amendment to the Constitution, we would end up as The United States of Sweden, with our armed services symbol being a penisless heraldic lion -- like they did to the Swedish military's symbol in the name of "gender neutrality."<br>  <br>  Edit: sex-blind laws like the VAWA? Makes me wonder if that unconstitutional law was ratified only to gain support for the unnecessary ERA? Nah, politicians are too stupid to do that. Doesn't that mean that all laws and special privileges that favor women would have to be revoked? And who said women were not logical...|`|TotgRmRZaa	could you include white males too.between 50-65,you think you are discriminated against!|`|uXqDYPNVaa	No, I don't. All the ERA will do is ensure that laws are sex-blind. It won't force private or even government organizations to pay men and women the exact same amount; meritocracy is safe.

1Ad7jJgwaa	Well darkness usually symbolizes fear in uncertainty. If you mentioned a specific problem of what's been bothering you lately, it'd be easier to relate this to it, which is probably what's causing these dreams.<br>  <br>  Most likely there is a problem going on with your family, because this is in your house, and you don't know exactly what it is or where it's stemming from. Maybe financial problems, problems between your parents, something like that. That's my best guess.|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	maybe its your brain telling you to stop smoking crack before you become a permaburny thus meaning the burnt out lights are the remittance of your mind|`|AA11595360	You didn't pay the electric bill. no im kidding<br>  <br>  I used to have dreams like that all the time. It wasn't always the same dream but it was the light never worked or never worked well where ever i was in my dream. <br>  <br>  I the dreams that happened to me in i was usually getting chased or someone was hiding from me. <br>  <br>  I found that it was a type of self sabotage. Whatever the reason i let the bad things in my dream happen to me. Maybe a esteem thing. But that feeling was predominant in all the dreams. Bad things would happen and i would allow it. <br>  So the light not coming on is your way of sabotaging your own dream. Could never run fast or punch hard in my dreams. And i would always remember thinking like you do. Oh the lights dont work again or i cant run again. You are conscience enough to realize that but not conscience enough to effect the outcome of the dream or do you want to...<br>  <br>  Your trying to turn the lights on is also a way of waking yourself up. If you cant wake yourself up you cant turn on the lights.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Maybe it suggests that powers that you once felt that you possessed are no longer under your control.  Things that used to be easy or automatic are suddenly not so.  It's sort of like you're losing your footing on your life.  <br>  <br>  I have a recurring dream with similar overtones, in which I'm trying to drive a car down on curvy busy road--but I'm in the back seat and cannot reach any of the controls.|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	I had the same and few days later my dad had a symptoms which are similar to stroke.

It also could mean that you don't understand something, or you are not informed well. Seeing a small light or a light switch means that there is help on the way and you will be able to finish with the "darkness". Being a dark cave means that you feel unprotected. Dreaming about darkness always refers to an emotionally dangerous situation which is not resolved.|`|FPGgaI3Yaa	it may be that you were afraid of the dark when you were young and this is your body remembering those times and still fearing them.  <br>  if you want to be supersticious, this dream traslates into the fact that there is someone in your family or group of peoples (friends or boyfriend type people) that your mind gets a weird feeling from and feels that when you let them into your house something bad weas gonna happen. but didnt.  and now your body is trying to figure out why it didnt happen and what could have happened.|`|ce3t8tWiaa	mabye you have some issue's from when you where a child, the lights not turning on in my opinion your trying to find something from when you where a child but your mind won't let you turn on the lights to see, and the thing that is lurking is the memory but as i said before your trying to avoid it.|`|cyh8uhAnaa	It's probably because it's hard to imagine light while you're surrounded by darkness while you're sleeping.

Girls tend to have such low self-esteem these days that it's important to give them positive compliments about their appearance.  <br>  <br>  For example, my cousin has an amazing body. She does pilates and exercises all the time...  According to her, she is the ugliest person alive.  Why does she think this? Because she's a red-head and is covered from head to toe in freckles.  So what?  She's gorgeous!  We've been telling her all her life how beautiful she is.  Only recently, in her early 20's, has she realized that guys like her.  Only recently has she begun wearing shorts, skirts and short sleeve tops (she used to always wear long jeans and long sleeve tops, even in 100 degree weather.<br>  <br>  So, for your Pappy to tell you that you have a nice body doesn't seem weird to me at all.|`|F45di0nIaa	If you were telling him you thought you were ugly and had an ugly body and he said No sweety you have a nice body, then maybe that would be okay but if he just said it then thats weird.|`|FQxbwbtlaa	it may b just being nic or pervy|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	ok is you Pappy your grandfather or your father? ether way that's just wrong. if you ask them for their opinion then that's on you but if they just said it out of no ware then that's on them and that's pretty wrong.

You guys broke up. these things happen every day and she really needs to get over it.

Can you think of anything you did that might have set him off or something? I can't really think of an explanation, because I don't knew the entire situation, sorry. Best of luck figuring it out though.<br>  <br>  If he does anything physical to you, like pushes you or something, then you need to report it to a staff member.|`|7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	That does sound strange. It is possible he's interested in you, or somehow you strike his fancy, but he's not sure, he's not comfortable with approaching you, or he somehow feels like you don't want him, or like him. So his feelings have led him to act awkwardly around you.<br>  That's really weird that he'd repeat things you said in a place that you could hear them.<br>  Without knowing if you had any other contact, or if you ever said anything about him that he may have found out about, etc., it would seem that, yes, he likes you.... especially when you say that he's so confident and talks to else everyone in class.<br>  I'm that way sometimes with women. I can talk people's ears off, both men and women, but when it comes to a woman I'm interested in, or one I have feelings for, I can be awkward around her. I could try to avoid her, feel nervous even making eye contact while walking down a hallway, but if she were to hand me something, I don't know if I'd look above her. <br>  Hope that helps.|`|mWLmImVEaa	NO he is not he just likes you

lDXh0jRVaa	Breasts are an evolutionary trait that show the ability for us to adamantly sustain children. The bigger they are the presumably more healthy/apt to bear children we are. It is also as simple as "I have boobs so I'm a female." It is something different for men to notice and differentiate us as a gender. Breasts carry fat reserves so if they are large we tend to be able to survive child birth better and are able to nourish our children. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, this is speaking as though we were still knuckle-dragging if you know what I mean. Obviously now there is no real reason to have large breasts other than to attract men.|`|i8uoiACxaa	I think because they are so significant to girls, guys notice them more. Like think of that we have them develop, we use them for breast milk, they are considered "private parts", they are considered artistic in art, and they kind of are just there on our bodies. Maybe guys think they are the only unique thing that girls don't show. IDK if that makes sense...haha|`|mHURCWV1aa	Probably cause it's always been passed on as something appealing and we learn from a lot of cues like ads that big boobs make girls hot.

94NYYq5Haa	Personality tests ask you questions that you think mean one thing, but really mean another.  <br>  Example:   True or False: I enjoy a race or game more when I bet on it.<br>  This question is from the MMPI and assesses masculinity.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, psychologists just have to observe individuals and how they react to stress.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	That's a common misconception. There are no tricks or deep analysis. They do what every normal person does to get to know someone- they ask questions and develop a relationship. Other than this, they are just armed with knowledge of different therapy types that can help and how to match people with the correct treatment options. <br>  <br>  There's no voodoo mind reading tricks. I promise.|`|CTTFsEl6aa	One that I commonly use is to ask them this:<br>  If you were given a choice between being a servant in heaven or a ruler in hell, which would you choose?<br>  The answer will immediately tell you alot about the person.
CRDl9nffaa	If you get to know men properly (and sometimes it's very hard because they're not used to be open and honest about their feelings and anxieties) you may find what I did. That they already do experience pretty much everything we go through in terms of their feelings, worries, insecurities, stress. <br>  <br>  They have different ways of talking about it and describing it. But underneath it's not so different.<br>  <br>  There are some experiences we don't share, but I've come to believe that those differences are few.<br>  <br>  And btw, yes I'd do it for fun for a little while. Why the hell not? But I'd want my man back pretty soon.|`|AA12095483	There really isn't any such thing as turning a man into a woman, unless you have a transgendered person who thought and acted like a woman but had a man's body. <br>  If you subjected a man to the chemical and physical processes that would turn him into a her, you would still not be able to touch his brain. That would remain masculine. The notion that having a man experience everything that women go through would alter their thinking processes doesn't stand up, because even though their bodies were subjected to the things that women go through, their mental reactions would not be female and they would neither understand what was happening or truly feel the way that women do.|`|mCAWxobNaa	Yes.  I want all men to suffer terribly—even worse than that because they are such terrible people for us having to have menses.  I want to punish them all for this now!!!!<br>  <br>  I am a contemporary Feminist and we're not supposed to admit that we hate men.|`|DvRz8657aa	Couldn't this same thing apply to men changing women into men if we could?<br>  <br>  Why would anyone want to do that, it would accomplish nothing imo.

7daadc8e86b66e23321da88992774adcaa	Because they have a sense of worthlessness. As such, they are unable to accept the love of others. They don't feel worthy of the love. And all your/the family's attempts to overcome that just fuel the fire. Technically, it's called cognitive dissonance. <br>  <br>  In such a case, when one is faced with an uncomfortable situation, they have a choice: change how they think/what they feel about the situation or distance themselves from the situation. Obviously, the second choice is the easier one to make. So every time a family member tries to 'help' the wounded one by loving them more, they further drive the person away, b/c it further makes them uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  The drugs and alcohol are simply the way to numb themselves to the feelings of unworthiness and obviously are addictive, so it's a double edged sword.<br>  <br>  The key is to get the person to confront the feelings of unworthiness, which will very likely require professional help.|`|naI5hGjHaa	genetics has a lot to do with it|`|af192a6562ef00219f613f2619a735ceaa	being inable to choose anything but drugs (or alcohol,porn or any other addiction) is exactly what an addiction is! what makes an addict an addict is that the drug habit COMES FIRST OVER EVERYTHING.  if the person were able to willingly choose to put his family first he would not be an addict would he?<br>  addicts need professional help to escape their addictions. even with help many rebound over and over back to their addiction or become cross-addicted. once an addict always an addict even if you are "recovered" and not actively "using".  <br>  <br>  wishing you peace and health to your family. i know how hard this can be on everyone.
ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	My dad died in 1992 with lung cancer. When I was told that he was dead I was in complete denial. No, MY daddy was NOT dead. Before I was allowed to view him in the emergency room I bargained with God to let him live.My own life for his.  I then began to become angry and blame God for taking him from us, but I knew it was not God's fault.  Once I seen him it sank in that he was really gone and there was nothing that I could do about it. He looked extremely peaceful and like he had never been sick at all. There was no way I would want him to come back and suffer anymore. So, I finally accepted it. Daddy was gone forever. I was numb through out helping moma with the funeral arrangements and after the funeral. Later, the pain of lossing him started to become more real and I changed. My moods were different, my eating habits changed. I could not work in the emergency room again and I had to change my occupation. Now it has been 17 years since losing him and at times the pain hits just like the day he died. But it is so much more easier to hold it together and deal with it better.|`|chfILbonaa	Well im 14 and when i was in 7th grade i went through this when my bf of 8 months broke up with me i will explain<br>  <br>   denial: this was short for me i wasnt sure if i was dreaming or if it actually happening<br>  <br>   anger: I got mad at my ex bf but i still really loved him<br>  <br>   bargainin: in a way i tried to buy him back i bought him snacks at school I was extra nice to him <br>    depression: lasted all summer vacation and part of the next school year i was about to die<br>  <br>     acceptance: finally after 2 years I am over him but for some reason i still love him unconditionally its hard to explain|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	You can go through them in different orders, and yes, the relationship of the person can cause the different orders.<br>  <br>  Such as your son who did drugs and died from AIDS...you would probably be angry first--that he caused his own death.

b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	It depends on what definition you use. The basic definition for intelligence is: the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge. <br>  <br>  Part 1: If the test is based on reciting facts they should receive similar scores assuming there aren't any external factors such as lack of sleep, hunger, anxiety, etc. When it come a test where you must apply your knowledge like physics (not the formula plug-n-chug type of physics, i mean REAL physics) I would imagine someone who studies and practices the concepts will perform better than the person who just read the chapter once.<br>  <br>  Part 2: I think that having an aptitude for social studies doesn't make you 'intelligent' (generally speaking). I believe in multiple intelligences, so, a person may be very good in that area and very bad in another. Think of your professors. You Chemistry professor may be horrible at math, and your Calculus teacher may not be able to name the presidents. But they are very 'intelligent' and gifted in their respective fields. As well, a skilled painter or musician who can't add, is certainly no less intelligent that a mathematician who can only draw stick people.<br>  <br>  Part 3: Yes, this happens a lot in high school. Just because you can memorize a formula or date or definition for a test doesn’t mean you are smart. In reality if you do not remember the 13 president of the US, or the formula of the Volume of a cone, you can always look it up. If you are in high school, i would suggest taking AP because a lot of the time the courses are like college level (if not harder!) and you must apply your knowledge. You cannot get by remembering just the formula.<br>  Hope that helped!<br>  <br>  ~chai|`|63hQUMbuaa	no because intelligence is interpreting information and that you have taken in and using it. Memory is just being able to encode information and recall it and not really using it. For example some autistic children who become savants have picture perfect memory and can remember tons of information. However, because of their condition they don't know what the information they remember means a majority of the time.|`|7daadc8e86b66e23321da88992774adcaa	I think you mean 'memorization'. Which is not the same thing as 'memory'. And no, intelligence is not tied to memories. But it may well be tied to the ability to memorize. <br>  <br>  But obviously, if a person goes over the material several times vs one who goes over it only once - absent photographic memory - then the first person should do better on a test. Intelligence has nothing to do with that.<br>  <br>  And no, a social studies test can not define your intelligence.<br>  <br>  As for your last question: The answer is yes.
lS1dv0Ahaa	A good place to start would be trying to raise your self esteem. You seem very self conscious and raising your self esteem would help you not feel like everyone is staring at you and you will gain confidence to be able to talk to people without feeling as anxious.<br>  <br>  If you feel tense, try taking a deep breath and try to stay positive. Thinking negatively will make your anxiety worse. Ask yourself, What is the worst thing that can happen?<br>  <br>  Most importantly, don't avoid social situations. It is better to be uncomfortable then to cause your anxiety to get worse.|`|jgF8NC8qaa	0ne thing u aughta remember-there is always someone like you and ur never alone.

The best thing to do is block out distractions and focus on finishing the assignment. If you're feeling tired do some exercise and continue. Don't take breaks until you finish the assignment!

You can be willing that the rain stops, or that your favorite team wins the game, or that a plane falls down and everybody there dies and I can assure you it won't happen just because of your desire.<br>  Let me tell you what happened to my cousin, to see if you can understand a little better. She dreamed and daydreamed that a certain accident was going to happen right in front of her house. She could vividly see ambulances, people injured, blood everywhere, and then one or two weeks later an accident similar to the one she had "foreseen" happened. She could not understand what was happening and at a certain point she was thinking the accident had happened because she had though about it, which is not true.<br>  Our brains have the capability to see in advance things that will be happening in the future, or things that are happening at the same time somewhere else (like a letter coming from a friend, a phone call, etc.), or things that happened in the past. Let us keep in mind that our minds are not limited by the barriers of time and space in any way.<br>  And yes, you have magical powers that all humans have but that we could never develop either because of fear, or presssures from our own environment denying completely this kind of things.<br>  .|`|b22d33b389f66522a42da38105df85caaa	Yes, you sound gifted to me. This is a talent that many people have that they can develop but seldom do. It is called "manifesting".<br>  <br>  Hey, if I were better at it, I'd have more money! But a lot of people fall into the trap of thinking that they can't do it, so they either don't try or when something comes about that they've thought of they dismiss it as a coincidence. <br>  <br>  You can finetune your skills by reading any of the books by a writer named SHAKTI GAWAIN. Google her name for a list of them.<br>  <br>  My fellow is very good at manifesting but he doesn't believe in it so it doesn't happen very often. I'm trying to train him but its an uphill battle so far. LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep your mind on good things to manifest.|`|UW9Trvrpaa	What we think about can attract the force that allows it to happen.

AA10937133	I can't understand why you would actually give yourself a sickness that could really result in permanent damage.  If you can get yourself so seriously sick, then why couldn't you fake being sick?  It sounds like the whole thing is faking don't you think?  Why don't you lay your leg across two chairs & have a friend step on your knee & snap your leg?  It will get you out of school and runs the same potential for permanent damage.  I'm not saying you need to talk to a counselor, but you should ask some of your friends instead of being anonymous on this forum.  Those friends will probably tell you to speak to a counselor.  If they don't, they're not your friends.  Good luck.  Adolescence can be tough but you'll get through it . . . as long as  you don't die from the flu.|`|1JSblCBsaa	Well that depends, is it worth dying over?<br>  If you get really ill you risk dying, so how about you just grow up<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way you really need that schooling.

hCVgzQd2aa	I think you actually touched on the meaning of this dream yourself.  It sounds like the part of the dream that makes you uncomfortable and stressed if being out of control, and feeling helpless to make the objects stay, or to save the objects.  <br>  <br>  Was there some event, however small it might seem, that made you feel out of control or helpless when you began to have this dream?  Even if it seems small, what is small might be very important to a 4 year old child.  <br>  <br>  If you can have lucid dreams, and you know that you are in the dream perhaps try one of two things.  First, command the object to stay, or command the force that is stealing the objects to stop.  Second, say out loud in the dream that you are okay with the objects leaving and that is is a part of life and it is okay.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|3lCz0VLWaa	i never heared of that|`|spq89t0Aaa	lallalallalal<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its 2 long

But I think that you are just fine, everyone gets cranky.|`|63hQUMbuaa	sounds like your energy levels throughout the day and when you function best|`|zj3vWnWuaa	Dude, I feel ya. <br>  Just like that too.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	bipolar|`|7cyqgJQnaa	either bipolar or on drugs|`|8JVEaeFsaa	i dont think you are bipolar. i can stand how some people label people like you to be like this. people with this disorder dont experience that radical of a mood change throughout the day. they go through weekly or monthly cycles i believe of ups and downs. before you ask others to diagnose you, examine what goes on in your life. bipolar is more than ups and downs, it is so much more than that.|`|n1MZefbqaa	You're probably so used to your routine that you mentally programmed your mind to feel that way all the time.  Your the only one that can change this but  it requires a lot of mental processing that at times leads many to fail.  If you want to really change then make sure that you do it for yourself and be sure that you fill yourself with positivism.|`|iJ2A7sr5aa	huh.......at least you have peace in the morning....24 hours I just hide from the presence of humanity just because I've been messed up all my life and have come to realize it the day I turned 18.....this is so ****** up!!!|`|z1BAYhP9aa	i think of your age when i read this text my opinion, age and community <br>  ( aka ) people around you and stuff like your house and neighborhood effect you strongly
ZJkwz1B5aa	This is different but I don't know about weird.  I remember when I turned 3, which is fairly young.  I have a very good long term memory to this day. Often surprising people who have experienced things with me.  <br>  <br>  Try going to a hypnotherapist, see if there are issues.  Probably not, but what the heck.|`|AA11570236	That depends on many factors, a bad childhood<br>  can be factor in not remembering.It's common not to remember things.I remember things as far back as Kindergarten.Even at 50 years old!|`|XjtZAFOyaa	nothing at all its actually very common...even for people who dont have bad childhood (like that will try to block them out) or people with good ones, they are just young and don't remember much its fine...im the same way|`|PTP8ptDbaa	well i wouldn't know exactly what to say, i am exactly the opposite! i don't think it's normal. can you remember anything, maybe something happened in your past and you wanted to avoid bringing it back in your mind so you have completely blocked out all memories near that time.<br>  and on the other hand maybe it is normal, i don't really have a theory if it's normal though.|`|Ict5JA4eaa	i barely remember anything for when i was little. not too many things. its different for everyone|`|NrH787NZaa	, i remember things from when i was 2 and im 16 now. well everyones memory is not the smae so...|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	no not weird at all. i like your name- sweet nibblets! i love that show!|`|9ZLOuqGvaa	I am 57.  I can remember back to 4 or 5.  Most are not exciting or important things.  I remember small things like smelling a flower, the rubarb plant and the shed in the back yard, walking to the corner store, etc.  The older memories are more like 'real' memories like being in class at school.<br>  <br>  I think it is unusual to have no memories at all for a long part of your life.   My sister lost a chunk of memory from a childhood concussion.  I lost the memory of my youngest sisters wedding from illness. (I can look at her wedding pictures and still not remember) Others loose memory from tramatic events/abuse.|`|AA11436843	no I don't think it's wierd....there are large chunks of my childhood that I simply don't remember<br>  in fact I hardly have any memories of it at all<br>  not sure if that's due to the fact that a few unpleasant things happened in my childhood or what, and, as I haven't the money to go to therapy, I guess I'll never find out the reasons|`|AA11032982	well its weird with me because i seem to only remember certain grades. like i can remember first and second grade, but NOTHING of 3rd, some 4th some of 5, all of 6th. but i do remember fun/exciting/tramatic things|`|JblWZcbbaa	No, I don't think most people remember much from their childhood.<br>  <br>  I'm only 18 and I remember next to NOTHING past two or three years ago.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	I don't remember anything from mine either (until like age 5 or so)...Only things I've seen in photos.|`|oZ5QPymuaa	Nah i dont remeber a thing. the important things will stick and the others wont|`|2b3eeb86bc8d64e12f3c71ade9c771eeaa	That's like you like smoked like too much pot...like.|`|7cyqgJQnaa	yea thats pretty weird|`|sAarmYbyaa	It depends on your current age and the age your looking back too.<br>  The human mind is like a motherboard it can only hold so much information. As you get older you'll find your self losing more of your memories. <br>  However, The loss of memories does not always mean a case of aging.<br>  Some "Diseases" that cause memory loss.<br>  For example (  Alzheimer's Disease ) (Parkinson's disease) (Huntington's disease) Because you may or may not know of the diseases I'll list them and meaning below, as short as possible  <br>  <br>  Alzheimer's Disease - is an illness which can cause mild to severe memory loss (mostly in people over the age of 65, but can be in 40 year old people as well.)<br>  <br>  Parkinson's disease - is a genetic defect which can always result in memory loss.(there may be some treat mints for this , but you may want to ask your doctor about it first)<br>  <br>  Huntington's disease - s an inherited disease which can result in memory loss.(do some research on your family and see if you find any thing of this nature)<br>  <br>  Know this, having memory loss is not always a sign of disease, It is common for people to forget , I mean you can't remember every thing can you?|`|bCwofEL1aa	depends what you define as childhood. assuming that you're talking from birth to about 12 or 13, it's understandable not to remember some things...but to forget everything, that's unusual. I've never heard of it before. I'm not going to jump to conclusions that you were anti-social, but it makes me wonder what you did all that time.|`|HPdBUsqXaa	i can relate, i believe i have memory problems because if i try and remeber anything past lets say a year ago i can't do it. I often find myself asking my parents about stuff happening in my childhood and telling them things i remember, but the things i remember never happened, so its like im making up my childhood whenever i "remember" something.|`|1n5BMzfOaa	Was your childhood something that you should remember? Anything exciting? Was your childhood boring? Either way, you are not the only one who can't remember their childhoods. You shouldn't dwell on the fact that you cannot remember much from your childhood.|`|adbe30c4db31f92dd2b1cdced05c307baa	I don't either.  I believe over the years I have repressed it out of my mind because my childhood was devastating. I believe that most people forget details of their childhood as they get older.|`|EzYgH0IJaa	i am 14 and i cant remembe anything from when i was 5 to the age of 9 i cannot remember anything not even what i did for my bday or who my bff was in 5th grade so im in the same situation as you are|`|nfLBSrY7aa	i remember many events from my childhood, i treasure those days! i think if you thought about your past all the way more you would have remembered them easier.<br>  <br>  hope i said that right >_>==<_<|`|D8ukWu82aa	i have a problem with that too. i sort of make memories off what my parents tell me. like stories and such. i do wish i had a better memory though|`|HMptdzjBaa	last thing i remembered in my childhood was waking up at the age of 4 and asking a lady(my mom) where was i.  i think it is normal.i think...|`|ebC4Uo02aa	not really, do you mean like when you were like 1yrs old through like 9? or is it like 10-15, if its 10-15 somthing might be wrong with your memory.|`|nfb6VTK5aa	depends how far out like 18-11 you should remember. If is 10-0 who cares because I don't remember half of the S**t that happened to me.|`|zN0IXUTWaa	same here. im 16 i cant remember anything. i feel like my life is wasted so far... but oh well. live life now.|`|E304zLGDaa	yeaaaaa|`|6BRglHwBaa	...<br>  yes..<br>  <br>  <br>  thats messed up..<br>  <br>  <br>  you shoudl ask someone... you know .. not on yahoo haha
BDHWZmfDaa	Tell the boss, and say you feel like she was treating you racistly assuming you use words like cracker, mabye you dont not every white person uses  ****** and it is kinda racist of her to assume you would use cracker to speak to her|`|9ibxX8EAaa	Approach the boss before she even gets there. Tell the boss, "I have something I would like to talk to you about. Do you have a moment?" Then explain what happened. This way, your boss knows your intentions were pure, and you won't look like you're just making excuses defending yourself. Good luck.
R7jkSmNqaa	Basically, it depends on the situation. One cannot really say that people who commit suicide do it on impulse. <br>  <br>  Those who commit such an act normally has a lot of negative emotions building within them. These are normally pent up anger, sorrow, depression, desperation, frustration and so forth. <br>  <br>  Killing oneself is seen by people as the ultimate way to escape the horrible reality. Since, as we all know, reality is a sad world. hence, suicide candidates have seen this truth and, unfortunately, magnified the sadness. <br>  <br>  On one hand, you can also say that it is done on impulse. As stated before, people who commit suicide has a lot of pent up emotions backing it up. The only thing needed is a trigger. It may be as small as not getting today's paper to something big like getting fired. This is true that in all essence, people who have pent up emotions welling inside them are walking time bombs.|`|AA10873745	Agh. I was just thinking of a friend who committed suicide last summer. I think Anthony is right. I know she had thought about it for years. Not a very good decision. It pretty much wrecks all your other options. I wish people would stay and fight.|`|4SaRvH3daa	It's fairly obvious that an overwhelming majority do it for fun.|`|MSIf48X7aa	Majority of people have a well-thought-out plan|`|ixHwF4apaa	may be out of fun|`|7cyqgJQnaa	most have wanted to do it for weeks, months, or even years, and finally go through with it
ZDFP11leaa	Yeah I know what you mean. It hurts but it doesn't stop me from caring about them.|`|681f09c6bbc209df0f295d98e8487bdaaa	They don't care because they are not good enough for you. They have different wants then u do.  You are everything you want to be and can be what ever u want . You will find that the right person to care for will care back. you will know who they are by the light in their smile and the lite of their heart.<br>  Smile from your heart.. It works|`|uojR7vmEaa	i care about a lot of people actually i care about everyone if i knew anyone who died i would probably beat myself up about it and when ever i see a accident on the road i always worry about that person so there are some people who care but some people actually dont because they dont have a heart jk idk why???|`|ixHwF4apaa	on my personal intrest.<br>  i select things, and take care for those things.<br>  if it is not in the selective catg. i dont care<br>  (it is applicable to all)
N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  To dream that you are pregnant, symbolises an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.  <br>  <br>  To dream that you are taking a pregnancy test, may be a metaphor for a new phase you are entering in your life (a new job, relationship, etc.) You may feel that you are being put to the test as to whether you are prepared or ready for these changes.  Alternatively, this dream may be literal in meaning and address your anxieties/fears of getting pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|DaurttTJaa	Sounds to me like you are really worried about becoming pregnant. If you are having unprotected sex, then you could really be worried about this. If you are having sex at all, and you are afraid that you will get pregnant, then that is why you are dreaming that.|`|SvsDQ0poaa	It may be completely unrelated to events in your life associated with pregnancy, per se.  Perhaps you have a fear of this and certain stressors in your life are just bringing such dreams up.  Sometimes it's just a manifestation of our underlying stress.|`|rurfFLDkaa	maybe ur just weird ;p jk stace|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	we jsut do us gals <br>  i am preggo and dream i am not .. waiting for my last 10 weeks so i dont look like a whale
weDd8uuDaa	One day at a time. Focus on the little things. Sunshine, flowers, naps in the afternoon. Sit down and watch the world go by. You dont have control over the world, but theres times when it turns out beautifully just the same. I think, that if you constantly worry about it, then the worry will make you sick because it's just going to eat at you and waste your energy. <br>  <br>  Find ways to distract yourself from the worry. Volunteer, do extra things outside the house. Help someone else who is fighting or has fought cancer, someone who has gone through the same thing as you and battled their way out. Sometimes you can borrow a little of someone else's courage and use it as your own. <br>  <br>  Good luck, you deserve the best xox|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Matthew 6:25-34<br>  "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?<br>  "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.|`|JVHCFXXVaa	I know many, many people who had cancer that never had it return. Some as long as 40 years. You should do some volunteering so you can keep your mind on helping others. When you think about other people's problems and issues yours will seem very small and manageable.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	You already know the answer to this question.  You answered it in your question

If they were black cats you were drowning it might mean something positive.  If  they were white cats then you might be ignoring or rejecting or "drowning out" good, sound advice.|`|HzkRpjhEaa	Dream symbols are different for each individual.  Never trust someone who tells you that a particular thing means something to everyone, like cats mean death, or cats mean you're afraid of something, or whatever it might be.  Cats might mean one thing for you and something else for a different person.  If you are interested in better understanding your own personal dream patterns, you might want to start keeping a dream journal.  It won't be long before you start recognizing patterns and figuring out what different symbols, objects, or people mean to you.<br>  <br>  As for this particular dream, it is possible that the cats represent something in your life that you find repulsive and want to get rid of.  Note that I am not saying that that is what cats mean for everyone, lol.  I'm basing this on the feeling and actions in your dream, not the actual object of a cat.  Also consider that, often, dreams represent parts of ourselves.  The cats might be pieces of yourself or your own personality of which you desperately want to rid yourself.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	CAT (common dream animal totems)<br>  <br>      * Associated with independence, cleverness and unpredictability<br>      * Look for magical and mysterious happenings in your life<br>  <br>  You could easily be in an internal conflict with your independence and possibly unpredictable nature.|`|YRd5AM5uaa	WEIRD I had that SAME EXACT dream, weirdest part for me was the next morning when I got up there were two soaking wet dead cats in my kitchen pantry|`|p20v99N2aa	Geez, how un-chrisian like of you. You are supposed to love all God's creatures.|`|pC6ZfvYOaa	I wish I knew the whole sequence of the dream...like were ther other people involved...etc<br>  cats can resemble witchcraft...have youdabbled in that?<br>  I hate to say this but the Harry Potter movies are not good for us to watch...a friend of mine said that she saw a guy who use to be a warlock and was delivered from it and now is in the ministry and he said that when he was  sorcering they would just laugh be cause in the movie it was teaching children their secrets and that it would influence them into witchcraft.....scary if you ask me...<br>  seems to me that there is an evil that you want to purge out of your life...|`|3lCz0VLWaa	your mad because you want a cat because you cat have it
cFrtOg45aa	Maybe they are telling you what you need to hear to inspire you. To motivate you in the right direction. Maybe they actually think very highly of you and believe you are wasting your life and need encouragement. For they know if you hear the right words it might be the thing to turn your life around. I would try and look at it from a more positive point of view. Then such a negative outlook. Would you really want somebody to tell you your a scum bag, good for nothing loser. Like that is going to change you and inspire you.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	I do that and always have, i'm now at the point where I don't know what i want or how my life ended up like this. With no-one wanting me to be a certain something or behave a certain way, im completely lost.<br>  <br>  It's something that is trained into people from a young age this days, just be one of the sheep :(|`|zZY3JX30aa	Easily. Most people want to hear what they want to hear, they don't want the actual truth; and most people are willing to oblige them, because they want the same thing. They are not secure enough in themsleves to handle or otherwise deal with a possibly unpleasant "truth".<br>  <br>  Any more, when people ask me a question, before I answer, I ask, "Do you want the truth, or do you just want to feel good about yourself?"|`|AA12047401	Because they are afraid to voice their opinions and come up against opposition, they are afraid of offending people and of getting into arguments.   Perhaps they were honest with someone and the receiver got angry or upset...<br>  <br>  <br>  It would make communication and life in general a whole lot easier if people really were honest, though.   And maybe we we would have a tougher skin to accept the truth...|`|qD5BS5Plaa	we do it for what is best. sometimes the truth isn't right because the persons perception of truth is distorted so we have to curve them around they're distorted perception to what is more clear, but some may be so stubborn to not listen so we must incorporate tactics to get them to what we believe(confidently) what is clear and concise.

I'm also a woman. It would be pretty stupid for me to think females are inferior!! <br>  <br>  I don't exactly oppose feminism - I'm more like a conscientious objector. There are some things that feminism gave women that I am very thankful for, but the movement has changed from something great and worthy of loyalty to something ugly. The ideologies it espouses these days are a far cry from those at its inception. I don't like the sexism, the inequality, the man-bashing and the attempt to gain special privileges. It's why I'm not a feminist.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Some are, some aren't.<br>  <br>  Most GWS anti-feminists are both anti-female and anti-male, in the sense that they want to pigeon hole everyone into very rigid gender roles and don't accept individual differences. "Equal but different" is just a politically correct phrase to hide their sexism. They also sometimes slip and replace the term 'feminist' with 'women', basically using their rants against feminists as a front against all women that don't meet their rigid criteria and our sex as a whole.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I believe we're all familiar with that phrase, "If you're not with me you're against me." All it is, is an invitation to the path that leads toward paranoia.<br>  Why do you think that females are inferior?

I am not against equality, which women and men already have.|`|WKyPDbglaa	No. I am sure there are few misogynists but by and large they hold no influence and don't care about men's rights and gender equality/equity.<br>  <br>        I could use feminist theory itself to state that men simply do not have the political power to be anti female but that isn't necessary because that type of theory justifies hate and ignorance and since it doesn't exist except for a few people who have baggage from bad divorces..  Something that could be easily corrected by changing law's to be fairer and getting rid of biased judges. <br>  <br>     By and large it is the movement and what feminism is trying to do and has been done in western civilization that is being opposed.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	I think women are different to and equal to men. <br>  <br>  I support gender equality (equal voting rights etc), but I oppose the modern feminist movement because it is anti-male. The original feminists would be turning in their graves to see what has happened to the feminist movement.<br>  <br>  Do you judge someone by their fine words or by their actions? George W Bush once described himself as a peacemaker - this makes as much sense as modern feminists claiming to be promoting equality.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  ""Equal but different" is just a politically correct phrase to hide their sexism"<br>  LOL! This is the first time I have been accused of political correctness! Feminism got carried away and confused abut the idea of equality, and has managed to convince many people that men and women are exactly the same. Confusing equal worth with 'exactly the same' is a silly idea and dangerous in practice e.g. women thinking they should do jobs that require male strength (e.g. fireman) and work the same hours as men, even if this means putting their child in daycare at an age when the child really needs its mother. Ignoring these basic biological differences is frankly pretty nutty, and one day when we all wake up from feminism we will be amazed that we every took that kind of nonsense seriously.|`|bTMdpMW9aa	I think there's a huge difference between anti-feminists and people that just aren't part of the movement. I'm for one apart of the movement but I try to understand not everyone will be.<br>  <br>  But on Y!A, many people on here seem to be anti-feminists straight up only because they seem to bash on women and general plus believe all feminists are ugly and that we're only feminists because we can't keep a man. *eye roll*<br>  <br>  EDIT: BikerChick, men and women ARE equal but just different. So you're right about us being different because we have different qualities but we still should be equal because I'm pretty sure you want to be treated equally and not less than a man.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	I'm not a femininst, but I am not anti female or anti female rights.

Or maybe you want this person to love you more and are worried that you won't be able to grow a stronger relationship before it's too late. Or if this person is making a change in their life, such as getting married or moving, you might feel like they're dying and you will not be able to love each other as much.

Alcohol doesn't help his cause either. Also answering his own questions and going back and forth from coherent conversations to non coherent is another effect of schizophrenia. I am no doctor but there is nothing YOU can do for your friend. His problems are too big for you unless he wants to help himself. This symptoms point to schizophrenia but there could be other things we don't know about which only a psychologist or psychiatrist could really understand. But like you said.

Good luck in your decision : )|`|1swTOWt9aa	dreams aint much to worry about sometimes girls get feelings about other girls dont mean your bi just mean u are curious :)|`|guhl8WjYaa	you might just have a little girl crush  lol or your just thinking about her alot and in dream that just sort of happens|`|s6itMDRTaa	could be you miss her <br>  dreams don't mean anything it's nothing to worry about|`|XU9kfVmKaa	it means you want to experiment with girls you not les or bi allot of girls go thru that fase|`|oCRpWgfDaa	Don't worry ive had REALLY WEIRD DREAMS and im not bi,or gay im str8:)|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Could be that you're missing her and would like to be her friend again. <br>  <br>  Could also be that you are sexually frustrated and are using someone who you were close to to act out your sexuality with in your dream.<br>  <br>  Not unusual, you may have been closer to her than you have been to anyone else.|`|94ITHKFTaa	haha i have dreams where i'm f*cking tila tequila and other girls a lot...<br>  moreso than i do about boys.<br>  it's really hot i love those dreams<br>  <br>  you think about experimenting with girls, like i do during the day.<br>  <br>  ...but you can't actually do it, so your brain plays around at night ahhaa<br>  <br>  thats all sweetie ur not bi or anything|`|dWG3TVk8aa	Don't take it too seriously. You may have some unresolved issues with her. You have to decide whether it's worth rehashing.|`|xkeSwj3Naa	Maybe you're bi/lesbo.|`|lQ57i2cOaa	maybe ur bi? lol idk or maybe...
cn9x6wxfaa	Just stop, step back and think, don't do anything you can't be truthful<br>  about or be ashamed of. If you get rattled because someone else wants results right now of any kind; anything and right now; just stop,<br>  What is best for you is always the right way. This gives you time to<br>  think, so do it! Listening and thinking is a lost art. Get alone, just by <br>  yourself and "READ HOW !" Don't let anyone else know what you are doing, it's your secret. When you get good and accomplished, you<br>  will have all the answers to life or can find them within yourself, simply because; "you listened for the question and have time for the answer"|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	you are not stupid! dont listen to them. you are a sophmore in college. that says a lot about you. i think you have a very low self esteem. low self esteem causes depression which also causes forgetfulness. you may have a little add because you get so overwhelmed. a little medicine wouldnt hurt you. it may make you feel like yourself again. you remind me of my sister and it breaks my heart. i hope that you regain your self confidence and realize that you are smart and important! because you are! good luck!|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	I think we were separated at birth.<br>  I am about the same way except im not overwhelmed on tests, usually, and  and i don't blurt out stories (I'm too nervous of how people will judge me if i say something stupid).<br>  <br>  I don't think you're slow at all, you're probably rather advanced and the things around you are too stupid to comprehend. lol.|`|BUvvstsjaa	I need the same answer.  Reading what you describe is like reading about myself.|`|9ZLOuqGvaa	I don't think you are slow; you just have a lot of 'stumbling blocks' in your life.  I think people have 'tools' useful in life or 'stumbling blocks' that make life harder.  A 'tool' could be a great memory.  A 'stumbling block' could be very bad eye-sight in a person with a very visual memory.<br>  <br>  It has been a long time since I went to college, but I think they have more help for students than they did 30 years ago, so I suggest that a lot.<br>  <br>  1.  Short attention span/forget easily/impulsive/people need to repeat things:  <br>  <br>  Could be related to something like Attention Deficit Disorder.  My nephews have it, but girls can have it too.  One nephew used behavior-modification to compensate and the other used both behavior-modification and medication.   Maybe your college counselor, or college health people, or your family doctor can help you get tested.<br>  (I've read they treat adults for ADD now)<br>  <br>  2.  Procrastination.<br>  <br>  You have identified it as being caused by fear of hard work (fear of failure).  See if your college health/mental-health people can help.  There are also books and support groups for procrastinators.<br>  <br>  3.  Terrible in math: <br>  <br>   Some people are just terrible at math.  Some people that are bad at math are good at 'English' type of studies.  Some are bad at both.<br>  <br>  I can program a computer, but can't do math.    I compensate by practicing basic math skills (I have not practiced enough to multiply above 6's.)  In college I could not get past advanced calculus and had to switch from computer-engineering to business-programming.<br>  <br>  However, I code 4 or 5 dimension tables by visualizing them.  From the shocked reactions of my fellow programmers, I don't think this is something most people can do.  [However when I sit with my eyes closed building the picture of the matrix in my head, my supervisor has asked 'Are you asleep?'.  If she does this at the wrong time I loose the whole thing, arrgggh!]<br>  <br>  4. People need to repeat things over and over;<br>  <br>  You could be one of those people who don't take in auditory information easily.  I am a highly visual person.  I understand things easiest when I can read or visualize the information.<br>  <br>  Auditory or spoken information just does not soak into my brain.  I compensate by taking notes; which gets the spoken info into my brain visually.  Sometimes I don't even have to refer back to my notes.<br>  <br>  5.  Forget easily:  <br>  <br>  I have memory deficits caused by many surgeries in childhood, which caused mini-stroks, which caused memory problems.  They are just now figuring out about mini-strokes.  All my life I thought I was dumb or not paying attention enough.  Now I think being smart and having a good memory are not necessarily the same thing.  Smart people can have a bad memory and 'somewhat dim' people can have a photographic memory.<br>  <br>  I compensate by making lists and writing myself notes.  Today they may be able to test your memory to see what the problem is and fix it.  Again see if your college counselor or health people can help.     <br>  <br>  6.  Blurt out answers without thinking/sharing something slightly related:  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you just need better people skills/impulse control.  I think you improve this by living life.  Be aware of what you need to improve and always try to do better than last time.  But, who knows, maybe there are classes or support groups for this too.<br>  <br>  On the other hand if impulse control problem is from ADD, that could be treated when ADD is treated.  One nephew was the typical go-a-mile-a-minute child, the other was very laid back, but could not concentrate.  <br>  <br>  7.  Get overwhelmed on tests.  Maybe there are classes (or college counselor can help you find) help to improve your test taking skills.<br>  <br>  8.  I suggest you look into being tested for depression too.  Depression can also mess with your memory and paying attention.<br>  <br>  You have picked up on this stuff much younger than I did.  I hope you can get help diagnosing and fixing (or compensating) for your 'stumbling blocks'.  Good Luck|`|Yxaht4Cbaa	You need to research Dr. Amen and SPECT scans.   Most people with ADD/ADHD or a variation on the theme are brilliant people.    Brilliance equals more neuron connections in the brain.  For some reason people who have that are more sensitive to things like heavy-metal pollutants, chemicals, etc... and can be damaged by things in everyday life easier than "normal" people.   <br>  <br>  What you describe a lot is that when you focus on a task it becomes harder...  Dr. Amen scans brains at rest and then brains concentrating on a task... people with damage show "holes" where there should be "solid" area in the concentrating, functioning brain.  Alzheimer's, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, strokes, tumors, ADD/ADHD, bi-polar, concussions, etc. all show up as "holes" in different areas.     <br>  <br>  There are natural supplements that can balance the neurochemicals to help the areas of the brain work smoothly.   Sometimes some people need to eat meat or pasta or avoid cheese to help themselves.  <br>  <br>  Anyways the different regions of the brain have functions like car parts:  brakes, gas, and speed control.  People who blurt things out have too much gas or "fuel" and not enough brake chemical in the brain.<br>  People who have hit their heads at any time are at 100% risk for Alzheimer's and will have functioning issues.<br>  <br>  When you try to focus on something and you can't it is because that region of the brain may have a "hole" and needs help.<br>  <br>  Now understand that nowadays with weaker genes probably everyone has a slight imbalance in one way or another... the Autism Disorder Spectrum is now how neurological issues are spread out.  Basically just like there is diabetes, etc, there are brain health failings... Autism is at one end of the spectrum, Alzheimer's at the other end and asperger's, ADD/ADHD, bipolar, schiz., and lesser symptoms are in the middle.    You don't have to have full blown ADD to have a few symptoms of it.  Some would call it learning disabilites, but this doesn't make a person "stupid".  Far from it.  Some of the most talented, productive people on the planet have these traits.  You have gifts, so don't "diss" yourself or give into others labels of you.<br>  <br>  People have a hard time understanding a lot of the symptoms, because they don't realize the person isn't trying to be insensitive or rude, or seemingly lazy, or dense.  They really can't help it.  <br>  <br>  Also when the neurochemicals aren't in balance your transfer of short-term memories to the long-term storage is hendered.  That isn't your fault!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The heavy metals can be kelated out of your brain and that will help prevent Alzheimer's down the road and help your brain function now.  The neurochemicals could be balanced with the help of a naturapath or a doctor who believes in using vitamins and natural "medicines".  Stay away from the doctors though that use mind-altering states of consciousness though, that will really mess with your head and heart!!<br>  Also traditional meds like ritolin, etc. aren't the answer either...  Natural is best...the others have side effects that are too risky, too addictive!!!...<br>  <br>  Hope you will take all this seriously and take over the responsibility for your health care so you can get what you need to be the fully functioning Awesome YOU! <br>  :D  <br>  You're NOT stupid, so ignore those comments.    You don't know what you don't know, but now you should have something to work with to get help for yourself.  Also, your parents do love you, but when people can't "fix" their loved ones they can sometimes be harsh when they think the person can and isn't doing all they are capable of.  Unfortunately neither you or they knew what the real problems were so they could only see the actions and try to guess at their causes...  They were wrong, and in time I'm sure they will see that.  Do the research, get the help, and then see how releaved your family is! <br>  Good luck!

Dead relatives or family members are gone, I never saw them nor be with them so how can I tell whether they are good at their life or not is really up to them.<br>  <br>  THE DEAD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LIVING at present. The dead has their own life to live so does myself. Their times and mine are not the same. I enjoyed luxury living while my forefathers couldn't even open a canned of sardines without a canned opener during those times or even enjoyed a cool breeze of an air-conditioner. STOP ADMIRING YOUR DEAD GREAT GRAND FATHER, he doesn't even know you or even knew who will exist. You feel something strange because the picture is quite old and the melancholia FEELING zip in, that's it nothing strange about it. If I were you I rather look at the scenic view of a mountain top or a ranch than looking at old photo's of dead relatives.  They are DEAD & GONE. There is nothing you can do about it or have the power to returned them back. <br>  <br>  Need to be a good person? Why need? You should be a good person not only for your great gpa, but to your life as well. A good person is well liked compared to a bad one. Bad ones are buried and forgotten while the good always be remember by. <br>  <br>  The dead has nothing to do with me, I have to finished this life I began the dead relatives has their own now it is me who got one.

Also, the fact that your mother was the one who came into your room and saw what happened tells me that she may be the one putting the pressure on you, or that she may be observing what's happening.  Has she either put real pressure on you to do or achieve something, or perhaps she has been trying to get you to relax and get a hold of yourself.  Either instance could be indicated by her coming into your room; but it definitely tells me that she plays a part in whatever it is.  Just try to relax and get a good grasp on life and whatever comes your way.  Don't worry too much, and take everything in stride; and you'll be fine.  Good luck, and God bless!|`|uscHnFPtaa	To dream that you are urinating, symbolizes a cleansing and release of negative or repressed emotions.

zZY3JX30aa	Not for me.<br>  <br>  Possibly for you.<br>  <br>  Invoking "should" makes your question one of morality.

AA11183969	B. surveys and experiments<br>  <br>  Psychologists normally use surveys because it is more direct and uses less resources. Ganzfeld procedure is not common and mainly done by parapsychologists to experiment telepathy. lie-detector tests requires the employment of professionals and therefore, hard to execute.<br>  <br>  I chose B because it uses the least resources and easier to execute.|`|ba6b5fc0002452dcde156920c951dcb7aa	B
AqXYZb9iaa	I do believe in my faith - Hinduism. But I'm not superstitious. I would, therefore, not attach too much importance (other than psychological) to a dream.<br>  If what you felt in your dream was awe-inspiring and not fear -inducing, I'd call it a good dream.<br>  <br>  You admit that you have no knowledge of Hinduism and are not sure of what a Hindu Deity even looks exactly like. Perhaps you have a deep desire to explore the religion. I'd say, go ahead....not because I want to populate my faith (we don't proselytize), but because that seems like the logical thing to do.<br>  <br>  You don't have to convert or abandon your own current faith to study another. If you don't find what you were looking for, you could return to the folds of another.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|nulE8zdBaa	Unlike what Christians believe, God comes to us in all different forms. God takes all forms; God is all forms and yet is formless at the same time. <br>  <br>  Your dream is magnificent. In part it is parallel to what Saul of the New Testament experienced when he persecuted the new Jewish sect whose members called themselves Christians. He hated them and wanted to exterminate them all. As he was walking towards Damascus he suddenly heard a voice from above: “Why are you persecuting me?” And then he was struck down by a brilliant white light. This changed Saul to Paul and the persecutor soon became to persuader. In other words he became a believer in Christ and started to preach about Jesus and founded the church in Greece.<br>  <br>  Your dream follows basically this same pattern of conversion, although you are not persecuting anybody! You are in a car in your dream which means you are moving forwards in life. The path of your life is a vast stretch and like the range of the dream wide open. It means that anything can happen. When the sky turns black it emulates the conditions of a storm. Its darkness is a message to you that your mind is in darkness. Then, like lightning in a storm, a white light burst out of this darkness and its brightness illumines your mind with the light of God. But he does not come to you in the guise of Jesus; instead he appears as four gigantic deities that are reminiscent of Hindu deities. Their gigantic size indicates how important this will be in your life from now on. Their size also connects Heaven and Earth and the rainbow colours indicate that a bridge between Heaven and Earth, between God and your mind has been established. The rainbow is an ancient symbol of heavenly and earthly things coming together. Noah, after the flood, saw a rainbow overhead which sealed a pact between him and God.<br>  <br>  Would you believe that at the very moment I mentioned the word lightning a massive thunderbolt struck and lit up the night. If I wasn’t keen to get this interpretation to you I would not continue working on the computer for all could fuse… And it did. The computer went down with a lightning strike, but half an hour later the power came back on and so I was able to send you my interpretation of your dream. <br>  <br>  I am sure you will never forget your dream. It is what psychology calls a big dream. It is a transforming dream. Your life will change from now on. I would not be surprised if you were to study Hinduism in one way or another in the near future.

4c03ca2af0670791eae96802dcc67d06aa	First of all, the fact that you were able to physically feel everything simply means that you were having a lucid dream.  People have them sometimes.  Typically in dreams, because you are asleep, all your physical senses are shut down.  However, in lucid dreaming, your senses linger on, and you can feel everything as you do in real life.  It also means that you have more control over yourself in your dreams.  You can control your actions.  Therefore, it is easier for you to realize that you're feeling it and that it is very real.  You can remember this dream more clearly than others, and you can remember exactly how it felt.<br>  <br>  The fact that everything that was there faded away into nothingness symbolizes the breaking away of you two and the friendship that ended.  Then you are confronted by it.<br>  <br>  Obviously, this guy has done something to make you hate him.  In your dream, you enjoy fighting him and killing him.  This indicates that you feel some sort of power over him...whatever that power may be.  Because you hate him, you get pleasure from it.  The fact that the fight is to the death indicates that you want to separate yourself from him completely and remove him from your life.<br>  <br>  You should confront these feelings and figure out what you want to do about it, as well as why you feel this strongly.  That's the only way to get over it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|pC6ZfvYOaa	I answered another dream of yours and I really think you have repressed feelings... are you a people pleaser??? <br>  <br>  People pleasers have repressed feelings because they are so busy trying to be nice to everyone to make themselves feel worthy... but it has a back lash because you start to feel like every one wants a piece of you and then you make commitments you can never keep <br>  you are feeling an empty space in your heart??? hence the emptyness of buildings???<br>  I would think the ring of light is from God wanting to protect you and surround you with His blessings...  but sometimes ther are hidden issues that need to be dealt with.  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps|`|vvinM5C0aa	probably a mix of adrenaline high and duking it out with some guy you hate.don't worry about it, just a dream. just keep in mind that in real life, fighting will get you into serious trouble and violence never solves anything-except creates more violence and hate. war and crime rates can attest to that.|`|kqCvVx1Saa	perhaps youre tired of always being so peaceful?<br>  also whenever i get into fights i tend not to notice things around me, which might be what the missing buildings represent?
1ylpCN3yaa	Yes, I used to work in various shops, and people can be so particular and demanding. I used to wonder how they got on with everyday life at home and in their jobs, because nothing stays the same and you have to cope with change and somethings are just not worth worrying about. <br>  <br>  The worst was when I was a maid in a 5 star hotel and a lady guest got so upset that there were no hangers with out clips to hang up her skirts and they will get "clip marks" on them! Honestly she was on the verge of tears, luckily we found some with the notches in them so she could use the loops on the inside of her skirts to hang them.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	Oh i know! they clearly haven't had to work in a store like that or they'd know.<br>  <br>  I worked at a state park office and people would ask me about all sorts of q's about the other state parks and got ticked off when i didnt know..there's more than 20 parks in my state.<br>  <br>  Just because I'm working a summer job at a state park to pay for college does not mean i researched every park in my state.<br>  And they would come in to rent a cabin (there are like 30 cabins) and would want to know what type of floors were in them???? (Like i can remember which ones have tile and which have hardwood.... get real!)<br>  <br>  People are morons sometimes.|`|7cyqgJQnaa	the question can be answered with simple economics. when you put on that uniform you two are more than two random strangers. you are the seller, and he is the buyer, in a competitive market, the buyer holds all the power, and he/she knows. they use it to take advantage of you, be rude to you, and treat you like a second class citezen. it happens to all of us, and we do the same things to others in uniform all the time.|`|cl6NXb61aa	Ha ha ha so true.<br>  <br>  Customers are so annoying most of the time.

833010ca4d1e44b4c2a847f3a4ca945eaa	I think at some point we muck up our lives and get off track. It is whether or not you decide to pick your self back up and look at life as a challenge again. I feel like I did some what of the same partying you did...except I blew over $100,000 dollars and when I came off my partying streak I had to move in with my parents at age 25 and re-invent who I was. I hope you have some one like a mom or dad that can be supportive while you get back on your feet. You already have a degree which is a better start than a lot of peeps out there. So use and focus on the assets that you do have, don't look at all the things you don't have. Start writing down short and long term goals and start accomplishing them. Start making your self happy and soon this will shine through and you will find some one that wants to be a part of that in your life. Just remember focus on the simple things in life and never take things for granted. I hope this helped as it is what I did to get myself on track. I wish you the best of luck and if you ever need some one to chat with just ask me for my e-mail.|`|RSiWvBecaa	think overit and take a good decision|`|gxNBtFFMaa	First of all, you aren't the first one that has been in this position before. Believe me, things could have gotten a lot worse. You could have become pregnant, or gotten a drunk driving ticket, or made a bigger mistake than just going out every night.  I like the fact that you have realized what you have done. I think this is the first step in getting back on track. You've made your mistakes and now you can learn from them. <br>  Start by looking at the positives. It may be hard but you need to be able to look at yourself in the mirror with a smile rather than a disappointing look. Start dressing for success again. Play the part. The job market may be weak but giving up before you get started will only make things worse. Start networking with friends and other students. Let them know your skills and what you are looking for. The word of mouth can be a powerful thing.<br>  You don't have to give up going out but you do need to work on your control. Make some goals and think positive. Sulking in the negative will only make you worse. You are young, and you need to enjoy this time in your life but don't let it ruin you. The other thing I would recommend is taking time to relax over the next few days. I know you are losing your job but stay calm. Overwhelming yourself is not healthy. I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|1ylpCN3yaa	At least you still got your mum and you sound like you have brains, so you should be OK. You sound like you have your priorities set now and now you have to get to it and clean up the mess you made. But remember being in a relationship is not the be all and end all. A boyfriend or husband is nice to have but it's more important to have a job and a family or friends that will stand by you. Next time someone breaks up with you yes it is likely to happen again, you will accept it more easily.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	Try to analyze the situation and discern if you have the strength and fortitude to provide an environment for your children which will allow them to reach their personal potential.  In many cases, we cannot measure ourselves or others against the societal norm.  Instead, we must understand the potential of an individual and attempt to help him to utilize his personal abilities and strengths to achieve within his specific intellectual and emotional spectrum.<br>  <br>  It is up to you to take on this task to be a supportive and positive influence on these children.  You may need to subjugate some of your life goals in order to provide the extra support and comfort that they need.

That is the true intention of feminism. It is about giving women choices in their lives and the same opportunities as men get. I don't understand why that is such a bad thing.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	You're using the wrong comparison again-if anyone is not going to use make-up, it's feminists. So actually, more anti- and non-feminists would be good at concealing the truth if you compared honesty and dishonesty to whether a woman was not or was using makeup (which is not a great comparison either). And it's a very old stereotype to say that feminists are ugly, hon. You can do better than that can't you? <br>  <br>  Feminism is easy to get because it's obvious that both men and women aren't getting a fair shake. It's not rocket science, you know? And I've met plenty of attractive and unattractive women who want to be housewives and ones who didn't. It's a choice, not based on attraction. Lots of ppl marry, attractive or not.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	But silly, feminists don't WEAR makeup, remember?  We're all a bunch of man-hating lesbians with moustaches.

If a girl see's a girl that is better than her at running or something else, she may want to compete with her so that she has a chance of beating her.<br>  <br>  But most of the time, I think that competition may be a sign of someone who wants to show off, and instead of making themselves look cocky, they will challenge someone else to make them look bad.<br>  <br>  This may be a subconscious thing, most people are just competitive by nature.|`|gCAoXG9Baa	it is the desire to show that they are better.

Sometimes people are just competitive by nature, but other times they want to outshine others. If the person is good natured, yet still very focused, they could just be having fun. If they are being mean and sore losers, they might be jealous. But yet again, it all depends on personality.|`|EZSYtYwZaa	Yes but if it's like friendly competition then no if that person just talk to you and says blahblahblah bla bla then it's totally a form of jealousy also if that person doesn't want to do Competition and the other girl is Still going with it then it's total jealousy.|`|66Fhsm0vaa	i think its more of an insecurity on her part. not necessarily jealousy..but it can easily turn into that if you lose and dont take it gracefully|`|BDHWZmfDaa	no, Jealousy is wanting something that somebody has and you dont, competing is trying to prove supiriority|`|oBhR0hDcaa	No you can compete with someone and try to be better without wishing you were them.|`|K7XSAjOvaa	it's more like pride and jealousy at the same time.|`|AA11787542	yes|`|EgqCLBwBaa	I think it is!|`|ygj9krQdaa	I like competing with others all the time to make me feel like I AM the best or CAN DO the best or BE the the best! That's how I see it, I feel no jealousy in any way toward the other person.

loqsl5xXaa	your mind is a tricky thing. your brain can store things and make you forget about them. something can trigger the memory and your brain recalls it (horrible events or traumatic experiences). maybe it is a good idea that your therapist wants to go the longer distance to help you. it sounds like you need extra care and attention t help yourself heal. I am really sorry for what has happened to you. I truly hope that some day and hopefully soon you will b free from all the past memories and wont b trapped by them. so, it could mean u have it. Talk to your therapist. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck with everything.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	There are cases in which people repress traumatic memories as a means of coping with an impossible situation when they are younger.  You never forgot it.... it was just buried.  In all honesty, honey, things like this often emerge when you start developing healthier coping skills.  So this is not necessarily a bad thing.  But I'm sure you are in a lot of pain right now.  You have every reason to go on living, because you can work through these feelings and memories, and you can get past them.  But you may have to develop a life completely independent of your parents to get there.  Follow the advice of your psychiatrist.  It can help stabilize your emotional state so you can see more clearly what you need to do t work this through.  I very much wish you well during this time.  Please don't lose hope.  I have seen many people get through similar experiences.|`|8TFtxm3yaa	To your main question ... yes. As to why,emotionally attached events are stored differently (at a 'deeper' level). These memories include stressful and traumatic events, particularly those which resulted in some kind of harm and emotional distress to the person.Upon the identification of the same stressor (or similar) that caused a reaction for the previous situation, the body would instantly trigger an overstressed response.For instance, a noise could be part of a 'memory' from a situation in which a person was hurt/ abused. The same noise, or something similar, could occur in the future 'awakening' the memory of the abuse. [ This is a greatly simplified explanation of a complex emotional/ mental process ]|`|vH9TUmVvaa	Traumatic events can alter one's personality and way of living drastically. People who do the healing work realize that with the right circumstances issues resurface from the trauma later in life for them to deal with. The effect of trauma never ends: Each of us will deal with the symptoms and effects of trauma according to our own time table|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	PTSD often emerges years later. Many times PTSD from childhood abuse or molestation will emerge in people 30, 40 ,50 yrs. old as they begin to have flashbacks & remember things that they were able to block out for so long before.I have PTSD from the military as well as from abuse as a child. I'm 35 yrs. old & still dealing with the effects, night traumas and flashbacks. Get some help through counseling. It will really help you out to talk to a third party who is neutral & trained to deal with the many after effects of abuse. You can see a psychiatrist or just a regular counselor would be a big help. I wish you the best.|`|e30cd21479ba61083d65bb804d7193edaa	Your mind does a lot of things to protect you from pain. The problem is you did not address the issues when they happened, instead you pushed them down. Eventually it is going to work itself up, and then it is so sudden, so unexpected that you have no way to cope. You're only coping mechanism was to block it out, so when you are faced with it, you don't know how to react. This is your mind telling you that you NEED to address this. You can't run from it forever. PTSD can happen 1 month, 1 year, 50 years from the time the incident occurred. I am surprised that your health care professional has not even considered this a possibility.|`|2pr32YNqaa	You are about to leave home and go out into the wild wide world. That could be causing an upsurge in anxiety.<br>  You really need to get some distance from your father though - try not to fear the unknown. <br>  When you are living away from your father, it may surface even more. Let it got through you until the pain passes. What helps you feel strong? Go for that, whatever it is.|`|mdumRghhaa	I have a diagnosis of chronic complex very very severe post traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and previous clinical depression. I was hospitalised for 2 years.<br>  <br>  I had something very traumatic happen to me for 15 months but my mind blanked it out for a whole year and it came back in bits - it was terrifying not knowing what these images in my head were and I couldn't make sense of them. I then started therapy and discovered I was experiencing "flashbacks". I then started to come to terms with how I felt about my experiences and began to self harm incredibly badly. I'm not saying this will happen to you but if you have feelings like this please don't worry thinking they are abnormal.<br>  <br>  PTSD is odd - it does take a while to stop being blanked out.<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend therapy. There is a special therapy called EMDR which I had - it treats flashbacks BUT if you are in a vulnerable state it is a bad idea as it stirs things up, that's what it does, and could potentially make you suicidal if you are having suicidal ideation. So the balance needs to be considered carefully before making a concrete decision. There are also other options like NLP and rewind therapy but I don't rate them at all as I have tried them both.<br>  <br>  So to summarise - I think you should try therapy before hospitlisation because I have been in hospital and it's not somethign you forget in a hurry. It is traumatising in its own respect.<br>  <br>  Dan

Everytime domestic violence is brought up people jump in shouting about gender, as though this is the issue.  It's not.  <br>  So yes, let's do away with any perceived inequality and then we can concentrate on the real issues.  The fact that women are more than four times likely to die in domestic violence scenes than a man isn't important.  What is important is that the bickering stops so that we can concentrate on people who do die in domestic violence.  <br>  I do believe that women are much more at risk, but again, is it worth arguing about when people's lives are at stake?|`|AA11589988	Yes. I wish our government in the UK was as enlightened on domestic violence as this group seems to be. As we saw yesterday the launch of the DV register proposal in the UK is all about protecting women from men - as if men and children and gay people are not victims of domestic violence too.|`|7LSonIoraa	Feminist are know for making false claim they even ignore the facts that women can cause physical harm to men and children.The reason why they ignore the fact because it goes against they philosophical believe that all women are good.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Well, how would it represent anti-feminism?

People like you just want people to feel sorry for them.  Now, if you really want to do something to boost your self esteem, then constantly think about thing you are good at - your good traits.  If that doesn't work, remember that someone out there has it way harder than you.  If that doesn't work, have fun being miserable.|`|0IpfhSqiaa	I went through a phase like that last year. Unfortunately, the sadness is an addictive kind of self-pity, and it shows, making everything worse.

DUMnjoxxaa	maybe try coming up with a daily activity that makes you want to stay focused. like for example, if you like yoga - tell yourself that the key to having energy would be to continually practice in order to relieve stress. i know doing more work sounds like going in the opposite direction, but from experience, the less you have to do, the more lazy you will become. find time to go to the gym|`|HUrLVofYaa	Make sure you eat a balanced diet with plenty of iron and vitamins.

e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	That's basic biology. Basically, we're meant to create as much offspring as we can, so we reach sexual maturity early. The age of consent is framed keeping in mind the mental setup and the circumstances in which the person having sex will be in.<br>  <br>  It's not exactly advisable for a middle school student to be a parent you see.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Probably because from a biological perspective, it's better to mate quickly, before you die- the whole evolutionary idea of passing on your genes in a world that was, but isn't so much now, short and brutish.  It doesn't really matter to our genes whether or not our minds are ready for sex, just so long as our bodies are.|`|NYU37jfGaa	The age of sexual maturity varies considerably from individual to individual.  And besides, being physically mature enough to have sex does not necessarily mean you are emotinaolly mature enough to cope with all the complications that can arise from a sexual relationship.  This is the reason why the age of consent is (sensibly in my view), set above the age at which a person attains sexual maturity physically.|`|G1kdupY3aa	Because until the beginning of the 20th century the average human lifespan was only 40 years and many children died before even seeing their 5th birthday.<br>  <br>  Many women used to die in childbirth.

Girls who have babies at a young age are actually in quite a dangerous position, with all sorts of problems.<br>  The age of consent is an artificial limit anyway - designed to keep people from abusing children.<br>  But you are right - I do think kids mature too early.  It could take another five years!|`|pQGUPITeaa	Tell that to the 9 year old girl in Brazil who had to have her pregnancy of twins aborted because her uterus was too small to carry them to full term without killing her.<br>  <br>  Just because you're capable of getting pregnant does not always mean you are fully sexually and physically mature.|`|usIUgISsaa	wat?<br>  explain.|`|TTjDATeOaa	In many cultures, children are raised to be adults by the time they are 13. That's why they get married so young. In our culture, we raise our kids to stay children well into their adult years. It is unnatural, yet even if we raised our children to act like adults by age 13, it would still be illegal for them to be married then. But the biological urges are there regardless.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	I think due to better nutrition and vitamins sexual maturity is being reached earlier than in the past.  The age of consent only really applies to industrial nations.

zZY3JX30aa	You're making "excuses" (justifying and rationalizing) what you choose to do...(you say, " don't do that stuff. I know that it's not worth the risks"), why should anyone else be any different, not in what they choose to do, but in explaining why they do it?<br>  <br>  Just because you see what they do as "dangerous" or "pointless", doesn't mean everyone chooses to see things the same way.<br>  <br>  So, if they are not like you, in that they don't see things the way you do, or do things the way you do, they are "...just morally inept scum..."?<br>  <br>  Nice.<br>  <br>  It's called freedom. It goes along with free will. Know anything about either of them?|`|U3j7oVflaa	It's neither.  Most of what you describe is attention seeking behavior and sex-drive related behavior (which are often related but not always).  <br>  <br>  Some people see no value in leading a more ascetic lifestyle.  In the struggle to be accepted, since most people engage in questionable behavior, in order to gain the most friends, it is often the quick and easy path to engage in similar questionable behavior.<br>  <br>  Monkey-see, monkey-do.  I'm glad you're above that influence, but, it is likely going to be a life of very few long-term friends, as, most of the people around you will eventually turn to drugs, alcohol, sleeping around, strip clubs, etc, etc as you get older.<br>  <br>  They aren't "morally inept scum" ... they are just people who want to belong and garner attention.  They continue to proliferate because most people are not formally taught whose attention is WORTH GETTING.  Most of them can't even learn it because the good feelings of being accepted by beer swilling hedonists often heavily outweighs the good feelings of being accepted by intellectuals.<br>  <br>  There is good middle ground to be found between "Narcissus and Goldmund"... but it is definitely closer to that of "Goldmund" than that of "Narcissus".<br>  <br>  Remember these 2 things:<br>  1) Moderation in all things.<br>  2) Acquittal of the guilty damns the judge.|`|8lboONb2aa	Who says getting drunk, doing drugs, and having sex is out of control? If the majority of people are doing it then it becomes just another aspect of society. We also have a big dependence on fast food, cosmetics, caffeine, etc. but are these things considered a problem, no. Also, I do the above mentioned actions in moderation and have no problem with depression even when some weeks are not so moderate. It's all about willpower.|`|a3bq277Gaa	Some people are depressed or are going through some tough things, so they turn to drugs, sex, drinking... they use that as an escape. They push people away because they're scared they're not going to find  anything else that's going to fill their needs like drugs and drinking do.|`|qD5BS5Plaa	because people want to knowwhy they act a certian way|`|4SaRvH3daa	There is no excuse for any of it.  You have every right to judge someone who makes stupid decisions that effect them and everybody else.  I have been to many parties with people all around me drinking and whatever else, have been offered to try things, and it is extremely easy to say no.  Peer pressure is no exuse.  Now I have my own problems, and I can't say that I am some kind of perfect Christian.  Here's what I can say:  I will never do any type of drug that is illegal.  I will only drink if it is a toast and I am of age, but never in excess.  I won't be having sex unless I am comitted to someone, and that means marriage.  Easy as that.  Judge me on my decisions.  Find error in that.  If you don't have anything that can be said about you that makes you sound bad, you don't mind being judged.  My mom and sister smoke, and that is no excuse for me to start.  It's good for you that you realize the problems in society today.  If only everyone could see how ridiculous they are acting.  The only people who permit it are the ones doing it, so I don't want to here "Don't judge other people."  You only get 1 life, 1 body, so why mess those things up.  Count your blessings, and take advantage of them.  Never destroy them.  What a rant.|`|ju4holjiaa	Let ye without sin cast the first stone.|`|Atcn9M3iaa	How's the whether up there on your high horse?|`|oBhR0hDcaa	They think it is worth the risk or don't see it as a risk obviously.<br>  For your information like 80% of adults do this too.

You sound quite smart so could be a good candidate for a cognitive therapy with a certified "shrink". It's basically a therapy intended to find the problems in the way you think and try to change them.

uscHnFPtaa	Most dreams contain messages that serve to teach us something about ourselves. Unfortunately many a times we forget what we dream about as we go about our daily routine. With recurring dreams, the message may be so important and/or powerful that it just will not go away. The frequent repetition of such dreams forces you to pay attention and confront the dream. The dream is trying desperately to tell you something.  Such dreams are often nightmarish or frightening in their content, which also helps you to take notice and pay attention to them.<br>  <br>  Recurring dreams are quite common and are often triggered by a certain life situation or a problem that keeps coming back again and again. These dreams may recur daily, once a week, or once a month, but whatever the frequency, there is little variation in the dream content itself. It usually points to a personal weakness, fear, or your inability to cope with something in your life - past or present. <br>  <br>  The repetitive patterns in your dream can reveal some of the most valuable information on yourself. It may point to a conflict, situation or matter in your waking life that remains unresolved or unsettled.  Or some urgent underlying message in your unconscious is demanding to be understood.<br>  <br>  To dream about sex, refers to the psychological completion and the integration of contrasting aspects of the Self. You need to be more receptive and incorporate aspects of your dream sex partner into your own character. Alternatively and a more direct interpretation of the dream, may be your libido's way of telling you that it's been too long since you have had sex. It may indicate repressed sexual desires and your needs for physical and emotional love. If you are looking for a place to have sex, then the dream may be analogous to your search for intimacy and closeness. To see your parents having sex in your dream, indicates that you are seeing similar aspects between their relationship and your current relationship. Most of us cringe at the thought of our parents having sex, so this dream imagery is really trying to get your attention. Consider your parents' real life relationship together and what you can learn from it. <br>  <br>  To dream about anal sex, represents submission. You may be afraid to yield to the wants and desires of others|`|j9OUIki3aa	It sounds to me like you are fearing for your personal space, and very concerned that things happened to you that you don't remember.  <br>  <br>  Listen to yourself, but realize that fears and worries are normal, especially after a realistic dream that recurs like that.  It doesn't mean that it happened, or that you want it to.  It might mean more than you are afraid of such things than anything.

And you are nice to people you dislike, because that means you are keeping your enemies close to keep a watch on them so they can't hurt you. Either way, you sound like you have trust issues. <br>  Sorry to tell you, but opening up and getting hurt, is the only way to change that. Being hurt by people, is the only way to be able to really tell who to shut out and who to let in. What doesn't kill you, makes you more of a ninja.

It could be caused by a physical problem or a chemical inbalance in the brain.<br>  <br>  First talk to your parents, school counselor or trusted adult about this.<br>  I know doing anything now is very hard, but make the effort to get other people to help you.  Then fight with them to get yourself better.<br>  <br>  Next you need to get a physical exam with good blood work.  My sister experienced what  you described when her Thyroid decided to stop working.<br>  <br>  Then, you need to be tested for depression.

Your doctor will probably want to wait for the physical exam results first.  <br>  <br>  No. 2<br>  If you are depressed and/or stressed.   The doctor may refer you to someone who can teach you 'stress reduction' methods.  He may also improve your diet and exercise.  He may prescibe pills only if your depression is strong enough to warrent it.  <br>  <br>  There is mild, medium and major depression.  There is situational (temporary) and chronic depression.  For most people the depression is mild/medium and situational/temporary.  Mild or medium would fit what you describe.  With major you are pretty much incapacitated. <br>  <br>  No. 3<br>  I started out with major depression.  I got 'stress reduction' methods,  talking with psychiatrist and pills.  Once that stuff had improved me enough, we worked on improving my diet and getting me to exercise; and fineally getting off the pills (hooray).  <br>  <br>  Now, if I eat reasonably well and keep up with my exercise I function normally (and happily) without pills, etc.  However, major stressors, like a death, will put be back to where I need pills again.  Warning:  Work with the doctors to go on and to go off the pills.  (I stopped the pills once by myself and acquired an imaginary cat.  Easy to take care of cat, but unhealthy me).<br>  <br>  Depression is in many members of my family, so we are probably prone to the chemical imbalance thing.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|U2wkJRrMaa	Hmm.<br>  <br>  C'est la vie.

You used to be happy then figure out what happen between the moment of unhappiness and the times when you were happy. There must be something you forgot or didn't look upon during those times. Is there a family problem? A friend who cheated on you? A thing that happen during the course of time. Think.....use your head. There must be something trigger those depressing mood you got now.

0YQRbq9faa	Fear is the root cause of anxiety. You have to figure out what you are afraid of happening, then face down that fear. It is usually something irrational and out of our control anyway.<br>  <br>  For general anxiety and a general sense of anxiousness, try these suggestions:<br>  <br>  1.  Listen to some soft adagio music that you like.  Keep a CD of it handy or keep the songs as a playlist on your ipod or MP3 player.<br>  <br>  2.  Practice deep, rhythmic breathing.  Deep breathing alone does not work. It has to be a rhythm - it is the rhythm that makes it work.  Breathe, hold the breath, and exhale to the count of 4.  Inhale 1-2-3-4, Hold the breath 1-2-3-4, exhale 1-2-3-4.  The rhythm is what calms you, not necessarily the breathing.<br>  <br>  3.  Learn to pray and ask the Lord to help you with your fears and anxieties.  He is always there to listen.<br>  <br>  4.  Get busy doing something physical that takes your mind off your worries.  Go for a walk.  Do something with your hands.  Do something physical.<br>  <br>  5.  Go do something nice for someone else.  That gets your mind off your anxieties and onto something tangible.<br>  <br>  6.  Find an inspiration book that you enjoy reading and read a few pages.  I read the Bible daily.  It helps keep me grounded.<br>  <br>  These things have always helped me when I am anxious or worried.<br>  <br>  May the Lord help you as you work these things out.

AcgDcQG0aa	President James Munroe first used this expression "great depression' to describe the economic crisis of 1819-1824.<br>  <br>  The depression of 1873-1896 was also described as a great depression by people who experienced it.<br>  <br>  And president Hoover used the word depression soon after the stock market crash of 1929 because at that time the word 'depression' was considered more mild than 'recession'.   And president Hoover didn't want to panic anyone by calling it a recession.<br>  <br>  Towards the end of his term, president Hoover was forced to admit that this was more than just a depression.  Which was when he started to say that it was a great depression rather than just a depression.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the first time this expression acquired its modern capitalized form was in 1952, when Harry Truman lambasted Republicans for having “brought on the Great Depression.”<br>  <a href="http://www.hnn.us/articles/61931.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hnn.us/articles/61931.html</a><br>  <br>  During 1930s, the word 'depression' was used as a euphemism for recession.  But the meanings of these words have changed.  And now the word 'recession' may be used as a euphemism to describe an economic depression.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's best to call the present economic crisis a recession rather than a depression in order to avoid panicking anyone.|`|tZPOSvHQaa	(The Great  outsourcing Disaster of Bush)|`|Ny5FYSvEaa	I heard someone quite knowledgable say that the term may have come from the fact that during that downturn psychological depression was very prevalent due to the fact that so many people were unemployed and struggling to support themselves and their families.<br>  <br>  - The fall of the American empire.<br>  <br>  I don't think that the American economy will collapse but I certainly think that once all the effects flow through America will no longer be the world's dominant economy.

ti1K0USpaa	I'm a guy and have been the victim of domestic violence.  <br>  <br>  My girlfriend at the time became upset about a text message I received from a female friend, did damage to my property, drew blood from me, and left me with scars.  I attempted to talk to her, back away from her, get her out of my home, call her mother, and eventually even called 9-1-1.  I even fled my own home, only to come back and find her waiting for me.<br>  <br>  Regardless of this, a restraining order was placed on me.  I had police come into my home and asked them document damage done to me and to my property, but they only reported the property damage.  When I attempted to explain my side to police a second time, showing them pictures of the damage she had done and of the cuts I had all over my body, they still wouldn't make a report.  Later, I was arrested, interrogated, and thrown into a jail cell because apparently there's a law that says a "mandatory arrest" has to be made if there's report of violence.  The part about how it has be a woman who makes the report must be in invisible ink.  <br>  <br>  Regardless of the fact that I agreed to take a lie detector test during the interrogation, had pictures and a written statement with me which I offered to show the detective interrogating me, and had all this occur in my own home, she was never arrested and charges of abuse were brought against me.<br>  <br>  I have had to pay thousands in attorney fees, was diagnosed with severe depression, and had my reputation publicly slandered.  Yet even asking for compensation for damages is not allowed.<br>  <br>  All this without ever having a chance to appear before a judge or a jury.<br>  <br>  <br>  The courts' attempts to be "politically correct" have resulted in the abuse of our judicial system, of innocent people being ripped apart (literally and figuratively), and of discrimination of the highest degree.  Women and men who are abused deserve equal justice and protection, in all countries and walks of life.  This should be a human rights issue, not a gender one.  No one should ever be attacked in their own home, call 9-1-1, and then be arrested and charged.  Especially without even having a chance to see a courtroom or say their side of the story.<br>  <br>  Domestic violence is a serious issue that leaves both sexes victimized, yet only one side is ever listened to.  Is this our nation's definition of fair and just?|`|G5Y725Tpaa	It is true that most DV happens to women, however that doesn't mean that all the attention should be entirely focused on women, like it is in today's society. <br>  <br>  People forget the smaller portion of DV victims who are men. Just because less men are abused doesn't mean the same attention and care shouldn't be given to them as well.|`|3ggolLgQaa	Saying that men and women are equally subjected to domestic violence is like saying black and white people have had a equally hard/racist experience of life|`|XIbct4fuaa	Most of the women on this forum are more enlightened than that.  We know that DV is a human issue.|`|CKusjKJ7aa	Domestic violence affects more than just women, it affects men and children just as much as women.  It is more common to see women made victims of domestic violence however there are men who are also victimized in these kinds of situations.<br>  Anyone that believes domestic violence is a women only issue is deluded.|`|RD1lLEnraa	Literally every unbiased research project I have seen indicates that men are half the victims of abuse.   The only ones that do not show this have something to gain...they are by the domestic violence industry and they get paid for what they find. It would be like Ronald McDonald paying you to find out what the best hamburger is by giving you money every time someone got a Big Mac. You would be tempted to say that everyone that went into McDonalds got a Big Mac even if they only went to use the rest room or to get a cup of coffee.  I have no doubt that were this to happen, more people would have eaten a Big Mac during the time this research was going on then they made Big Mac's   <br>  <br>  Even the DoJ stated that 38% of the victims of domestic abuse were men when the Violence Against Women Act was first past but this did not matter to Congress.  Although the United States Constitution is suppose to assure equal protection under the law, there is NO protection for abused men.  Not one dime is authorized to help them.  <br>  <br>  The fact is that men do not make up just 38% of the victims of abuse....the most recent large-scale study of domestic violence was published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2007. The researchers analyzed data concerning 11,000 respondents. According to the researchers, “[H]alf of [violent relationships] were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.”<br>  <br>  Most of the largest groups on Yahoo about domestic abuse are those that focus on men.  One that I founded was the largest until someone who did not like what we were revealing hacked into it and deleted the entire group.  Shattered Men had 990 members at that time and we were one of the most active.  If it were not a problem, why would someone want to prevent the truth from getting out?  <br>  <br>  One other thing to consider....ONLY the gender feminist were allowed to give input on the VAWA each time it was enacted.  No one with a different point of view was allowed to give any input.  Would this not be like asking the KKK to help write racial relationship laws and  never allowing the NAACP to say anything?|`|c77cjTOeaa	Women are victim to the severest forms of physical abuse like choking and strangulation.  They are also far more likely than men to be murdered by their partner.<br>  <br>  Where I live we have the highest DV rate in the country and every year thousands of women and children are turned away by shelters that are full.  There isn't enough money to take care of these people and you want what???|`|flqAr30laa	Domestic violence happen in any relationship straight or gay, so its not only a womans issue.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	no , i have friends who r male and r in an abusive relationship, they take all the abuse bc of the rule where u "cant hit a woman" they get hit w/objects, stabbed, get called terrible names in front of friends/family. one friend of mine has a wife who gets roaring drunk and<br>  actually stomps on his back. police r called all the time, but they dont take it serious cuz hes a man gettin hit/beat.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Feminism has spent vast, vast amounts of energy, resources, time and effort pounding out that only men hit mainly women. When I first began really examining the claims of feminism, I couldn't help but notice the sites I found all claimed that 95% of victims were women and of the remaining 5% (men) the d/v usually was found in same sex relationships (i.e. still blaming men / absolving women of any responsibility).<br>  <br>  I knew from experience and life that they were talking absolute cobblers.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	It most certainly is NOT a  woman only issue. It is just that the men aren't as likely to admit to being beaten up by a woman, especially their wife or partner. And children are also affected by domestic violence, I know from personal experience.|`|3e3a79551e54dcec91edbfed2b6166eaaa	In my house growing up domestic violence was from both my parents. my mom beat my dad my dad beat my mom but only after years of abuse from my mom. there was many times my dad would just be sitting there and my mom would jump on him and beat him without any mercy for no reason. so in my house I saw it was NOT just my mom it was both.<br>  <br>  In real life I have also had my eyes open to the fact that there are more men now then women who are being abused. there are no reports about this. sometime you may hear about a women getting arrested but not many times.<br>  <br>  You know I am sorry to say after watching my dad get beaten many times till he was out cold in front of me. I still believed that men were the only ones who abused women. I knew better I saw this was NOT true by watching what went on with my dad but I still believed that men were the ONLY ones who was the abuser. I am now trying to help get the word out about the truth. and help people see that domestic violence is a human problem not a gender one. <br>  <br>  And I do see many women on here that say the same thing. that men are victims and need help also. we just need everyone to wake up and see that violence knows NO gender and help ALL victims of abuse. and try to help the abuser before the cycle is passed on to the kids. I was lucky I broke the cycle my child will NEVER EVER live in fear of me. like I lived in fear of of my parents. God Bless|`|9EVcTnUWaa	It's not that men aren't the victim of domestic violence, it's just that women are about 90 % more likely to be victim than men.  One of the basic reasons is that men are more likely to resort to violence than women and the second is that when men are the victims of domestic violence they don't talk about it and they tend to want to pretend that it didn't happen. Being the victim of domestic violence doesn't fit most mens' Ideas of how to take care of themselves and them as the stronger sex.  There for it's more difficult for them to deal with.  It's like rape, it happens a lot more than it's reported and part of that is the fault of the victim by allowing themselves to fell that there is something to be ashamed of and to keep hidden.  When men are allowed to be human first and foremost than they will speak up more about being the victims of domestic violence.  the other thing that it makes me think of is men being the survivors and patients of breast cancer.  Why isn't it spoken about more in the male population when about 1 percent of breast cancer patients are men??? Because the other 99% are women so they get most of the attention.  But men do contract breast cancer and die from it just as women do. Yet it's rarely something that's spoken about, the same thing applies to domestic violence.
oENe16luaa	Sure.  It is natural for kids to want to explore sex parts and feelings with each other.  Infants masturbate because it feels good. Parents must teach what is appropriate and not.<br>  <br>  Doc up there is way beyond any norms.
pqOnERLWaa	I'm sorry but I think there is zero trust in your relationship.<br>  Dreaming you were single probably indicates a need to be free from your responsibilities, not necessarily your girlfriend though.<br>  The other girl is obviously temptation, you felt like there was an offer on the table and you took it, not a bad thing really.<br>  The realisation that you were set up, did it make you angry or feel guilty for getting caught?<br>  If it was anger then, you have the strength to get out of the relationship for good. If you felt guilty for going to kiss the girl, then I think you are not ready to move on, even though you are unhappy with the way things are.|`|fOZPJhoPaa	Personally I think there is a serious lack of trust in your relationship and that is what the basis of this dream is about, also maybe you are worried that you do like the 'slutty' friend as the saying goes "I think he doth protest too much"<br>  I would take a good long look at your life and relationship and decide if it is what you really want or if you and your girlfriend have got into a habit, it's an easy situation to get into, when you break up and get back together often as you have said you do|`|XN0sRoqpaa	it probably is a sign to tell you "beware of your girlfriend's unorthadox methods"<br>  <br>  basically, just learn from the dream and stay away from any women who isnt your girlfriend.
mCEKMWTYaa	At about age 35 women do reach their sexual peak.  It does not happen for all women at that age but it is common.  As far as it starting in the early teens or when a girl gets her period, that is the stupidest thing I ever heard!  Girls sometimes get their period as early as age 8!  I really think you were right that preferably women only should answer this question!|`|80YPHmm7aa	It's generally true, that by the time someone reaches 40, that they are more comfortable in their own skin. That translates into a sexual confidence about what you like and don't like. You're not as timid about speaking up, presuming you were more reserved when you were younger.<br>  <br>  As far as a man liking an older women, that boils down to that persons preference in women. Some men like young and nubile, some like a more mature women. There is no set formula.|`|OlzWOP2Baa	I think you mean sexual peak.<br>  <br>  Yes I have heard many times that women don't reach their sexual peaks until they are their 30's.  <br>  As far as men preferring older women, that depends on the man himself.  A lot of times women of this age are too mentally mature for a lot of younger men so it doesn't work out a whole lot.   Sometimes it does work, so there is hope.

That's what "sexually mature" means: being able to reproduce.<br>  <br>  "Chimpanzees and humans both reach sexual maturity in their early teens. In the wild, female chimpanzees typically give birth only once every five years, usually to one baby. Infant chimpanzees are reared by their mothers and have close relationships with related females and older siblings, who often share in their care. Infants are extremely important. If a mother is injured or dies, others will take on the role. Jane Goodall, the famous primatologist, noted this on many occasions including when Sniff, a young male, adopted his baby sister after their mother’s death."<br>  <br>  "Sexual maturity of female killer whales is achieved when the whales reach lengths of approximately 15-18 feet (4.6 m-5.4 m), depending on geographic region. The gestation period for killer whales varies from 15-18 months, and birth may take place in any month. Calves are nursed for at least 1 year, and may be weaned between 1 and 2 years of age. The birth rate for killer whales is not well understood, but is estimated as every 5 years for an average period of 25 years."<br>  <br>  <br>  African grey parrots reach sexual maturity at around age 5...<br>   I think you get the picture.<br>  <br>  *Degree of "hornyness" depends on many things other than biological age.  Each woman is different, as are her individual circumstances, so the existence of a rule of thumb is unsupportable.<br>  <br>  It helps when you think about how to word your question before you post it, doesn' it?

3CSoSRmtaa	My confidence problem started when i was a toddler.  I was diagnosed with ADD in fourth grade.  They coucilled me and gave me pills, which I believe weren't as effective as what I have learned recently.  I speak to those I have acquaintances with.  Even those I am afraid of being around because they intimidate me (managers, co-workers, friends, family..etc).  I say 'Hi, how are you?' I start off simple and if they reply I gained confidence in myself because I made an initiative to speak over my fears.  Speaking to others about your problems and asking for solutions is the best thing that has ever come my way.  If you can, find someone who understands what you are going through.  They may beable to give you advice on what you wish to work on.  Learning is the key to success.  Keep your head up and live strong.

1TPGdaXJaa	I can give you advise that I use in my job, which is a job that is somewhat chaotic with lots of different things going on.<br>  <br>  It's really easy, and is basically just taking a few minutes before you actually start working to look over everything you have, and make a general list then prioritize.<br>  <br>  For example, if I have to write a report, file some paperwork, write a letter, do some training, etc. I just write them all down, so I have everything that I need to accomplish together in one place. Then I rewrite the list in the priority that I need to do them. For example, the report may be due in a day, so I make that priority # 1, and so on.<br>  <br>  Then, after I have prioritized my work and decided what I should work on, I quickly overview what has to be done to complete the job. For example, as I have decided my report is the top priority, I will then look over what needs to be done to complete the report, like make a brief outline (written or just mentally noted) for what needs to be done (written, researched, looked up, etc) to complete the report. Then I begin. That way I have in my mind at all times an idea of an overview for what is going on, and what I will need to do to complete it, and can focus on the details of the task at the same time. This really helps me, because if I become really involved with a certain part of the report, I always have my list and overview to go back to and make sure I get everything else done for the report, and all of my other tasks done, without forgetting anything.<br>  <br>  In short, it is all about planning when it comes to doing work: list, prioritize, and overview, then start. It really helps to give an idea of what I need to do and to help me be sure I don't forget anything. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps with your school work too. If you have homework, maybe make a list of things you need to do for school, along with whatever else you need to, or want to, do in your time, and make sure you just simply set some time to do things like your homework.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	It's called prioritizing.  It means you have to get the homework done first, before you do anything else.  It means you start on your term paper or class project the day it is assigned instead of the day before it's due.  It means you work on your assignments until they are done.  I completely understand the temptation to put everything off until the 11th hour.  I used to do it all the time when I was in high school and undergraduate, and it made me crazy.  I was almost always able to pull it off, but I was lucky.  When I got to graduate school, I couldn't do that anymore, although I tried.  I paid a big price my first quarter, and I had to get my act together.  I did, and I did MUCH better.  It's up to you.  It requires making that decision then sticking to it on a daily basis.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	Back in it's home - if you make a habit of putting things back in their proper place immediately after use, life will be a lot easier.  If everyone is reminded to do the same, it will save last minute panics trying to find the second shoe or that special necklace that matches the dress. Also, you will never have to face the daunting task of a major clear up.<br>  <br>  Jobs - try to do tasks as they crop up, not leave them until another day when they will probably have multiplied, thus making them more of a chore.  Ironing done immediately is always a lot less hassle than when the laundry has not only become over dry but reaches the ceiling.<br>  <br>  Labour saving appliances - only use these when they actually do save labour.  It doesn't make much sense washing up a food processor used to chop an onion, when a knife would have done the job.<br>  <br>  Large jobs - if possible, break these down into smaller, more manageable, chunks.   Don't try to spring clean every cupboard in the house at the same time, not only will it take for ever but you will also get fed up before the task is finished.   Either choose one room to do, or perhaps just one cupboard at a time.  Mind you, if you have a lot of cupboards, this is a bit like painting the Forth Bridge, by the time you get to the end you will have to start at the beginning again!<br>  <br>  Immediate results - if time is limited and you need the place to look good, concentrate on the obvious areas.

Remember it, and scare yourself with it. Getting organized is DIFFICULT. Start with getting a planner. If your school doesn't give you a free assignment notebook/planner buy a cheap one and utilize it. When you are bored in class, or don't want to pay attention you can bring it out and write your assignments in it. But try your best to pay attention! If your teacher mentions something write it down write away. Seeing something often times reminds you to do things. Also designate a folder and a notebook to each class. At the end of the day look at your assignment notebook to see which folders and notebooks you need to take home to do your homework. <br>  <br>  Doing the homework may be tough, but try doing a little bit at a time. Do a worksheet and then reward yourself by playing a computer game, write a paragraph and watch a youtube clip etc.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	You've got to pick a time of day where you sit in a quiet place and do your homework for an hour or so.

This can justify by making comparison of the MAJOR FOREIGN HOLDERS OF TREASURY SECURITIES, annual GDP growth, total reserved US dollars, and the result of Pew project of Global attitudes project survey. No one can deny the fact that US is the locomotive of the world economy, coupled with its super influential and manipulative power in military and economy. let's go to the current global economic turmoil rooted and caused by the US sold toxic bonds, shares, securities, and mortgages to local and world wide. How we are going to track these down? We can't just by accusing once Bill Clinton's wise statement of super imperialism for the US should allow the Wall St. peoples to earn more, or the implemented Deregulation by Allan Greenspan that started a lot of financial scandals planned and proceeded by the US financial elites (international crooks what many peoples named them). These sins have sucked more than 40 trillion US dollars world wide from investors, financial institutions, both locally and globally. I foresee the China will get the economy recovery faster and earlier than any country this world. China has more natural disasters than the US and every country in this world.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	There is nothing wrong with you at all.  You are actually building communication skills by talking to yourself.  It's like a "dry run."  That is how I practice discussing specific issues, whether it's for work or for preparing myself for communicating with someone close to me.  To me it's no different than someone looking in a mirror and checking out certain facial expressions, People do THAT all the time!  And yeah, it's embarrassing when someone walks in.  But so what?

Fun to watch, but not fun to get caught doing it.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	I sometimes do some of those things.

So is imagination. As long as you can tell the difference between imagination and reality your good.

KOC8BBZ6aa	Yes it matters! The human life is, as far as we know, the only true sentience that exists. In fact, due to the nature of reality, the enitrety of the universe may only exist because we are here to experience it. It follows the lines of subjective reality, which is to say, if I am not here, who am I to say that you are? <br>  <br>  And, leaving behind Philosphical points, the human mind is still partially unexplained by science. Why sould it be that, when a group of molecules and ions get together and sends electric charges at each other, they should create the sembalence of life? Why is it that we seem to have an unlimited memory, and what is the nature of our thoughts? We have detected no other life in the entirety of the universe, so human life, even though we are minascule, and only temporarily around, is exceedingly important. We are, so far as we can tell, unique in the universe, and it is exceedingly important that we remain around into the future.<br>  <br>  Of course, if we were all dead, there would be no one around to mourn our passing, and the universe might just plod on, but exceedingly worsened for the loss of the only true intelligence and sentience found so far.|`|kX4JPvwwaa	Matter to what?

Everyone says that because they love the earth but who cares if that goes too? No one. So many people are too strung up on their own importance and vanity to realize that we don't matter - to anyone but ourselves. We'll all be dead in 120 years, we wont care, the universe wont either. The molecules you're made of have been around forever, they've been in the heart of a sun and warped through amazing things we cant imagine (presumably) - 80 years of human life is hardly an event.

nCkPhvf5aa	Smile, be true to who you are and what you're about (if a girl doesn't like you for who you are then what is the point of pursuing her right?), grow out your hair (I like to touch clean, soft man hair!), get involved in something related to your interests so you can meet women who share them,<br>  <br>  and keep up what you're doing now! You're on the right path, definitely! You should be proud of yourself already, that takes inner awesomeness! Good for you =D|`|IxmgdMOraa	truthfully,you do not even look 300 lbs in that pic,you look like you are in the 200's,but honestly just be yourself.Remember that there are billions of people on this planet and you are just one,and the girl you are approaching is another,there are way harder things than talking to girls like flying lanes,building bombs,etc...you got it man.|`|jPQqmPh0aa	Be funny?|`|CRDl9nffaa	I can't tell you what all/most women will find appealing but I can tell you what I find appealing.<br>  <br>  Smiling, happy  men are attractive. People who look like they're enjoying life - and I don't mean just partying. I mean everyday stuff like having coffee with your friends, walking in the park, having a chat. <br>  <br>  Eye contact is really important, so give it. But be happy and smiling while you are, and taking an interest in the other person and their life.<br>  <br>  Confidence is attractive, but not smart *** confidence or arrogance. Men who are confident enough to be relaxed and able to make or take a joke about themselves, and to not care too much what other people (except close friends) think of them.<br>  <br>  Wear at least one thing that's a nice bright colour. Bright red or blue is usually good for guys but other colours work. Don't make yourself look  drab. A dash of colour can be a tshirt or shirt underneath a jacket. But that bit of colour helps lift the way you look and make you a bit more friendly looking.<br>  <br>  Take a genuine interest in people. It's lovely to be talking to someone who is interested in you.<br>  <br>  Set out to make friends, not girlfriends. If it's going to go to more than just friendship, it will. That way you get the best of both worlds and everyone is at their ease and not in some kind of dating game stress.<br>  <br>  Be interested and enthuastic about your life and the stuff you do. Enthusiasm is immensely attractive. We want men with a sparkle in their eye and a lust for life!<br>  <br>  I have a very good male friend your size and shape who was going through some of the stuff you describe. One thing that really helped him build his confidence was martial arts. He did Karate, and over the months you could see his confidence and presence growing. There's something very strong, relaxed and appealing about the way he carries himself now.  He has a lovely girlfriend now and he's lost that shyness that plagued him before.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|8s3rMWojaa	Dude women are over-rated - just look the way you look dude what the hell|`|fwrfIxIaaa	stop posing in ur pictures would be a good start|`|AA10818712	Ask popular men for advice, not bitter feminists.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	You could be 586 lbs and still pull hos if you have game. What you look like doesn't matter to women in the least as individuals- women only care about how men look as far as society cares about it. Women would be out there dating jungle sloths if society told em' that it was cool. Don't ever dwell on trying to appeal to women; as women themselves are only accessories who's own purpose is to appeal to society. -
kif21UOdaa	My original answer: "This is such a miserable question and to be asking it out of the blue makes me think that you have some serious issues and problems which need to be discussed with a therapist. <br>  Please do not speak of brain injuries as lightly as this because many people have family and friends who have been injured legititimely by either disease or accidents."<br>  <br>  My reconsidered answer: " Having a sister who had uncontrolled epilepsy made me worried my whole 50 years of life of developing a smiliar brain disorder.

But since you're not ...|`|EQQFisd8aa	Sorry about the situation at hand. <br>  <br>  I would say that you are not yet depressed but rather confused or undecided or discouraged fueled by fear. <br>  You must have hoped to find/gain something by reading and checking through that same website but that didn't happen so u where discouraged and developed less interest in them all.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you should communicate/interact/share ideas with friends or family more often so as to get some more insight and encouragement of real life.For example, the life led by those in moves is just for making money and entertainment, but in actual sense, life needs commitment and endurance.<br>  <br>  So please dear, i suggest that you choose to live a real live. Talk to others about how they are managing. It would be better to start with your own family, the class mates.But First you must identify what you want to  achieve or want to do in life.You could read this book for encouragement.<br>  <br>  Good luck dear|`|dkevqCtkaa	You may be depressed but its more likely that you are a teenager. It is crap being a teen for some people, but all I can say is that things usually get better with time. In the meantime you need to see your doctor to get it checked out just in case. Also finding something that sparks your interest usually helps take your mind off stuff. Good luck and dont give in to those negative thoughts, always remember that you are in control, and if there are things in your life that make you unhappy, you can usually change most of them.|`|uwr1rghaaa	get a job, pet a dog, mow the lawn make water baloons,take a walk, plant sunflowers and water them,go to the library, go to the thrift store see what you can get for ten dollars, wash the dishes, get a haircut, make mud pies, need any more ideas? oh yeh quit f###ing around and go back to school.|`|306Dk9Ywaa	Pick a good book and power through the first 100 pages.

Death or suicide seems less painful than continuing to exist in the current painful situation.|`|akqzdLA8aa	I think it depends on what caused the depression.  My 11 year old lost her best friend last year and she talks about death but she doesn't fear it.  She talks about looking forward to the day she will see her best friend again and can't wait.  She is not suicidal and has gone on with her life but she can't wait till the day they are reunited, she says that will be the best day of her life!|`|S5vUEJ9Kaa	no! its wrong to say they dont fear death. THEY WANT TO ESCAPE THROUGH DEATH. person's who are in "depression state" are "sick mentally' they need aid just like physical healing. they feel loss of control or overwhelmed by their lives and in these hard times its "hope" they should give themselves or someone could say that or remind them. Adversities in life either weaken or strengthen people. We should be Fighters not Escapists.|`|utivEuTfaa	Not necessarily. I'm depressed now and just because I can't seem to find any joy in life, I'm still too afraid of whatever else is out there to not care about death.<br>  It is true to some extent though.

I attempted a few times. My medication made things a lot better for me- I would say I'm just the same as everyone else when it comes to fearing death. I wonder about it, as I believe many people do, but I don't fear it less. I have a lot in life I want to accomplish.|`|tX57rwksaa	Many people who are depressed say they do not fear death and want to dye, are usually just seeking sympathy. Given the opportunity and the wherewithal to do so will not take that advantage . Every body fears death but realise it is the inevitable out come. The biggest fear one has is the manner in which it might occur.

CRDl9nffaa	I share your frustration. But really, the same is true for many things. <br>  <br>  As soon as people find they can attach a label to you, they bombard you with those stereotypes and assumptions, or wheel out their pent up prejudice and irritation with your 'type of people'. Do any of these labels sound like triggers to you: feminist; environmentalist; middle class; blue collar; vegetarian etc?<br>  <br>  But that's life! The only solution is to be patient, positive and try to raise people's consciousness bit by bit without seeming to lecture. These days I've learnt to not describe myself as anything, but just put across my views in a friendly and respectful way that people can relate to in their lives (like Jamier D says). You have to pick the right tools for the job if you want to influence people's ideas.<br>  <br>  RiverRunsRed is right, in a nutshell. They're uneducated. They have to get their education from somewhere. If we have the knowledge, why not us? And confound their prejudice by being a respectful, reasonable person - not the freak they expect. <br>  <br>  That in itself may wake them up a little. But be aware that you may not see it happen in front of your eyes! Often people will argue with you out of stubborness, but later start to dwell on what you've said and absorb it into their view of the world.|`|foUPphu2aa	I would deal with them in the same way as I would deal with people who advocate feminism as only being beneficial without ever having read a book on it. <br>  <br>  However, you can view the positive and negative effects of feminism without ever having read a book on it because it exists outside of those books.

What they know or don't know won't change my mind about anything.|`|AA10098126	My advice would be to listen to them before dismissing them out of hand. There is often a discrepancy between what an organization or movement says and what it does. Just look at every major religion. Often times, people who have studied a subject academically develop the inability to see the forest for the trees, so to speak. You may know what feminism wants to accomplish, or at least claims to, but others may have a better understanding of the real world consequences of their actions. Someone who knows of feminism from books may think it's a good thing, but someone who only sees the unintended consequences may feel differently. Just keep an open mind to what others are telling you. They're not all haters, some do have a point.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	You are referring to the feminists here, right?- As 'people that don't know anything about feminism, but are quick to tell you how it is despite never once cracking a book on the subject' ?<br>  <br>  I also feel that they embrace stereotypes and assumptions and it makes it hard for rational people to argue their cases against these 'feminists' who stick so hard to the once noble issues of gender rights from the past and try to use these past examples to account for the actions of modern feminism of today.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Real world feministism exists in sexism and discrimination in family law, vawa, positive discrimination/affirmative action, the closure of women's prisons, the exclusion of male victims of dv, the hiding of female abusers etc.<br>  Feminism's "leading lights" theorizing about everything being socialized and nothing being natural is kind of irrelevant to a man whose been arrested for domestic violence after his wife puts him in intensive care with a frying pan and then takes his house and his kids.|`|233bbb5ff35324aa581bb39605c0d28daa	educate them
CjxwKrHzaa	There is still the old ways of thinking that women are worthless and cannot be intelligent, invent or contribute to society and can only be at home cooking and having babies.  It's people's own narrow-minded attitudes that keep women inferior.  Women are quite capable of being major contributors but they are not given a bigger and fairer chance of proving themselves.  Politics is an area where there are not enough women.  They are not taken seriously.  The media is more interested in what they are wearing and not what their policies are.  Lot of good women have gone to waste.|`|AA11713693	Because some men can not handle a woman telling them what to do.|`|vEj7xoBraa	I will give you family,but they did nothing good in society/city/state/province.|`|Dfe8oKmpaa	family/what a joke.

Hell, I'm not even always great (and I'm pretty great).<br>  <br>  As a woman I expect and want the same attitude towards my behaviour and life as a man would get. Credit for what I do well, friendly indulgence for my minor faults, and a slap (metaphorical!) in the face for when I screw up.<br>  <br>  I'm serious. Being treated any other way is to be treated like a child.<br>  <br>  So I guess my answer is partly a plea to say: stop making these comparisons where women have to be better (or men have to be better) or someone has to be the 'top' type of human being. It doesn't help anyone.<br>  <br>  At the same time, let's keep vigilant and active where we find actual discrimination  - that's a different thing altogether.|`|233bbb5ff35324aa581bb39605c0d28daa	there are so many reasons why, but i think women need to do more to not let themselves be demeaned by men and society. many women choose to let themselves be seen as sex objects and give in to what society deems as "attractive" even if it means undergoing risky surgery. these types of women are detrimental to the progress of our gender.|`|C7yjMBuqaa	Superior?
