Although the end of hostilities was near, news censorship remained. Therefore, it was left to the noncombatant country of Spain to report that civilians in many places were becoming ill and dying at an alarming rate. These circumstances gave rise to the name by which the disease would forever be known—the Spanish flu.<br>  <br>  The pandemic began in March?1918. Many investigators trace its origin to the state of Kansas, U.S.A. From there it was apparently spread to France by newly arrived U.S. soldiers. After a sharp increase in influenza deaths, by July?1918 it seemed that the worst was over. Little did doctors know at that time that the pandemic was only gathering strength to become a more efficient killer.<br>  <br>  When World War?I ended on November?11, 1918, the world rejoiced. Ironically, at almost that same time, the pestilence broke out earth wide. It was a monster that now claimed international headlines. Few who lived through that time were untouched, and all were frightened. A respected authority on influenza noted: “Life expectancy in the United States dropped by over 10 years in 1918.” How did this pestilence differ from others?<br>  <br>  A Unique Pestilence<br>  <br>  A most alarming difference was the suddenness with which this flu struck. How sudden? In the recent book The Great Influenza, author John M. Barry quotes a written record of this experience: “In Rio de Janeiro, a man asked medical student Ciro Viera Da Cunha, who was waiting for a streetcar, for information in a perfectly normal voice, then fell down, dead; in Cape Town, South Africa, Charles Lewis boarded a streetcar for a three-mile trip home when the conductor collapsed, dead. In the next three miles six people aboard the streetcar died, including the driver.” All died of the flu.<br>  <br>  Then, there was the fear—fear of the unknown. Science had no answer as to the cause of the disease or exactly how it spread. Public health measures were imposed: ports were quarantined; movie theaters, churches, and other public meeting places were closed. In San Francisco, California, U.S.A., for example, officials ordered the whole population to wear gauze masks. Anyone caught in public without a mask faced a fine or jail. But nothing seemed to work. Such measures were simply a case of too little, too late.<br>  <br>  There was also fear because the flu struck indiscriminately. For reasons still not clear, the 1919 pandemic did not primarily afflict the elderly; it struck healthy young people and killed them. The majority of those who died of the Spanish flu were between 20 and 40 years of age|`|Fdhim9lCaa	I wouldn't.<br>  You do know what vaccinations are right? (if we even have one)<br>  They give you a little bit of the virus so your body can become immune to it, but you can actually GET the virus from that shot.<br>  wouldn't advise it.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	The reason a few are anti-vaccination is some have adverse reactions to it.  They don't want to be in that 'some' and rely on others t keep it under control.  For anything that is a real concern no choice will be allowed, it will be forced on you.  IMHO that attitude is very very selfish and I would always use a vaccine.  I generally do not like the idea of governments coercing citizens but in this case I believe they should.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  bill

If he sent it to the lab for further testing, he probably ordered a culture on it (a way to see if bacteria grows). If you want an HIV test, request one. It is a simple blood test that can be done in just a few minutes.|`|2ffaef9025db79107a25a196b9a585e2aa	I'd ask your doctor/office if the test battery included HIV.  Though, if you did have it and it showed on the test, the doctor would tell you.<br>  <br>  If the test wasn't inclusive and you want to test yourself, there is an at home test available.

Often, the lump is painless. Other potential signs of breast cancer include:<br>  <br>  A spontaneous clear or bloody discharge from your nipple, often associated with a breast lump <br>  Retraction or indentation of your nipple <br>  A change in the size or contours of your breast <br>  Any flattening or indentation of the skin over your breast <br>  Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange <br>  A number of conditions other than breast cancer can cause your breasts to change in size or feel. Breast tissue changes naturally during pregnancy and your menstrual cycle. Other possible causes of noncancerous (benign) breast changes include fibrocystic changes, cysts, fibroadenomas, infection or injury.|`|wjlLWqLuaa	i once a lump too that was only hormone related and went away on its own. you can't know for sure unless she goes in for some tests. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|aAQPV0Jjaa	defintly

This is perfectly common and nothing to worry about. In addition, stress can cause your period to temporarily stop. Don't worry about it and keep being healthy. If it really bothers you, talk to your doctor about taking birth control pills.

vJBq8ZFkaa	what your brother has might be jock itch. sometimes a sweaty underwear can lead to a scaly or itchy rash. to avoid it try to wear a clean cotton underwear and loose fitting pants. try not to use anyone else's towel or clothes. jock itch can be treated with anti-fungal medications available at a drug store without a prescription. i would suggest to get an jock itch ointment that might really help. if it gets worse see a doctor.|`|20s2EmWfaa	Could be a few things...Most likely jock itch or just swamp crotch (dirty crotch).

DIRbVD5uaa	To get off the Coke addiction I would suggest slowing dimiinshing the amount you consume a day. If you consume 4 cans a day then every week cut down that amount by a can or a half a can. So in a month you can have 1-2 cans a day instead of 4-5 cans a day
HT1ar9m4aa	Sometimes the cramping goes whether there is bleeding or not. When you said you've been on birth control off and on I feel that it could be more than your body can handle. We change so much threw out our lives with body changes already that either you need to stay on birth control or stay off of them period. And if it has been awhile I would suggest an appointment with a gynecologist to determine between the two of you if you need birth control or not or some other way of control unless you need it to regulate your periods. As far as the pimples, I don't know about, I've never had them. Maybe the doctor can determine them and help you get rid of them. <br>  Have a good day, Julie|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	ur fine. all birth control is different so what happens with this method could be completely different than ur last one. everyting should be back to normal in a month or so. if not then see ur dr. u may be pregnant|`|qitXGd0qaa	Your cycle won't be the same anymore.

wbVd38d2aa	Don't rush it, just take your cues from her. Make sure there is plenty of foreplay, so she's truly ready. What makes it painful is when the girl is tense, because she is nervous, or if there isn't enough lubrication. If you put her at ease and take it slow it should be a good experience for both of you. She might still feel a little sting and she may bleed a little, but there won't be a gush of blood or anything, so don't worry. You are a kind guy to care. There should be more men like you around. Good luck.|`|j6xDeydyaa	Honestly.. You cant do anything to help the pain. But talking her through it and letting her know that you care will make her feel better. If she doesnt want to continue.. dont try to force her. And as for the bleeding part.. It really depends on the girl. A lot of time (im not sure what its called) but it'll break and make her bleed.. usually for a girl this can happen when they ride a bike or anything along the lines. You wont really know if she's going to bleed until you actually have sex.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	yes, it often hurts like hell the first or first few times, and many women do bleed the first time. I would suggest just going slowly and ask her to tell you if anything becomes uncomfortable or if you should stop. Thank you for truly caring about your girlfriend.|`|QAN5OxWIaa	just go slow and keep talking to her and just do what she says feels good...good luck!
RczxgiQaaa	First question... do you REALLY mean 10x3?  10 sets of 3 reps?  Or are you really doing a 3x10, ie 3 sets of 10 reps?<br>  <br>  If it's really a 3x10 and you want to get stronger, switch to a 3x5 or 5x5, using heavier weight (like 120-135).  Heavy weight low rep builds strength.  Sets of 10 are more for building size, but not necessarily strength.

Clean your face in the morning & evening & use a good day & night creme/ don't use all those special products that say to eliminate those black heads cos they are very aggressive to your skin & most likely leave you evan worse the longer you use them.From the inside eat well blood purifying veggies ( you can find them on the net) & last but not least  use fish oil supplements  500mg a day for 3 months than you see a very good result|`|TR7XorHMaa	Chiropractic will increase the effectiveness of your immune system and body's detoxification. If you want ur skin to change you have to start from within and try to take care of it nutritionally as well. But I have had acne for over 10 years and what I found to recently help, along with chiropractic, is taking Omega-3 fish oil and zinc everyday, using a dilution of tea tree oil and which heazel to remove makeup and oil 2x /day, halfing a lemon and using it on my face morning and night to wash with water, and changing to all organic makeup. Pretty much I removed the chemicals and toxins I've exposed my face to. It took about one month to see great results for me, but everyone's different. Good luck!|`|uuHDQr1paa	First of all...you might try washing your face with warm water and soap once in awhile.  I've never heard of anyone having them all over like you.

axylPYftaa	hahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahah|`|AA10249078	The words "quick" and "colon cleanse" don't really belong together. To achieve the true purpose of a colon cleanse, more than 24 hours is required. If there is a lot of sludge built up, it's not going to be expelled after just 24 hours of psyllium in apple juice.<br>  <br>  The least amount of time required to do a colon cleanse is approximately 14 days or two weeks. The longest is usually 30 days.<br>  <br>  As far as a liquid diet, most cleanses consist of more than just apple juice, powdered fiber and water. They usually include different herbs whose purpose is to loosen compacted matter in layers allowing it to be expelled over a length of time a little bit at a time.<br>  <br>  This source has a lot of good information, that might be helpful:<br>  <a href="http://www.healingdaily.com/colon-kidney-detoxification.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healingdaily.com/colon-kidney...</a>|`|SnkaH7W6aa	The best thing is to fast---a 24 hour fast will clean you out--just drink a LOT of water, eat nothing, not even the powder fiber, and don't drink the apple juice--another way is to get the colon cleanser used to clean it out before a colonoscopy--again, eat nothing, drink only water, and the colon cleansing stuff--but I can tell you that it tastes nasty.<br>  A quick colon cleaning might give you the illusion of having lost weight, but it really does nothing for us. <br>  If you want to do your colon something good, start eating yogurt--plenty of it--you'll be amazed how much better you will feel after a week or 2.  it makes you go - it makes you full for a long time--it burns belly fat--and it is cheap and works.  Eating plenty of lowfat yogurt with active and live cultures is what I did for a long time--it cleaned me out, that's one thing for sure--and it made me lose 30 lbs since I started this regimen.....good luck|`|P8CBDLiKaa	That's probably the best option if you really feel the need.  Don't go for longer than 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Most of these colon cleanse products are scams.|`|YrNr017haa	yes; break the fast with a bowl of cooked plain oatmeal with apples slices or banana and milk or soy milk;' do oatmeal 1x a day for 3 days brown rice and veggeis at nite; eat a slad daily; and fruit|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Depends. If you had a thorough colon cleanse and have been on a healthy vegetarian diet with plenty of fiber no refined foods  and then you cheat for one day, in that case a 24 hour cleanse may be all you need. In fact Dr' Schulze offers such a product.|`|dcd11iUwaa	hmm im sure it can do some good but they always recommend 7-14 days.<br>  i know, i couldnt do it for that long either
FfwMHgAIaa	If I were you, I would go to the doctor. It could be strep throat, and that is not something to mess around with. Trust me. Strep can spread from your throat. A man from our church recently died of kidney failure because of a case of strep that was never checked out. <br>  <br>  I know it's scary to go to your doctor, but if he asks if you have been making yourself throw up, tell him the truth. If you don't want your parents, or whomever to know, ask him not to tell them. Your doctor needs all the information possible to diagnose you correctly.<br>  <br>  You do need to go get it checked out though. Sore throats don't seem like that big of a threat, but if left unchecked, they can go bad.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  Glad to hear you won't be purging again.<br>  :)<br>  Hope everything goes okay for you.<br>  Always.<br>  Emily?|`|nBoM6F3caa	Why don't you just tell your docter a fib and say that becasue your sick you have vomited alot while eating something that made you gag or something.|`|FhAhtjkOaa	duno|`|AEXJcpmHaa	Well if your throat is red and you have a fever it could be a viral infection or something NOT casue by your bulimia. Your glands are swollen and that is not usually caused by stomach acid. If your doctor can tell youve thrown up, i mean throwing up for the rest of the non bulmia world happens when you are sick sometimes so its not like ONLY bulmian throw up ever.....seriously just take some tylenol and drink lots of water and dont throw up while youre sick, youre robbing your body of nutrients to heal itself....if your glands get too swollen or you get white bumps on your throat go to the doctor for antibiotics...|`|i6ZvLIU9aa	my moms a doctor she wont be able to tell she'll just think its some kind of throat infection from eating something, or a bacterial disease like strep. <br>  go to the doctor immediatly you dont want it to get worse, it could get extremly swollen and ur a esophagus is going to bulge and u wont be able to breathe as welll. go to the doctor immediatly.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	go to the doctor your not there to impress him your there to get well. <br>  Tell him everything and being ashamed and not telling everything will mess up the diagnosis. Don't do that to yourself. <br>  Get well soon!|`|Sb1PmUZQaa	No there is no real way they can tell that you've made yourself throw up, they will probably question if theres a way that your pain and fever could have happened though.  Its probably an infection, but you need to go to the doctor because throat infections can turn out serious, believe me ive been there!

It doesn't matter if any of you are over 18 or not. If he is your teacher, it is illegal.
yDJiiqcsaa	Surveys indicate that most people (men/women) masturbate at one time or another. If you are asking do most men do it on a regular basis ? Yes, some more often than others. Some (small percentage) do not masturbate at all but it is unusual.  Surveys are difficult to interpret/rely on because they are based ONLY on the people that participated (can't force everyone to participate) and the info is maybe true - maybe false, maybe exaggerated...  I would GUESS that of the guys that DON"T regularly masturbate it would be more likely those are over 20 years old and fairly well satisfied through interpersonal coition.
jnOiqcAlaa	That girl probably jumped on him before he had time to react, and he probably didn't want to push her off. He doesn't look to happy in the picture. So I wouldn't worry.

By the way, you are gorgeous!|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	Just because she is flirting with him doesn't mean that he will act on it! Be confident because he says he loves you.

You can go look it up and order a free sample all you do is pay shipping and handling! Hope i could of been of some help! Good luck
INZ1LlHGaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  The water flushes your digestive tract so you absorb the good nutrients and rid your body of more waste before it builds up and gets stored as fat.<br>  <br>  Also, drinking water helps you feel full so you eat less throughout the day, reducing your caloric intake.|`|Z0GZeATJaa	DEFINATLY.  I recently lost 20lbs in less than a month.  I would drink hot tea with no sugar in the morning and anything i pretty much wanted for lunch.  And a snackish type food if I got hungry later.  Drinking hella water keeps you full.  If your working out, you burn more calories if your really hydrated!  I always get a pitcher of water and slice up lemons and put them in there, for my fridge.  It breaks up the boringness of water.  And tastes really good. Plus, lemon is really good for cleanseing your body!  Good luck!  --oh and Ive also heard ice cold water burns calories itself!|`|ak0T96CQaa	A fair percentage of your hunger actually comes from thirst for water. So directly, no, drinking water does not help you lose weight. But if you drink more water, you will be less hungry, and eat less. So it indirectly helps you lose weight. Or gain it slower.|`|K1HnQAZFaa	Yes. It's one of the better ways to keep the body healthy AND curb hunger. Most people mistake thirst/dehydration with hunger...keeping hydrated at all times means that your body will be more able to tell you how much food you need.|`|BsAX7NsYaa	yes it lessens your hunger and gets the nutrients to your blood faster and gives you more atp.. which is energy|`|xZn7WRsUaa	Yes it can. But don't drink to much though.

Have a great day!|`|Z0cmfmo1aa	I know water is good for you but I know that drinking too much can also be bad for some people. I cut out coke and drank water instead.

Don't overdo it.|`|KvOeZwWTaa	yeah before a meal plus it gets rid of pimples yay! and also if you want to lose weight, brush your teeth when you're craving sweets.|`|CXNnAqd0aa	It definitely will because it will in turn cut out other fatty beverages like pop|`|sqmHXmKDaa	yes i lost 20 pounds to just drinking water on all my meals and exercising<br>  <br>  just make sure you eat twice or three times a day|`|2UlIbjMUaa	um....no...but it's kinda gross...but if you get a water bottle and spit in it...you will actually loose weight...water weight...|`|lAZWTLtRaa	yes because it fills you up, when you pee it out you have to drink more water tho, and it's good because you're keeping your body hydrated.<br>  You lose weight by eating right and exercising, not just drinking tons of water.|`|bxxwhP04aa	Yes, I think so.  It helps keep your tummy  feel full at times when you think you need to eat, but ought not eat at that time.  Plus, it hydrates your entire body, which is very healthful.|`|5826c0f958be58086ad9de0d1be3724daa	It is reccomended to drink 8-10 glasses of 8 oz water a day. It helps to detox your body. To get the bad toxins out. So yes, drinking alot of water helps lose weight.|`|N8wNmQShaa	Absolutely, without a lot of water you dont burn nearly as many calories. Water also flushes out your system... its probably the most important thing in weight loss.|`|E0EAXDhfaa	Yes but if you drink to much you can actually drown yourself....it happened over a wii b4 as a competition|`|0H63P4jAaa	especially before a meal.

mjC5XldXaa	It is not uncommon for some bleeding to occur for even 24 hrs.  If the gauze is only mildly stained or slightly pink, don't be alarmed.  Don't forget that the blood gets mixed with saliva and sometimes looks worse than it is.  At this stage the gauze should Not be saturated with blood every 5 minutes or so.  That would be excessive bleeding.  By tomorrow morning the bleeding should be totally stopped and if not see the dentist.  Just keep biting on gauze or a tea bag.  Pressure is the best thing to stop bleeding.<br>  PS  A dry socket usually occurs 2 or 3 days after the extraction.. The blood clot actually washes out of the socket leaving the bone unprotected and exposed.  Very painful, but that's another subject.|`|dQnWZPBsaa	There could be many reasons for this, if you smoke this is probably the reason as the wound doesnt get time to heal. Try rinsing your mouth out with warm salty water and shove a bit toilet roll in the gap where your tooth is to soak up the blood, if it is still bleeding in 30minutes you should go see a doctor as prolonged bleeding can sometimes mean some more serious problems
ilUkTIkWaa	The best way to lose weight is by eating healthy and exercising. go to your gp and maybe he/she could refer you to a dietician, who can make up a healthy eating plan suited to your needs. also make sure that u get a health professional to monitor  your weight, so that things dont get out of control. as for exercise, go for a walk/run, join a team sport such as basketball or netball, swim, anything that is enjoyable that also uses energy. sit ups are good as they burn and build muscle. <br>  Please be very careful though. you are quite young and u dont want to stunt your growth by not feeding your body enough.  trust me, ive been down this path and it gets obsessive. so make sure that you follow medical advise and eat healthy!<br>  sorry if this isnt much help.<br>  xo|`|FyAHNpQbaa	you can't spot train. the only way to lose fat is to do cardio (running, walking, swimming, biking, etc.). the fat will probably not come off where you want it to at first, but it will if you keep at it. you need to do at least 30 mins of cardio a day.<br>  in addition, you should do 2-3 days of weight training. this will not make you big and bulky like a guy, it will make you lean and sexy. having muscle will help you burn more calories faster.<br>  go to sparkpeople.com for diet and exercise tips|`|KGNIGkx9aa	I suggest that you do normal things.<br>  Push ups, crunches and cardio, like running. <br>  Doing this and having a healthy diet works wonders.<br>  But you have to stick to a workout regimen. <br>  But start out slow, then build up.<br>  For the first little while I suggest 20 crunches, 20 pushups, and 10 minutes of running and/or jogging.<br>  Work out at the least, 30 minutes a day.|`|j5Zm7Rndaa	just do cardio and lift weights if you are a guy.

And i wasnt exercising.  So if you do, def do cardio.  Cardio burns fat everywhere.  At least an hour a day, runnin or brisk walking.  Crunches are killer do as many as you can before bed, and you will burn calories through the night.  Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed.  Lots of veges, some fruits, lean protein.  Like chicken and such.  Drink A TON of water.  It keeps you full and hyrdrated.  You burn more calories the more water you drink.  Ive also heard Ice cold water burn calories upon itself.  I like to put lemon in my water to break up the boringness of water.  Its hella good, and it's really good for cleaning out your system.  Good luck.
6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	You would be irregular anyway because you're young. Losing weight certainly didn't help. Don't worry too much, eat and get healthy and it will eventually come back.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover below all reasons for missed periods|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Yes thats very possible.

Ok, I just started doing this and I've lost afout 3 pounds. I mean I know it doesn't sound like a lot but i have only been doing it a few weeks and I wasn't very FAT to begin with. Ok, for the first few weeks start drinking a LOT so it will fill your stomach.I love orange juice but if you want that beware, I know it does sound weird but orange juice can be VERY fattening. I suggest lots of WATER. Trust me if you drink a lot, you feel a weird FULL feeling and you won't want certain things. I recommend fruits such as sour green grapes(they taste a lot like sour candies) and bananas are good. Keep yourself very busy so you won't have time to think about food. Pretzel or pretzel sticks are very good for you too. NO fat. But don't get anything like Auntie Anne's or something. Those would be very bad. I hope this helped you.
giler9Wgaa	the reason your weight is so high is because muscle weights more than fat.. you could have very little fat on your body and weigh alot for that reason. so you cant always go by the pounds you have to go by how you look and how healthy you are when you got alot of muscle|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	Your body isn't done growing yet, so don't worry!

You are probably at least 5 lbs underweight.<br>  <br>  As long as you are eating enough and you feel OK you are probably OK as long as you are aware that under eating can stunt any further growth.  Your calorie intake is too low for a 13 year old and perhaps you might want to increase it to 1,500 or 1,800 calories a day.  800-1,000 calories a day is insufficient.|`|K1HnQAZFaa	You're not fat.<br>  <br>  You're pretty damn needy though. Grow a backbone and stop giving girls a bad name.  You are you. Be healthy physically and mentally and you get all the good guys later in life. Be proud of who you are and stop looking for affirmation from others.
d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	sort of, you did use some of the calories within the hour you were digesting...|`|K2a3XFlFaa	yes. <br>  <br>  and what do you want <br>  caloires or stomach acid burning away your trachea every time you throw up!!|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Food digestion starts immediately. Hence why even if you DID have bulimia, it would be ineffective in losing weight anyway. Bulimia does NOT make you lose weight, as calories still enter your body even if all of them are not absorbed.<br>  <br>  After an hour of digestion, you most definitely got at least SOME of the calories. Obviously not all of them stayed there, and puking I'm sure burned some calories, but I would could part of the calories for sure.|`|K1HnQAZFaa	Worrying about if you should count your calorie intake this religiously means you have an eating disorder. You know that. Outwardly admitting it is a good place to start to be healthy again.|`|Sre03EZ6aa	Technically, yes. <br>  You ate the calories and you just threw back up and out the calories. <br>  <br>  lol sorry you got sick, that sounds rough!<br>  At least now you know what not to eat. :)|`|N8wNmQShaa	Some of the calories probably counted, but not all. You would have a little room to eat a bit more.|`|JSZMubz3aa	Don't add it. It takes over 4-5 hours for food to get to your small intestine, where most of the absorption happens. If it's within an hour, then it's highly likely that very little amounts of calories have been absorbed. You DID take it in, but you didn't absorb it, so don't add it.|`|s9MxeQNtaa	No. Don't add it. :-) Have a great day! Also, you wouldn't add it because it takes several hours for calories/food to get in the bloodstream.
CkUjIA1maa	Are they itchy? Warm? Red? Crusty?  Have you been in a hot tub lately? Have you recently had a viral illness?  Have you ever had anything similar happen after shaving?  More information is needed, but it sounds like you might want to make an appointment with your dermatologist to find out what's going on.|`|GTKXq7A1aa	Did you just shave? It could be razor bumps.<br>  Make sure to keep the area clean and dry
HcS8vzNCaa	Your premise that you need to lose weight is misguided.  At five-feet-half-an-inch, your perfect weight is about 103, based on the fact that a five foot girl should be 100.  Of course, there is a healthy weight range here, but for a medium-build girl, you are normal, but a bit light of normal.  This is a perfect weight for you, unless you have very large or very small bones.<br>  <br>  At your weight, exercising more will probably add a few pounds, but they won't be noticeable.  You can easily add about five to ten pounds of muscle without looking overweight.<br>  <br>  Your goals include wanting to tone up the muscles of your arms and legs.  If you don't want to gain much weight, don't do heavy lifting, which will build a lot of muscle mass.  You sound as though you prefer  long, lean muscles, which are more functional anyway.<br>  <br>  The way to get long, lean muscles is by focusing on aerobic activities which utilize all the muscles of the body.  Cross-country skiing and swimming fit the bill nicely, but if you can't find a pool or snow, you can try elliptical trainers or indoor skiing machines.  The main  thing is to find something you enjoy, that uses all your muscles repetitively.   A good aerobic workout is at least thirty minutes in duration.<br>  <br>  Secondly, work on your flexibility, utilizing a systematic stretching routine, like yoga or Pilates.  These exercises will keep your muscles loose and relaxed, and will diminish the chances of torn muscles from your aerobic and other exercises. <br>  <br>  Finally, a little resistance exercise will help you, but since you don't want to bulk up, I suggest doing calisthenics for about fifteen minutes a day.  Push-ups, jumping jacks, step-ups, etc.  will keep your muscles firm but small, and will eliminate your "jiggly" parts.<br>  <br>  Above all, please don't worry about losing weight.  You really are at a healthy weight now.  Teen obesity has become a serious problem lately, and you may see a number of your peers battling weight problems.  You are not one of these, so please put yourself in that group.  All you need is building an exercise foundation for the rest of your life.  The health habits you develop now will be the ones you will most likely keep up later in life.  All my best to you.|`|aGzh5e7Haa	I have just recently lost 25 pounds since december.  I plan on losing 10 pounds a month until I reach my goal which is about 150 pounds.<br>  <br>  I refuse to use any diet pills or try anything crazy!  All I did was:  eat only fruits and vegetables, smaller portions and snack on them throughout the day.  Some meat here and there is fine.  <br>  <br>  The secret for me has been "smaller portions"  Exercise is good too and will give you faster results.  But whatever you do, dont try diet pills.  Good Luck and try just sticking with fruits and veggies...  ohhh and by the way, I discovered "fat free pringles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  hahahah  And I eat them as a reward ;)
jXndHFm3aa	LOSING WEIGHT: <br>  <br>  Losing weight is hard for a lot of people if you feel you’re the only one with troubles losing weight trust me your not. Make sure your not stressed out a lot stress makes you gain belly fat. If you are always stressed you got to chill scream into a pillow, wash your face with cold water, call a friend think of something to do because stress is not worth your time.<br>  <br>  EATING RIGHT: <br>  <br>  They say oranges eat up your belly fat I don’t know if it’s true but that’s what they say. Start eating healthy things from now on for fruit like apples, oranges, pears, peaches things like that. Eat for vegetables things like carrots, potatoes, Broccoli. Sweet food is okay once in a while but not everyday.<br>  <br>  EXERSIZING: <br>  <br>  Make sure before you exercise you do 50 sit ups and 50 pushups. It kind of gets your stomach muscles working for your work out! Maybe running if you got a treadmill if you don’t, I recommend you go to a gym and run on one. If you live on a farm simply running around your house.<br>  <br>  EXERSIZING SPORTS: <br>  <br>  Swimming, Jogging, Skating, Hoola Hooping things like that!<br>  <br>  Or you could try Wii Fit. <br>  Well, I hope this helps you and good luck losing weight!
2RzEaod9aa	Toning is just another word for muscle. <br>  <br>  You could certainly try adding size to the rest of your body to make your calves look smaller, but because you want to "thin them," chances are they aren't as muscular as you'd like to tell yourself. I was a fatty before as well, and lied to myself that it was "mostly muscle." Doesn't work that way.|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Slaughter them and throw a massive barbecue.|`|KGNIGkx9aa	If they are pretty muscular now, then the only way to lose the muscle is to stop working out. That's the only way I can think of to lose muscle. My legs are the same way, all muscle. But I have learned to love them and flaunt them. Ps I'm 5'3 too.|`|j5Zm7Rndaa	what do you do currently? In terms of working out that is ofc. Also, are you skinny? approx your body fat if you can|`|L1RtyIVcaa	Hi!!!

TRUST ME|`|FyAHNpQbaa	you will get a boyfriend. there is somebody out there that thinks you're beautiful.|`|uXFdeKGPaa	its all about confidence huni keep your head up.|`|rtV052yxaa	noo!|`|XpWjdPg2aa	That's totally not true. Lots of people have to work hard at asking people out. Including me, btw. <br>  <br>  Of course there's hope for you. Your problem is that you obviously don't feel self-confident. Guys don't like girls who aren't self-confident. If you need to lose weight to feel self-confident, then do it!|`|ZmXiFkmTaa	Its all about change these days.|`|XQJg3RNTaa	It's sad but you kind of have a point, you'd be surprised how far a pretty face and a sexy body will get you in this world. I don't like it any more than you do.<br>  I used to be very overweight and once I realized the advantages it was great motivation for working out, and now I feel much better than I did when I was obese.<br>  I guess what I'm saying is you should consider fixing your situation.|`|0629ba226685cd875a8a9c9400895adbaa	Yes there is hope for you. If you don't like how you look try to lose weight but in the meantime get your confidence up. Stop thinking that you are fat start finding things you like or even love about yourself.   I am overweight and I sometimes feel like you do but then I stop and think hey I have a great personality and if the guys can't see that then sorry it's their loss. I wish you the best of luck...
RKTNDLDKaa	It could be a lot of different things.     A visit to the gyno is absolutely in order.  <br>  <br>  You could have some fibroid tumors or some cysts.    A vaginal ultrasound should tell.  <br>  <br>  A bacterial infection.     This is not an STD.    The gyno takes a same and looks at it under the microscope.   Results back same day. <br>  <br>  Endometerosis.    <br>  <br>  Adenomyosis.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are experiencing dryness and not realizing  it.   Try using some lubricant--plain.  No warming.   <br>  <br>  Try relaxing.  I know it sounds silly, but if you are anticipating discomfort, you may be tense and if you are tense, it will be uncomfortable.    <br>  <br>  If you do not get any answers, get a second or third opinion.     You know your body and you know when something isn't "right" and so you shouldn't let anyone convince you otherwise.|`|8ZZapX2daa	I would think your doctor already checked, but you may have a bacterial infection.  A 'wet prep' looked at under the microscope would be a starting place to check.  I had one and didn't know it except for very painful intercourse.  After a week of antibiotics it got better.  Something to ask your doctor about maybe?|`|4gC38fKsaa	you could just be "tight." you'll get used to it eventually.|`|WFDXsEmSaa	dyspareunia maybe??? although since u said youve never had this problem before i dont know.....|`|TycCeqtaaa	maybe your partners thing is too big?<br>  or maybe its him that has something and it causes you to hurt?<br>  does it sting or something? <br>  maybe try condoms and see how that feels? gosh girl i feel sorry for you.<br>  but i hope you find the problem. =/|`|DQkDQraOaa	Go to the gyno. They will probably order an interior ultrasound to see if you have any fibroids or cysts. Good luck.
NPhepcBkaa	Yes,yes you are.<br>  You clearly need to cheat on many wife. With cupcake.|`|KHR2toXZaa	LOL<br>  help saisai timberbitch deleted my acct. (;.;)|`|btNoRiPWaa	Be gone troll.
AA10478980	Those products are all about making money for the producers and taking your money away from you.  And they are not healthy, and many of them are actually dangerous.  They don't do what they claim.
QY0ETRH0aa	yes, but not too much. maybe 2-4lbs a week. try eating less foods and drink a lot of water. water usually tricks your stomach into not being hungry. and spend less time watching t.v., computer, video games, etc. try doing extra activities instead of always jogging. do active stuff that you like doing, i.e: soccer, football, baseballl, etc.|`|zzeS8jJwaa	if you first start out 1-2 miles a day is enough, don't over exercise oki?? but trust me after a month or so, you don't want to run 1-2 miles because you would be too good by then :D|`|ginv4lZZaa	lower your calories ,and you're gonna have to work harder than that .<br>  if you're mad out of shape .... one - two miles straight will be tough|`|YUJWfeMoaa	Definatley... but actually at first you will lose weight, and then you'll start gaining some more, but it will be muscle weight, muscle weighs more than fat. Plus running is a great way to get in shape, so you'll look good and feel good too!
Gcf0GAIZaa	Most of it was, except for the coke. Coke has far too many calories to burn off. the vanilla custard doesn't sound too good either. Lay off the sweets! Reward yourself after a weeks time depending on whether you decide that you have a good calorie intake for the week or not. Try replacing the coke with water. Also, you should start exercising into your plan. Oh, also, butter and jam= no good, too many calories. Replace that with something else. A large bowl of carrot and coriander soup? No! Spread that out, and eat it throughout the day.|`|mags2ekzaa	that doesnt sound like many calories, you mustve eaten more than that per day in the past to get to 19 stone?<br>  <br>  maybe try to eat porridge for breakfast.  porridge is a brilliant breakfast cos its full of fibre and it fills you up til lunch.  plus it wont mess up your blood sugar levels like jam does
Rn8Em3OLaa	Yes, although, don't forget cardio. Maybe just 30 minutes twice a week?<br>  And more protein for you too if your working out like you are.<br>  <br>  But apart from that there's nothing wrong with your schedule.|`|XQJg3RNTaa	what do you mean and so on same pattern? You mean your just going to switch those two days the whole week?<br>  First, forearms are useless exercises, I always have a little chuckle when I see people doing french curls or pulling up that weight on a rope by twisting a pipe, it's fine if you want to do them, I just consider them a lost effort because the muscles are good for nothing. <br>  Second, you don't have any triceps in there and you could injure yourself easily if you lift chest and don't develop your triceps. I'm bad about that myself.<br>  Another key thing you are missing is technical lifts, they're no fun but they will help with your overall strength and look, as well as raising your RMR. You should try and put Squats, Cleans, Deadlift, and Snatches in there somewhere.<br>  And you also need a day of rest in between lifting days, for example if you do this on monday and tuesday, take wednesday off or do cardio. <br>  Make sure your getting at least three exercises on each muscle group and keep your rest under 30sec. always, good luck.|`|1S7MpzW5aa	probably not.<br>  you need some cardio as well.<br>  and a break during the week :)
qzRDh8Rgaa	You will, remember 85% Diet 15% exercise. So diet is way more important than exercise.<br>  <br>  The fruits and vegetables, try to eat more carrots and more raspberries, because sugar is all over strawberries and grapes.<br>  <br>  I know you will lose weight if you stay under 1400 calories.<br>  <br>  Exercise is like gas to a car, but then again you only want to turn on the radio so you don't need gas (exercise), but if you do exercise, you will speed up the weight loss process big time.|`|0colK2Efaa	from a scientific view protein takes twice as much energy to turn into fat, so if you eat that it would be harder for it to become fate. But ut if you exercise (swimming is one of the best) then you will lose weight.|`|TXw2T44Gaa	not so much excerise|`|WcYRd9DLaa	not much.|`|ITo6FhPzaa	hey same with me im trying to lose weight good luck!<br>  this is what i do <br>  breakfast: Egg white<br>  <br>  Lunch: salad<br>  <br>  Dinner: Lean chicken breast<br>  <br>  excerise: 30  mins of runnig on treadmill then 50 lunges<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps
C05aHvwdaa	There are some things you can do but, acupuncture, chiropractic, things like that only masks the pain but doesn't cure the problem. It's like taking a pain pill. The pain may leave but the cause is still there. Inversion therapy causes your muscles of your core (the hips, thighs, buttocks, back muscles and most importantly the stomach muscles) to stretch out. As they stretch the knots and spasms leave and when these muscles are all relaxed they loosen their grip on your lower back muscles, your spine and most importantly your pelvis, allowing them to go back into natural alignment. As they align this will cause your sciatica to vanish. It's like if your car is out of alignment it pulls to one side and screws up the tires, it's the same with your back. Inversion therapy will help align your spine much quicker than some pillow while you're laying on your back. Hope this helps.|`|piE8mQM3aa	If you have buldging discs, find a local pain management doctors office by your house that accepts your insurance. They will most likely tell your to get an MRI (if you haven't already gotten one. Then either give you injections at a surgery center and/or send you for PT.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  (If it's NOT a bulding disc and could be herniated- there are a NUMBER of different types of injections or treatments they could do. Some pain management clinics do and don't require referrals from PCP's. Check that out as well.)|`|kadNaNg9aa	go to a dr asap cause i thought i could do the same thing and it ended up being a shattered disk and i havent been right since
SOfbIOzUaa	My wife once lost 30 pounds in 30 days. She did it by eating only fresh fruit and vegetables. Fruit in the morning and vegetables the rest of the day. Nothing cooked everything raw. She also took some supplements. One that I remember was spirulina.|`|QY0ETRH0aa	i have lost 30lbs in 5 and 1/2 weeks. seeems hard but just follow the steps: 1. Excercise for at least 1 hour a day. 2. Eat only little portions of food from each category. 3. Vegetables and fruits are great for snacks. 4. Drink a lot of water(sometimes tricks you into not being hungry) 5. That's pretty much all you have to do. (If your planning to lose more weight, try to exercise more. Do something active that you like doing, etc.)|`|0FIvrC3Uaa	hi<br>  <br>  I have not lost 30 lbs, but I've lost 20!<br>  It's awesome that you want to loose weight<br>  <br>  the best way to loose weight is by doing cardie, instead of cutting back on tons of calories<br>  <br>  I tries cutting back on my calories and gained 10 lbs! (while still doing cardio) because I slowed down my metabolism so much<br>  <br>  The most weight you could probably loose in 6 weeks is 12 lbs (depending on your weight and calorie defecit) but that's loosing around 2 lbs a week

QY0ETRH0aa	PROBABLY THE MOST EASIEST WAY OF LOSING WEIGHT AS FOLLOWS: 1. Exercise for at least an hour each day. 2. Eat from all food categories, but not too much or too little. 3. For snacks, eat mostly fruits or vegetables. 4. Drink a lot of water so it may seem that your not too hungry. 5. You may mantain a healthy diet if you do all this correctly.

See how she would like to be scarred, mutilated and deprived of sexual sensitivity for the rest of HER life!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, your glans is hypersensitive, and this will diminish if you keep it retracted for 5-10 minutes at a time, perhaps twice per day.<br>  <br>  The exposure to the air and a little gentle handling will diminish the sensitivity to a normal level within a month or so.<br>  <br>  Don't leave the foreskin back any longer than that, as extended retraction can make your foreskin swell and become quite painful.<br>  <br>  No, it isn't necessary to have the foreskin retracted during sex.     It moves back and forth, which is more enjoyable for both partners.<br>  <br>  You're lucky to have a foreskin, which is an essential part of a complete penis so that your sexual experiences will also be complete.      Most circumcised guys have no idea of the sensitivity of which they've been deprived.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Here's a helpful link about retraction and sensitivity: <a href="http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tightforeskin" rel="nofollow">http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...</a><br>  it will get less sensitive in time if you touch it more.<br>  <br>  During sex the foreskin naturally slides up and down. <br>  <br>  Harriet|`|SltEwVX7aa	baby oil works best;  lotion is a good second choice.<br>  <br>  put a few drops of either on your fingertip, shuck back your foreskin, and (gently) rub the glans with your lubed fingertip.

It'll do what it wants to do.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	The glans of the penis is very sensitive for a very good reason.  That is the bit of the penis that produces enjoyment during sex.  Just keep washing it as you don't want to become a cheese factory.  Don't worry about retracting your foreskin during sex.  It will all happen by itself.|`|Z4OeKTToaa	yes its important to keep it clean and to pull it back when u shower or bath and no it dont need to be retracted if<br>  <br>  if u wanna talk more msg me bk <br>  hey_monkey2003|`|ZOa478yFaa	you should probably just get yourself circumcised, buddy.

b7y1SCAOaa	Yes, those are the CLASSIC symptoms of allergies! You do not need to worry.<br>  <br>  The best way to control your symptoms is to avoid the things that make them worse, but this is hard. If these symptoms are bothering you, I would recommend trying an antihistamine. There are many available that are generally quite effective. Something like Claritin only needs to be taken once a day, and will not make you drowsy. It is available in a generic form which is relatively inexpensive. They usually start to have their maximum effect on your symptoms within a few days, and will dry out your nose to stop the runny nose, and will control your sneezing and itchy eyes too. Sometimes the eye symptoms may persist, and you may need an eye drop for this, but for many people, an antihistamine in a pill form will help. I would give this a try, it will probably be quite effective for you.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you should check with your doctor. Antihistamines are the first thing anyone with allergies should try, but if they are not doing the job as well as you'd like, there are prescription options that can help, such as different types of nasal sprays, including steroids and antihistamines, as well as antihistamine eye drops that can help for itchy watery eyes.<br>  <br>  A cool compress on the eyes can help the itching too. Wet a facecloth with cool water and apply it to your closed eyes for 15 minutes, 4 or more times per day. This is safe and easy to do, and helps a lot with itching, burning eyes due to allergies.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. There is no reason to worry.. these symptoms are definitely pointing to allergies, and there is no other disease or illness that has these symptoms the way you are describing them.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

If you are just starting out with having your periods this can be an indication that your body is still trying to adjust to the changes going on (an example only).  The only way to know for sure is to talk to your doctor to see what they think could be going on.<br>  <br>  As for Spring Break, if the old blood is related to ovulation then it should not affect when your period would normally come.<br>  <br>  I am also going to include the link to a site that may help you find more information.

48GkKhh5aa	bruise-like mark made during love-making by pressing the mouth to the skin on one’s partner’s body and sucking, and pulling it into their mouth for about 30 seconds. This creates breakage of the blood vessels and causes either a red or brown, semi-circular shape to appear on the skin.  While hickeys tend not to be very painful, they still may be unwelcome. As well, for the underage person, a blatant hickey could cause problems at home. t is important to ascertain before giving a hickey/lovebite/monkey bite, that the receiving person actually wants one. There are many people who do not like them, and who would find getting a hickey both mean and offensive. Since hickeys are often associated with sexual foreplay, many teens and adult do not wish to advertise their sexual behavior with a big hickey.|`|PImvmP1paa	Hickey's are broken capillaries under the skin. <br>  <br>  You get them from your boyfriend/girlfriend sucking on your neck or other places.|`|MlQ0GIpoaa	A hickey is given by biting and sucking the skin.

ZqXUduJMaa	Why not eat healthy all day instead of just after 2pm? Generally, to lose weight, you need to exercise and eat fewer calories. Always eating a good breakfast and not eating late in the day will help your metabolism. Cut out soda altogether - they are just empty calories, and don't fill you up so you end up eating just as much.|`|3Y7RJu3taa	That really won't be helpful.  Its clear that you just need to make some substitutions because eating all healthy food only makes you binge later. (plenty of people are like that so its not big deal.)  Try and go for healthier alternatives to the foods you love.  For example, Switch to whole grains, diet soda (better yet no soda at all,) low fat ice cream etc.  Also, focus on controlling your portions.  Many people eat healthy but overlook their portion size, which is where they fail.  Your friend's idea is doomed to fail because your setting yourself up to binge at certain hours and think its ok because its not the entire day.  What I do, which has been effective, is think about the nutritional value of every single thing I eat.  I consider the balance of whole grains (I don't eat anything white), protein and fruits and veggies, and compare it to the level of activity I did during the day.  It helps me get a better sense of how food plays a role in my body, and decrease the number of sweets and empty calories I eat per day.  <br>  Good Luck!|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Walking is a fantastic way to lose weight  I started walking my dogs each night & before I knew it I  lost weight & my body in general felt better so yeah I cut out everything after 8PM  I ate yogurt & salads & I got low fat micro dinners at the store I'm not 1 for doing reg exercises but walking worked it's not hard once you see how cutting out the fats & junk food  the weight does come off  I hope this helps|`|WW66AkgJaa	i was reading an article online recently and scientists said the key to losing weight is cutting calories. just drink water instead of other drinks and maybe exercise. and cut calories, but not too much like a crash diet or anything.|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	Eat healthy, DON'T snack, and exercise<br>  <br>  3 meals, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, period...

It won't work you'll pig out until your supposed to eat right and regret every bite!.....everyone thinks carbs are bad but carbs are the things that keep you going if you eliminate them from your diet you'll be in such a bad mood and feel so tired!! Eat a good breakfast look for cereal w/ at least 3 grams of fiber per serving and remember just because a cereal w/ fiber has 230 calories doesn't mean it's bad for you (those are good carbs!!)  ...try eating a good good carbs like wheat bread-apples-ect......<br>  ......for breakfast don't eat a bagel!!go to the store and buy cherrios or honey bunches of oats and only eat one serving!!!! (Thats a cup)I usually eat my cereal in a cup so it looks like I've got more than I do.. then eat a piece of fruit and yogurt or something like that then  for lunch pack a healthy lunch and don't bring any money to buy food at school so you won't be tempted to eat anything else....when you get home eat a healthy snack or bring something on the bus and then go for a walk or dance to music anything that gets your heart rate up...exercise is a big part of losing weight!! Don't think you can get by w/ just eating right bec. more than likely you'll tell yourself "well I can eat this one bad thing and I'll work it off later but one thing leads to another and soon you find yourself at the bottom of the ice cream bucket or scraping the very last of the crumbs from a bag of chips...you can do it!! <br>  PS. one thing I do every morning is I tell my self 10 things I like about myself on the inside or out...It's called positive self talk..it helps you feel better about yourself even when you don't feel like trying....<br>  hope this helps YOU CAN DO IT!!!! =]--drink lots of water!!!!!|`|c922633c597731abb86aae9cac7f9c32aa	Hey dont put yourself in stress and dont worry, try these tips it will help you.<br>   <br>  Stop the fizzy drinks.<br>  exercise for about 15 mins or more everyday.<br>  Eat healthy food<br>  Drink ALOT of lemon juice or make it yourself and drink it instead of fizzy drinks and its much better.<br>  whenever you have nothing to do go for a walk<br>  also go to the gym<br>  <br>  do this for a week and will see a BIG difference!!|`|7DZ5z8Vyaa	NO dont do that! Your body will splurge before 2.00 pm. that is a big mistake, either that or your body will store your sugars highly (fat). You just always need to eat healthy and healthy amounts. Snack occasionaly around two cookies a day or a small cake treat, but dont splurge. Ask an average weight friend if what you are going to eat for snack is a good amount. Eat lots of salads and iced tea. The main thing is more excersize. Join a gym with a friend. Stay commited!|`|d6ZJj4hVaa	Diets don't work. It doesn't matter what you eat or when you eat it.

Workout DAILY!!|`|a6Y3gczwaa	Yes that is good and try to stay away from those late night snacks.|`|o6TQs7F1aa	no that is not the most effective way to loose weight, what is shown to be a very successful way to loose weight is to have three nice full and healthy meals a day, breakfast lunch and dinner.but as you probably know breakfast is the most important meal of the day, heres why. when you wake up you have burned of alot of the previous days energy by sleeping(yes you can burn by just sleeping!) but now you dont have anything left to keep you moving, if you skip breakfast than you have nothing to keep you going for the rest of the day. so eating a big breakfast is actually recommend fo loosing weight, youll be less hungry latter in the day like at lunch, but still eat a lunch, not to big though, just like a sandwich or a salad(keep it healthy). and actually studies show that it is better not to eat a big dinner, because really if you think about it what are you going to do with all that newly acquired food right before you go to bed, you can use the energy while you sleep but you dont burn all the extra, you store it, which is not what you want for loosing weight. dont just skip dinner though, just make sure its not a huge massive dinner.<br>  <br>  and mabey give up something for lent that you like to indulge on, like brownes or soda or something, i gave up pizza<br>  <br>  but your diet isnt all you can do, join sports team or just exercises on your own more

ms82j4iaaa	if you just got the cold sore, apply ice to it to stop it from spreading.<br>  also, you're going to want to not touch it and after you apply the medications, wash your hands. because it's very spreadable.  <br>  secondly, there are lots of cold sore medications out there.<br>  some of the cheapest are things like blistex which are like 2-3 dollars at a local drug store. <br>  the "best" medication for it is made by a brand called abreva. it's supposed to heal it fastest.<br>  but really, it all depends on what works for you.<br>  when it's almost healed it gets crusty and looks really gross. but you're almost done with it so don't feel bad. it'll be gone soon after that. <br>  if you pick that scab off, it usually bleeds. and could leave scars. so it's not a great idea if it's huge. but if it ends up being the day of your pictures and you have like a tiny scab, personally i'd get it off so it wasn't crusty for the picture and just put a little blistex on it to protect the openness.|`|zoCTvYoRaa	For cold sore, you can follow these tips:<br>  <a href="http://hits.affiliatetraction.com/cgi-bin/redir?pd_link=i1-a32289-o2083-c21081" rel="nofollow">http://hits.affiliatetraction.com/cgi-bi...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck ;-)|`|LkfW1B24aa	USE CARMEX..THAT DEFINATLY WORKS.

Try maybe 25. You'll look great at 119. I want a flat stomach like my BFF has.<br>  <br>  Basically, I'm eating:<br>  <br>  Breakfast - <br>  Toast with peanut butter (protein)<br>  <br>  Lunch -<br>  Tuna fish sandwich<br>  Diet Coke<br>  <br>  Dinner - <br>  Chicken/Fish<br>  Veggie<br>  Handful of Noodles (i.e. Pasta-Roni, etc.)<br>  <br>  DON'T SNACK. Unless it's a fruit or something. Eat proteins, they'll tide you over. They take longer to break down. Tuna is a protein so it'll work for lunch. It can be a ham sandwich or something, tho.<br>  <br>  If you do this right, it should take about 2 months or so to get to 119 (more or less). It only takes about a month to lose it if you're 144 lbs.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, take a brisk walk around your block a couple times every day. That's your exercise.<br>  <br>  And don't starve yourself. You actually keep weight if you do, cuz your body goes into starvation mode and keeps your food around longer.

DI3u9gMSaa	The biggest drawback is that Invisalign can't move every teeth if they are too out of place.  That's why buttons need to be glued, filed, etc.  <br>  <br>  Invisalign will help a cross bite by pushing (forcing) teeth in certain areas.  <br>  <br>  There are going to be results after every set of aligners.  But they'll be hard to see from one aligner to the next one.  Compare the first to the 20th and you'll see a huge difference.  My site shows pictures of my first and 21st.  <br>  <br>  Only an orthodontist can tell you the length of treatment, but even that is not final.  I was scheduled for a certain number of aligner sets but when it came close to the end, the orthodontist told me I needed more.  Yikes!<br>  <br>  My speech was affected the first several days but I got used to it.  Try saying the word "streets" and you'll sound funny the first week.<br>  <br>  I created a site that answers a lot of your questions.  Email me if you would like!|`|ueeBGJnvaa	I don't think there are any draw backs besides that they are easier to loose then metal braces because you are taking them on and off to eat. You have to remove them to eat and be care of some drinks because they will stain the aligner.. like wine. <br>  <br>  Yes it can help a crossbite. It depends on your case when the doc evaluates you to see if you are a possible canidate for invisalign. The doc then can give you somewhat of an estimate of how long it will take. When they submit your case to invisalign you will find out exactly how many aligners you will need to straighten your teeth. When you get them you will change them every 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  I haven't heard from any of our patients that it is hard to talk with their aligners.
gvWC3tvgaa	sure|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I think you need to drink water. take the amount of your weight & divide that number by 2...so a person who is 150 lbs would get 75 & that is how many ounces of water they need to drink each day...If it is almost time for you to go to bed don't drink much now.. Drink a bottle of water first think in the morning & try to drink as much as you can early in the day.

eI0V852Saa	Myoplex is an extremely good muscle supplement. Cell tech is also great. No-xplode is great for getting that explosive work out, but it makes you kind of jittery. Personally, the most progress i've experienced in my building history, Whey protein, and creatine. The past month, i've been using Whey protein, and creatine with my workouts, and i've gained about 15 pounds of muscle mass, and that's only in the past month. I know a few guys on steroids, and they usually experience about 10 to 15 pounds in three weeks to a month on average.<br>  And a good amount of it depends on your body type, and metabolism.<br>  Hope i helped.

kzECdCbQaa	Hello,<br>  I am a Dietitian and would be glad to help you! That is wonderful that you want to eat healthier, it would be great if more Americans were like you! Anyways, do you go food shopping with your family? If so you could ask Mom to buy things like whole wheat bread and lean deli meat to make sandwiches to take for lunch then get some fruits like apples or bananas that will pack easily in a lunchbag then get some carrots or if your not a big fan of veggies, you could try some Kashi crackers. What kinds of things do you guys do for dinner? Would you be able to prepare something for yourself if they are eating unhealthy? What about breakfast - its the most important meal of the day!

I don't think feminine products need to be an object of shame that requires discreet packaging - what's so embarrassing about your period that you don't want to use a brand of tampons that has red on the box?<br>  <br>  As for Secret's slogan, well, it's the eternal curse of ad campaigns that while they will grab some section of the target audience, they will also push away some customers.  <br>  <br>  So they don't work for you - don't buy their products.

However, I think it's better to be plainly obvious than have nothing 'catchy' at all. I don't think of it being crude- 'period' is just another word for menstrual cycle, and it's not shameful or uncouth.<br>  As for Secret, I think mostly they're trying to do a play on words. 'Because you're hot' is their slogan because when you're hot, you sweat, therefore need their deodorant, a long with its meaning that you look good.

Make a note of how long you use it each time and the distance you've gone, it's really motivating and ensures a consistent workout. Your weight loss also depends on your speed. If you go fast for a couple minutes and a slow/regular pace for a couple minutes, then repeat for your whole session, you burn extra fat and calories. Just look up 'interval training', it's the new craze.<br>  I also suggest making it fun by listening to your favorite songs and club remixes.

Green stuff on the knife could indicate the color of bile found in the intestine and parts of the gi tract.  He will feel pain but the hospital can make him comfortable with medication.  its hard to tell you how long before he bleeds only because there is different factors but if he is in the hospital than there main priority will be to stop any bleeding. the intestine will not creep out of the hole if the knife stabbed him and came straight out because a knife cut would not be big enough unless there was a deep enough and long enough incision. dont worry  he is young. young people tend to heal fast.|`|xTqZiiZUaa	Green stuff == Bile or Feces<br>  <br>  Surgery to fix it is easy, fighting the infection isn't.  If it hit his intesting (green stuff == feces) with a pocket knife, he will probably be in and out of surgery within a few hours, and in ICU with IV antibiotics for a while (a week or so).

dkCNV7gSaa	Well basically eating less can result into more weight so I wouldn't recommend that a lot. When you don't eat your body eats it's own body fat, which isn't healthy for you, and after you do get while your starving your body will store a lot of the food resulting in stomach aches and maybe throwing up. The reason it store the food is because your body is afraid you won't eat again. So basically you need to not only eat less junk food but be aware of sugar too. When you eat cookies and etc inform yourself about the sugar your taking in. An average daily diet for sugar is 48 g which is almost what you get from ONE can of pop. So worrying about sugar is much more important than junk food. Exercising will help burn off calories and sleeping is the BEST way to burn off calories so you should sleep more. <br>  <br>  Your basic answer is:<br>  Eat less junk food and consume less sugar. Also exercise and sleep more often. Don't starve your stomach. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps you!|`|MpTZjdLJaa	losing wieght is very simple<br>  the only factor that will stop you is temptation<br>  if you stay commited, then pounds will fly off you<br>  <br>  just some extra tips:<br>  1. list of bad foods:<br>  chips, popcorn(only if butter is included), cheese, anything fried, an fastfood<br>  2. veggies, the greener the better.

Next time you only see the negative side of things think, 'ok i can see the negative' then try to find the positive!|`|88i6HGzCaa	forget the bad things in life for a while just let yourself have fun|`|D4ot0qLpaa	Hmmmm.<br>  <br>  It's pretty difficult to live all the time with a negative outlook. But it's also pretty hard to suddenly shift to a positive outlook. Are those really the only two alternatives, though? I know many people hold that view, but if you think about it, isn't that kind of an oversimplified and dualistic view of life?<br>  <br>  How about a REALISTIC outlook instead? Think about it this way:<br>  <br>  Positive and negative are both extremes. Given the choice, positive is certainly the more pleasant extreme, much of the time, and it's also a lot more functional than negative, much of the time. But both of them are a little bit unrealistic, aren't they?<br>  <br>  The best won't always happen. The worst won't always happen. <br>  <br>  We won't always succeed. We won't always fail. <br>  <br>  Both ends of the spectrum are a product of our imagination, our way of creating reality as we choose to see it, rather than as it really is.<br>  <br>  Yeah, the best won't always happen. But that doesn't mean that the best will never happen. Or that what happens can't be reasonably okay, or at least livable, most of the time.<br>  <br>  The way out is not for you to try and suddenly change yourself to be the way other people want you to be. The way out is for you to find new ways of being and thinking and feeling that can help you to live your own life better, even if they're not exactly the way everyone else wants you to be.<br>  <br>  So you don't have to try to be suddenly all positive and cheerful. That's every bit as unnatural, in its way, as being negative and gloomy all the time. It feels fake, and it doesn't really help because you can't sustain it. <br>  <br>  Instead, you could try walking more in the middle of the road. Be realistic. When you find yourself dwelling on the worst, don't suddenly try to shift into expecting the best. Instead, shift yourself more toward the middle. Remind yourself that there's no particular reason that the worst should happen. After all, how many times has the worst ACTUALLY happened? Probably not many. It's improbable. It's far more likely that something in between will happen, something that could be characterized as "not too bad" or maybe even "pretty decent". <br>  <br>  Constant negativizing is a fantasy, a game that doesn't fit in with reality. It allows you (and me - I do it a lot myself)  to create your own reality and shut out any other versions of reality, and that's a lonely place. If you start to gently let in some other views, your reality can expand slowly and gently, without you trying to turn yourself into someone else. You can still be you, just a little bit expanded.<br>  <br>  Then, when you've opened up enough to experience that good things sometimes really DO happen, maybe you'll loosen up enough to start expecting good things sometimes. :)<br>  <br>  There's my two cents' worth, for whatever it's worth.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
FMajZYS2aa	Root canal is needed when the cavity is too deep into the nerve. It is basically removing the infection and placing deep filling in the center of the root so the tooth can be saved. <br>  <br>  The benefit is that it would help prevent severe pain and infections.<br>  <br>  The cost for root canal vary from 600-1200. Depending on which tooth it is and the dentist. <br>  <br>  It is probably a front tooth so it costs about 600. With modern technology, root canal therapy of front tooth can be succesfully finished in one visit and within 20 min. Hope this helps.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	It definitely wasn't a root canal in 20 minutes and the price is crazy for 20 minutes work.|`|AA10137237	I'd call and complain root canals normally take two visits to complete. They can cost over 500 dollars, so the price for it is right.
Sy6sU46haa	first off, i must say i am very sorry for the crap you have to live with why cant the different races just get along and not fight all the time then again i have no room to speak i am italian so there is the whole mob scene especially in newyork, and chicago.<br>  <br>  However i think that you should tell your mom first thing that you are scared for your life and that your life is in danger just to do simple things like walk down the street. If she doesn't allow you to move in with her or she doesn't help you move out then i would try seeing if you could find a low rent appartment in a more decent neighborhood in chicago. Another good thing for you to do is get a license to carry a fire-arm and start carrying a 9mm or a simple .357 magnum with you. WHAT EVER YOU DO STAY IN AT NIGHT KEEP DOORS LOCKED, AND DONT CARRY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ON YOU! try to be with a buddy or buddies as often as possible when on the streets of chicago. but dont make it to where they think you are part of a gang, that will make more trouble for you because i think they are only intimidating you because they think your a rival. or you can always tell them back off or i will call the immigration control on your azz lol. <br>  Good luck , and may you keep safe, God Bless.|`|fh2taCkvaa	ohhhhh this is some tough **** . but you did the right thing don't ever walk around alone spanish gangs are bitches. just don't show them fear and if they threaten you just stay calm but whatever you do never  go to the police they will all jump you .. you should just tell your mom the truth and tell her your scared its ok to be scared. :) im sorry bout your problem i hope this helped.|`|M9YBxkhqaa	Just tell her whats going on thats the best thing you can do.|`|L1FUcmb0aa	No, why would you not be justified in having your friends there for you? I would no doubt get a group of people with me or something if I were in your position. I guess if the other side was friendlier, then get back, for your own safety. Try getting to an even safer community, though, if that's possible. I don't know how to help you, though. I am sorry. I have never been in such a position, and I don't expect to be.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You're right.  This has nothing to do with Men's Health.  But - you really need to do some tall talking to convince your Mom you all need to get out of that neighborhood.  I can't tell you if that was smart or dumb to have your friends with you.  There is safety in numbers - for the most part.  But, then, again, the gang might want to get even if they ever catch you alone.  All I can say is 'watch your back, Bubba!'|`|VIM4XmYNaa	Explain the situation in-depth to your mom.  Hopefully she will understand how important this situation is.  In the meantime, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to go around in groups that large, simply because it does look like your itching for a fight.  If confrontations do come to blows, then tell those bastards to leave you alone, and that you don't want any trouble.  Best of luck to you.

It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|NV6VzkOpaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite difficult, some peeple would state impossible, however the one thing that definitely delivered for me was green tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

c55O7jqXaa	I suggest you be able to maintain around your ideal weight for atleast 6 months to 12 months before getting the surgery done.

AKv1gj0Xaa	I pay most attention to the calorie, fat, salt and sugar contents, in that order.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, as most seem to, cutting calories is the only way to go. Simply eat fewer calories than the minimum you need to maintain your weight and the pounds WILL come off. Foods lower in sugar are almost always lower in calories and fats.<br>  <br>  In my family my wife needs to avoid high salt-content foods because of high blood pressure, and I avoid excessively sugary foods to guard against diabetes and dental problems.<br>  <br>  Nothing is 100 percent, but the nutrition labels can give you a good idea of what you're putting into your body.|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	oh ya.. mostly i see the labels to know what are the ingredients and the expiry date..<br>  <br>  diet wise i see the labels for fat content, calories, preservatives used and coloring agents..<br>  <br>  its a good habit which i advise everyone to follow.. <br>  <br>  its great that u r teaching ur child early!!|`|aMBQLNGqaa	yes I do read labels, if there's partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated written on it then I don't get it<br>  <br>  If there's high fructose corn syrup then I don't eat it!|`|DaJX9rshaa	I have used several of their programs, most have rocked, some didnt -- so overall, I say that they are safe to do business with and have good programs.<a href="http://aznutritionnews.com" rel="nofollow">http://aznutritionnews.com</a>

zxaqL885aa	On a scale of 1-10, id say its about a 3 but only for like 2 seconds literally. I didn't even get a tear but my eye watered a little. I have mine done on the left side. My mom, both my sisters, and I have all our noses done on the left side.<br>  I have also gotten my tragus pierced (a part of the ear) and my nose was nothing compared to that. the tragus piercing hurts more but i love it!!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	when i had my nose pierced i didn't hurt my eyes just watered.i got my nose pierced on my left side|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	It feels like popping a pimple on the side of your nose. My eyes watered for a second and it stung but it didn't hurt. It'll be a little sore that night and the next day you just have to be careful with them also I slept with one of those little band-aids on my nose the first 3 nights or so just so I wouldn't rip it out. That's usually a good thing to do if you toss and turn a lot. Idk about the whole symbol thing I asked my piercer and he said no. I got mine on the left.|`|ICHzrALJaa	I have both ears streched to and inch, my labret, nose, and belly button (twice)  <br>  <br>  Out of all of them my nose hurt the worst. The piercing itself really doesn't hurt, its over  fast, but it is tender for a few days (ie rubbing or blowing your nose) <br>  <br>  My nose ring is on the left side, but my mothers is on the right, i really dont think it matters at all.<br>  <br>   Good luck:)|`|qMsdXDxJaa	It is more painful than ear and belly button. They shove a long pointed tool into your nose, and it hurts bad and I usually can tolerate pain good but this made my eyes water pretty bad. It doesnt have any after pain like any other piercings would, like sorness or infections, nose piercings heal quick and no sorness. Look at the video below of a nose piercing I found on youtube, it shows exactly what you will experience, its worth it though, nose rings are so cute!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPSjhtxYoc4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPSjhtxYo...</a>|`|aXm6wS8paa	no if you only perice or have a piercing on one ear i forgot if its the left or right that means gay<br>  <br>  ummm its hurts a first for a bit<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|LsfqaMGaaa	Okay, so I've had both of my nostrils pierced. I can tell you that it hurts more than a navel piercing and more than an earring too. It only hurts for a second though. When the needle goes through, you get instant tears so it's a bit uncomfortable. But like I said, it only lasts for a second and the pain is well worth it. If you're scared, just close your eyes. Trust me, go through with it.

PfE6bg5iaa	TSS associated with tampon use is very uncommon now. It was such a risk back when tampon companies first put those warnings on the box because back then tampons were rated at a higher absorbancy than they are now. Now there's like maybe one case reported per year in the US.<br>  <br>  Also, a couple hours over the 8 hour rule isn't going to give you TSS. More like leaving it in for 12+ hours. <br>  <br>  You're just fine :-) Just never use tampons when you aren't on your period and stick with the 8 hour guideline.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  The previous answer is incorrect. Do you really think all these tampon companies would put 8 hours in the directions if it were unsafe for 4 hours? They would all be out of business. <br>  <br>  There's something called a "safety factor" in all design and engineering applications. Basically, it's a way of expecting people to be stupid and use things improperly. Say for example that they know a bridge must support X tons for the evening commute, so they multiply X by the safety factor (which is always over 1) and say that that number is the minimum number of tons the bridge must be designed to hold. <br>  <br>  Tampon companies do the same thing, they say "Oh well some idiot isn't going to listen to the instructions and they're going to keep it in for longer than we recommend. So we'll design them to be OK for 12 hours, but we'll tell them they're only OK for 8"|`|6NA2MXNPaa	You really don't want to leave a tampon in more than 4 hours. The longer you leave it in the more bacteria accumulates on it and the higher the risk for TSS. You're obviously fine now though. TSS, when it occurs, happens right away. You'll get a fever and flu-like symptoms along with other things. I wouldn't worry about what happened last year, just be sure to change your tampons more frequently in the future. Take care!|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	If you had toxic shock syndrome you would have shown the symptoms by now (high fever, vomiting, rash, etc.). <br>  <br>  In the future, use a tampon with the lowest absorbency that will work for you, use sanitary pads when you can (on low-flow days they work well at night), wash your hands before and after inserting a tampon, never insert more than one at a time, and change them regularly (read the package for directions).|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	You should be ok now...some time has passed.  Just don't do it ever again...the box of tampons comes with information on TSS...READ IT! and follow all instructions.|`|4yp9bHSsaa	im pretty sure you could get ts (toxic shock) i wouldn't do that not that safe
HsX4H0FLaa	It could be be related to the antihistamine-type action of the drug - now that the dose is coming down that is lessening, and people do experience various forms of dermatological reactions during withdrawal, usually itching, but others are reported. It's interesting that it seems to be a self-limiting response after a dose drop... given Effexor's extremely short half-life, that does seem a pretty conclusive reaction.<br>  <br>  Also check-out the less well-known anticholinergic properties of the drug... e.g. mouth dryness. Or the connection between Effexor and glossitis. Or the connection between Effexor and mucous membranes. Yes, these are side-effects, but it stands to reason that they could also be triggered by the reduction of the drug since it appears common for side-effects to also be withdrawal effects.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Yes stress is the root cause of eczema in many cases.<br>  <br>  I have been helping a friend get rid of his psoriasis’ on his skin, it covers about 2 square feet of his arms and hands. <br>  <br>  He has been spraying on 2.5 PH water for about a month now, and it is working.

StiIpLFoaa	did the doctor say what is was from?  I went to 2 ear, nose, and throat doctors in the past 5 years who stated there was nothing that could be done about it so I just lived with it. A few months ago I was referred to another ENT who did several tests and stated it was due to my eustachian tubes being swollen and had me take Lipoflavaniods 2x's per day and Veramyst 2 sprays each night. He also stated he was going to further test for pollops in my nose which could be removed if needed. I am awaiting the test results.  So do not give up - check with another ENT (unless it is nerve damage then I'm not sure). He said the swelling was from allergies and sinuses and sure enough I notice it is louder and certain times than others. As for getting used to the sound, yes I have, but I also use background noise at night or when needed such as music, a fan, or my baby monitor for my son. I thought I was going to go crazy at first, but now I only notice it if I think about it or if it is so loud I cannot block it out.|`|AA10232076	Well mine starts up and then goes away, but I can usually ignore the ringing in my ears by some miracle.

ICHzrALJaa	The Bartholin Gland is located inside the inner labia and is stimulated through a genital caress. <br>  Take the first and middle finger of one hand and lightly press on the vaginal lips about halfway between the top and bottom of the vagina. <br>  You dont have to rub to stimulate the glands, just lightly pressing is enough. <br>  You wont see the lubrication because it is secreted inside the opening of the vagina.
dI9BLGYpaa	Alcohol is far more harmful than most people think, and it’s very important that you understand how this drug (yes, alcohol is a drug) is affecting your progress. This is not an anti-drug speech, but if you’re serious about achieving a truly impressive physique, you should definitely be aware of the 5 main ways that alcohol is slowing down your gains…<br>  <br>  <br>  1) It negatively affects protein synthesis.<br>  <br>  Protein synthesis is the process where amino acids are joined together to form complete proteins. Excessive alcohol consumption slows this process down by up to 20%, and since your muscles are made up of protein, you can see how this is a problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It lowers testosterone levels and increases estrogen.<br>  <br>  Testosterone is the most important muscle-building hormone in your body. One of the limiting factors that determines how much muscle a person can gain is their level of free-flowing testosterone.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) It causes dehydration.<br>  <br>  The kidneys must filter very large amounts of water in order to break down the alcohol, and this can result in severe dehydration within the body. Water plays an absolutely crucial role in the muscle-building process, and being even slightly dehydrated is a recipe for disaster. The muscles alone are comprised of 70% water.<br>  <br>  <br>  4) It depletes the body of vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  Alcohol consumption causes vitamins A, C, the B's, calcium, zinc and phosphorus to all be drained at rapid rates. Vitamins and minerals keep every little process in your body functioning properly, and many of these processes involve muscle growth and maintenance.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) It increases fat storage.<br>  <br>  With 7 empty calories per gram, alcohol can actually be quite fattening. Alcohol also disrupts the Kreb’s Cycle, which plays an important role in fat burning.|`|8SRjELNBaa	lol... i was thinkin about getting totally baked and doing the same.|`|CR4AJXNYaa	lifting weights when you are drunk is of course bad. but it still gives a little exercise at the least. so what you should do is to try to keep yourself from exercising when you're drunk.|`|AEfIgkHEaa	i was going to just say it's much easier to hurt yourself, as you're under the influence you'd prob not even totally be conscious of what you're doing.|`|akvrwpywaa	Yes, not only that but with your poor technique and poor muscle coordination, you may unintentionally tear or hyperextend something, or worse yet drop the weights on yourself.|`|DtBx851Maa	Lol probably doesn't hurt as much.  I'd say it's better than no exercise at all, but be careful not to fall down or drop something on yourself :)
Njgof6hNaa	Everyone hits their arousal peak at different points in their life. Meaning, you might not be there yet. Arousal isn't something you can switch on like a light switch. Another factor is that the people you're having sex with aren't people you have strong connections with. A strong connection with a sex partner isn't required, but you might be one of those people that needs a deeper connection. I wouldn't worry about it, but if it persists, then you could always see a gynecologist. Sometimes having no arousal at all to stimulation can be medical. Just give it time meanwhile. Ah, and another factor could be the level or expertise of the people you're sleeping with. You might be having sex with people who aren't very good at it. There are many possible factors.|`|EUJZdcO9aa	its normal<br>  but who knows maybe it is the guys your meeting. when you meet the right hot guy youll go. lol <br>  <br>  but in the mean time try oils, lotion, do differnt positions, sex candy, teasing...etc do whatever makes you horny [immature people do not laugh it is the truth]|`|PImvmP1paa	Most women do not experience female ejaculation.<br>  <br>  I don't know the percentage, but only a small portion will experience female ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Also, 90% of women do not orgasm during sexual intercourse either. Why? Because there has to be clitorial stimulation, which is achieved mostly by the use of hands.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Try the bath tub....if you can get the angle right<br>  <br>  No, there's lots of women in this world who have trouble with that particular problem.

FMajZYS2aa	If you can feel a hole, then it is a cavity. If you can't, it can be stain from coffee, tea or food. <br>  <br>  However it cost much less to have a cavity filled than to wait for the cavity to grow bigger and you need a root canal.

I would get it checked out.  If your dentist puts the little metal pick in it and it sticks, that's the start of decay.  If it's really tiny, you could always just make sure you keep it extra clean so it doesn't get any worse.    <br>  <br>  Trust me-a $200 filling is a lot better than a $1000 root canal years down the road.|`|AUD1wZ5Kaa	A tiny black speck on your tooth is probably plaque.

HhEiV9RDaa	Yeah definetaly!|`|tq1eQwRZaa	Sure, you can go veggie, but it takes a lot of commitment. Start out slowly, by removing any meat from your diet that you can live without. I am not technically a vegetarian, because i eat chicken and seafood, but I cut out all red meat and pork because i wanted to eat healthier. But I do love fruits, veggies, beans and even those veggie patties, like GardenBurger or Morningstar. Try replacing meat with tofu or these veggie patties to get enough protein. And it wont be difficult at all to get enough fruits and vegetables :P lol. Just make sure that you're eating a balanced diet, with grains and protein and even dairy in there (unless you become vegan...then i think you can only drink soymilk). Hope this helps!|`|4mVPpVsWaa	I would think Not! unless you want to be really hardcore about it.....Your already eating meat (I assume) but even if you would become a vegetarian alot of other things that are veggie friendly come from animals anyways.

It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows?

uC75y83Taa	It's possible low blood pressure, low blood sugar, or anemia, among other possibilities.  It's impossible for us to examine you, which is what's necessary, and you need to have your blood checked.

I experienced this when I was pregnant and didnt know it. Otherwise, I would say that the dizziness standing up sounds like you're dehydrated, but you're a bit too young, so maybe not.

Dbr0MO3Vaa	It should work, just make sure u change your tampon before you go to bed and not wear it for more than 8 hours (preferably not more than 6), The best protection for sleeping would be a pad, and honestly I doubt he would be able to tell (my BF never could :))|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Wow, that's a tough one. I usually bypass the tampons at night and wear thick overnight maxi pads. You really don't want to leave a tampon in for more than 4 hours because of the risk of TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome). But I understand what you mean about not wanting to wear a big ol' pad when you're sleeping in someone else's bed, especially a guy! I'd say stick with what you're doing, if it works for you now, or it has worked in the past, then it should work again. If you're kind of iffy about it then go to a super tampon and keep the liner too. Just make sure you wear some pajamas that have bottoms and not a nightgown and you'll be fine. Hope that helps! Good luck!|`|GQfQ1jlpaa	wear a liner with the tampon just incase and check it reguarly|`|6hx1pW9Oaa	sounds like you've already thought this one too, its what I would do too so I think your in the clear.
i05dLLeRaa	If you want to bulk up do heavy weight with less reps adding weight each set. <br>  1 set 135 x 8<br>  2 set 155 x 6<br>  3 set 185 x 4<br>  4 set 225 x 2<br>  <br>  To burn the most fat while building some muscle, do more reps with less weight. Pick a weight that you can do 12 - 15 reps with and do three sets. Warm up with 12 reps with 50 percent of your normal working weight.<br>  <br>  Side Note: Always go to failure. If you get to rep 15 and you can still go, don't stop just because you hit 15, keep going till you cant go anymore and then just increase the weight for next time.|`|fQ4hVKazaa	well...i dont got by numbers and sets and such i go till i can't go anymore for each set if you can do like 20 it's too light.. but work lotsa different muscles and do cardio youl lose weight, you need lower back muscles dont forget..i was out for like 5 months because of my back.kettle bells work muscles differently they work the main muscle and the stabilizers there supposed to "do twice the workout in half the time" they even have em at target but they only go up to 20 lbs there for heavier ones go to di(c)ks or sports authority (sorry it beeped the other stores name|`|lbIG9eVCaa	Look at the web site body for life ,Book is called body for life bill phillips.<br>  its what im working on at the moment.I see the results

Do you ever get the feeling of a lump in your throat that you feel like you have to throw up? Let me guess, he assigned you Xanax for it?

oH5Vv9Fxaa	My mom is on a diet right now that was recommended by her doctor. After losing so much weight, you're body has a fluctuation period, and it's usually where people hit the point where they give up their diet. Just keeping working at it! It'll fluctuate for a bit but you'll get straight back to losing weight after a bit. <br>  <br>  I suggest walking for half an hour to an hour a day, if you have the time. Any kind of exercise half an hour to an hour a day is good.|`|AA11611389	Hey!  This is normal - you lost 6-7 pounds in a little over a week, that is a lot, a big adjustment for your body.  Just keep at it, you will start to lose again.  It's probably better to lose 3 or less pounds per week to avoid a slowing metabolism, which may be what is happening to you.  Eat more times per day than the typical three meals - have 5 small meals, a small salad at each one along with a protein serving and maybe some brown rice or oatmeal.  Skip the carbs for the last meal however, and go to bed slightly hungry.  I highly highly recommend you add an hour of walking each day to burn more calories and stimulate your metabolism.  Walk fast like you are late for class, and find hills to go up and down.  Do this for 1 hour, preferably on an empty stomach like before breakfast.  The fat will melt off, trust me.  Good luck!|`|bKlGcORPaa	Most diets these days will actually cause you to gain more weight in specific areas in the long run.<br>  <br>  I suggest you use a natural system to help you lose the weight you want. Check out: <br>  <br>  weightlossmiraclesystem.com<br>  <br>  I recommend it because it's an all-natural and permanent solution and was rated #1.|`|oELUYx4laa	keep at it, but try pushing yourself a little harder each day.  Also, avoid the salty foods and drink plenty of water 20 mins BEFORE you excises.  also keep water when you exercising|`|7o2VCyfNaa	it takes a while to lose weight. So I suggest dancing a lot, it helps lose wait.. an hour or a half a day and drink a lot of water, only water.. (= hope it helps|`|pkNYlFubaa	people lose weight differently|`|KCqOTbBEaa	DEFINITELY work out!  You have just lost some "water weight."

EcCbforQaa	What weakness? It's in your mind. Masturbation is the best thing to ever happen to you.|`|0nLdwZP2aa	There is nothing wrong with masturbating.  It makes you feel tired because it's exercise - just like running or lifting weights might.<br>  <br>  As long as it's not interfering with other parts of your life, there's no reason you need to feel bad about it.  It's healthy and normal.|`|AA10952792	there's no food that will stop it. corn flakes were actually invented for this very reason, but obviously with no success. just masturbate and get it out of your system. it's nothing to be ashamed of as long as it's not ruining your life in all aspects of it.|`|mWEQzvOzaa	Everyone  feels tired after masturbation....Just get up after masturbation....And dont just sit there =)|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Uhh...

Eating Ice cream is good when you get your tonsils out. remember though not to smoke or drink through a straw for at least a week in a half. You don't want to get dry socket. That is horrible!

Try to be calmer and more open about things|`|t2R3mEMoaa	There will always be a certain amount of stress in our lives. It's the needless stress that we have control of. You must set your life and lifestyle up in a manner that is acceptable to you, by staying away from the negative that we tend to have surrounding us. I have few friends and they are supportive to me as I am to them. I don't have needless debt which can cause a great deal of stress and I stay away from situations that I know will add stress to me, mostly family in my case. Eat and exercise well. Play relaxing music and get your rest. I don't know your situation so you will have to clean house and dump the garbage that may be in and around your life. Good luck and good mental health
dUyqUPiuaa	If you're not a heavy sport person then start on some aerobic exercises such as jogging or swimming, they work pretty well - I've experienced it myself :) As you progress you should try to push yourself that little bit more so that you can also lose that little bit more.

31c1bf10299cf785d0fd794d6f91492aaa	Yes that is too low especially for an athlete. You are only 14 years old and do not need to worry about such things because you have to have at least 10% body fat just to survive. Also fat is not as bad as you think, it keeps your boys warm and protects your organs. Since you are an athlete I think you have nothing to worry about.|`|xqQO81Omaa	Yes, it's too low for ANY female.|`|3ylgyqGbaa	omg- 19%, yer probably really thin.<br>  your perfect now.<br>  anything under 12% for a girl is unhealthy.
D100ixUgaa	Beach volleyball players are exceptionally fit, healthy athletes. Saying you should starve yourself to look like them is ridiculous. Those women probably eat 3-4,000 calories a day during peak training. To get in great shape like that, the easiest thing to do would be to seriously dedicate yourself to a sport you like. Your coach will push you to develop your body, you'll get lots of exercise, and your muscles will get toned while your body fat burns away, which will make you look a lot more like a beach volleyball player. If you hate team sports, consider martial arts, hiking, and stuff like that. And if you hate all sports, then spend some serious time at the gym doing both cardio and weight training, and aim to get in good enough shape that you can handle a program like CrossFit or P90X.|`|Cj5IxMFfaa	loose weight.

Rk46lIBwaa	No diets on their own work to produce sustained weight loss, especially not faddy ones like this. You need to combine a sensible balanced diet with regular, vigorous exercise.|`|DPQVGWDDaa	you cannot lose weight by just having maple syrup.....maple syrup brand payed beyonce to say she lost weight...look at the ingredients of maple syrup, it is mainly sugar..are you mad|`|x9S6KBejaa	If it's not Aunt Jemima...then it aint real syrup! Haha. Really though babe...don't you think that things such as the syrup diet or cabbage soup diet or things of that nature are going to work? Maybe...but those type of things work if that's 'all' you consider in trying to loose weight. Working out and making a commitment to eating healthier is still and will always be much more effective than all those infomercials that we see many of these celebrities try to endorse. Plus, it works for every one! Don't believe in all the other hype. =)|`|9pLI73pqaa	Doesn't sound healthy to me! Learn to eat healthily and you will lose weight and feel better.

iTTS06IKaa	No, a urine test is not required. All they do is have you jump around and do various physical exercises to make sure you are fit and healthy enough to do sports, and they also give you advice on what you can improve. <br>  <br>  A nurse or doctor also asks you about your period to make sure everything is "normal."|`|feQT7tWwaa	well im not from washington...<br>  <br>  but around here & most high schools, before you even get to try out for the team you have to have a physical from the doctor. the school has nothing to do with that. <br>  <br>  hope that helps (:|`|C8Dk5hGiaa	I say it depends if they do or not.
fDUCEX3Haa	2. Bio Oil didn't work for me. I used it for like a month. Good thing about it though is it doesn't break you out. <br>  4. Skin lightening usually equals bleaching and that's never good, unless you protect your skin with sunscreen. You have to use it consistently or else it'll come back.<br>  3. I never tried mederma but I tried scarzone, which is way cheaper. It didn't work.<br>  <br>  out of those two I would choose bio oil. A lot of other people have seen good results. It worked really well on some big bites I had near my knee.
1mkJ4rntaa	Ha... funny!<br>  Anyways, I know what you mean.<br>  Try to find foods that are wholesome, organic, baked... yada yada.<br>   -If you like Lay's BBQ chips, you'll love the baked kind because it has a softer crunch and bigger chips.<br>   -Sugar free cookies and candies are the way to go, especially if it's sweetened by Splenda. My father (has diabetes) eats sugar-free Oreo's and they taste the same. Trust me!<br>   -Food tip- This sandwich tastes really good, and it's really sweet.<br>    Spread peanut butter on white bread, sprinkle sugar on top and squeeze a lemon on top.

Good luck!
2TAFN9lzaa	I would say probably not. The symptoms are regular discharge and occasional itching? Is the discharge more than normal? It could be some other type of vaginal infection, though. I would say have it checked out by your doctor. Or, they have these new tests that are supposed to tell you if you have one or not. Hope you feel better soon.|`|f4sKk8Ytaa	please consult your doctor has soon as possible.<br>  it may be something of no worry, still it is better to ask that to a professional.|`|EZMkioAgaa	yea//monistat will cure it.|`|AA10292836	i think you should see a doctor! that's the best advice i can give you!
AA11738671	Is it your earlobe or your upper ear? There is a huge difference. If it is high on the ear (what some call a cartilage piercing, even though all of your ear is cartilage), it will hurt a LOT for a long time (about a year). Cartilage does not get much blood flow, so healing takes a lot longer. The "upper lobe," as I interpret it, it like a 2nd ear piercing on the bottom. It should hurt a lot for a few weeks. And don't touch it! The normal flora on your hands (everyone has bacteria on them, it's normal) can cause damage if it gets into the blood stream. And washing your hands, even with antimicrobial soap, does not get rid of your normal bacteria. If anything, the massaging action of handwashing squeezes the bacteria out of your pores, and the soap eliminates the skin oil that keeps the microorganisms on your skin.|`|t37U01cjaa	You have to have clean hands whenever you touch your ears.<br>  It really shouldn't hurt that much when it's healing. It might be infected.<br>  When you got your ear pierced, they probably gave you some alcohol<br>  to put on your ear to clean it, make sure you use that. Good luck. :-)|`|jjV0aikbaa	It sounds infected. I would take the earring out and clean it really well. It shouldn't hurt after a few hours of getting it pierced. Or maybe your allergic to the kind of metal.|`|ziw77iuPaa	Stop touching it first. Then if it feels really warm it may be infected. Just clean it as usual and hope it gets better if not go back to the piercing place..|`|8Q5WlMV1aa	it should really barely hurt at all. <br>  i have my ear pierced twice on both sides.<br>  and they only hurt when i touched it, its probably from touching it all the time...|`|wLzcj73gaa	<a href="http://getinanswer.snowpeaks.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswer.snowpeaks.co.uk</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|f4sKk8Ytaa	normally a week or so.<br>  I think you can try to put some ice. well, I not too sure about it. ask just in case.|`|AA10426129	well it should hurt about 2 weeks then it should stop|`|AA12209909	It's normal.

Nt7exGYAaa	If you have bad anemia the best thing to do is see your doctor.<br>  <br>  You'll need to have a complete blood count done so he can see exactly what your levels are. This is just a simple matter of taking a blood sample which they do tests on.<br>  <br>  Depending on the results you may be given Vitamin B shots on a regular basis until your system builds up or whatever the doctor suggests.<br>  <br>  You could try taking iron tablets but this really isn't a good thing until you know what's causing the anemia and just how bad it is.<br>  <br>  Also just because you have fair skin, doesn't necessarily mean you're anemic.

Its basically inflamation and ulceration of the stomach caused by excess acid in the stomach. Its like a catch 22 because you feel sick because you aren't eating enough but you don't want to eat at all because you feel sick. The way to stop this is to go see your doctor and get a perscription. Also you need to eat MORE. Because there is so much acid in your stomach you need to eat more to "keep it busy." it will take a few meals before this works but it will. Also eat larger meals, smaller meals will just get the acid moving not dilute it. I know this sounds backwards but its true.|`|AA10199093	Any chance you have a mirror in your dining room?

ZCCFzvMBaa	Not sure what your diet is like, but I started a weight-lifting program and had similar trouble.  I sought help through a trainer and he put me on a high protein diet.  Eating fish, grilled or baked chicken, egg whites, and lots of vegetables helped me.  I also started drinking 100% whey protein shakes (GNC) after each workout to help the recovery of the muscles.  I'm no pro but this worked for me.  I saw results within 2 weeks.  But it's good that you are changing up your workouts.  You also need to give yourself at least 3 days of no lifting for a better recovery.  Hope this helps a little. Good luck!|`|9PPGOqpuaa	Get your hands on a good Protein powder. Protein helps repair your muscle and that in turn grows over  a period of time. Best of luck|`|ergk5yLiaa	You could use those protein drinks that build up muscles|`|dwhClJ1Haa	Okay... how can I help you?|`|AA11738671	Do you eat a lot of protein? Mucles are made out of protein, so if you don't get enough lean protein in your diet, the muscles can't grow because there is nothing to make them. It's like if you're building something and you don't have enough Legos to build it--you can't just use bread instead! Chicken, fish, and other lean meats (even red meat will work but it is high in saturated fat and bad for your cardiovascular system) are full of complete proteins. Milk, cheese, peanuts, and other proteins that do not come from animal meat are not complete proteins, but they are better than nothing. If you do get enough protein, you may have a hormone imbalance so see a doctor.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	this is just a basic process of your muscles. they need to rip and tear so that when they heal they are stronger. if you overstress your muscles, they will not let you heal. they will stay ripped. causing no loss or gain of muscles. so no, your muscles don't. they are normal:) they are perfectly normal. do more reps instead of higher weights. that will help definition. that way you'll see a difference.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	peanut butter my friend... peanut butter... it turns into protein that your body uses to make muscle. start taking in more calories.. i eat about 12000 a day. also eat less beef and more chicken and fish. but make sure you also get a full food pyramid in each day.|`|1AZAmuvgaa	...?|`|HqNiRRHlaa	i think he wants to know how to get big quick<br>  <br>  <br>  Let me just tell you this you won't realize it when it happens - Your'll just wake up one day & it'll be like that Tom Hnks Movie "BIG"

PRGYuRe7aa	you may be a baby oven my dear :D<br>  <br>  WHY:<br>  -Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  -Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  -Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Besides everyones assumption on prego status for you baby girl, it may be a sign of stress or other related problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  The body doesn’t distinguish between physical and psychological threats. When you’re stressed over a busy schedule, an argument with a friend, a traffic jam, or a mountain of bills, your body reacts just as strongly as if you were facing a life-or-death situation. If you have a lot of responsibilities and worries, your emergency stress response may be “on” most of the time. The more your body’s stress system is activated, the easier it is to trip and the harder it is to shut off. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Many health problems are caused or exacerbated by stress, including:<br>  <br>  Pain of any kind <br>  Heart disease <br>  Digestive problems <br>  Sleep problems <br>   Depression <br>  Obesity <br>  Autoimmune diseases <br>  Skin conditions, such as eczema <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  see your doc to know for sure what's up...<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck hun <3|`|xrEIAD2aaa	Are you having a hard time breathing or are you just tired?

NOT enriched wheat. <br>  <br>  Eat several small meals a day rather than just 2 or 3. That will help your metabolism increase. <br>  <br>  If you want to run or walk, that will help as well. You do not want to get your heart rate up too much or you will not burn that much fat. For best results, exercise first thing in the morning before you eat. Your body will have no choice but to burn fat for energy. <br>  <br>  Your heart rate is very important in burning fat. You want is elevated but not too much that you leave the fat burning range. A good rule of thumb is that if you can carry on a conversation while you are exercising, you should be in the fat burning range.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|DIRbVD5uaa	If you want to kick start your weight loss I suggest Master Cleanse.
WEZq2xyCaa	I have to assume that you are about 30 pounds overweight. If you are not overweight or grossly overweight different advice would apply.<br>  <br>  I will have to assume that you are physically sound - without any physical limitations, handicaps or medical conditions. Also, that you are between the ages of 16 and 60.<br>  <br>  It is probable that you do not currently exercise regularly and that you are not very particular with what you eat. Both of these things will need to change for you to reach your goal.<br>  <br>  Begin walking 45 minutes every day. The best way to accomplish this is to walk 22 minutes in one direction from your home and return home along the same path. Do this when you feel energetic and when you don't feel energetic. It is easy to do when you feel motivated - not as easy when you are not. So, your challenge is to do what you know you should even when you you aren't in the mood.<br>  <br>  You would like to lose weight right now, immediately (yesterday perhaps?). Losing weight over a 5 month period is certainly more challenging but totally worth it. Remember though...you are used to doing things according to your mood - not according to what is best for you. Expect it to be difficult to adjust to this more rational way of behavior.<br>  <br>  After 4 weeks of walking 6 days a week for 45 minutes move to 90 minutes of walking or 30 minutes of easy jogging. Your choice.<br>  <br>  Next, begin buying and cooking food that you purchase mainly along the side and rear walls of your supermarket. Do not buy food, or very little food from the middle aisles. The middle aisles are full of non-essential, overly processed, nutritionally deficient food. These products are produced and marketed for profit without the slightest concern for who may be eating it. You are addicted to these products and it will be difficult for you to cease eating them altogether. Sadly, your taste buds acknowledge, fat, sugar and salt as being tasty and nearly everything else as being not tasty. How could you be slim with those tastes?<br>  <br>  Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, low fat dairy, low fat chicken breast, fish..... these are naturally inexpensive, naturally healthy foods that will help you slim down and be healthy.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of good books out there that will teach you about eating right and exercise. Why not enrich your life and pick up a few?<br>  <br>  You, your life is worth it. Pounds mean little..health means everything.<br>  <br>  Go get it.|`|Xcyaju2vaa	Do without soda and sugar.

557nSJb1aa	Masturbation is fine. It is a perfectly normal and acceptable thing to do. Some religious people will try to tell you that the bible says not to, but when they say that, they are lying. <br>  <br>  Depending on how you masturbate (playing with your clit or if you put things in your hole) and what you use (finger, dildo, vibrator, etc) it can hurt you and cause a health problem. A good way to avoid this is to make sure your hands and whatever you use are clean before masturbating, go slowly (atleast the first few times), and stop if it starts to hurt. If you use something like a vibrator or dildo make sure it is clean and that you don't force it in. It might not fit all the way in length-wise and/or might be too big around to go in. <br>  <br>  You should be able to orgasm, it probably will take a little while to happen. It might be good for you to experiment a little to find out what you like and what effects things have on you.<br>  <br>  The only way to lose your virginity is by having sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is what it is called when a man puts his dick in a woman's vagina. (Man can be replaced with boy and woman can be replaced with girl.)<br>  <br>  The bible does not say that you shouldn't masturbate. If the people that say it does would actually read the bible, they'd know that.<br>  <br>  You can't really masturbate too much, but there can be some problems caused if you do it alot. The problems can include bleeding, making the skin extra sensitive, it starting to hurt, chafing, it not feeling good, getting addicted to it, and it being harder for you to "get off".<br>  <br>  The best way for a girl to do it without buying things can vary. Some like fingering themselves (sticking their fingers in their hole), others prefer playing with their butt-hole and others like playing with their clit. A few even like a combination of the three.

After a couple months you will settle down into a nice routine of about 2 per day, some people have 1, some people 3.  Everyone is different, there is no standard.  If you are having constant, runny BM's that are painful, that is DUMPING SYNDROME caused by eating incorrectly.

Baking soda has a natural cleansing ability and can even be found in some commercial toothpastes. It's non-toxic and will help polish your teeth. Some recipes call for table salt, in which case you should mix three parts of baking soda with one part of table salt.<br>  Add three teaspoons (15g) of glycerine for every 1/4 cup (55g) of dry mixture. This is optional; it acts as a sweetener. An alternative is stevia.<br>  Add 1/4 cup (60g) of household hydrogen peroxide and one drop of peppermint oil. Hydrogen peroxide naturally disinfects your mouth and will also help whiten your teeth. If you don't have it around, use water. The drop of peppermint oil will leave your mouth feeling fresh. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down very quickly in the presence of UV light, so it is necessary to store the toothpaste away from sunlight. If you're not into the peppermint flavor, some alternatives are ground cinnamon, vanilla extract, fennel, ginger, and almond extract. Whatever it is, make sure it doesn't have sugar added or that it isn't strongly acidic, since acids will produce a fizzing reaction with the baking soda.<br>  Mix the hydrogen peroxide and baking soda until it is a paste . If you need to, mix in more hydrogen peroxide until you get the right consistency.<br>  Store the toothpaste in a small plastic container where it won't dry out. You can also purchase a small, empty lotion bottle so that you can squeeze out the toothpaste onto the toothbrush more easily, rather than dip it.|`|MZ3Ylb8vaa	yes you could make your own toothpaste google it.

Now if it is a barium enema <br>  It can be a bit painful or uncomfortable, but it is over fairly quickly. Liquid barium and then air are inserted into your rectum and bowel. Sometimes this will cause cramping but after the films are taken they release the clamp so everything can flow out of your bowels. You are then taken to the restroom for as long as you need to be there. Drink a lot of water after, barium can cause constipation!|`|2cC2vyxBaa	True it does depend of what type of enema you are having. Is going to be a cleansing enema, or enema for a Cat Scan, or is a Barium Enema in x-ray? Anterior superior is big important thing in inserting an enema tip an that means to the front and up toward your head anatomically. The Enema for a Cat Scan is pretty much just some water with a dye called usually gastrografin and the tube is about the size of a pen or a little bigger and once once they put the stuff up your rectum they take the tube out. The Enema Tip for a Barium Enema is larger about the size of a marker and that has to stay for the whole procedure until all the films are done and checked. Once everything is good they usually try to lower the bag of Barium and keep the enema in because using gravity to get the barium contained back in the bag. Then yes you get to go the restroom afterward and then once you get done sometimes they take a film afterward to show the radiologist to see if most of the barium is gone.|`|yxcJAD54aa	It will be uncomfortable but try to relax and it won't be so bad...<br>  Remember to breathe... : )|`|iZ5N4uydaa	Thats going to be uncomfortable not sure if it is painful but it sounds like it|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	Don't know.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|vJBEnFVzaa	I have done two things and both of them have worked wonders. I did them separately (during different diets). The first one is I would do walk/sprint intervals on the treadmill until I reached a mile and a half I did that everyday. And another thing that is amazing is Turbo Jam. It's amazing. You do their videos and follow their diet plan and lose 10 pounds or 10 inches in your first 10 days or your money back. It worked for me it was amazing. You can find it on ebay or beachbody.com|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Thats a tall order.  I won't say its impossible but it seems unlikely that you'll loose that much so quickly.  Is your dress even going to fit if you do that?  Or is that why you're trying to loose the weight; to fit in the dress?  Why don't you know which month your wedding will take place?  Sorry for all the questions it just seems so close to not have a date nailed down and to be just starting to slim down.  If you want to loose weight, you need to eat right (don't try going on a fat free diet, you'll just cause your body to go into starvation mode and retain weight) just eat smaller portions at mealtimes.  Do plenty of cardio to burn fat.  Best wishes and congrats!|`|BmZFsuZCaa	you shouldnt be losing weight now, as soon as the weddings over you'll gain it all back plus some, but if you really want to get a small sized wedding dress <br>  join the gym and get a personal trainer|`|5408d5b8031b0bec092ddfb160a82e59aa	bootcamp baby  a strict 1600 calorie a day diet rich in vitamiuns and veggies <br>  <br>   one hour of interval training / cardio five times a week.<br>  <br>  SELF DISCIPLINE IS KEY  good luck|`|pkNYlFubaa	limit your portions
4f2GaLhpaa	I think it depends on why you want them reduced. Do you want them smaller to fit in or because they are a burden? If you feel different from everyone else because of them that's not okay. You should be happy with your body, and not worry what everyone else thinks.<br>  <br>  However if they are waaayy too big and they are hurting your back that's a problem. You could try losing weight by doing more exercise such as running. As long as you're burning more calories than you're taking in you'll lose weight, and the weight will be all over so that will make them a little smaller (as well as make you healthier!!). <br>  <br>  & You can have breast reduction surgery if they are an EXTREME problem, but I would use that as a last step only.

QOFSjgJqaa	Ahh, right up my alley. <br>  <br>  The best way to treat a broken to is to tape it to the one next to it. Medical tape (Wal-Mart, Walgreen's, etc is your best bet) works best, since it's durable and flexible. However, once you have it taped, you're going to want to stay off it as much as possible. I know you're probably raising an eyebrow, because it's going to hurt to tape it, but trust me - it works. Just pop some Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Asprin before you go to tackle it..|`|ACGBj2liaa	my mom broke her toe recently. er doc says not much they can do, so they taped it to toe next to broken one, it looks bad hurts like hell, so she is taking vicodin good luck|`|AA10703634	u should go to the doctor to treat it <br>  you could get infection there<br>  if you don't want to then put  a splint <br>  on it

Men do this, mostly in America, or men of Jewish descent, purely for cosmetic or religious reasons.  If you life outside the US, there is no real reason to get it done, especially as an adult.  Women in the US get used to seeing circumcised men, so some stupid ones can be kind of mean to uncircumcised men, but there's no real benefit to doing it.<br>  <br>  2.  This is under debate.  Some people are against it because they claim it reduces sensitivity, but science does not have an answer one way or another.  Don't use porn as a judge of what goes on in real life - these guys have trained themselves to last a long time, but it doesn't have to do with their being circumcised or not.<br>  <br>  3.  Again, no, it's not.  As long as you keep it clean and find a girlfriend who is reasonable (and if you live outside of America, most women don't care) then being uncircumcized is fine.|`|mWEQzvOzaa	Huh????

You just need to request an experienced doctor. The last time I went thru an episode like that, the doctor had a mohawk. I hate to be judgemental, but if the guy that's taking blood from you has a mohawk...beware! It took forever to get blood from me, he kept telling me to take deep breaths and relax. I wanted to slap him. I was weak because they told me to fast from the night before the test and it was already 1:00 p.m. He gave me 3 options, keep trying, come back the next day, or try to take blood from a vein in my hand. My HAND!...no way I was having that! We kept on trying for about 5 more minutes and just before he gave up, the needle hit my vein! Needlesss to say I haven't been back there since!|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Next time drink plenty of water before your appointment. Being well hydrated will make your veins be more pumped up with a greater volume of liquid. I always did this because I used to hate getting my blood drawn and wouldn't be able to handle too many pokes. It would make me so dizzy, I couldn't function for like an hour afterward. Then I give birth to three kids, and had more needles stuck into me than a pincushion. But you know what? After the first pregnancy, when they wanted like a pint every month, I told them at the first blood letting: take as much as you need, because this is the last time you are taking my blood. I meant it too. It's kinda like somebody just likes to play around with blood all the time. How many tests do they need to run anyway?

ICtwYntuaa	It's probable that they're right.  Urination could be a result of your past illness, in which case it should go away in a few days or a week.  Another possibility is that you have a high salt intake (ie. eating lots of salty foods) which can cause an increase in water filtration.

What is your build?|`|k6M48eUMaa	I don't know?<br>  Maybe you should try getting some exercise equipment like a treadmill, stationary bike or elliptical machine. The can tell you how many calories you have burnt every time you work out. <br>  Then you can get a fair idea of how many pounds you will lose since there are 3500 calories in each pound, so you can calculate it that way.

I SUGGEST DRINKING NON FAT MILK I KNOW IT TASTES REALLY BAD BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU calcium and help make you slimer. For proptien technically you dont need to eat meat for that but get your protien some how maybe from nuts or tofu or something it depends on what type of dance as well.  I suggest running also and before bed maybe doing some crunches push ups and calf exercises. hope I have helped :)|`|AEfIgkHEaa	none, unless you lose muscle.. where's your protein?! <br>  <br>  you won't be able to do it.. you just won't.<br>  <br>  eat normal portions, limit your junk to moderation only it's not that hard.|`|BmGQwutqaa	if your rigid about it you might loose up to 50 pounds more or less ,the issue will be maintaining that .|`|YEzzm9hZaa	you will lose   100 pounds|`|97izv0Dbaa	well it all depends on how much fruits and oats... and how much ur dancing... could gain could lose. idk tho

I tried proactiv and all those benzoyl peroxide treatments and they did help but if not used properly the acne just came back right away because the peroxide kills it but once it isnt used right like you miss an application it just creates a huge breeding ground for bacteria to form. The benzoyl peroxide is really bad for your skin it dries it out, creates premature aging, it bleaches your skin, and if you dont wear sunscreen it can help in getting skin cancer. My secret is I bought somthing called "Clear Skin" vitamins. I never thought they would of worked but I was astonished, it's all natural vitamins with zinc, omega 3, chromium and other antioxidants which in a week you'll start seeing your skin clear and within a month u'll be glowing with no blemishes. Use a good exfoliator as well to keep a nice glow and you'll never of been happier especially doing it a natural way.|`|KX3WBMVnaa	what may work for one person my not work for you, but what i've noticed works pretty well is clean and clear advantage acne control kit. i've tried lots of other products like neutrogena and proactiv, but they never worked for me - they may work for you though, however i think you should keep something in mind that i heard about recently, which was that most of the better known acne treatments tend to be created off of funds supplied by the rich/celebrities to make even more money and rarely are the products effective enough. i heard about this specifically with proactiv, it may or may not be true, but all i know is that their products didn't work for me.<br>  also i learned that there's a really simple way to get rid of pimples, although it can take some time and a little dedication, but i learned that everytime you touch your face or wherever you get pimples, that you're mixing oils into your skin which create even more pimples. never pick at them because even though it may make that pimple slightly better, you're creating more in the process. be careful about touching areas where you get pimples because you could be doing it without even realizing it, like say you're sitting in class and you're bored so you put your elbow your desk and your head resting on your hand, doing this creates lots of pimples without you ever thinking about it. and certain types of make-up also damage your skin more, like if you put make-up on to cover up the pimples you're not helping the problem, you're hurting it more, so it would probably be best to either wear no make-up at all, wear very little of it, or to search for make-up that's more sensitive to your skin. so anyway you need to be really conscious about what you're doing, and remember to do things like wash your hair everyday so the oils from your hair don't add even more pimples to your face by accident.<br>  lastly you could also try tea tree oil, that could be used in your hair also. a company called desert essence makes little tea tree oil pads for your face that work pretty good. you should give it a try.<br>  <br>  hope these help and the problem goes away.|`|zxZU1T6Qaa	PROACTIV - for future use<br>  <br>  and to get acne scars removed, you need to get Laser Skin Resurfing.|`|jX2GErqWaa	<a href="http://thisinall.makes.it" rel="nofollow">http://thisinall.makes.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

Was it a guru in San Francisco, because I think I met that guy. Tell him he owes me $100 dollars and my dad's class ring.|`|uC75y83Taa	No, that's not true.  Meditation is very good for relaxation, but it doesn't take the place of your real sleep. :)|`|iTTS06IKaa	It is definitely not true -- nothing can impersonate real sleep. When you sleep, your body can recuperate and your mind can rest. Sleep is necessary for a healthy body, and nothing else can replace it. Meditation can in no way have the same affects as sleep.

pTf4pIw9aa	Smoking cannabis first and then doing salvia would probably not be so great.  Salvia is way too intense of a hallucinogen to be interact with cannabis.  But smoking Saliva first, followed by the cannabis would probably be alright, it might help mellow out the intensity of the salvia trip.  Remember, salvia only last 10 to 15 minutes, often less.|`|LaUouVtfaa	Um, smoking salvia alone is pretty bad itself.

0WuXhCTSaa	Many men and women die from this every day.   My husband has had three tests this year and is having one on monday.  <br>  When a polyp is found, that is not a good thing.  Some can be cancer and there are different types of polys.  My husband has a kind that is high risk, meaning he could develop cancer if he does not get regular check ups.  His mother died from this.  The cancer spread all over and she suffered alot.<br>  When your colon is checked for polys did you know they only check the first six feet.  We found out and then my husband had the whole colon checked.   We have had to go for genetic testing and so far it looks like he will need to be checked alot for the rest of his life.<br>  It's not something you do once in your life and think your ok.  The only way to prevent this type of cancer is to have it checked every two years or so.  Some polyps grow quickly.  But it's good if your being checked.  It does not matter if it runs in your family either.   Good Luck.|`|ea57331baf4a18f47dbbd6f150a03a4faa	I'm surprised ... you're pretty young for that, however, they need to be removed if cancerous, obviously.

I myself went through this phase.  What you need to do is either have a more physically tiring day by exercising (this will tire your "clock" down and tell your body to rest more) or take nyquil.<br>  <br>  id go with having a more active day, worked for me.<br>  <br>  ps. alcohol will not help your symptoms|`|h4WvAEbRaa	Try 5-htp.

I had a totally screwed up and inconsistent sleep cycle. i was trying to switch back to the normal one(12-7am) but i ended up having less than 5 hours of sleep daily. But it's getting better now as i wake up at 6 plus.The point is your body bio-clock will get used to your new sleeping cycle one day. So don't worry. If the problem persist please consult your doctor. <br>  And regarding the toilet urgency, try not to drink too much water 1 or 2 hours before you sleep
DtBx851Maa	When people talk about those measurements, particularly rappers, it's bust, waist, hips.  So you would be 36-29-39.<br>  <br>  Edit: my bad, I was just concentrating on the debate of chest vs. shoulders, and didn't stop to consider that 36 isn't the actual size of your chest.

Unless you're applying for a p0rn star role, size is utterly irrelevant. Most of the feeling for a female is near the front of her vagina, not in the back; it's only 3 - 4" deep, so you are of adequate length. Focus on HER and pleasuring her to the max. before you start intercourse itself, and I just about guarantee she won't give two hoots how big or small you are. In fact, I never heard of a female stopping sex because it was the 'wrong size'.|`|xqtKODvbaa	if a girl loves you for your penis, you need to move on<br>  <br>  you sound like an average guy<br>  <br>  remember, it's not the size of the penis, it's how you use it

Tell your gyno about this pain, sounds like a pulled groin muscle.<br>  <br>  About the blood.  You said your period was just finished, your are forcing a little bit of blood out when you exercise that is still remaining from your period.  This sometimes happens to me too.

Go to Ticketmaster or wherever.  See if there's a band playing that you like.  If so, buy a ticket.  On the date of the show, go to the designated venue at the designated time.  Voila!

They are not what you call "friends", they are called "bullies". They don't have to physically taunt you to be considered bullies, they are still bullies because they are mentally and emotionally attacking you.<br>  What goes around comes around, tenfold, my friend. So you do not worry about them, they WILL get what's coming to them. God never sleeps, He sees what they've done to you and they will pay for it in due time, if they have not genuinely sought forgiveness for it.<br>  So do not worry about them, just forgive them in your own heart and mind because it's the right thing to do. And then move on, avoid them and carry on with your life. You can make something great of yourself, so don't let them hold you back.<br>  Concerts and friends are not going to make life good and wholesome for you. It only appears that way because you may think that everyone else is having fun and you're missing out. But truth be told, those kind of people who did this to you are unhappy within themselves and looking for easy prey. Do not allow yourself to be their prey, you must stand up for yourself and treasure being given the gift of life. Make something of yourself, educate yourself, engage yourself in fun activities (eg. volunteer with kids or join the gym or take a class that you were always interested in taking, etc) where you can meet GOOD, kind-hearted people. But do not dwell in self-pity and sorrow for this will get you nowhere.<br>  Don't be down, my friend, keep your chin up and understand that these people are not what define you. You are better than that and you can emerge out of this much happier and a stronger person than before.<br>  God bless you, take care and don't be sad, everything will be ok, God willing. Just be strong and don't let silly people drag you down just to humour themselves. Best wishes =]
blHF41AFaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  Glad you told us the information "I'm a girl". That's very helpful to answering your question!<br>  <br>  Let me say this really frankly: you're 1.2 points under standard BMI for your height: less if we ditch the politically correct values of the BMI (IT IS NOT RIGHT TO APPLY THE SAME BMI TO BOTH SEXES: IT IS BIOLOGICALLY ABSURD). <br>  <br>  That said, a female is considered healthy for having, at minimum, BARE minimum, seventeen percent body fat: probably this is actually too little. Your body fat is also crucial to the function of your immune system: this is all especially true for females in particular. When you said "i carried all the weight in my stomach and thighs and calves", you described a "female" homo sapiens, with normal weight distribution and what is expected of any member of our species who has the remarkable capability of bearing children: the "gross" comment is more reflective of overexaggerated expectations of a sub-group of Americans than biology, historical awareness, common sense, or deference to health. <br>  <br>  If you were lighter based wholly on your biology, rather than trying to override it, then it could be a more arguable question: as a guy I probably consume multipes the daily recommended intake of calories (package-label "calorie" is actually a "kilocalorie") and I'm still underweight (a combination of naturalness + having had toxic chemotherapies), and it's yet a problem. <br>  <br>  As for you, however, do your immune, endocrine, gastral, and reproductive systems a favor (I mention the last because your weight and body fat content can affect it: and it's one particularly dear to most gals, who tend to express interest in having kids someday): normalize your BMI and don't take the advertised woman as a standard of what's acceptable, and what's gross. And do remember: people can and often do overexercise, and it does toll their health and future.<br>  <br>  As for weight loss: DO NOT USE SUPPLEMENTS. Do also realize that if your body fat content falls below a certain limit it tells your body "I'm starving", not only because (1) you are (note that your very cell membranes ARE MADE OF FAT), but (2) it is your lipocytes (fat cells) that tell your body when you are or not full: they signal your brain.<br>  <br>  Just eat moderately, whole grains, veggies, meats, AND fats: and enjoy. Cut-down on foods that add a ton of sugar unnecessarily (corn syrup, boxed cereals, etc.), (they're added for flavor moreoften than real necessity: labels showing "sugar" isn't what indicates whether or not to get something, as foods naturally have sugars, and trying to eliminate them from the diet, as morons do, is dangerous), and get them in their more complex forms (unprocessed fruits, in grains, etc.), and enjoy your exercise. Also, fat lost too quickly DOES equal a problem to the body: your body will actually rob its own parts for the things it's losing/missing, for essentials that losing weight too quickly robs from your system: and it's things like muscle cells that it steals from (ahem, the heart, future ability to lose weight by burning fat, etc.). Six pounds in a month isn't too big a deal: but at the point you're already technically underweight for a female, and if it's a problem to lose at all, your body is already warning you "enough". As I said before, fat around the thies and stomach are totally and utterly natural for a woman: even more than is liked here in America.|`|zX6N6bwMaa	if you really want to lose your weight.don't worry.exercise daily with some hard workouts and drink fresh juices.for more info visit the below website.|`|cb0b5b67d515b1bb2d77526490647ca8aa	I don't know why you would want to weigh anything less than 104...but I'm going to agree with the first answer. I heard hoodia works well. But also, if you work out that much and cut out all types of liquids except for water, you can lose your exact goal in a month.  <br>  <br>  I don't suggest not eating. You'll gain all the weight back that way. Follow the rule of eating the most earlier during the day and very little later on in the evening. Stop eating at around 6 and make sure you take some time off to rest your body. If you work out too much every day, your body will eventually burn out.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	considering your height and current weight, you're already underweight.<br>  why do you want to be under 100lbs?<br>  you do know that gaining muscle adds pounds, right? muscle weighs more than fat<br>  if i were you i'd seek help for body image distortion
wwP3ONCFaa	Water suppresses the appetite naturally and helps the body metabolize stored fat. Studies have shown that a decrease in water intake will cause fat deposits to increase, while an increase in water intake can actually reduce fat deposits. Here's why: The kidneys can't function properly without enough water. When the kidneys don't work to capacity, some of their load is dumped onto the liver. One of the liver's primary functions is to metabolize stored fat into usable energy for the body. If the liver has to do some of the kidney's work, it can't operate at full throttle. As a result, it metabolizes less fat, more fat remains stored in the body, and weight loss stops. Drinking enough water is the best treatment for fluid retention. When the body gets less water, it perceives this as a threat to survival and begins to hold on to every drop. Water is stored in extra cellular spaces (outside the cells). This shows up as swollen feet, legs and hands. Diuretics offer a temporary solution at best. They force out stored water along with some essential nutrients. Again, the body perceives a threat and will replace the lost water at the first opportunity. Thus, the condition quickly returns. The best way to overcome the problem of water retention is to give the body what it needs.PLENTY OF WATER. Only then will the stored water be released. If you have a constant problem with water retention, excess salt may be to blame. Your body will tolerate sodium only in a certain concentration. The more salt you eat, the more water your system retains to dilute it. But getting rid of un-needed salt is easy - just drink more water. As it's forced through the kidneys, it takes away excess sodium. The overweight person needs more water than the thin one! Larger people have larger metabolic loads. Since we know that water is the key to fat metabolism, it follows that the overweight person needs more water. Water helps maintain proper muscle tone by giving muscles their natural ability to contract and by preventing dehydration. It also helps to prevent the sagging skin that usually follows weight loss - shrinking cells are buoyed by water, which plumps the skin and leaves it clear, healthy, and resilient. Water helps rid the body of waste. During weight loss, the body has a lot more waste to get rid of - all the metabolized fat must be shed. Again, adequate water helps flush out the waste. Water can help relieve constipation. When the body gets too little water, it siphons what it needs from internal sources. The colon is one primary source. Result? Constipation. But, when a person gets enough water, normal bowel functions returns.<br>  <br>  as for me, I dont drink 8 glasses a day, 6 glasses is just good, depending on your activity, if you spend time working out, you need lots of water. 2-3 bottles of water (the regular size) is just enough.|`|Bu0TSiaKaa	no.  but i heard that we get more water from eating food than we think|`|m13Se2dAaa	8 glasses of water a day = huge frickin' myth!!!<br>  <br>  You'll see lots of people trying to tell you otherwise, but you won't get links to scientific information - just a lot of speculation.<br>  <br>  Check out these links - real science, legitimate websites, and interesting reading...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2008/07/wellness-water-8x8-myth.html" rel="nofollow">http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2008...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thedoctorweighsin.com/journal/2008/4/5/medical-myth-1-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedoctorweighsin.com/journal...</a><br>  <br>  and from one of my favorite and most trusted websites - snopes.com<br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/myths/8glasses.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/medical/myths/8gla...</a><br>  <br>  and WebMD - one of the most highly respected websites in existence <a href="http://www.webmd.com/news/20080402/health-benefits-of-water-oversold" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/news/20080402/healt...</a>|`|XUnsJ2xjaa	i agree 100%.

It also causes the cervix to create more mucus to make it more difficult for sperm to pass through. And it also makes the lining of the uterus thinner in order to make it difficult for a fertilised egg to attach to the uterus.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the bleeding can't be from ovulation, but it can happen sometimes if you're late or even miss taking a pill. It also happens sometimes if you've not long started taking the pill. <br>  <br>  If you are unsure about it because it's not normal for you, then you should visit your GP just to be on the safe side. It would put your mind at ease also. It's not uncommon for this to happen though, so don't panic yourself too much!<br>  <br>  Good luck x

6nrLRKmeaa	you should try less severe measures first. TRY the ablasion, that is what I am trying first. If it doesn't work, or stops working after awhile, then do hysterectomy. Both are expensive, but a hysterectomy is more expensive because it requires at least a one day hospital stay. Also you will have to take hormone replacement until you're old enough to have gone through menopause naturally. <br>  <br>  candidates for ablasion are younger women, like under 40, who do not want or are done having kids, and do not have a high risk of cancer of the cervix or uterus. <br>  <br>  <br>  feel free to answer my question about ablasion<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkqH8bF61dAfZyuqIK5YoGXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307004855AAdzk9m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LrGmpacOaa	A patient is not considered for a hysterectomy unless they have some underlying disease of the uterus or ovaries that makes it necessary. Cancer, severe endometriosis, etc. They don't just take out your reproductive organs for no reason.<br>  <br>  And you can't have a hysterectomy without surgery. It requires a laparotomy, which will leave you with a scar at least 4 inches across. It will look a lot like a C-section scar.<br>  <br>  Recovery time is several weeks, usually at least a few days in the hospital. I don't know the cost, but it's major surgery, so pretty expensive.<br>  <br>  Why do you want one, may I ask?<br>  <br>  EDIT: No one here can judge your candidacy.

I incorporated the treadmill into my weight loss routine along with taking hoodia and honestly the weight started falling off. It's simple really, if you control your appetite and are eating less and you exercise more it's a great formula to drop as much weight as you desire in the areas you desire. What I liked best about hoodia was that I didn't feel like I was dieting. It took away my hunger and I didn't feel all lightheaded and run down like can happen when you cut back caloric intake. I had plenty of energy and if I had to diet, and I did, desert burn hoodia made it as enjoyable as possible as I lost my weight. I dropped 33 pounds in two months or so and didn't even feel like i was dieting. GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia : and you will see. I had great success with hoodia and treadmill/walking exercise and MAKE SURE you don't get any of that junk they sell in the mall @ GNC. Only 100% hoodia gordonii works this well and desert burn has that kind. So, like I said, check out some reading and check out the treadmill pages as well. Also, upping your protein and fiber intake is a great idea. Protein builds muscle which burns fat and fiber fill you up and keeps you regular. So, like I said, do that Google like I said and see for yourself. Hope this helps you out. hoodia really works, I'm living proof!!!

wNxADbnYaa	Trypanophobia is the extreme and irrational fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles. It is occasionally referred to as aichmophobia, belonephobia, or enetophobia, names that are technically incorrect because they simply denote a “fear of pins/needles” and do not refer to the medical aspect of trypanophobia. The name that is in common usage is simply needle phobia.<br>  <br>  Treatment:<br>  <br>  As well as the specific methods recommended for a case of trypanophobia that is clearly of one of the four types, there are other treatments available, some more effective than others. As not every trypanophobic patient falls clearly into one of the four categories and there are both hybrid phobias and phobias of other, as yet unnamed classifications, it is best to research all available treatment options before coming to a decision as to which one will be effective in a particular case.<br>  <br>      * Local anesthetic injections - This form of treatment is readily available and economically sensible. However, it provides only superficial pain control and it is completely impractical to treat needle phobia with an injection.<br>      * Ethyl Chloride Spray (and other freezing agents) - Easily administered, but provides only superficial pain control.<br>      * Topical Anesthetic Creams - This form of treatment is painless and portable but takes a long time to become effective and is messy.<br>      * Jet Injectors - Jet Injectors work by introducing substances into the body through a jet of high pressure gas as opposed to by a needle. Though these eliminate the needle, some people report that they cause more pain. Also, they are only helpful in a very limited number of situations involving needles i.e insulin and some inoculations.<br>      * Iontophoresis - Iontophoresis drives anesthetic through the skin by using an electric current. It provides effective anesthesia, but is generally unavailable on the commercial market and is also inconvenient to use.<br>      * Behavioral Therapy - Effectiveness of this varies greatly depending on the person and the severity of the condition. There is some debate as to the effectiveness of behavioral treatments for specific phobias (like blood, injection, injury type phobias), though some data are available to support the efficacy of approaches like exposure therapy.[2][3] Any therapy that endorses relaxation methods may be contraindicated for the treatment of trypanophobia as this approach encourages a drop in blood pressure that only enhances the vasovagal reflex. In response to this, graded exposure approaches can include a coping component relying on applied tension as a way to prevent complications associated with the vasovagal response to specific blood, injury, injection type stimulus.[4]<br>      * Laughing Gas - This will provide sedation and reduce anxiety for the patient, along with some mild analgesic effects.<br>      * Inhalation General Anesthesia - This will eliminate all pain and also all memory of any needle procedure. On the other hand, it is a very extreme solution, as it is not covered by insurance in most cases and most physicians will not order it. It can be risky, cost a great deal of money and require a hospital stay.<br>  <br>  <br>  More facts:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanophobia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanophob...</a>
BaNrweQ4aa	lots and lots of advice here:<br>  <a href="http://www.tellmehowto.net/howto/get_rid_of_spots_quickly_25" rel="nofollow">http://www.tellmehowto.net/howto/get_rid...</a><br>  <br>  12 ways to get rid of acne:<br>  <br>  1. Don't Touch!<br>  Don't pick, press, rub, or otherwise manipulate your pimples. If you do, you risk spreading the bacteria and increasing the chances of scarring. Similarly, don't rest your chin on your hands or constantly touch your face. Tight sweatbands and chin straps from baseball caps and sports equipment can have the same effect.<br>  <br>  2. Use Benzoyl Peroxide<br>  When to See a Doctor<br>  There's no reason to put up with serious acne, because a number of medications can treat it successfully. See a dermatologist if you:<br>  Use benzoyl peroxide products for six to eight weeks and still have problems.<br>  Have pustules larger than a match head.<br>  Have nodules the size of the end of your little finger.<br>  Have any scarring from your acne. <br>  Use an over-the-counter product containing benzoyl peroxide once or twice a day. It helps break up the plug of dead skin cells, bacteria, and oil that clogs the pore and forms an acne blemish. And it cuts down on the bacteria, too. Start with the lowest concentration -- a 2.5 percent or 5 percent lotion or gel once a day. After a week, increase to twice a day, morning and night, if it doesn't irritate your skin.<br>  If your acne doesn't improve within four to six weeks, use a 10 percent lotion or gel once a day and, if needed, twice a day. Work your way up gradually, especially if you have sensitive skin, because the higher the concentration, the more irritating it may be. <br>  <br>  3. Try Sulfur or Resorcinol Products<br>  Try over-the-counter products containing sulfur or resorcinol, which help unplug oil glands by irritating the skin. However, most dermatologists believe that benzoyl peroxide is the most effective over-the-counter ingredient for acne. <br>  <br>  4. Cover Your Bases<br>  Don't just spot-treat acne; put the product on acne-prone areas, too. That can include your entire face (avoid the lips and eyes), back and chest. <br>  <br>  5. Go Easy on Washing<br>  Go easy on your face. Washing removes oils from the surface of the skin, not from within the plugged ducts. In fact, if you're too aggressive in your quest for cleanliness, you may end up drying out or irritating the sensitive skin on your face.<br>  <br>  6. Wash Properly<br>  Wash properly once or twice a day, using a soap or nonsoap cleanser labeled "mild" or "for sensitive skin", and rub lightly with your fingertips and warm water. If your skin is oily, use a soap with benzoyl peroxide for its drying properties. <br>  <br>  7. Be Careful with Exfoliants<br>  Exfoliating refers to removing the top layer of dead skin cells using a rough washcloth, loofah, or specially designed product. But skin with acne is already irritated, and scrubbing can make things worse. Don't use brushes, rough sponges or clothes, cleansers with granules or walnut hulls, or anything else of that nature on the delicate facial skin. For the back and chest, where skin is less sensitive, you can try one of the acne scrub pads along with soap that contains benzoyl peroxide.<br>  <br>  8. Avoid Oily Products<br>  Is it Rosacea?<br>  <br>  if you're over 40 and suddenly develop severe acne, you could be suffering from acne rosacea. -Acne rosacea is characterized by redness, inflammation (swelling), and dilated blood vessels. Further clues: You don't have any blackheads, the acne is located mainly on the central part of your face (nose and cheeks), and you have a lot of pustules (pus-containing pimples). <br>  Don't use oily products, such as hair pomades, heavy oil-based facial moisturizers, or oily cleansers. Likewise, protect your skin from cancer and wrinkles without aggravating your acne by choosing an oil- free sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher. Unfortunately, many waterproof sunscreens are too likely to clog oil glands to use on the face; so if you'll be sweating heavily or plan on swimming, you'll have to stick to the oil-free variety but be diligent about reapplying it often (as recommended on the label).<br>  <br>  9. Choose Better Make-up <br>  - Use water-based make-up, it won't clog pores as much as other types. Check the label to find out if makeup is water- or oil-based. If the label is unclear, use this guideline: If it separates into water and powder when left to sit undisturbed for a while, it's water-based, and if it stays mixed, it contains oil. Better yet, use powder blushes and loose powders instead of liquid. Eye makeup and lipstick are okay, because you don't generally get acne in those areas.<br>  <br>  10. Avoid Facials<br>  Don't get a facial. You may end up doing more harm than good. <br>  <br>  11. Pay Attention to Food<br>  Chocolate, greasy foods, nuts, and other foods have not been proven to have anything at all to do with causing teenage acne. Of course, if you notice a correlation between something you eat and your face breaking out, you could try avoiding the offending food. <br>  <br>  <br>  12: Watch Out for Iodine<br>  Watch out for iodine, which can be found in multiple vitamins and iodized salt. Some doctors believe iodine|`|TaQNtLBcaa	there is a clean and clear gel that removes red spots after 4 hrs.<br>  try it . btwi bought it yesterday and it helps.|`|FygMdfN6aa	use bio oil for the dryness and areas of red, it clears up dry skin and gets rid of uneven skintone and doesnt make acne worse it also gets rid of acne scars. and a product like pan oxly for your spots it ranges from a 2.5 to 10 depending how bad your skin is. or if you have a really big one, as a last resort i use retin-A however it is exreemly strong and you shouldnt use it all the time just put a bit on one spot if its quite bad, drs will tell you not to just put it on one spot, but trust me from experience dont put it all over your face cause you will peel like never before.|`|Nu6HObHWaa	<a href="http://readyin.surfs.it" rel="nofollow">http://readyin.surfs.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Drop some Visine drops on the red spots.

qboiPwCdaa	Often it's not an actual condition, but just an inexplicable phenomenon that may be caused by many things<br>  <br>  But it's also possible that it's Tinnitus, which is a medical term for hearing noises in your ear when there is no outside source of this sound.<br>  <br>  Almost everyone experiences a mild form of tinnitus once in awhile that only lasts a few minutes. However, constant or recurring tinnitus is stressful and can interfere with your ability to concentrate or sleep.<br>  <br>  You can help this by:<br>  - Relaxing<br>  - Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoking.<br>  - Getting rest<br>  <br>  But see a doctor if:<br>  - Buzzing started after a head injury.<br>  - The buzzing is associated with other unexplained symptoms like dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.<br>  - You have unexplained ear noises that bother you even after self-help measures.|`|SazPJ3iKaa	"EAR INFECTION"<br>  <br>  thats all I can say<br>  <br>  if you have fired any guns lately, or been exposed to really loud music, it could be tinnitus.|`|8LBIeeomaa	sometimes when the ear is too dry...not enough wax..this can happen..how often does it happen..if its too often c a doc..|`|Lh2KRCI2aa	It sounds like tinnitus.

2jMFurDoaa	ive never ever been against porn so you probably dont want me answering but hey im opinionated!<br>  <br>  i think like 98% of men look at porn. ive only met 2 men in my entire life who didnt look at it(..so they claim). My husband looks at porn at there is no unrealistic expectations of me or what i can do. if he sees something that really fascinates him then we will try and if it possible then great but if its not then he isnt heartbroken or saying "but they can do it the movie!" we watched porn together before and he wasnt comparing me to any of the actresses in the video. i was laughing at it too.<br>  <br>  porn isnt that big of a deal. if a man views women differently because he watched a movie, then that is the mans problem.<br>  <br>  what about chick flicks and romance novels? is a woman's view of men distorted because of those? if so then thats the womans fault, theres reality and then theres fantasy. most people know the difference.<br>  <br>  i dont understand women who say things like that about porn. i think its just because they are insecure with themselves on some level and dont want their men looking at any other women. men are visual beings they are going to notice other girls anyway (but not all men will chase after those women)|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I'm not against porn, so I guess I technically shouldn't be answering, but, yeah.  I watch it (not mainstream stuff, usually- more like stuff made for women, by women, like Erika Lust, Petra Joy, Shine Louise Houston) on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  I think more men could use more discussion about how porn is not real.  I actually read once about a study that showed how people who watched porn believed that BDSM, anal sex, and other sexual practices were more prevalent in society than those who didn't.  So no matter how much we may be rational and tell ourselves "it's all fantasy", there is a part of our brains that responds "does not compute".  It certainly doesn't help that gonzo porn- that which seems like reality TV, and presents itself as not-staged (even though it is!)- is more popular than ever, making us think that it's a realistic depiction of sex.<br>  <br>  I agree with you- we know better, and the answer isn't in banning porn, but in more education, more reminders that it ain't real.<br>  <br>  And I don't think guys necessarily expect women to act like women in porn- but that doesn't mean they don't want them to.  If you seeing something highly eroticized like that, you'll be naturally curious and want to try it in your home life, often- even if you know it's a little much to ask for/expect your lady to be able to do all the things done in porn.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just wanted to say, to Mfh H, that there is NOT a link between porn and violent behavior.  If anything, the statistical evidence seems to indicate that it may actually LOWER the number of sex crimes in a country.  At the very least, the claim that viewing porn causes someone to want to rape or be violent has never been scientifically substantiated.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	no im 13 lol but i totally disagree with it because i think it is disrespectful to your partner as if they are not enough for them and disrespectful to the actual porn star<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: damn mfh H you got there before me  :(|`|ITCknAHVaa	I am against porn of both men and women.  One main reason is that it disrespects the person in the porn and the person watching it is brought down to the lowest common denominator.  There is also a link between porn, and sexual abuse, and violent crimes.<br>  <br>  I have actually seen a very little bit or porn and was totally disgusted.  I think there are some very good reason why it is banned in many cases.<br>  <br>  Watching porn also totally disrespects your partner, like they are not good enough.  It also cheating on your partner, whether you like it or not it is cheating.|`|U18g98GWaa	mostly the point of porn is just a turn on. its just visually stimulating. my husband doesn't ask me to act out things. its just something that like to watch together for fun. i personally don't feel theres anything wrong with porn. everyone has their own feeling about it. maybe because most of the porn is directed towards guys. there are plenty of porn movies that are actually very sensual, like reading some love story. porn is a good way to, i guess, discover yourself.  masturbating is actually a healthy thing. its a good way of finding out what you like and finding new ways to do things. it can make you feel more confident in and outside of the bedroom.|`|Zg4Wfjnnaa	i dont think it gives unrealistic expectations, i just think its wrong and degrading<br>  im pretty open with my sex life, but i wouldnt want someone else watching.<br>  but now we live in a world where people make money wherever they can for having so ittle talent. all they need to do is have big boobs and wax their pubes. oh and be mega skinny with long blonde hair. then you're a porn star.<br>  i guess i also dont like it because it is so very fake. and guys do sometimes get the impression that all women have orgasms because they have huge *****... i mean some women need so much more than a huge dick to fill their hole.<br>  <br>  mmmm. and i wouldnt like the idea of my boyfriend watching it.<br>  <br>  ive watched a few, and i think theyre mega corny. especially the ones with the plots. id rather be doing it and experimenting to find new ways to make one feel good then to watch it happen.|`|IMN5j1ZUaa	i Love porn

DErZDyBQaa	Good job on your diet, it's what most people miss. But I feel that you are overtraining. 4 hours a day? That's way too much!<br>  <br>  Try 3-5 times a week, for 1-2 hour sessions!|`|AA11037376	Yes because thats what body builders do|`|cc3de441467bd3591cbacd40337caeccaa	sounds like you are pretty skinny, no offense. for some people it is impossible to gain much weight. but try this and see if it helps.<br>  <br>  first give yourself a week away from the gym to allow your body to rest and reset your training schedule.<br>  <br>  allow 3-5 days rest between working the same muscle groups, it seems like a long time but that's the time the tissue is actually building and regrowing. and of course take in lots of protein and amino acids esp. right after workouts 25-40 grams. these are the building blocks of muscles, you have to get lots of these! but you know that already. also try to do slow controlled reps, this is important! it adds intensity to your workout and makes for more efficient use of your time. oh god i could go on forever.<br>  <br>  everybody (with experience) has their own routine or strategy for the best way to build muscle. i suggest you do some research and figure out what works best for you. me personally, i love going to the gym and ripping my muscles to shreds, i rep to absolute failure. bring a friend and have him spot you doing things like curls so he can help you squeeeezzzee out those last 2 or 3 reps. you have to rip up your muscles and provide your body plenty of protein and rest to repair. if you work the same muscle groups every day or every other day you're just re-ripping them, not allowing them to grow and recover.<br>  <br>  a GREAT place to start your research is <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.h...</a> there's TONS of very useful articles here.<br>  <br>  one of the strange phenomenons in the gym is what i call the placebo effect... sorta... when you're repping and you cant squeez out that last one have your buddy just place his hands under the bar and make it look like he's helping you lift without actually lifting. somehow magically you can do 2 or 3 more reps with their "assistance"<br>  <br>  pick 2 muscle groups and and alternate between the two, going to failure on one should allow you enough time to work the other. then alternate. drink lots of water! and rest well.<br>  <br>  basically if ur trying to put on muscle weight u need protein to build the muscles and carbs to give you the energy to work out. take multivitamins!<br>  <br>  good luck!

Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of  warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to master, (Progressive Muscular Relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day. An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, saying to yourself: "Even though I sometimes have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure tapping. <br>  <br>  Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at <a href="http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm</a>  The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective. Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.<br>  <br>  Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea.  I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, in section 3, on page A, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you. I also use it prior to my chosen relaxation technique, after lights out, at night. Get strong light, preferably sunlight (even if overcast) soon after waking in the morning, to reset your circadian rhythm. Your bedroom should very dark, after lights out, and a good sleeping temperature is 70 F, or 19 C. No daytime napping. Have a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3. <br>  <br>  Others may prefer Sleepytime, by Celestial Seasonings, Relax, Be Sleepy, or valerian root, from supermarket tea, or health food aisles.   <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  If you are one of the 40% of people who are fairly suggestible, you may wish to consider professional hypnotherapy, or: Cure Insomnia, & Sleep and Dream, & Sleep Like a Child, & Drift Off To Sleep, & Fall Asleep Fast <br>  <a href="http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/</a> or from: <a href="http://www.asktheinternettherapist.com/h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.asktheinternettherapist.com/h...</a> - Quiet Blissful Sleep, & Enjoy Deep Sleep, & Restorative Healing Sleep.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Light exercise and then taking a warm bath or shower before bed can help you sleep.

Most of the time this should curb your hunger|`|LHKB43gMaa	Look up what filling foods there are, which ones you like best, and stock up on those. Also, try replacing a meal or two with a meal shake such as slim fast or a generic brand. They tend to keep you fuller for longer. You could also divide your portions of a regular meal so that 3 regular meal portions take you 6-8 sittings a day to eat. That way you would pretty much be eating all day long, but not taking in any extra food. Or just munch on celery, it has negative calories, aiding in some weight loss.|`|8xH05DqDaa	Seriously?

iK3YYRaTaa	I don't think you have a great possibility of getting diabetes. Its a auto-immune disease. But,,,, Ninety percent of children who develop type 1 diabetes actually have no relative with the disease. Thanks to studies of families, researchers now can identify at birth when a baby carries some of the genes that indicate risk factors for type 1 diabetes. Certain genes called HLA markers are associated with diabetes risk. If a child is born with such markers, his or her risk of developing type 1 diabetes is about the same as if he or she had a sibling with type 1 diabetes, even though no other family member may have the disease. There are other genes that also create risk for juvenile diabetes that have not yet been identified. <br>  <br>  In type 1, the pancreas stop producing insulin, due to autuimmune response or possibly viral attack on pancreas. In absence of insulin, body cells does not get glucose for producing ATP (Adenosin Triphosphate) units which results into primary symptom in the form of nausea and vomiting. In latter stage which leads to ketoacidosis in which body starts breaking down muscle tissue and fat for energy, there is consequently fast weight loss. Dehydration is also usually observed due to electrolyte disturbance. In advance stages even coma and death, are being witnessed.<br>  <br>  You could get a check to see if you have these HLA markers, to see if you may be prone.<br>  Good luck my friend>|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	<a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/endocrine/type1.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/end...</a><br>  <br>  Scroll down to signs and symptoms. Looks like frequent urination, fatigue, abnormal thirst and weight loss.|`|zSsyOBcIaa	You can ask your doctor for an insulin antibodies blood test, which can predict with accuracy if you are deceloping Type 1 Diabetes.  I am a type 1, and my two children have this test every 2 years.  It won't help prevent the onset of Type 1 Diabetes, but if you are aware you are developing it then you can manage the symptoms and greatly reduce the risk of serious illness.  I got it when I was 15, and I was so sick I weighed 35 kgs (77 pounds) and fell into a coma before my parents bothered to take me to a doctor, so it would be fantastic if you could find out beforehand that you are going to develop it and really reduce the risk of becoming underweight and ill.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that with only one type 1 diabetic parent, your risk of developing this disease isn't great.  Slightly more than if none of your parents had it, but also less than if both had.  Have a positive outlook on life and don't dwell on the worst case scenario.  Chances are you will never get it.|`|S7TVjfmQaa	The latest discovery of British scientist released 2 day ago shows that the main cause of Diabetes is virus.

ESAVdvdxaa	Asprin is one that can thin blood and is not dangerous. I wouldnt suggest the eggs, mayo, pizza etc. Those are dangerous to the arteries, if you have thick blood.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Coumadin is a blood thinner. She shouldn't do anything else to thin her blood without the advice of her doctor. Just because the blood may look thick when she bleeds doesn't mean that it's TOO thick. The doctor will determine the appropriate "thickness" of her blood based on the results of the blood test. If it's not within the range of what it should be for somebody on Coumadin then he'll adjust the dose, have her take the new dose for awhile and then retest her blood. Thinning out your own blood is nothing to fool around with. There can be serious consequences to doing such a thing and she needs to leave it to the doctor to work with her on this issue. I hope that helps. Take care!|`|rNsCkHEwaa	The doctor will adjust her dose of coumadin if her blood needs to be thinner.   Do not attempt to do this on your own.

Honey is a great remedy for skin blemishes and acne because the honey kills bacteria. <br>  These are some effective home remedies for the treatment of acne and blackheads.|`|rZeoJXqsaa	Try a gentle cleanser. One that is glycerin or sorbitol based will be good and it does not need to be expensive. Cetaphil and Neutrogena has some pretty good ones. Try Cetaphil? Gentle Skin Cleanser. <br>  <br>  Proactiv works for some people it clears up for a while but acne may come back. It is also very harsh on your skin and may dry it all up, definitely not for people with sensitive skin. My friend said it corroded and bleached her metal sink so if it can do that to the sink, think of what it is doing to your face. So Proactiv is a no no. <br>  <br>  Wash your face at least twice a day and everytime after you perspire. If your skin is the oily kind, you do not need to apply any moisturizer, your skin oils are enough to keep it hydrated. If you really must apply a gentle light oil free one. Cetaphil? Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15 or Cetaphil? Moisturizing Lotion is quite good<br>  <br>   Apply pimple cream to the acne area. Try benzoyl peroxide low strength(2.5%) first. Don't pick poke scrub or pop your pimples unless you want scars which are really ugly. Scrubbing cleansers or washes are also no-nos because it equals picking and poking and makes acne worse Treated pimples gently.<br>  <br>  Eat healthy. Make sure you drink plenty of water. Cut down on sugar and carb intake. Foods like chocolates, coffee, soda drinks, bread, rice potatoes or anything starchy and sugary are no-nos. Cut down on oily and fried foods also. Go for grilled, steamed or baked food. Make sure you eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Ensure that your diet is rich in vitamin A, C, E and Omega-3 which are important for the skin. Less stress and sleeping enough is also important. Not having enough sleep is like putting stress on your body. Makes sure you sleep at least 8 hours a day.<br>  <br>  If you are a smoker. Try to quit. Smoking causes a lot of damage to your skin because it introduces toxins to it. These toxins can clog the pores or make the skin harder to breathe and that’s when the acne bacteria set in. The toxins also cause longer healing of the acne as well as the marks and scars left behind by acne.<br>  <br>  If all else fails and your acne is still very bad, it is time to see a dermatologist. The pills and medications do work but you may have to take them long term to suppress the acne as it is not a cure and acne is a chronic disease. However the pills are not miracles and you won’t see results in 2-3 days. It normally takes about 2 weeks to see the difference. However not all dermatologists prescribe pills unless your acne is really bad. The pills will include antibiotics, accutane and contraceptives. If your acne isn’t that bad, dermatologists will prescribe topical creams first. If you are really going to a dermatologist, I suggest asking about a product known as Retin-A that treats acne and acne marks and heals the scars.|`|6VvJ62XTaa	Dermatologist persciption.

nolxYfzUaa	It is an oral candida infection.  Known as "Thrush."  Babies usually get this from having an upset stomach, viral type.  Until you can see your doctor for some antibiotics, amoxicillian, get some MOM and swish it around in your mouth.  Don't be kissing on baby, in case you are running a temp.  Don't want little one crying.  Gargle with plain listerine.  It is an aggravating thing to have, but you will be fine once you get the antibiotic.  Sorry.  You can go to MedMD and type in thrush.

You are going to have to go to the hospital or call a dr and have them prescribe you amoxicillin. It is important that you get it. right now, you are contageous and continue to be contageous until you are on the amoxicillin for a little under 24 hours.
AA10975447	Yes. Genital herpes, HPV and syphilis are spread via direct skin contact. The parts of you NOT covered by the condom can be vulnerable to infection.<br>  <br>  Granted condoms are not 100% protection (only abstinence is!), it is better than having no protection at all.<br>  <br>  The best way to ensure a healthy sexual lifestyle is to get tested regularly, always use condoms and birth control and be selective about your partners. Develop relationships with your partners so you can TRUST them.
M6UbAi83aa	Hi, first of all I would like to say well done for making that appointment.  When you go she will ask you to remove your underwear and will probably give you a sheet or some paper roll to place over you so that you're not bearing all.  She will then either place your legs in stirrups or will ask you to place your ankles together and then place your knees apart. She may then even ask you to place your hands in a fist under your bottom so that you'll be slightly elevated.<br>  <br>  It's a simple procedure and she will either place a small clamp inside you so that she can take a scraping of the cervix or she will use this new piece of equipment that they have which looks like a plastic bottle.  I'm not really sure what they do with it but it's all sterile and with a small spatula she'll just take a small sample.  I've had about 6 or 7 smears and I've never really found them to be painful, just slightly uncomfortable.  It only takes a minute or two to do.  <br>  <br>  After it's been done she'll then explain that it can take about 6 weeks for the results to come back.  You'll be sent a letter which will either tell you if it's normal, abnormal or inadequate (not enough cells taken).  Depending on the results, the letter will tell you what the next step is.  <br>  <br>  Please remember that even if it's abnormal, this does NOT mean that you have cervical cancer.  It just means that they have detected some changes in your cells that can BECOME cancer if left untreated.  I had an abnormal smear 2 years ago and since then I've had a baby and had 2 normal smears.  I don't need to go now until next year.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DUa16Ka4aa	If you are a virgin, they don't use the metal thing, which is actually very short and about the width of your thumb with rounded edges.<br>  If you are a virgin they'll just swab you. When you are with your nurse its actually strangely comfortable if you just look up at the ceiling. It feels like.. almost nothing really. You'll probably flinch at first, I did, but it's very quick, maybe 2 minutes MAX.<br>  I was nervous too, out of my mind.<br>  But once I got in there, I was fine. Just don't look at the doctor or nurse while they are doing it, it'll only make you uncomfortable.|`|wSqq4gSBaa	It's just awkward in uncomfortable 2 me|`|6a809f8f4c97f768092102e120596872aa	u will go behind a curtain and strip from the waist down lie on a bed and put a small blanket over u the nurse will then come in and ask u 2 bend ur knees up and let them flop to the side, then u will get a little thing put inside that will open u a little bit and she will take a little bit of stuff from ur cervix then its basicly over and u need to get dressed|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	The nurse will probably ask you a lot of questions, but the doctor will actually perform the tests on you and this is what you can expect.<br>  <br>  If you are going for your first pap smear, it is uncomfortable but not painful. They will take your blood pressure and weigh you. Then they will ask you lots of questions about your health and when your last period was. Then they have you put on a paper gown and get ready for the doctor. When the doctor comes in he may ask some questions about your health. He will discreetly check your breasts for lumps. There will always be a nurse or lady in the room with you and if there isn't and you want one, ask. Then they will put your feet in stirrups with your legs open and he will put two fingers into your vagina and push on your ovaries to check them. Then they will insert a speculum into your vagina and take a long q-tip and take a sample from your cervix. It doesn't hurt but is a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they will put a gloved finger into your anus to check to see that everything is okay there. Then it is over.<br>  <br>  During the procedure, the doctor will probably talk to you about your life or family and try to keep your mind off what he is doing. If you try hard to relax and take deep breaths, it is less uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Don't be embarrassed, it is nothing compared to giving birth and being in labor, when it seems everyone is checking your vagina.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	A smear test basically involves a Dr or Nurse using a speculum (an instrument that is inserted into the vagina, which opens to view the cervix) to collect a sample of cells from the lining of the cervix-  this is done using a plastic spatula or brush. The cell sample is then sent away to the lab to be looked at under a microscope. The aim of the test is to detect abnormal/precancerous cells. The idea is that if precancerous cells are present, treatment can be given before the cells turn into cancer.<br>  <br>  Smear tests are carried out to prevent cervical cancer not to diagnose cancer as many people wrongly think (although smears can detect cancer). Most people describe smear tests as being uncomfortable rather than painful. It is all over very quickly.|`|mAQHyfCYaa	Ok so this is copied and pasted from my previous answer of basically the exact same question asked by someone else.<br>  <br>  "Well the procedure isn't so bad. I'm guessing you'll be getting a breast exam, pap smear and pelvic exam.<br>  <br>  If you are nervous talk to a nurse or doctor and they will explain the exam to you, but here's the basic experience:<br>  <br>  You get your blood pressure and weight taken by the nurse. She asks you things like are you sexually active, if you are on birth control or any other medication. If you are sexually active and on birth control they may also ask if you use condoms as well, it will depend on the nurse though.<br>  <br>  Next you're taken into the exam room and given a large paper sheet and the nurse will tell you to remove your pants and underwear, including your bra (if you are getting a breast exam), you leave your shirt on and some people find the stirrups cold so keep your socks on as well. The nurse leaves you to get undressed and you lay on the exam table and cover yourself with the paper sheet. You won't have to put your feet in the stirrups until the doctor arrives, just lay down and relax. When the doctor arrives she/he will perform the breast exam (you don't need to expose your breasts, she/he will just do it through your shirt).<br>  <br>  Next you will be asked to scoot down and put your feet in the stirrups and you spread your legs (feels embarrassing but it is necessary). The doctor then inserts a lubricated speculum (<a href="http://www.gpsupplies.com/images/Product..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gpsupplies.com/images/Product...</a> into your vagina, this will be somewhat uncomfortable. The doctor then opens the speculum a bit (again uncomfortable, not painful usually though). The doctor will then use a a brush (kind of looks like a mascara brush) and a spatula looking thing to scrap some cells from your cervix (again, more discomfort). Some places do an automatic STD check, which is just another quick swab with a q-tip.<br>  <br>  Continue to relex, the speculum will be removed but don't sit up yet, you still need a pelvic exam. The doctor will insert a couple of fingers into your vagina and place the other hand on your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities. You are then allowed to sit up. The doctor will leave and you can get dressed and you're all done.<br>  <br>  Some women experience cramping for a few hours after, nothing too severe though.<br>  <br>  It's uncomfortable and slightly embarassing but it is necessary and only takes about 5 minutes at most."|`|Rx0ae0suaa	Good for you for having one, sweetie.<br>  <br>  I've had two (not by a nurse, by a male doctor) and I don't think they're so bad. While you're lying down, the nurse may give you a breast exam to feel for lumps or anything like that.<br>  <br>  You'll then raise your legs and push your knees apart (either with stirrups or just supporting yourself with your hands under your hips like I did), while the nurse lubricates a device that looks like a duck bill, and slides it into your vagina so they can look inside. It's uncomfortable and doesn't hurt, but just breath deeply and you'll be okay.<br>  <br>  They'll then insert what I think is a long thin stick (I've never seen it personally, my doctor hasn't shown me from what I call), which they place into your cervix to take some cells. Again, this shouldn't really hurt - it might feel like a small pinch, but shouldn't hurt, and it's over within seconds.<br>  <br>  At this point the nurse may or may not remove the duck-bill device, and with lubricated fingers they'll probably insert a finger or two into your vagina, and up until they reach the ovaries. At the same time, they will push down on your stomach with their free hand over the same area - they are simply checking your ovaries. I actually can't feel this part of the procedure at all.<br>  <br>  Then it's all over, and you can wipe yourself down and get dressed again!<br>  <br>  Honestly, it's not that bad - it's a little awkward; especially if you have a male nurse (it was a bit embarrassing the first time, but I've had so many male doctors looking around down there for various tests, and I no longer care). I just look at the ceiling or make simple conversation throughout the procedure.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	They will have you put your legs in "stirup" type things (Most of the time they'll give you a paper towel dress to cover your ladyness) and you'll slide your butt to the thend of the table and they'll insert a speculum into your woo woo and open it a little bit and take a bunch of swabs and swab ya... then they will take 2 fingers and put them in to feel your cervix and push on your belly with their other hand.. and then your all done =) its not so bad just kinda uncomfortable,..<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S - THE DOCTOR WILL NOT PUT HIS FINGER IN YOUR BUTT!! WHOEVER SAID THAT BELOW ME MUST HAVE A WEIRDO DOCTOR BECAUSE I AM 21 and have a 3 year old and have been going to the gynecologist since i was 14 (when i got my period) and NEVER EVER EVER had a doctor put a finger in my butt lol.. so DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT!<br>  <br>  AND ALSO they will feel your cervix and your ovaries for cancer NOT just your ovaries... and when doing a breast exam you will have to have your shirt OFF.. they wont do it with your shirt on...
ZcpefUf7aa	I am a personal trainer.  Step aerobics, lunges and calf push-ups. Stand behind a chair with your hands on the top of it for support and go up and down on your tippy-toes. 3 sets of 8 each. You can also do it at the gym and add weight to it on one of those calf free weights machines. You can start by boosting your cardio from 30 minutes to 60 minutes every day. Then try incorporating strength training into your routine three days a week. This strength training can focus on the areas you really want to tone, like your legs. Doing simple and effective exercises like hamstring extensions, lunges, squats, and leg raises can help tone muscles while burning calories. If you are overweight, don’t forget that working out alone isn’t the key to losing excess fat — you will also need to watch what you eat.  Stand with your weight on your heels. Hold feet apart. Slightly bend your knees. Hold back straight and keep your chin parallel to the floor. Bend knees until upper and lower legs form a 45 degree angle. Slightly lean forward, tilt pelvis up and squeeze glutes when you return to starting position. Do this in three sets of 15. Stand on a low bench. Tighten muscles around your abdomen and bend your knees. Lift your left foot a few inches off the bench. Place weight on right leg and bend right knee. Straighten and then tap toes on the bench. Switch legs as you complete sets. Do this in three sets of 15 on each side. Place both hands and knees on the floor making knees form a right angle. Keep your back and neck straight and aligned. Keep shoulders relaxed and face the floor all the time. Push right leg behind with a flexed foot. Keep glutes tight. Control your movement. Switch to left leg as you complete sets. Do three sets of 15 on each side.|`|Lh53NhmYaa	I have a friend who was overweight and had a thigh a big as a cow. That was 2 years ago. Now she is so slim and sexy.

Unfortunately, where you carry your fat (and I'm not just talking about excess fat when I say that) is to some extent genetically predetermined.  You can certainly lose weight and exercise - but, especially at your young age when you are still growing, you need to talk to your doctor before you embark on any diets.  But, you may have to live with it - I'm nearly 39 and no matter what weight I've been, I've always had cankles.  I did hear something about liposuction for ankles though - wait til you're older before you think about that, but it is one of the times when it may help with a single problem area.  As for the cellulite - the truth is most women get it, no matter how skinny they are - only a very lucky few don't.  In terms of exercises for elongating and toning muscles, pilates and light weights are supposed to be very good for that.  But, again - get some professional advice, then you'll be getting the best benefit out of what you are doing.  Take care :)|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

ciYaAPz9aa	This sounds like you're dehydrated. Drink plenty of water and use a good moisturiser. This should sort out the dryness and any dark circles and give your skin a healthy glow. <br>  <br>  The litle white spots are called milia and there is no known reason why they appear. They may also just disappear on their own but some things you can try to get rid of them are:<br>  <br>  Hold a hot, wet face cloth over the skin for a few minutes - the temperature should feel comfortable, not painful. This simple facial sauna helps to loosen and remove dead skin cells and debris from the skin.<br>  Use an exfoliating facial scrub to remove the top layer of skin, which can enable the cysts to fall out. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps

( what are they teaching kids in schools these days).<br>  <br>  the term "Virgin" will always be a sexual term describing your first time having intercourse, not using a tampon.

Cuz truth is, you are until you have sex. oh yeah..google it.|`|7utsLRfyaa	you are still a virgin if you use tampons<br>  even if your hymen is broken, it doesn't mean you are not a virgin.<br>  some girls break theirs during sport etc<br>  you only lose your virginity when you have sex.|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	no. a tampon cannot "take your virginity." that's like saying fingering can do it. actually, if I remember correctly, on the tampon box or if u look up information on tampons, it actually states that u will be "in tact" when u use them. actually, hymens are also destroyed during sports as well. I remember growning up saying "ok, can sports take your virginity then?" lol! but as long as you have not let the "real thing" get in there, consider yourself safe|`|hxxOIm1Maa	I think that virginity doesn't depend if you have the hymen intact, it is with the fact that a girl hasn't have sexual intercourse never before. I understand that the hymen is no longer intact as this can be tear by simply doing exercise since we are little girls eg. when we learn to use bicycles, when we climb up to a tree, etc. Anyway if you decide to use them, be careful and read carefully the instructions.|`|TeXaZaW3aa	incorrect...the hymen can be broken by horse back riding,tampons...etc...every womens hymen doesnt break the first time so when ever u get penetrated ur no longer a virgin|`|gC98RlU3aa	i guess it depends if u wanna look at it sexually or scientifically.|`|1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	using tampons wont take away your virginity. you have to have sex with a guy

Now he is in his early forty and already suffering from several injuries related to his being active in his youth according to a doctor. Among them is joint injuries and thickened blood.<br>  <br>  To answer your above question, I have another friend who was a heavy smoker but slightly less active (he jogged 5-7 miles 3x a week, played football and badminton 2x a week). He died when he was 30 because of, you guessed it, cancer. he thought he will not get it because non of his family member get it. He also thought that by being active he might not get it either. He died as a fit man with a cancer.

I cannot stress this enough sleep and diet seemed to help mine when I found my cadence with these I was able to get to the point that I could not buy slacks off a rack. The key is to optimize this to fit your metabolism. I also ran tire drills and did air raids but the first four seemed to be the top performers for me.After you do this then start a through leg work out like you would for deeper cuts. And eliminate all fats, even avocados. If you use testosterone try injecting both legs instead of just one. Nandrolone testosterone alternating 6 on 4 off will make them better defined.

If they still hurt like hell on the 3 day wait another day. In the mean time train your other body parts on days you don't train legs.|`|1Txef261aa	WIth your weight training train each body part 5 days a week.  When it comes to leg days rotate each week with the front squats then the next week normal squats.  Remember to be strict with your form and start off slowly and then you will gradually build yourself up to heavier weights.  Your diet and supplements also take a major part, increase clean carbohydrates and protein.  With supplements go to a natural health store and ask for the plant extract pure tribulus.  This will boost your own natural testosterone in your body.
fPSNxm7saa	I am living similar things. I am bipolar type 2 myself and I take a mood stabilizer. Just like you it helps my mood swings not to be so intense. But as you, I still get down and I don't have this motivation for anything. I find it frustrating (just as I imagine you do.) <br>  <br>  You should be carefull with antidepressants. People who suffer from bipolar illness often react badly to antidepressants because it shifts us in full mania. And if you are like me, your manias consist of anger, irritability and suicidal thoughts.<br>  <br>  Best advice is to talk it over with your specialist and I also strongly suggest you have someone with you whenever you try new meds. As you must know, it can take up to 3 weeks for the medication to take full effect in your body. So have someone you trust at your side that is able to see if their are any negative reactions (because you will not notice them).<br>  <br>  I'm speaking from personal experience! I had a really bad reaction once and if it wasn't for my mother pointing out the fact that I go worst because of the meds. I would probably have committed suicide! Always be safe and think about having support.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps in any way. I just wanted to make sure you knew the possible dangers so that nothing bad could happen to you.<br>  <br>  Take care ;)|`|JV0VqaqAaa	I suffer from Bipolar 1 and my psychiatrist still cannot stabilize me. I am taking prescription meds for anxiety, depression, manic, moodswings, and psychosis. I say yes that you should go ahead and request meds for depression. When you are depressed you lose interest in everything you ever card about. But if an anti-depressent works, then you should start becoming interested again and motivated to continue on with your life. I wish you Good Luck!

Anyhow, I asked him what to do and he told me he heard good things about hoodia. I did some research and found out the desert burn was one of the best. I got some and took it on the first day and literally forgot to eat. My appetite is very strong I might ad so when i forget to eat it's kind of a minor miracle. So I took it for a couple of months and my will power was very high and I dropped 33 pounds in just a couple of months and it didn't even seem like I was dieting. I was so psyched about feeling better and losing the weight that I started my own website dedicated to back health, diet tips and all around wellness. You asked, I'm telling you. try hoodia.

The steroid that the above writer suggests (prednisone) would not routinely be prescribed in the UK unless it were an extreme case. Good luck|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	Try some Homeopathic Belladonna .

Warm and cold drinks help with pain.  Warm tea or broth, or really cold drinks work best.  Gargling with warm salt water will help with the phlem that builds up on them.  Gargling with vinegar and warm water will help kill the bacteria that causes it.  <br>  <br>  If it's too bad, you should go to the dr to make sure it isn't strep.

AA11522944	The ‘average’ length of an erect ADULT penis is about 6" (15.2 cm).<br>  <br>  About 60% of all guys are between 5.5" (14 cm) and 6.5" (16.5 cm) and up to 90% of all guys are between 5” (12.7 cm) and 7” (17.7 cm). That’s only a 2” (5 cm) difference between 90% of ALL males.<br>  <br>  Only about 5% of guys are less that 5” (12.7 cm) and only about 5% are more than 7” (17.7 cm). Less than 2% of guys are 8” (20.3 cm) or longer. <br>  <br>  See this link <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Penis_percentile.svg" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:...</a><br>  <br>  It's impossible to deny that size matters to SOME women. Women have preferences about all sorts of issues (hair colour, build, hairiness etc) and penis size is no different.<br>  <br>  However a lot of guys seem to have the mistaken belief that ALL women prefer big penises or that having a big penis would improve their sex life.<br>  <br>  The fact is that a penis CAN be too big and CAN cause problems during sex.<br>  <br>  It's worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average adult vagina (which is about 6" deep). If your penis is longer than your partner’s vagina is deep you will hit her cervix - the opening to the womb at the top of the vaginal passage - when you have sex and this can be very uncomfortable for the girl. So bigger is not always better… in fact for some people it can be a problem.<br>  <br>  While a large penis seems to be what every guy wants there is a definite down side... not being able to 'slam it home' is one of them. I have read interviews with porn stars who say their big penises are a curse... seriously. <br>  <br>  If only guys could get it through their heads that being 'average' is actually a good thing.... for them AND their partner.|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	its normal and it does nt matter as u can satisfy a gal with jus 2 inches<br>  jus read on the following links they will further unfold all ur answers about sex, penis, etc<br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-Myths-and-Facts-About-Sex.477823" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthmad.com/Men's-Health/Common-Sex-Queries.510033" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthmad.com/Men's-Health/Co...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/Adult-Games-Foreplay.538737" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/Adult...</a>|`|UfkOQsE2aa	That's just slightly below the 6" average.

This is something you can keep up indefinitely - not too time consuming or expensive!  Weigh yourself every Saturday morning before breakfast.    You should lose at least 1lb a week if you do it properly - so a dramatic loss if you keep it up for a year.     The ideal menu is a small portion of cereal with a tub of fat free yoghurt or a banana for breakfast,  a tuna or cold meat and salad sandwich on wholemeal bread for lunch, and a normal dinner but not too much.    A piece of fruit mid morning and mid afternoon and a good glass of water with each meal and snack.  Good luck.

ioBfCtRQaa	When you do upper body muscle training you will burn more fat and calories in this area. Try lifting weights doing upper body exercises. Concentrate on using weights that are challenging, but not too heavy b/c you want to do higher number of quick reps to keep your heart rate up. Push ups and pull ups are great exercises, even if you must modify and do them on your knees and standing on a box/chair. Bottom line is the best way to decrease any area of fat is cardio with some weights specifically focused on those area. checkout the fitness magazine website they have specific things for specific body types.|`|hVNVl6Ujaa	As you loose weight your body might seem to look disproportional; however, you can only loose fat from where you store fat. Abdominal fat is hard to loose especially if that is where your body likes to store fat.  As for loosing the double chin, there are some facial yoga exercises you can do to help you on your way, but the chin leaves when the fat stores are depleted.  Facial fat is quicker to respond to weight loss than abdominal fat so keep up with the fat % loss and you will see the results you want.  Other options are surgery, but its better to work on your health than just on your looks.  Good luck with your fitness!|`|wXKs94nDaa	No, but cardio will make you lose excess fat|`|niZBsn9Qaa	You cant do that unfortunately. Overall fat loss depends on genetics as to where your body tends to lose it first.<br>  <br>  Now, the good news. Based on what you told me you have what is called Android obesity, which is, extra body fat that tends to accumulate on the belly, arms, face, chest and back. Gynoid obesity is just the opposite, lower body legs, butt, thighs and hips. Android obesity normally affects men (thus the "beer belly" look) and is the most dangerous since there are extra concentrated fat deposits around the heart which can lead to heart disease......yah that's not the good news, but HERE is the good news:<br>  <br>  since you are predetermined to gain weight first in those areas, you are most likely predetermined to LOSE fat in those areas first. SO, if you do 30 minutes of cardio daily (keeping your heart rate between 120 and 140) and cut back 500 calories from your diet a day, you will lose weight and most likely in the areas that affect you.<br>  <br>  So yes, cardio cardio cardio and abdominals to strengthen that area, create lean muscle and thus helping you lose more weight (muscle burns fat, you know)<br>  <br>  good luck

JV0VqaqAaa	I am bipolar as well. Creativity and artistic talent are symptoms during a manic phase. You have racing thoughts and you need to release and express your feelings of euphoria some how. It's absolutely normal and expected to be creative in the manic phase. You are lucky though, when I am manic I become hostile and I have racing thoughts as well, but they are negative thoughts. I'd go a few days with little or no sleep. My psychiatrist and I have been trying all kinds of meds, but I can't stabilize. I just can't believe this is happening to me. I wonder what meds you've used.|`|CegkTi6Haa	I'm bipolar & it's not unusual for me to become manic even while on meds. Usually I become super-talkative and have high energy. But being ultra-creative during both manic and depressed states is common. I'm an artist and I can easily spend hours writing or creating digital art or scrapbooking. I can also play the Sims for hours at a time. It's just the way the bipolar brain works I guess. The way it's hard-wired & the chemicals it the brain.<br>  <br>  If you're interested Kay Redfield Jamison wrote a really good non-fiction book called Touched With Fire about famous artists/writers/composers who had manic episodes and creativity. I believe it also explains why it happens and things to do about it.<br>  <br>  You could always ask your psychiatrist or health care provider about it or join a bipolar/mental illness support group so you can meet people who've had similar experiences.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps.|`|7e93af17f42d666c2908eb9cb997f573aa	If I may, what meds are you on now?

HAletyh8aa	@ Jennifer M, girls do think that not eating will allow them to lose weight. That is not true. Not eating will just increase your rates of storing more fat. Think of your body as a fireplace. Your fireplace constantly needs wood to keep yourself warm. So.... what I'm trying to say is... just eat small meals/snacks every 2-3 hours or so. Also... if you don't eat... and then suddenly one day you do... your body will be worried about when their next meal would be... So instead of using those calories as energy, it will be stored as fat. <br>  <br>  Sum it all up.. LADIES!!! DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF! You're just making yourself more fatter than you really are! <br>  <br>  To do long/short distance things.. you've got to practice. Don't think that after 1 week you will see results. You've got to keep at it every single day!<br>  <br>  Start out with something small. Swim or run! Do some aerobic exercises in order increase your rates of not losing your breath. Swimming is a good way to get fit! Not to mention, swimming actually helps people who have symptoms of asthma. I'm not saying you have possibilities of asthma, but it does help you with breathing.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know you said that you eat like a horse.. and you do not mind. Thing is, if there is ever a time you are trying to watch what you eat... it's best to eat 5-8 small meals a day. In fact, it shouldn't even be called meals. <br>  <br>  If you were to lay in bed all day and do no physical exercise... <br>  <br>  Your weight (In lbs) x 11= Calories (kCal) you need in order to just exist. For a male, you would need to multiply 12. <br>   <br>  To lose 1lb=3,500 Calories (kCal). You would need to workout about 2-3 hours for every day in order to lose 5lbs per week.<br>  Anyways... I know I'm giving you extra information, but it's just in case you're curious. Mind you, that if you ever try to lose weight.. you can not spot. Meaning you can't focus on one area. When you lose weight, you lose weight all over your body.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	i admire you for wanting to do this the right way. too many girls on here think it's ok to not eat to lose weight.<br>  start out small...like running for 3 minutes, walking for 1 and continue for 30 mins.<br>  www.sparkpeople.com is a great website for weight loss and becoming active. it has many many articles that you'd want to read<br>  add me as a friend if you join...gavinsxmommy|`|Bstj2gMVaa	you should start by jogging or cycling at a pace that your comfortable with and over a distance you can manage and each week try and push yourself to go a bit further and up your pace a little bit by bit. an hour would be a good starting time.
t9Nw86Plaa	She *should* have her period at the same time she would normally be expecting her period.<br>  <br>  However, some women do bleed shortly after taking Plan B (it is a very high dose of hormones). If this happens though, she will only bleed for a short time; not for several days, like she will on her regular period.|`|cCVvrIFHaa	gender guys have periods?!  LOL|`|5cXv0NAsaa	Plan b doesn't affect the menstrual cycle, it just temporarily thickens the mucus in the uterus so that the egg doesn't attach to the wall. Usually within three days a fertilized egg will attach itself so that it may be nurtured and Plan B does it's best to prevent that. Her period will be the same and will come as expected if she took Plan B within the required time (other wise she may be pregnant). Please be careful when you use this, it's not meant to replace a condom or birth control. If you're looking  for free birth control there are usually local clinics that can supply government insurance for teenagers who need birth control.|`|WlHXOIenaa	Is your gf on oral birth control?  If yes and she forgot to take it or missed a day, then the best thing to do is to just allow her period to start and start a new pack.  <br>  <br>  It takes 7-10 days for implantation in the uterine wall and if she allows it to, her period will start in one or two days and it will never get a chance to implant.  (Indecently, this is what the abortion pill does, forces a period, which is technically a miscarriage, after implantation)<br>  <br>  Are you using condoms, foam, sponges or film?  Plan B is a large does of hormones and might delay her normal period for 1 or 2 days so please don't be alarmed.<br>  <br>  p.s. when I take more hormones that usual, it make me really horny...so don't be dumb and make the same mistake again.|`|wpsAuIuRaa	oh she will have it<br>  right after you have yours

twlqaZSmaa	if you have pain again when you urinate again and no blood, i would say get checked for an STD (symptoms of chlamydia are painful urination and discharge from the penis among other things). it doesn't hurt to get checked out just to be safe. most guys think that getting tested will be painful, but an STD check consists of peeing in a cup... pretty painless, and worth the trip to the clinic for piece of mind.<br>  <br>  since you've never had sex then no, it's not an STD. i wasn't aware of that when i posted, sorry to scare you. i would say if it hurts again just call a nurse (a lot of clinics have a ask-a-nurse hotline). make sure to tell them you are not sexually active before you tell them your symptoms...

I know from experience.  Whenever I was still in college full time, it was very stressful for me and it has caused me to be late in some months and other months, I was a little too early.  I wasn't sexually active at the time, so I knew stress was the case for me after looking it up on the internet.  If you want to be sure, check with your doctor.

hHXwgsOlaa	When I grew up I also was reluctant to show my inner self, and was always being bullied and made fun of. My answer to this is kind of weird. What I did was start watching animes like naruto and bleach. The main characters in those shows has similar, if not worse beginnings than me, as you watch you see that they make their resolve a harden it. Just be determined and be yourself, that's the most important thing. Who cares about being bullied, what can words do? It's best to go through your life determined and proud of yourself.

IFGYXPDbaa	This sort of high-volume work does very little to help your muscle(s), other than helping your "strength endurance" a bit.  It can work your slow-twitch muscle fibers (the ones that rely on oxidative metabolism).<br>  <br>  However, that's not to say that it is "bad" or useless.  This sort of training is very useful for novice weight lifters.<br>  <br>  High-rep training is very good for your tendons.  In fact, if you have a tendon injury or weakness, this is the sort of training that any physical therapist will prescribe.<br>  <br>  As a beginning weight-lifter, high-rep traning will increase the flexibility and range-of-motion in your tendons and joints, without putting undue strain on your connective tissue.<br>  <br>  I think your coach is a smart man.  You'll have plenty of time to develop raw strength, but there's no substitute for taking a bit of time at the beginning of your strength program and working on flexibility and range of motion.<br>  <br>  Check any weight-lifting discussion forum; many, many weight lifters have joint, tendon, or ligament problems.  If they had developed a solid foundation with high-rep work, before using heavy weights at low reps, they might not have the problems they suffer with today.|`|WUVGFINnaa	you will be sore but you definately need some rest inbetween these benchathons lmao at least two days to let your muscles heal|`|H2uAJoeMaa	Many weight-lifters use this kind of stuff as part of a bigger picture (periodisation) to help tendon strength and health, like the person above said. By itself, it's not going to lead to big gains in strength or size, but for a beginner, I think it's a good idea.<br>  <br>  You can't judge regression on one workout - it's a trend, not a one-off occurrence. See what your numbers are like in 2 weeks or so and then you'll be able to see if you're heading in the right direction.|`|88MByjTxaa	No your not regressing but that is harmful for your body.

K4zsztkRaa	It's normal. The color of our genitals does change a lot in our lives. Like usually durring puberty the skin get's darker.

As you age, the pigmentation in your penis varies.  Sometimes it can go from a darker colour to a lighter and only in some areas.  The inner foreskin should be pink as it is mucosal tissue and very rich in nerve endings.  If there is no irritation, then there is no problem.

WlHXOIenaa	HE WAS WRONG!  <br>  <br>  What he did was rape and you can press charges.<br>  <br>  Being forced to have sex is not your fault, but nor is it something that you should be expected to just "get over".  It is not uncommon for girls to lose their virginity before they are ready to a guy who they later find out was a jerk.  It's not uncommon, but it doesn't make it any easier.  Guys are good at lying to girls to get them into bed.  It does not make you stupid or a whore.<br>  <br>  Please get help.  You will need support and therapy to work through your feelings.  Rape victims of all ages benefit from therapy.  Listen to your body and only do what YOU want to do.  Make sure the guys you date respect your feelings.  If they can't wait for you to be ready...then they don't deserve you in the first place.|`|XsDMokYKaa	does that actually work with chicks? "if you dont have sex with me ill rape you." "ok fine ill have sex just dont rape me"<br>  <br>  you are aware that that IS rape. <br>  <br>  14 is young to lose your virginity but it doesnt mean your a bad person or a slut, like, at all.|`|98bxBr20aa	he...was wrong.|`|fomkCUCiaa	I almost hate to break it to you, but you're as wrong as he is.<br>  <br>  but you're not a whore. a whore is someone who sleeps for money, or just sleeps around with everyone she pleases. as for the way it happened, you should've got up and walked away. as for what's happening now, you've probably let it go too long. If he's threatening to rape you, just keep saying no. if he does come to rape you, call the police or get a big friend to protect you.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you're both wrong, and there's a 95% chance you're not going to get out of it easy.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	If he said that then you need to contact the police and press charges.<br>  Threatening somebody to make them have sex with you IS RAPE!!!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You shouldn't ever call yourself or think of yourself as a whore. You can't sit there and regret something that you can't change. I did that very young too and often times I wish I waited, but I am still doing it too fast with guys now and I need to stop and wait for someone better.<br>  <br>  I think he rushed you. Why would he want to force you? This guy really was awful. Of course he was wrong .He DID force you.|`|cCVvrIFHaa	wow  you didnt deserve being raped wow i would kill him if that happened to one of my friends if i knew you in rl life id srsly kill him not litteraly  but rly hurt him badd he didnt deserve the "fun of it"  he needs to go to hell and in my book i would  kick him in the balls a hundred times and then turn him  to the police|`|TQlQ6zbwaa	i lost my virginity at 14 also. to a 24 year old male. i felt the same way you did. what i can tell you from experience, is that i fell into a cycle of dating abusive men. speak up and don't let anyone take Advantage of you. you control that! it fades away with time. you learn from it. don't feel so bad, it's in the past now.|`|2jMFurDoaa	yeah he was wrong. stay away from him. if people threaten you with rape call the police.<br>  <br>  your not a whore.|`|30iqJREVaa	So all of this happened last year? Well if you regret it, don't do it till you want|`|Zg4Wfjnnaa	you weren't too young, and the first time, i guess you werent wrong, though you should have really spoken up. but he definately was. so very wrong. thats not fair.<br>  <br>  and the second time, he was so compeltely wrong. i would have hit him in the balls or bit his penis. far out. how dare he! that pretty much is rape! the bastard. stay away from him.<br>  he's so very wrong.|`|IiiDPTxlaa	He was defiantly wrong. Don't beat yourself up over this, really. :( <br>  Even if you said no, he would still go for it, so it would have done nothing. Im really sorry ot hear this :/|`|VzBAzdfwaa	he was wrong want me to beat that kids ***|`|yfoNIRRvaa	he was wrong, you should tell someone about this, he needs to be taught a lesson before he does it to someone else.|`|MGXHme6Qaa	he was wrong.  sorry that happened to u.  the same thing happens to so many girls.|`|ITCknAHVaa	Definitely he was in the wrong.  He had no  right to threaten you at all.  Dump this guy and if he threatens again report him to the police at once.  You should report him anyway as he did threaten you, with is breaking the law.<br>  <br>  We all make mistakes, you are not a whore, and give your age when you lost your virginity you can not be expected to think clearly at that age.  Just do not have sex in future unless you want it.  Do not be pressured into it, and think it through very carefully.  <br>  You have that right and you are a valuable person.  Wait or restrain and any guy that can not understand that is not worth bothering with.  Leave this guy immediately and never see him again.  Basically he used force against you or coercion.  <br>  <br>  You are not a bad person because you had sex so early, it was a decision, maybe a incorrect one, but we all make incorrect decisions all the time.<br>  <br>  Importantly do not go near this guy again!|`|mAQHyfCYaa	He was so wrong. Don't ever feel bad for agreeing to sex because you were pressured. You are not a whore. Don't ever feel bad for having sex because you though you were in love. And don't feel that you were stupid because you thought you were in love with him.<br>  <br>  You were (and are still) young and you don't necessarily have the experience to know how to deal with it. Sadly lots of girls your age do have sex because they feel like they are supposed to and are pressured.<br>  <br>  But just know he was wrong, you were not. You also ask if you were to young. In my opinion? Yes. But it matters what you think. You sound like you probably think that you were too young. Am I right?|`|pvjZEIDRaa	Oh wow! You definitely were not wrong. Forcing you to agree is still raping you! This is definitely the wrong guy! It's ok that you've had sex before, but it's still rape even if a married woman says no to her husband! I'm actually angry at this guy not even having known him. I'm 19 and still a virgin, and my boyfriend is not a virgin. I understand how you can feel pressured. My boyfriend is doing his best not to pressure me, but sometimes him not trying to is still pressure, so I can totally understand how you feel when he pulls out a condom and says that to you. Do not think you're wrong for a second! He put you in such an awful position! I would seriously suggest talking to your parents (probably mom), or at least someone you can trust that will do something about this. Guys need to understand that you will do something about it if you say no and they force. Stand up for yourself, be strong! Don't let him push you around. Having sex should be a decision that you both make together and not in the heat of the moment, especially at your age. But this is NOT your fault! Do not feel guilty, but learn from this. No guy has the right to force you to do anything you don't feel like doing. You are ALWAYS allowed to say no!! If you don't want to have sex, you don't have to...it's your choice!!<br>  <br>  If you need someone to talk to, I will be more than happy to help...or to do my best to find someone who will be of more help than me!

It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows?

I was on my back for a while and didn’t adjust my eating habits to account for a lack of activity.  Also, I found that as I got a little older weight was harder to keep off and my appetite got stronger.  Just not even paying attention I put on over 30 pounds pretty quick.  When I jumped on a scale at my friend’s house I nearly freaked.  My friend mark is a diet guy and when I say that I mean he’s always on the cutting edge of what’s the hot supplements and products so I asked him what was a good way to drop some weight and he told me about desert burn hoodia.  It sounds like a line but I got some and my hunger really just kinda vanished.  No bull!  And I can eat a horse.  That was also a problem as we get a little older we can still eat as much or more because the stomach gets stretched out when over stuffed for long periods of time when a person is overweight.  Also, we are not as active.  So eating as much or more and doing less activity it only strands to reason that you’re gonna pork up.  Anyhow, I tried the hoodia, it worked great and I lost 33 pounds. So, if you want, and I really think you should, please GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia  : you can just cut and paste So, I hope sincerely that this helps you and I hope that you lose the weight that you want.

If you're really worried visit your local clinic and ask them for details. As another word of advice, please make sure you ALWAYS have a condom, it doesn't matter if he pulls out or not, there are instances when males slightly come and don't know it.

ChlQdcAWaa	5 Days a week! 2 Hours a Day?!!!!!!!!!!! You're exercising too much... Even some people in the best shape do not exercise as much as that. Either you're not sticking to it or you are going to break down and not do anything. That is for starters!<br>  <br>  Next, your diet could use some adjustments (sorry to say--very major). Fruit, vegetables, and tea? What are you a snowman? There is no way you are getting the necessary nutrients you need. There is also no way you will be healthy or ... *ahem* lose weight with this diet. <br>  <br>  By the way, weight isn't everything... I knew a guy who was 5'5", 200 pounds and healthy as a horse--in fact he didn't have an ounce of fat on him (well besides his internal organs). Weight doesn't mean much, if ANYTHING! It is directly correlated to your BODY STRUCTURE and how much MUSCLE you have! <br>  <br>  Mini-me and Jaws... Or compare the guy who played Chewbacca in Star Wars to the guy who played R2D2 or Gollum in Lord of the Rings... Now think about how major their weight differences are... Those are the extremes... Now think about X body builder (not saying healthy, talking about size), who is 250 pounds solid muscle (say 5'10") and compare him to over a tenth of any of the General American population... Now, take someone healthy who is big, large frame (say 250 pounds) and say around 6'3" and compare him to the latter... Do you understand what I am getting at? Okay...<br>  <br>  For food, you need protein, AMINO ACIDS (the building blocks of muscle), healthy fats, saturated fat, carbs (not more than 150grams, if not less), lots of water and a quadrillion other things. Look up on here or reputable site, how to get this things, but best source is meat, fish, beans (some, if not many toxic), nuts, seeds, fruit and some veg etc... If you are a vegetarian, then eat a lot of eggs, vegetables etc... although not the best source--by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Divide your body weight (in POUNDS) by 2 and that is how much water you need in OUNCES daily minus any diuretics you are consuming. This should be clean water, preferably, okay definitely, without fluoride. So move to MOUNT EVEREST (is that clean?) or IDK some rural place far away from the city in Alaska.<br>  <br>  ***(forgive me I am indirectly quoting one of the top health (nutrition?) contributors on here and I forgot his name (tried doing a search can't find him?) Well, it is probably in some book or on some database on some website. If you post here (short answer to this question) I will give you or the source credit (about how much water you should be consuming), just trying to be polite****<br>  <br>  You have to do something you can stick to forever--well not forever, just your time on Earth.

Interesting. The study was done over 2 years with hundreds of participants. People cut calories and lost an average of 9 pounds during the whole 2 years, and 2 inches from their waist line. Cool!<br>  <br>  Exercising is really, really, really good. It's won't help you lose weight very fast because it takes a LOT of energy to burn calories. Also, while crunches and sit-ups are good for toning muscle and increasing your metabolism, they won't help you lose inches very much.<br>  <br>  As for exercises, I like crunches a lot. Also, those big bouncy balls are really fun to try to balance on without help from your arms - and they work out your abs a LOT! Best of luck.|`|C05aHvwdaa	For thousand of years, South African bushmen (known as ‘San people’) have relied on the hoodia plant during long hunting trips. By chewing on it they could fight off hunger whilst sustaining energy levels. These properties make it ideal for helping weight loss by curbing cravings and suppressing snacking. Whenever you eat, levels of ‘glucose’ (energy stored as sugar) in your body rise. This triggers a message in part of your brain to say you are full. Hoodia contains a molecule that is about 10,000 times as active as glucose. This means it can trick your brain into thinking your stomach is full - even if you skip a meal! An early hoodia trial showed a calorie reduction of up to 1,000 a day and was described as a ‘stunning success.’ Now the western world is hungry for more of this weight loss wonder. Rest assured, unlike many other Hoodia products on the market, Healthy Direct's Hoodia Gordonii 400mg is made in a factory which holds a pharmaceutical manufacturing license: this is granted by the Danish Medicines Authority (who are amongst the most exacting agencies in the EU) and has recognition throughout Europe.  Desert Burn hoodia helped me lose 33 pounds with little to no effort.  Honestly!!!
Esdm3tY9aa	IQ tests are pretty stable over time. Poor performance at one point versus another is often due to factors outside of the cognitive abilities needed to take an IQ test. Emotional problems, for example, might negatively affect your IQ. <br>  <br>  There are questions to the degree to which IQ is hereditary, and how much can be influenced by your external environment. Thus, children from poor backgrounds, usually attend inferior schools, and this has been said to impact scores on IQ tests (though by how much is debatable). However, once you are an adult, you will not likely experience any major shifts in your IQ.|`|of049X1waa	you might just not have been paying as much attnetion on the second test.  Your IQ does not change, but your score on an IQ test CAN change, depending on how focused you are, how good you were at guessing, or how much attention you are giving to the test.|`|VZkN4tHiaa	For one, IQ tests are not exact. They just measure your ability to take that particular test. IQ is a hazy concept and only measures certain aspects of intelligence. The number you get can vary widely from test to test (I've gotten results from around 118 to over 160).<br>  <br>  I believe that your thinking capacity could fluctuate, even if the conditions are fairly similar. Your brain chemistry could be a little different from day to day (depending on what you eat and other bodily states). A different mood may affect how you test. Your mind could be preoccupied and make it harder to think, even if it's something simple like feeling cold. You may be alert or sleepy. You may be stressed or calm.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just work hard and be passionate about whatever you're into, whether it's academics, being funny, music, or being a good friend.

pTNAgU5uaa	The major lipids in serum (cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipid) are transported in the form of lipoproteins. <br>  <br>  Two major lipoproteins are HDL (high density lipoprotein) and LDL (low density lipoprotein). <br>  <br>  LDL is the major cholesterol carrying particle in plasma. LDL provides cholesterol, an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor of steroid hormones. LDL is also the main lipoprotein involved in atherogenesis as it carries cholesterol to the cells and is more likely to deposit it the arterial walls causing artherosclerosis, hence is regarded as the bad cholesterol.<br>  <br>  HDL transports cholesterol from the peripheral tissues to the liver for it be broken down and plays a major role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the body. This is regarded as the good cholesterol.<br>  <br>  For more information please see the links below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugs.com/cholesterol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/cholesterol.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugs.com/cholesterol-risk-factors.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/cholesterol-risk-fa...</a>|`|JV0i77uiaa	HDL is the good one<br>  <br>  LDL is the bad one
cplaV2KWaa	No. You are safe. Gangrene is the degeneration of dead flesh caused by decrease or lack of blood to the tissue in question. Often associated with diabetes because a result of diabetes is decrease of blood flow to the peripheral body parts, ie: legs and feet. A wound or sore is caused very easily because of the thinning of the skin layer and the lack of blood flow seriously hinders healing. Therefore the wound may become infected with gangrene. You won,t get gangrene from proximity. The stench of rotting flesh may make you think of infection, but you are safe.|`|KkvyQLvfaa	This is the death of the skin, necrosis.  This comes from a puncturee in the skin and the body's inability to heal itself.  Like, in diabetes, the blood is thicker and has trouble getting to the feet, for example.  Blood carries oxygen to the feet.  No blood to the feet=no oxygen to the feet=death of the skin.|`|NkA872tQaa	No

It is a scary word and i understand that but that is what happened to me. It itched, i was bleeding not a lot but every time i used the restroom there was blood in the toilet and on the toilet paper. It itches really bad and burns when you use the rest room. I hate to tell you that but i would go get tested, it will go away, if it is chlamydia you will need to take two pills and get a shot. After you do take the pills it will be about 24 hours and then the burning and itching will go away. You may test positive for a few months after but do be careful with what you do. I would let the guy you had sex with  with know that you are feeling like this and maybe both of you can go to the doc together. <br>  It is a very scary thing. He may freak out when you tell him (mine did) but just let him know that you don't know what it is but you want to go just to be safe. <br>  As far as your parents go, I would see if a friend can't take you, It will require you to ditch one day of school but that is possible.....

FygMdfN6aa	Thats the same as me , go to your chemist and ask for "pan oxly", use this right before you go to bed and apply to acne areas, also invest in some "bio oil" its a great moisturizer and clears up acne scars, stretch marks and all sorts its great!, it wont make your acne worse either. my regieme is wash your face with a soft cleanser to get rid of all dirt make-up etc (Wash gently) then pat dry with towel, apply pan oxly (2.5) to your acne areas and go to sleep, in the morning moisturise with bio oil as this will get rid of any dry skin the pan oxly has caused. use bio oil when ever you feel like, you cant overdose it just makes your skin beautiful :) it is quite pricey though but worth it! i havn't been doing this for long and i can already see a difference on my skin i think we've just got to carry on doing it religiously and you'll see a difference definatley.|`|u8CJFHPcaa	dont touch it too often, and use something. <br>  I have used this, you can try<br>  but it works slowly

which is caused by the lack of omega 3 fatty acids in your brain.A deficiency that most of the humans on this planet have.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mind you that you will never read this in most of the articles written by the main stream so called doctors because it goes against their interests and the interests of the corporations that finance them to seel their poison under the desguise of a cure.<br>  <br>  <br>  Omega 3 fatty acids raise your serotonin levels.The more you have the better you feel among many other benefits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Start the omega 3 diet.I have researched omega 3 acids for 2 years and performed a very successful experiment on myself and few of my volunteer friends.Few months of the omega 3 diet it significantly reduced stress[and/or cured depression]

<br>  Take two table spoons of grinded flaxseed[rich with omega 3 and cheap]a day[with a glass of water] and in a few months you will start to notice significant improvement in your mental health[you will become more psychologically stable,among other things].Use a coffee grinder.Whole seeds cannot be digested by the hydrochloric acid in our stomach only grinded seeds.A fact and not a assumption.There are many articles on the internet about the omega 3 fatty acids.<br>  <br>  Flax is the best source of ALA omega 3 fatty acid which our body converts to more important fatty acids called DHA and EPA.For the efficient conversion to take place,foods containing a large amount of the following nutrients must be consumed along with the flaxseed:C,B3,B6 [vitamins],zink and Magnesium [minerals].I recommend 3 table spoons of flax with 100 grams[or more if to your liking] of almonds and/or 250g of green peas,1 kiwi every day.[do not take more then 3 table spoons of flax because large amounts can cause intestinal gases which can cause abdominal pain and/or constipation.If three spoons causes abdominal discomfort lower the dosage to 2 table spoons of grinded flax and elevate it to 3 table spoons after your body adapts to high fiber content].<br>  <br>  The information in the following link should provide you with the nutritional facts of most if not all known fruits and <br>  <br>  vegetables:<a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritiondata.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you are consistent with this diet you will gain permanent emotional stability and you will realize your unlimited potential because your brain will receive what it needs to continue its evolution.<br>  <br>  There is another way to gain emotional stability.By eating Cocoa rich chocolate.Lindt exellence is one of the best sources of cocoa you can find in a store.Cococa is a natural substance and contains natural substances that create a feeling of pleasure in the human brain.By doing this it reduces pain,anxiety,depression,anger or stress.It only takes a small amount to experience these effects which last for most of the day if not the entire day depending on the amount taken.A warning.Too much of anything can kill you.Even too much cocoa.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cocoa rich chocolate.Cocoa contains natural substances that reduce stress and pain and create a feeling of pleasure in your brain and increase your brain activity.How long effects last depends on how much you consume.Only a few pieces of high cocoa chocolate reduces your pain,anxiety or stress for most if not all day.Lindt exellence is my recomendation.The best chocolate you can buy and affordable to most people.You can find it in any store with large selection of items.The applications of cocoa are very wide ranging from consuming it before a dentist appointment to reduce pain and fear from the drill.It is very effective.<br>  <br>  <a

Are you a christian? believe in god? <br>  <br>  Reason i ask is because it kinda sounds like a spiritual problem. naw i'm not saying you need to have a pastor pray over you or anything ... just something to think about since it only happens on sunday. send me a message if u want any other thoughts on that.<br>  <br>  My other thought is have you had something bad happen to you in the past that happened on sunday. Something like that could be causing you to get scared and have the depression. <br>  <br>  have you ever taken any meds for depression? They do really help once you find the right one for your body. They add certain chemicals into your brain that you're missing. Normally, people get depression because of a drastic event that happened and the body stops producing the right chemicals that the brain needs. So anti-depression meds add those chemicals back into the brain and then the body starts to product the chemicals again. Anti-depression meds are like jump starting a car. It gives the extra power to charge the battery. =) hope that might help|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Whoa. Do not see a doctor for "treatment". There is nothing wrong with you. Perhaps your activities over fun weekends leave you depleted of the things your mind needs to be happy. If you party a lot or a little, consider taking it easy on yourself. Every sunday during the day, stand outside in the sunshine with minimal clothing on for a good ten minutes, soak up the rays, and generate a bunch of serotonin for your brain to feel happy and sleep well. Eat basil, turkey, stuff with tryptophans in it during the evening, to calm your mind down and ease you into a happy sleep. Skip the shrinks who encourage you to delve into the "feelings" so they can keep you there and get your repeat business. Consider that a "professional" is a business man. I'm not though!

Thus, you should be able to do these:<br>  Tell your family about your situation and feelings about this(if they are still unaware) They would most likely console and try to help you. If you still don't feel better, you can try doing the same for close friends or a teacher. If it still does not help, you could try to visit a psychiatrist or psychologist or a counsellor and talk to them and, you know, get some medication. You could also try asking yourself why this happens. If you can find the problem, find the solution and voila! YOU'RE CURED!  Good luck and get well soon. =D|`|dOF8utrsaa	You need to see a doctor to get treatment. Anti-depressants help immensely. I am on them myself.

AA12266052	Conduct urinalysis test. If glucose is detected in the urine, then you have diabetes. Glucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed. A glucose test is a type of blood test used to determine the amount of glucose in the blood.<br>  Drink 15 glasses of water daily.|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Not enough symptoms to really tell. But here are the symptoms for Type 1 and Type 2 .<br>  <br>  Diabetes Type 1:        Symtoms of type 2 <br>  <br>  In type 1, the pancreas stop producing insulin, due to autuimmune response or possibly viral attack on pancreas. In absence of insulin, body cells does not get glucose for producing ATP (Adenosin Triphosphate) units which results into primary symptom in the form of nausea and vomiting. In latter stage which leads to ketoacidosis in which body starts breaking down muscle tissue and fat for energy, there is consequently fast weight loss. Dehydration is also usually observed due to electrolyte disturbance. In advance stages even coma and death, are being witnessed.<br>  <br>  Diabetes Type 2:<br>  <br>  * Increased fatigue : Due to inefficiency of cell to metabolise glucose, reserve fat of body is metabolised to gain energy. When fat is broken down in the body, it uses more energy as compared to glucose, hence body goes in negative calorie effect, which results in fatigue.<br>  * Polydipsia : As the concentration of glucose increases in the blood, brain receives signal for diluting it and in its counteraction we feel thirsty.<br>  * Polyuria: Increase in urine production is the result seen when excess of glucose is present in body. Body tries to get rid of the extra sugar in the blood by excreting it through the urine. This can also lead to dehydration because excreting the sugar which carries a large amount of water out of the body along with it.<br>  * Polyphegia : The hormone insulin is also responsible for stimulating hunger. In order to cope up with high sugar levels in blood, body produces insulin which leads to increased hunger.<br>  * Weight flactuation : Factors like loss of water (polyuria), glucosuria , metabolism of body fat and protein may lead to loss of weight. Few cases may show weight gain due to increased appetite.<br>  * Blurry vision : Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia nonketotic syndrome is the condition when body fluid is pulled out of tissues including lenses of eye, which affects the ability of lenses to focus resulting in blurry vision.<br>  * Irritability : It is one of the sign of high blood sugar because of the inefficient supply of glucose to brain and other body organs, which makes us feel tired and uneasy.<br>  * Infections : Certain signals from the body is given whenever there is fluctuation of blood sugar (due to suppression of immune system) by frequent infections of fungal or bacterial like skin infection or UTI (urinary tract infection).<br>  * Poor wound healing : High blood sugar resists the flourishing of WBC, (white blood cell) which are responsible for body immune system. When these cells do not function accordingly, wound healing is not at good pace. Secondly, long standing diabetes leads to thickening of blood vessels which may affect proper circulation of blood in different body parts.<br>  <br>  And yes you are at risk for diabetes. A low Glycemic diet is in order, plus 30 minutes of exercise a day may keep diabetes away from your door. Good luck and lets hope , Diabetes is a terrible disease!<br>  History of Diabetes in the family is really a good warning to take care of yourself. Do it, my friend...|`|HxXduL1maa	The most consistent symptom of diabetes mellitus (Type I and II) is elevated blood sugar levels. In Type I (insulin dependent / early onset) diabetes, this is caused by the body not producing enough insulin to properly regulate blood sugar. In Type II (non insulin dependent/adult onset) diabetes, it is caused by the body developing resistance to insulin, so it cannot properly use what it produces.<br>  <br>  However, high blood sugar is not something you can see in the mirror at home, so it is useful to know the side-effects of high blood sugar, which are commonly recognized as the noticeable symptoms of diabetes.<br>  <br>  If you find yourself experiencing many of these diabetes symptoms on a consistent, long term basis, you should visit a doctor to be tested for diabetes. Ignoring (or not recognizing) the symptoms of diabetes can lead to long-term serious health risks and complications from untreated diabetes. Some of the common 'early warning' signs of diabetes are:<br>  The first symptom of diabetes is often excessive thirst (unrelated to exercise, hot weather, or short-term illness) <br>  Excessive hunger (you know you've eaten "enough" but are still hungry all the time) <br>  Frequent urination (often noticed because you must wake up repeatedly during the night) <br>  Tiredness and fatigue (possibly severe enough to make you fall asleep unexpectedly after meals), one of the most common symptoms of diabetes. <br>  Rapid and/or sudden weight loss (any dramatic change in weight is a sign to visit a doctor) <br>  While many of the signs and symptoms of diabetes can also be related to other causes, testing for diabetes is very easy, and the constant/regular presence of one or more of these symptoms over an extended period of time should be cause for a visit to the doctor.<br>  <br>  If diabetes is suspected, tested for, and diagnosed when those symptoms first start appearing, other more serious symptoms of advanced diabetes can often be prevented or have their onset significantly delayed through diet, exercise and proper blood sugar management. <br>  However, often the 'minor' symptoms of diabetes go unrecognized, and physical and neurological problems may arise, resulting in some <br>  of the following symptoms: <br>  Blurred vision (diabetes can lead to macular degeneration and eventual blindness) <br>  Numbness and/or tingling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy, a symptom of diabetes, causes nerve damage in the extremities) <br>  Slow healing of minor scratches and wounds (diabetes often leads to impaired immune system function) <br>  Recurrent or hard-to-treat yeast infections in women (another sign of impaired immune function) <br>  Dry or itchy skin (peripheral neuropathy also affects circulation and proper sweat gland function) <br>  If you are experiencing any of these symptoms on a regular basis, or you recognize these symptoms in a child or relative, they may be signs of untreated diabetes. A doctor's appointment should be made as soon as possible, so the individual experiencing the symptoms can -- if diabetes is diagnosed -- take the steps needed to prevent more serious health problems.<br>  <br>  It can also be heriditary.|`|wvDh3PdFaa	yes you are manifesting symptoms of diabetes mellitus . but to make sure that its a really a case of diabetes an endocrinologist must be consulted..especially so that it runs in your family|`|9TyEDcRzaa	diabetes --mother to son is genetic ---best way of assessing the diabetes is only by blood test ---not by all you said|`|6URBv5xfaa	get yourself checked as diabetes tends to be hereditary|`|pMUXcuWVaa	Dear friend<br>  Smell of urine can be in any infections also, but if there is diabetic history in your family as you have mentioned and other criteria which you can see from here <a href="http://dr-healthguide.blogspot.com/2008/12/how-to-know-that-i-am-diabetic.html" rel="nofollow">http://dr-healthguide.blogspot.com/2008/...</a> is present, then I must say to take it seriously as it might be a serious complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis and the smell may be of ketones which is sweetish smell.

Sometimes with bacterial infections (like mono), you may or may not notice extra symptoms, but the spleen is doing some crazy work, and if you move around exercising too much, it can put a strain on the spleen, possibly even rupture it. I almost never say see a doctor, but if it is truly swollen and painful in that area, I'd go to the ER.

I went for a week and realized they basically tell you to recognize what you are eating.<br>  Make sure you are realistic with yourself when you log what you eat, dont cut out anything, not soda or juice or milk, because all are really high in calorie and content. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to try something similar to weight watchers this is how I started:<br>  (this is how to calculate number of points you get a day) answer the following questions:<br>  Are you: Male (8 pts) Female (2 pts) nursing (10 pts)<br>  How old are you? 17-26 (4 pts) 27-37 (3 pts) 38-47 (2 pts) 48-58 (1 pt) older than 58 (0 pts)<br>  take 10% of your weight or the first 2 numbers in your weight: (example I weighed 174 when i started, so I added 17 pts)<br>  How tall are you? under 5'1= 0, 5'1"-5'10"=1, more = 2<br>  your excersize level: If you work out often or your job is labor add up to 6 pts, if you sit most of the day like in an office you get 0 pts..<br>  For future reference if you know the fiber content, calories and grams of fat you can get a generalized number of points at this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.webmilhouse.com/pointcalc.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmilhouse.com/pointcalc.php</a><br>  Foods like fruits and veggies are 0 pts so you can have as many as you want. (whoops sorry, I saw that someone said they arent... a majority are though like carrots, apples, celery, etc. its easy to find the ones that are.)<br>  also you get an extra 35 pts a day.<br>  You will be so shocked to see how many points you actually eat a day, I am now restricted to 23 pts and i realize i eat alot more.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. if you have difficulties figuring out how many points your food was, google it!  Google WW points_____ (like WW points ceasar salad)<br>  They will give you a generalized idea... try and take the highest number so you dont go over!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long, I hope it helps|`|qUr5P7hgaa	LP is spam just fyi <br>  <br>  You may not be eating enough calories, especially if you are working out...You need to eat the right amount of calories for your weight and reduce them as you lose. You are getting a good start by eating your fruit and whole grains and proteins, and veggies.. also add in some olive oil, Milk (preferably Non fat) non fat yogurt, string cheese... and all your calories should come from things of this nature.... Not from cookies and cakes and things like that..even if they are low in fat or low in calories..You should also eat a  lot of fiber or take a fiber supplement to keep things moving in your digestive track. And just so you know..drinking water will help flush out your salt intake and help get things moving in your digestive track but it won't make you lose weight....It really easy to cut the fat if you are motivated and it sounds like you are..Just stick to the basics, whole wheat, LEAN protein, veggies, fruits, dairy (non fat) and the fiber..Things with more fiber the better. Do you have weight watchers where you live? I have lost 25 pounds in two months on weight watchers....<br>  <br>  Also cardio and weight training really help..The more muscle you have the more calories you burn....And get a pedometer and walk 10,000 steps a day!!! Good luck!!!!|`|7swefA6Paa	just build muscle. or do cardio, that burns hella calories. when you restrict your food, your body adjust to that amount and your metabolism lowers.|`|zSkC7hsGaa	Add a little weight training and cardio exercise. Sometimes just dieting isn't enough to get the weight to start coming off. Don't give up persistence always wins, it just takes a little longer than we had hoped,
ArtZzDU8aa	I think you should concentrate on trying to solve the problem instead of trying to finding a woman who is alright with being sexually unfulfilled.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	It depends on the woman you would want to marry.  And more than all, it depends upon you.  Will you change your life style?  You know what?  The latest report says that man who drinks and smokes too much has a very low libido and sexual organ tends to decrease in size.  Are you one of them?  Do you treat your woman with respect and dignity?  Do you give her the respect she is due?  As a rule, if you treat your woman as a queen, she sill treat you as a king!  Your problem with pre mature ejaculation is much more of a physchological problem than physical problem.  If you are a real man with strong will <br>  and determination, your problem an be easily solve, by you - not by others.|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	I don't see why you couldn't marry and start a family. Quit the drinking till drunk thing, that's probably why your previous ladies left you, if you were doing it back then too. How about find and date a good respectable lady and don't have sex with her till you get married. She'll marry you for you, and then it won't matter about the pre-mature ejaculation thing. And besides, the pre-mature ejaculation will get better with practice and with being in a comfortable secure relationship. The premature stuff is nothing but nerves! Please don't try to convince yourself that being 40 makes it too late for this. I'm thinking you don't tell yourself that already, or you wouldn't be talking about starting a family, but I wanted to say that just in case.|`|RM9I8hwTaa	i believe that you should try and find a third lady because unless you try you won't know. those other 2 woman were probably not right for you.<br>  im positive that you will eventually find someone because your only 40 and life isn't over.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	keep at it man. if they don't wanna stay with u cuz of that, then to hell with them. but u should consult ur urologist about it, he can help u out. but there is an old-fashioned, time-tested remedy.MASTURBATE!!!|`|SszbjMtLaa	Theres many new technologies to fix premature ejaculation, its not even a problem anymore|`|AA12108445	I would see your MD or Urologist.

Both males and females of all ethnic backgrounds are affected by von Hippel-Lindau disease. It is estimated to occur in 1 individual per 36,000 people. The average age at diagnosis is 26 years. The VHL Family Alliance video shows you some of the people living with this disease and makes a great point: 1 in 10 Americans has a rare disease, so rare disease is not rare! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Rosai Dorfman<br>  Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder characterized by over-production and accumulation of histiocytes in the lymph nodes of the body.  It most often affects the lymph nodes of the neck (cervical lymphadenopathy). In some cases, abnormal accumulation of histiocytes may occur in other areas of the body besides the lymph nodes (extranodal). These areas include the skin, central nervous system, kidneys, and digestive tract. The symptoms and physical findings associated with Rosai-Dorfman disease vary depending upon the specific areas of the body that are affected. The exact cause of Rosai-Dorfman disease is unknown.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The above is an abstract of a report from the National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc. ? (NORD). A copy of the complete report can be obtained for a small fee by visiting the NORD website. The complete report contains additional information including symptoms, causes, affected population, related disorders, standard and investigational treatments (if available), and references from medical literature.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Comments (0)Permalink<br>  Rare Disease Day video: Faces of Rare Disease<br>  Friday February 27, 2009<br>  This beautiful video features a collection of patients living with rare disease who participated in the Eurordis 2008 Photo Contest.

As you might guess, there are some diseases that only affect small numbers of individuals in the world. And there are some diseases that are truly one-of-a-kind, usually happening because of a genetic defect. Some diseases are widespread in certain parts of the world but rare in others. It is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 known rare diseases in the world.|`|3NVWerakaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJLG85gn0bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJLG85gn0...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  check this out.....its weird
cc3de441467bd3591cbacd40337caeccaa	allow 3-5 days rest between working the same muscle groups, it seems like a long time but that's the time the tissue is actually building and regrowing. and of course take in lots of protein and amino acids esp. right after workouts 25-40 grams. these are the building blocks of muscles, you have to get lots of these. the average person does not take in enough of either on a daily basis to support heavy muscle growth. 6 small meals a day 3 should be protein shakes. also try to do slow controlled reps, this is important! it adds intensity to your workout and makes for more efficient use of your time. oh god i could go on forever.<br>  <br>  everybody (with experience) has their own routine or strategy for the best way to build muscle. i suggest you do some research and figure out what works best for you. me personally, i love going to the gym and ripping my muscles to shreds, i rep to absolute failure. use weights that you can only do 8-10 reps with. bring a friend and have him spot you doing things like curls so he can help you squeeeezzzee out those last 2 or 3 reps. once you cant lift those weights anymore right away grab some lighter weights till you cant rep those anymore. you have to rip up your muscles and provide your body plenty of protein and rest to repair. if you work the same muscle groups every day or every other day you're just re-ripping them, not allowing them to grow and recover.<br>  <br>  a GREAT place to start your research is <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.h...</a> there's TONS of very useful articles here.<br>  <br>  one of the strange phenomenons in the gym is what i call the placebo effect... sorta... when you're repping and you cant squeez out that last one have your buddy just place his hands under the bar and make it look like he's helping you lift without actually lifting. somehow magically you can do 2 or 3 more reps with their "assistance"<br>  <br>  pick 2 muscle groups and and alternate between the two, going to failure on one should allow you enough time to work the other. then alternate. drink lots of water! and rest well.<br>  <br>  basically if ur trying to put on muscle weight u need protein to build the muscles and carbs to give you the energy to work out. take multivitamins!<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  as for what matt said, creatine is not like protein powder, they do completely different things. creatine also has to be drank more frequently. creatine is a chemical produced naturally in the body, it helps the muscles recover. using the creatine supplement puts more creatine in your body to help your muscles recover faster so you can work out more frequently. it should be taken with protein powder, not replacing protein powder.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	go buy some creatine powder. its like protein, only way more potent. if u do what u say u do in the gym while using creatine, then u should get a lot more muscle mass on you very quick. <br>  <br>  PS: make sure u read the bottle. make sure u take what it says, too much can make u puke. when i used creatine, i found that the best drink to mix it with was apple juice. not only does apple juice mask the taste of the creatine, it also has sugar in it that will give u some natural energy in the gym.|`|yHLpTiK4aa	You have to take a weight gainer protein shake with full cream milk so u can put on some weight first and while u do weights it will tranfer ur fat (its good fat but) into muscle then when ur at the size u like change ur protein shake to a muscle protein shake.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	If you are trying to get muscle, then don't spend time doing cardio too much.  Focus more on weight-lifting.  Do cardio about once a week.  Eat lots nutritious food.  Heavy weights and low reps.|`|Bu0TSiaKaa	do high rep 15-20 and low weight to tone muscles.|`|kjEoHmKjaa	exercise more
is132TSYaa	Once you reach the puberty stage it is perfectly normal to get these around 80% of adolescent teenagers do.<br>  <br>  Basically what it is , is the build up of natural oils blocking the hair folicles. causing a slight white spot usually about 1-3mm in size.<br>  <br>  They can get worse if your hygiene is not good, however, with plenty of soap and water and daily cleaning they should eventually disappear.<br>  <br>  And whatever you do . DO NOT PRESS THEM. it can cause an inflammation and may even cause them to spread.<br>  <br>  hope this helps ;)

Those who do experience outbreaks find that topical medication as Zovirax ointment eases the pain and can help speed recovery when blisters appear.<br>  For maximum benefit during recurrences, start therapy as soon as the tingling, burning, or itching begins, or as soon as you notice blisters.
2jMFurDoaa	just be relaxed. <br>  use lots of lubricant since it has no natural lubrication like the vagina.<br>  <br>  it can be pleasurable but it can also really hurt if you are tense or not turned on or he moves to fast or goes in to far.|`|3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Honestly? My wife and I have been together for over 16 years....We never tried or even talked about anal sex,well...one night after a bit of hardcore drinking,it just happened....WOW!!!! she woke up the next morning and insisted that we try it again.....Now,neither one of us ask for it,it just happens....The natural fluids leak from her vagina when she thinks about it now...What a turn-on..Such a wonderful wake up call of a almost boring sexual relationship.|`|tpC9IOADaa	You anus is a very tight muscle. When relaxed, and you are sexually turned on, it also relaxes, and anal can be pleasurable. However, if you are really nervous, and the idea doesnt appeal to you, it will hurt.<br>  <br>  Take it slow, use lubrication, and stop if it hurts. you can do some damage if you continue when it really hurts.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|7Wb0bazTaa	AIf its your first time it will  feel likeyou need to poo (no joke) then it may hurt abit, but after the first time you do it it feelsbetter then normal sex is what ive been told.|`|W380tuKiaa	Try slow dilation with 1 finger then 2 see it it's for you if yes then try larger objects,  Lots of lubrication and go slow.  it feels good because there is a nerve up there that makes your heart race when you hit it.|`|jF94WiDnaa	If you TRY this you will CRY.  Anal intercourse needs somethings to do before penetration. I mean lubrication of anus for relaxation of muscles. After lubrication slow one finger/dildo ******* & then two finger *******. And then Tool should be lubricated. This whole process will make you absolutely ready for anal intercourse. If you act upon my advice, then you will only ENJOY not CRY.|`|jDflHYOzaa	Yes. its going to take a while before your body gets used to it because its not really meant for sex. But once your body gets use it. When my husband and I first started we went to a sex shop 3 towns away and asked one of the workers. He found this great kit it came with 3 butt plugs. one was 1/2 inch diameter the second was and 1 inch and the third 1 1/2 inches in diameter and he also gave us this lube. I cannot remember the name I'm so sorry but the thicker the lube the better it is. So if you decide to go to the sex shop ask for the thickest lube. If you decided to start out with the butt plugs let your body get used to them and then when you decide your ready tell you boyfriend GO SLOW and EASY the second your uncomfortable tell him to stop to let your body get used to him. After like 7-10 times of trying you'll be used to the idea and you'll know whats going to happen and you'll be able to enjoy it more. P.S. when I'm on top of him and its anal I have the most intense orgasm ever... something to keep in mind. Hope it helps|`|d0809bbf69d53789db51501585e6d1d8aa	I would also have him do some reading--and the erotic kind, not the medical--before you try it in bed. The more familiar he feels with helping you prepare, the less nervous he'll be during the act, and the less chance he'll have of hurting you. There will be a little post-soreness, but if there's enough preparation, you'll only feel a burning stretching sensation during the act. <br>  <br>  I recommend: if you're a pretty open couple, spend a night browsing through adultfanfiction.com. Pick out stories inspired by movies you're both familiar with and read some smut to each other. Some of the fiction is terrible, some is over the top, but some is very titillating, and good sources of material.|`|Lgc9SGfkaa	This website is about quality when using condoms for men and women does nay.you line or click the ad to learn add.I Thank you very much.<br>  <a href="http://condom-enzin.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://condom-enzin.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://medicinenet-enzin.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://medicinenet-enzin.blogspot.com/</a>|`|x1qKGmzSaa	i havent done it. but my freind said "it" slipped in once during sex, and she said it was the worst pain she had EVER felt...
AA11055270	IzzieB got it.  Mixing cardio with weights.  The goal is to strength train slightly, but more importantly get your heart going as long as possible at a decent rate.  Sandwich your workout - cardio, weights, then cardio again.<br>  <br>  Isometric exercises - push ups, sit-ups, etc. are always a decent mix of the two and usually require the whole body. Look for duration and not intensity when performing weights.  Know your max weight, then work at about 60%.  You won't be building muscle, but toning and burning fat moreover.  It might look goofy for a huge dude using a 8# weight for exercise, but it's not a sprint, it's a marathon.|`|1Txef261aa	Diet, weights and cardio.  <br>  <br>  Start weight training<br>  for example<br>  Monday  back and calves<br>  Tuesday chest <br>  Wednesday legs<br>  Thursday biceps and triceps<br>  Friday Shoulder<br>  <br>  Do abs every second day<br>  <br>  Cardio go for a walk every afternoon or early morning<br>  <br>  As of diet use balance as a tool.  Protein lean beef, chicken, turkey, fish.  Carbohydrates rice, potatoes, green beans and brocolli.  Fat by the oils used in cooking olive oil.  Have one reasonable cheat meal a week.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	To tighten abs, get an exercise ball and do sit ups. When you learn how to balance on it, it's the best exercise for the abs.
H2uAJoeMaa	Is soreness your goal? DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) has very little to do with the effectiveness of a workout.<br>  <br>  What are your goals?<br>  <br>  If you're after strength, then chart strength increases for the major exercises (squat, dead lift, overhead press, bench press) and, as long as they are all improving, you are on track.<br>  <br>  If you're after size, check the scales/mirror every week or so. Again, only adjust if you stop gaining, or start gaining too much fat for your liking.<br>  <br>  Soreness isn't an indicator of anything useful.|`|zSkC7hsGaa	Usually the soreness hits the 2nd day after your workout. cycling wouldn't make much difference a lot of people do cardio after lifting.<br>   I would say you were lifting to light of weights. In any exercise the weight you use should feel impossible to lift on your last rep..lift to muscle failure. If your friend is reallyy experienced he'll know what I mean. And you should also spot each other in case of failure.|`|Fg8ULUt2aa	i think u are doing your workout perfectly there is nothing to get wore  if u get sweating it self that mean u are working hard may be y should be a strong person or a spots men like that so your body can control the pain ........hai if you do workout properly u will feel fresh not sore....
qUr5P7hgaa	You should aim for at least 4 days per week. If you can't do four days then you should work out three days at the least. It is important to get your cardio in but it is also important to lift weight and build lean muscle mass (don't worry you will not bulk up) because the more muscle you have the more calories your body burns... So for instance <br>  Monday: 30 minutes running or on the elliptical and then work your upper body with weights<br>  Tuesday:  you can go and just do cardio or don't go at all, if you choose cardio do at least 45 minutes to an hour. <br>  Wednesday: 30 minutes or cardio and then work your lower body<br>  Thursday: Cardio 45-1 if you wish or break.<br>  Friday: If you have circuit at a local gym this would be perfect for friday but if not go in and do the upper body again and your 30 minute cardio...<br>   saturday and sunday would be great days to take a long walk with a dog or friend or take a hike, go swimming things of that nature...<br>  <br>  If you follow this and a healthy diet you should be losing weight in no time...<br>  <br>  Remember: working out is 10 percent of your weight loss the other 90 percent is nutrition and what you eat!!! <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|34c2a39509c3bdd737d232c8b0aba78baa	30mins to 1 hr. <br>  3-4 times a week.|`|fwpu4jL3aa	Experts recommend that you accumulate one hour of physical activity every day to stay healthy or improve our health. Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.<br>  <br>  The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise.

Your spelling is very poor. I really have a hard time taking these questions seriously when you can't even spell the important words correctly. This tells me that you don't take your so called "problems" seriously. I can't tell if you're being serious or just another smart *** posting fake questions.<br>  <br>  So if you do really have IBS, exactly what "pills" have you been put on? Don't you think this is slightly important information? And don't you think that any important medical information should be provided if you actually expect to receive an intelligent response?<br>  <br>  And don't you mean Gall Bladder and Spleen? And exactly what DID your dad go through? We don't have any idea as to what that means. Some problems are genetic, meaning they're passed from one generation to the next.<br>  <br>  Please be more specific. Medical help is not a guessing game. We need some intelligent, objective, and more subjective information if you are expecting to receive an intelligent response.
Z12yoRu2aa	i sent you an email x|`|S5HQP65Eaa	Thinking people say things things about you is a sign of being self concious. Write down things you love about yourself.<br>  <br>  Thinking negative is having a bad outlook on life. Write down your experiences in life that have caused you to be a negative individual and find creative ways you can turn negativity into positve things. Like art maybe.<br>  <br>  Thinking you destroy every relationship could be a sign of having trouble with past relationships and not being able to carry on a new one. Try working out the relationships you believe you've destoryed maybe by explaining your situation.<br>  <br>  Feeling guilty could be that someone else did something to you and you blame yourself for it this could affect all of the above. Or you've done something and haven't been able to forgive yourself for it. Whatever it may be forgive yourself or forgive someone else because It's not helping you to carry around guilt. <br>  <br>  I really don't know much about your situation, but maybe some soul searching can get to the core of your issues. Hope you find goodness within yourself and can be a productive happy spirit.|`|U1X7Qtqvaa	I advice you see a doctor.

He will listen to you if you listen to Him.|`|QBFbvO21aa	smoke a fatty.<br>  Im sorry...ok thumbs down...|`|KwheCx4Aaa	take a pen and a paper write down all the good things that happened today. Like "woke up in a warm bed" "took a nice long hot shower" "had a big satisfying breakfast" "laughed at a something super funny on t.v." "got a big smile from the neighbor today" anything! nothing's too small. focus on these things. when you start to feel a little better. do the same thing for the whole week. If negative memories creep up thing of how small it REALLY was. when you think negative it's likely that you may perceive small doubts as HUGE problems that you MUST think about. Sometimes we're trying to "figure it out" but that backfires when you realize you didn't benefits from any of it, and you still can not be absolutely certain of what you attempted to figure out. <br>  if it sounds "crazy" maybe it is, but trust me it is not something you have to identify with. for example "I don't like how that person just looked at me, they must be thinking something bad about me...." you do not have to adhere to such thoughts. when you do you immediately try to "fix it" or "figure it all out" so you can fix it.when you do that you have (unknowingly) already accepted it as true. So don't let your mind get ahead of you. You cannot control you mind 100% of the time, but you can choose what you dwell on. dwell on the good things. The more you live in the moment the easier it is to let things go.......it doesn't matter how many times you have to put the same issue or thought out of your mind as long as you keep living in the moment it won't be long before you make it a habit, and soon it will be less of an effort and will come natural, THEN one day you'll find yourself smiling for no reason other than you've been having positive thoughts all day!<br>  and hey you are not losing your mind. everybody feels they have thoughts or thought patterns, or habits they can't control at some point or another. You don't have to feel guilty. You are NOT the sum of your thoughts. There is more to you than you're thoughts.

Throw spinach in the mix and mmhmm.... it's good for you and your muscles too.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Beefcake.|`|4iaAfQQeaa	Hi Angus,<br>  <br>  The first thing in muscle gain you need to know is you need amino acid rich foods, one of which is the humble egg. And, its been a common belief that you can OD on eggs I say this to that RUBBISH you can have as many eggs as you want! Also red meat is another good source of protein however, the most potent is fish. Take a good protein supplement too balance muscle technology has a good one which I use. Also what I recommend is green leafy vegetables the best one is spinach broccoli and have a variety of foods it keeps you healthy.<br>  <br>  Also for real gains you will need to eat tons and lift heavy and really work hard! Get a workout bud and hit the gym at least 5 times a week and work one muscle group to failure. And mix it up with cardio that will help with general fitness.      <br>  <br>  And one final thing treat fitness as a game something you enjoy you will say in it for the long run! <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|Fg8ULUt2aa	boiled ege <br>  fish<br>  so ya<br>  ground nut  (Buffy)<br>  milk<br>  but this will all work if you do regular and correct workout at perfect way|`|1Txef261aa	Tuna salad|`|aH1mUOyTaa	chicken,fish|`|gookp8AWaa	Tuna or white chicken on whole wheat bread with fat free mayo.<br>  <br>  Throw some lettuce and tomatoes on it and you get vitamins and minerals too.

The zoloft and welbutrin haven't built up in your bloodstream yet to their peak efficiency. Takes different times for different people, average 2-3 wks before you start feeling the best effect. After saying that, let me also say I think it's great that you feel better already. Of course it's all in your head....haha, really though, believing the meds will help goes a long way to a good outcome.  Best of luck to you.|`|1UX9jDoCaa	better you read this carefully <br>  There are a few very important points that I would like to cover on the subject of drugs and research and treatment At present the system in England and much of the western world is this<br>  , all treatment recommended by the doctors  should be tested and approved and quite rightly so. <br>  <br>  Obviously it costs vast sums of money to test and approve treatments because of the possible damage to people and the subsequent litigation costing millions of pounds. The point is this Where does this money come from to test and approve treatments? <br>  <br>  By far the biggest source is the drug companies.<br>  <br>   So take for example a researcher might go along to his local drug company and tell them his findings about this treatment he has been working on which is of outstanding value but needs testing further or approving, you might think they would be falling over themselves to know more –right, you could not be more wrong. <br>  <br>  By and large only  and I mean only  treatments, which show the promise of good deal of a profit, will even get examined. <br>  <br>  Because they are in business to make a profit, not for serving the people. <br>  <br>  So many of the thousands of therapies which they see as having no profit potential do not get approved and thus by and large do not get recommended by your local doctor or hospital.<br>  <br>  You wont hear a word about them from your doctor in the main <br>  <br>   Despite The fact that some of them do have overwhelming benefits some, which have saved needless operations, needless amputations, needless pain and trauma, needless kidney failures and much loss of life. <br>  <br>  This will apply to any country where most research is being done by drug companies – <br>  <br>  they would probably laugh in your face if you went there with a promising therapy  which was so cheap anyone could get it.<br>  <br>   Do you really think they would invest thousands of pounds in any therapy  which did not show the promise of good profit. <br>  <br>  Your local G.P/ doctor is not a researcher, do you clearly understand that <br>  <br>   in the main he is told…………… what to prescribe …………. he does not even have the time often to look at research.<br>  <br>   In fact some G.P .s doctors have had action taken against them for prescribing simple supplements. They are in a difficult position in a way many would like to prescribe many different therapies but many feel they cannot for action could be taken against them.<br>  <br>  This does not help you does it though.<br>  <br>  In 2004 approx 5000 Beds are being taken up by people in the UK who have had adverse reactions to drugs. Some will die others will be maimed .A serious amount of suffering is taking place on a scale that makes some wars look like a minor infringement. That is a fact<br>  <br>  So Mr/Mrs patient in 99% of the time because of this system you will probably only get recommended drugs. <br>  <br>  Primarily because of deliberate government policy not to fund research into other therapies. <br>  <br>  Have you heard your local doctor recommend, Massage, Spiritual healing, Knieisiology Herbs, Light therapy, Colour therapy, Regression therapy, Osteopathy, Zappers, Magnetic devices, Electrical Frequency devices.has he mentioned detoxing , reiki, massage, colonics, enemas, sweat baths , accupuncture, tai chi, yoga, hypnosis.not to mention castor oil packs  epsum salt packs  etc etc. <br>  <br>   Has he ever mentioned the power of nutrition what you eat how much protein, carbo, vitamins, water you take in etc.<br>  <br>   Has he ever recommended a detox ..<br>  <br>  All of these have shown their inherent worth with thousands if not millions of testimonials.<br>  <br>  As you can see this system in its present state is inherently flawed, and is criminally negligent <br>  <br>   Until the day comes when most of the research and testing is done by an agency with no vested interests attached and a very clear agenda of being objective. Acting for the people. Printing and revealing all results good and bad.<br>  <br>   What also clouds the issue further is the fact that some of these drugs work well but that is not to say that there isn’t something more natural better.<br>  <br>  Moving on to a more positive note .One of the biggest problems we see when giving this material is that a lot of people do not have good evaluation skills. They rely on a white coat, a hospital building, the sound of a persons voice to sway their thinking into accepting treatments when they are ill.<br>  <br>   Like lambs they are taken down so called drug healing  paths some of which will lead them into untold suffering .<br>  <br>  Of course this is what some of these drug companies rely on the vast sums of money which can be generated are enormous.<br>  <br>  So as the wise among you will see a little investment in time over your health could be a very wise move indeed.<br>  <br>  So what do we recommend ---well we get very beneficial results   doing these therapies ….i am writing a book on this subject   but here is the general principles <br>  <br>  Depression protocol<br>  Hi well I do quite a bit of research and practice the art of healing , my research
2Ltc1dAwaa	Yes, Julie, <br>  Spotting before come on your period is completely normal. It is actually the lining of your uterus already being "cleaned out" before the onset of our period.  <br>  <br>  It is normal that your period may come earlier.  It can be based on a number of factors such as temperature, sexual activity, hormonal activity.  Penicillin is an antibiotic and it can change the hormonal level of estrogen in your bloodstream and therefore you can see some changes in your cycle, but they are completely normal.  <br>  Also, spotting before your pregnancy can happen, just as people can have their period even when they are prgenant- these are rare cases.  <br>  <br>  If you are using contraceptives, there is a much much less chance of being pregnant, but I doubt this is the case, since you are experiencing symptoms of the menstrual cycle.  <br>  <br>  You will probably wake up tomorrow or find yourself welcoming mother nature within a couple of days. Embrace the tamponless days before they come! Im just teasing.  Dont be too concerned, yet again.  This is normal. However, if the sympotms begin to change and your period does not in fact come, or if you notice something else irregular of your normal self, consult your doctor, or a pharmacist!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I hope you get better!  <br>  Drink some warm tea to diminish the bloating!  Midol helps for cramps aswell.  <br>  :)|`|647d5d09dea3015f258c13a34983e878aa	Spotting before a period is normal. I have done this many times in the past. But it is also true that it is possible to spot if one is pregnant for the first month after conception.|`|Ky0e3wOhaa	its normal
L63BRwXbaa	nope, just as long as she keeps it relatively clean/sanitized between uses
7d0acf624119d880dd527cb6ba016228aa	Maybe you should do some more research before venturing and having more sex, but yes some bad things can happen..Your girl could get pregnant off of precum without you even knowing, there is still an exchange of body fluids whuch means a high chance of spreading possible STDs and for smaller things such as yeast infections
i0nlqfJVaa	In what way? Arousal? Infection? Normal to throb for both. Not so good though if it's the second one.
SF1uPJZhaa	We do?
H2IqzG12aa	I'm pretty sure most people use it to mean just the penis.  The whole package is usually called gonads.|`|AA11785060	Well, to most of the world the D word refers to that big pointy thing sticking out from a male's body.  The testicles are the balls, or nuts usually in slang.
PAvYZJK2aa	no it doesn't and I am circumcised
Yx5iSat4aa	There's a valve in your penis that stops the pee and sperm coming out at the same time.  It's normal. it should only burn for a bit.
z2swEfTwaa	it can. it depends on a lot, like your family history, what you eat, how healthy you are etc. but you should try to be happier. when your depressed it can cause you to get sick more and it makes it easyer to get diseases because it causes your immune system to be down. but not by much. so, its a small risk. but if you have hpv, you should try to be happyer, it will help you rid of the virus. and if you do get sick with anything, you can take bee-propolis, it helps cure things like cancer, tumors, hpv and more. but only take it if you aren't allergic to bees. i hope that helps you.  ;D
FIvA9OVxaa	no i dont think so
a7755f42f69cefa52515f7b509e000ceaa	Hell, yea! Me and my boyfriend watch them together sometimes. It's awesome!
P7et8yVcaa	Because no matter what you think, someone still loves you.
VRSUyeqbaa	if you haven't started yet, it could be a sign that you are very close to it. ignore the STD one, apparently, they have no clue as to what they are talking about.|`|FKuoOtgYaa	Odds are it is some very rare sexually transmitted disease. Even if you have not had intercourse recently, you could still have picked it up by means of swimming pool, toilet seat, or being within three feet of a boy. Boys are generally bad and are always looking for ways to give you STDs. I would avoid exposing your vagina around them.
Yx5iSat4aa	Yes. You'll know if you get it in your throat.|`|AA10975447	That depends on who and how.<br>  <br>  If you perform unprotected oral sex on a man who has chlamydia, you can get chlamydia in your throat.<br>  <br>  If a person has oral chlamydia and performs unprotected oral sex on a woman, it is highly unlikely the receptive woman will get chlamydia.
DtwqUqPTaa	hi..<br>  <br>  girls will feel cool,relax and conformable.be coz' she release her sex power.
JhJXKRkOaa	Summer allergies, like hay fever last all summer long, I get hay fever and it's like having a permenent cold all summer. it's horrible.<br>  <br>  I take benadryl plus, this helps a lot with the symptoms, you can get it from pharmacists or supermarkets|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	That's no fun!<br>  <br>  The allergic reactions will last as long as whatever you're allergic to is in the area. Try using Claritin or Benedryl, and start dusting your home frequently with a damp cloth. If that doesn't work, talk with an allergist.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
rc52fIZQaa	You need to watch porn and masturbate, try to get horny and you will see!<br>  <br>  www.xtube.com<br>  www.redtube.com<br>  www.rubias19.com<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|unLtd3jYaa	IDK
5wcgYT8uaa	sometimes it can be because of stress or other reasons or you might just be late.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Depending on what you mean by foreplay there is a change of pregnancy if any sperm gets released in the area of your vagina(yes it is possible to get pregnant without penetration) I suggest you do a test just to rule it out for sure and if negative it is best to repeat it a week or two later. Saying that a number of other things can affect your periods they include: weight loss/gain, hormone imbalance, stress, illness amongst others. If it is concerning you a lot then it might be better if you went and saw your doctor to find out what is the matter and get the right treatment.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	You could easily be pregnant even if you don't have sex often, and you can get pregnant through foreplay as well - if he ejaculates anywhere near your vagina then you can get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Do a pregnancy test, that's the most likely cause for your missed period.|`|DBpdoY3Baa	Just because you dont have intercourse regularly, it  does not mean you cannot be pregnant. <br>  I have recently fallen pregnant and I am suffering with headaches galore! <br>  I would take a test first thing tomorrow morning as your first wee of the day is most reliable!|`|VG9uUG9gaa	You need to visit your gp...<br>  there could be soooo many reasons as to why your period is late or non existant...<br>  get it checked out
mcZlYdw9aa	lots of changes and depends on the person.
5fd47c4c5af8193e5bb771a7fe09d9d5aa	I got this quite a lot, i found foods and plaque often was found between here, how i cleared it was i flossed before brushing (i brushed 3x a day if possible) brush with a mild toothpaste - as strong often irritated it - and used a good mouthwash such as listerine or best mouthwash when you can get it - oraldine!  this clears a lot of mouth problems for me!<br>  <br>  it is just an infection and been told a sign of gingivitus but you must catch it before you find under your teeth beside this begin to go red and hurt which again i found.<br>  <br>  ensure you are brushing all sides of your teeth and thoroughly and using floss and mouthwash as much as you can.<br>  <br>  good luck
ReTPKcfEaa	1. acai berry help you loose weight so i wudnt do that if you want to recover<br>  2. im glad to see your recovering:)<br>  <br>  my advice would be to stop worrying about the calories and enjoy what you eat byu the taste.<br>  <br>  or if your not at that stage<br>  each healthier 5 a day milk and cereal for breakfast giving you calcium and protein, then maybe a salad for lunch and some fish or chicken with vegtables and a couple of potatoes.<br>  eat healthily lotsof healthy stuff and big portions that way you wont gain weight youll get nturies and just build on your figure.<br>  by eating fatty foods and fast foods will put bad fats in your body. <br>  so gradually increase your portions and youll do great|`|vEHP8JySaa	I strongly suggest reading this|`|7fc779e36f1c26b1790c0dfad78189fcaa	I am a personal fitness Trainer, and I see this all the time, I also suffered when I was a teenager, please take this advice, When you starve you burn muscle and muscle is what give you that beautiful difined body, you should eat 6 times a day, yes seems like a lot it was hard for me for a long time, you will gain weight but it will be temporary, you have to retrain your metobolism to burn calories from food not your body, I am not saying 6 full meals, most consumption is way to high, and the daily recomended is 1/3 of a cup of everything when meassuring a meal, for healthy reciepes that taste good and hold good amounts of what you need go to www.hydroxycut.com, I wouldnt suggest using ANY diet pill most of it are fillers and hold no values, if you read a label to them and to a vitamin you will find very few things differ and most of it is fillers, I use to work for a LAB research company thats all we did was make those diet pills, herbal supplements, I was a lab tech, they are junk...everything works with proper exercise and diet, if you are very active you will find you will not put on as much weight as you think, but its very important to get this right when your young or you could do permanat damage where you will gain so much weight when your ready to have children, it will be very hard to take it off, I wish I had this advice many years ago when I was a teen, I would have learned more how o burn calories but keep food in to maintain a healthy metoblism, once damaged its hard to retrain but it can be done!! please take advice meal portions are small and you will feel better, if you need more advice write me golda.beaupre@yahoo.com, I will feel free to answer what I can for you, in this matter.
8SRjELNBaa	Just keep doing basic bicep curls for them.  If you want your arms to look bigger, be sure to work your triceps aswell (scull crushers are a good one), seeing as how they're 2/3 of that region.<br>  <br>  Just keep eating lots of protein like your doing & just give your biceps some more time.<br>  <br>  Stay focused!|`|zpVKSq9Kaa	I would switch over to mixing chest/biceps and do one circuit one day, and then switch over to a completely different circuit the next day...but yet still working the chest/biceps.<br>  <br>  you dont "really" need to give the muscles rest unless you are really really trying to bulk up with max muscle regen.<br>  <br>  how are you drinking the protein shakes? 1x/daily before or after the workout?? if so, then add in one for breakfast and lunch.<br>  <br>  start munching more red meat and chicken too.  even if you have to get the cheap cuts if money is a factor.  just toss it all on a george foreman and eat away.  tobasco usually helps me cut out the blandness haha.  also, you need to eat more per day than you spend in calories or you'll never bulk, you'll just cut.<br>  <br>  find a GOOD calorie site that breaks down EVERYTHING you do versus everything you eat.  be honest about it and you'll see how much more you need to eat to gain.
MhpccWpmaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  After all, you're going to start your period tomorrow.  The only side effect I've ever experienced when this has happened to me is earlier cramping and possibly earlier bleeding which usually leads to my period ending sooner.  I've also experienced no side effects before.  I wouldn't worry|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Skip today's pill so you get back on track.<br>  <br>  One pill before your period should make a difference, but play it safe for a day if you feel in the mood.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry.|`|fhhqFgJuaa	Nice Question,careful now.
f6fa663c41793f7eaa4b7a56f5b520ebaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Yes, unfortunately, the sun and heat can exaberate symptoms like, rashes, fatigue, vertigo, even joint pain and disease flares depending on what kind of lupus it is and it's severity. Frankly, it just makes me feel lousy and drains energy much faster than when I was healthy. Your sister probably has a good idea of how much sun her body can tolorate. If I am having a good day and I must have to be outside for some reason, covering well (light clothing, sunscreen is a must!, hat or scarf), sometimes I will even freeze my scarves to wrap around my head or neck to keep me cool, drinking lots of water. They even make cooling vests and gear for people who are sensitive to the heat. Eventually, despite all this, it still sometimes affects me negatively but not enough to make me move to a cooler climate...although it has crossed my mind ; ) During the cooler months I do tend get out a lot more so I don't totally miss out on all the fun. Also, swimming and walking can be really good for your joints and getting outside in the mornings or evenings when it's cooler is much easier than in the heat of the day!<br>  <br>  You are very sweet to be concerned about your sister and she is blessed to have a close family to her.|`|468643370c34c10681fbee132f8bb6ffaa	I have Lupus too, so you can contact me if you like I would be gald to talk to you, my email address is jamn52501@yahoo.com. But yes she should avoid sun and ultraviloet light as much as possible, she should also be using neutrogena sunscreen with spf 45 to 55 with the ingredients helioplex. It is expensive, but it is the newest and best on the market right now. Also long pants, long sleeves, hats with 4" brims and basically keeping your skin covered will help with the rash part of the lupus.  The best online information I found was on webmd.com and mayoclinic.com, both are really good sites with lots of information.  But although there is no cure, with some lifestyle changes and healthcare management, this disease does not have to be a death sentence, lots of people still live very long full lives. Please feel free to email me if you have any more questions or if you just need to talk to someone , I would be glad to be there for anyone I can . Good Luck!!|`|944b4cac76d80a2d31fa24348e467565aa	IT IS SAID THAT PEOPLE WITH LUPUS SHOULD  AVOID FLORESCENT LIGHTING AND  DIRECT SUNLIGHT|`|AA10921438	Hey- whaddya know my sister has lupus too. I think they have to stay out of the sun so the characteristic butterfly rash doesn't get worse. We should all stay out of the sun, not only her. If she takes common sense precautions with sunscreen, a brimmed hat, possibly an umbrella, she should be fine. Her doctor will be able to answer this question better than I can, so I advise her to seek her physician's advice. :)|`|d628644c3eb0f354fffd4b2f4dd54c69aa	oh yeah keep her out of the sun and and all lights 100+ watts. keep her in a cool shaded or dark room for the rest of her life or until it goes away. oh and make sure she drinks lots of fluids. trust me im a boy scout. <br>  <br>  Life Scout Scott Jones|`|AA11253368	SWEETY,I AM TRUELY SORRY THAT YOUR SISTER IS SO ILL...YES IT'S TRUE...LUPUS IS A TERRIBLE DISEASE,YOUR OWN BODY STARTS WORKING AGAINST YOUR BODY...AND YOUR SISTER MAY HAVE TO MOVE...SHE WILL GET SICKER...I DON'T LIKE TO ME THE ONE,WHO HAS TO TELL YOU..BUT YOU WANTED TO KNOW...SPEND ALOT OF TIME WITH YOUR SISTER,AND DON'T LET HERE KNOW,THAT YOU KNOW WHATS GOING ON...I WISH YOUR SISTER AND YOU ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD...<br>  <br>                   GOD BLESS YOU CLOWMY

Axial means your eyeball is essentially too long and refractive means the shape of your cornea is the cause.

You will constantly strain your eyes trying to focus, which will make it worse.
ca827b1afdaa87f995da7fcc4eda444eaa	to be honest the best way is not to go on a diet as ive tried them all and diet pills and they dont work lol but just change your diet and go swimming 4-5 times a week for about an hour each time it tones your tummy and all your body up wonderful too ! i lost 2 1/2 stone since may its great and i eat loads too im just eating the right foods but instead of swimming try aqua arobics its great and really fun ! great question goodluck !|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	no

nxKAZZHRaa	Yes, for a number of periods within the past twelve years, usually for 3-9 months each time.  <br>  Yes, it does help.  I've found it has stopped morbid thought patterns and made it easier for me to get up and face the day.  It gets  rid of that hopeless feeling I get, and when I am taking it I no longer have to go to bed for an hour when I get in from an early start at work. <br>  However the depression that I believe I sometimes experience is mild.  I have never been off work with it and  I do not suffer from anxiety.  So I only speak from the point of view of mild depression.<br>   I don't take any other medication and I have to be careful in the sun anyway, so I have not had any side-effects or bad reactions.<br>  I do not see any problem with "self-medicating" for depression so long as you let someone you trust know what you are doing, and that you plan to seek help if ever you started to have suicidal thoughts.|`|xHlcnkgWaa	Yes but you have to take it for at least 3 or 4 weeks before you notice the affect, although i did notice it a lot earlier.  It kind of made me a bit numb to things that were upsetting me.  for example if i would think about something before my mind would play on it and then i would cry where as i found with St Johns wort your mind doesn't tend to play on things and upset you as much.  You know obviously that things are bothering you but they don't seem as traumatic.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to explain it, i suppose it's like touching a sharp pointy bit of glass will give you pain but if it was filed down a bit you know it's still a bit sharp but the pain isn't so bad.  sorry i know that's not a great example.<br>  <br>  But it is good, i found, for mild depression|`|wEifjqZUaa	i took sjw for 3 months and thought it did little other than make me queazy, i also felt it numbing and suppressing .<br>  dont expect too much from sjw just because its herbal, anyone successfully on prescription anti depressions will tell you that they are far more advanced in terms of dealing with depression. depression is different to the individual, thats why people are prescribed different meds. sjw is just one herb that deals with some forms of mild depression there are also others, but it is unregulated and you are not going to be monitored and technically you are self medicating which is never a good idea.<br>  go and see a doctor and work with him-her|`|cku5S9WLaa	Yeah I am taking it as my GP recommended it to me after I told him I don't wish to go on antidepressant drugs. I found it a bit weird for a doctor to recommend something herbal but anyway...  I have been taking it everyday for the past 5 weeks. I do seem to be smiling a lot more. I also managed to get through an interview for the first time without having my speech get muddled and I seemed a lot more relaxed there as well... AND I GOT THE JOB! :)|`|35Mer9LJaa	Yes!  You should also take some kind of Omega 3 supplement on a regular basis, like fish oil capsules if you want to feel much better especially during that time of th month.  Most of the problems we have today are nutrition related.|`|m1Kjxlkvaa	I was listening to the radio one day and they were warning people about taking that, as it can have an effect when using other medicines<br>  they did not think people should take it at all in certain cases|`|x2mgUMb6aa	i tried it once,but my warts are still there.|`|cAoJmUMIaa	i haven't tried it i use Bach's rescue remedy it really works|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I tried it because it's over-the-counter and a natural medicine for depression.

4ea275b41b6c56f0526600a3f5521117aa	I don't understand why, in the midst of having panic attacks, you insist on going it alone and braving it without your medication. If you accepted medication, you tacitly accepted the fact that right now, you cannot control it and you need help. Just going off the medication could be something that is a shock to your system. You don't just arbitrarily go off meds and wing it. It's an especially bad idea if you just started the medication.<br>  Your mind and body need something to teach you how to stop doing this. This is a bad habit, and you are locked into a pattern. You are so accustomed to having panic attacks, you would find it traumatic not to have panic attacks. You expect to have panic attacks, just like you always do. You need something to help you bear the burden, so that, in time you find you haven't had one for a while, and you didn't even notice. It takes time, it doesn't happen over night, but gradually you can get used to the idea of calming down and relaxing.<br>  If you find yourself isolated and really struggling with this, I think that is a clear sign that you aren't ready for this. This is not the time to play the brave soul that wants to go it alone. It's too much for you. You are not ready. Today is not the time to try this.<br>  If you were to chart your panic attacks and notice that you hadn't had one if a long time, I think first, you should throw a party and then make a plan on what you want to do about your medication. Talk it out and plan ahead on how you would handle an unexplained attack. You need to know yourself well enough to be able to calm your self down and deal with it in a calm rational way. <br>  Some times diet and exercise can help tremendously. But if you have no idea where you would start, then you need to work on that. Something does work. You can make yourself healthier and calmer with lots of things. A good hobby or a place where you can escape to that will reassure and let you calm down. The arts are an excellent outlet for that.<br>  Please, don't play the martyr. This doesn't seem to be working for you. Be patient calm down and let more time pass before you try this again. Talk to someone and talk about your feelings and know yourself well enough to see one coming before it arrives. Know yourself. Know your limitations. Know what pushes your button. In time, it can't blindside you like this and you will be ready. I want to assure you of that.|`|x2DweOpqaa	you're definitely not the only one with an anxiety disorder.<br>  try breathing in deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly out of your mouth. continue this until the panic attack passes.<br>  <br>  besides this, i don't think there's a lot that you can do but try to remain calm. and i hear that if you smoke anything, your anxiety gets worse, so avoid smoking.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	Sometimes going outside for some fresh air can help.  If possible, try to get near some greenery...being surrounded by nature can be quite relaxing.  Breathing exercises can help.   Positive mental reinforcement is key.  You have to tell yourself that it is going to be okay, that you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Medication is probably not the best idea.  I can understand not wanting to become addicted to prescription drugs.  St John's Wort is a herbal supplement that is supposedly good for depression and things.  You might want to replace your drugs with that for a bit.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Clearly, you need to spend more time reading this website. Look at the mental health section. You are only one of MANY people questioning how to control their anxiety.<br>  <br>  What kind of meds are you on. Remember that you can have crazy side effects from immediately stopping a daily medication. If you want to go off things, go sloooow. Breath deep. Distract yourself.|`|XEvK4urxaa	Hi i sent you an email|`|neu1gyQmaa	i also suffer from anxiety and i am on paxil for it the best thing to do is try to stay on the meds because going off them without some kind of help could cause your anxiety to worsen.

0Jdubcj2aa	Honey I feel so sorry for you. I am EXACTLY the same as you. I have been with my fella for 6 years and can't be without him, I love him so much and constantly want hugs from him. However, I have realised that if he shows more attention to something on TV or another person eg a friend or family member of his I can kick off SO easily! Then we argue and I feel like I hate his guts and have hurt him. I also hurt myself and threaten to kill myself during heated rows. I have tried to let him go but he says he is with me for life and I have been seeing a therapist for my problems. <br>  As my fella is 42 and I am 27 there is a huge age gap. Sometimes I wonder if I love him but as a father figure. (I had a troubled relationship with my Dad.) Maybe that's why I want his attention all the time.<br>  Anyway sweetie, what I want you to do is see your GP who can refer you to a specialist. I have had CBT sessions which have helped my self harm problems and my rages. Just enjoy having your fella, maybe do some things together that you enjoy and remember he loves you! He is with you and that is because he wants to be.

Just having it with your boyfriend may mean you are not with the right bloke. Have you felt like this with other boyfriends? <br>  BPD you would also have black and white thinking like if something goes wrong it is the end of the world but then the next day everything is perfect, You would have mood swings where one moment you can be happy,sad, angry etc.<br>  Other symptoms are self destructive behaviour like self harm, binge eating, substance abuse and many BPD are suicidal at times. They have a fear of rejection and can come across as manipulative when trying to stop the rejection happening, for example threatening suicide. It is a very complicated disorder to treat, but it can be done. If you still feel you may be BPD then speak to your doctor and they will refer you to a psychiatrist who can assess you and diagnose you.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- then you need to see your doctor who can advise you more!

Like there is a chemical found in most personal care products that has Quanternium15 in it - a Formaldehyde releaser, even in your dryer sheets you inhale from your pillow all night.  Maybe if you made  a huge lifestyle change and got these products out of your house like I had to because of the kids eczema, you might notice a difference in your headaches.|`|rqxpZlzpaa	Despite the fact that they are relatively uncommon cluster headaches are classed as being one of the most painful things which you can experience. Fortunately they are quite unusual and, whilst other often painful headaches such as migraines attack approximately ten percent of the population, less than one in three hundred people suffer from cluster headaches. The majority of people describe cluster headaches as being far worse than a migraine and a lot of women say that they are more painful than giving birth.<br>     Cluster Migraine headaches, which normally present as a stabbing pain behind one eye or near the temple, are distinguished by the fact that they generally occur at regular times. This means that they have a tendency to strike at a specific time of day, last for an hour or less, and then attack again at the same time the following day with this pattern repeating itself for several weeks, months or even longer. Also, cluster headaches have a tendency to hit without any warning and differ from migraines which are sometimes preceded by familiar symptoms such as flashing lights.  Precisely why we suffer from cluster headaches remains a mystery although some researchers think that they are caused by an abnormality in the hypothalamus, which is the gland that regulates the body clock and is affected by alterations to the length of the day and a number of other things.  Another important difference between cluster headaches and migraines is the gender of sufferers.<br>   In the case of migraine headaches approximately three quarters of the nearly 28 million sufferers in the United States alone are women and just one quarter are men. When it comes to cluster headaches by contrast about eight out of ten sufferers are men.  Traditional treatments for ordinary or migraine headaches are normally ineffective for cluster headaches and such once miracle drugs as ibuprofen and aspirin have virtually no impact.  One treatment which has been demonstrated to be quite effective is inhaling pure oxygen. This form of treatment cannot of course be given until after the onset of the headache but inhaling pure oxygen for a severa minutes will often ease the headache considerably.  Another reasonably effective treatment is that of taking a class of drugs known as triptans that are commonly used for the treatment of migraines. Here however the drug must be given in the form of a nasal spray to be effective and this can prove difficult as cluster headaches can sometimes produce swelling in the nasal passages. When this is the case then the drug may also be effective if it is given by injection.<br>   This again is a form of treatment which needs to be given once the headache has appeared.  As cluster headaches strike with a clear pattern it would be particularly useful to have some form of preventative medication that could be taken regularly shortly before a headache appears. Unhappily however as the condition is so unusual and is not well understood we do not have a lot of information about which drugs may or may not be an effective form of preventative treatment.  In extreme cases surgery designed to block nerves and other neurological procedures may be carried out but this ought to be viewed as very much a last resort and is not always wholly effective.<br>     By: Donald Saunders  Article Directory: <a href="http://www.articledashboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com</a><br>   See Also:<br>   What causes migraines and how do you end the pain?  <br>   How do you define the pain of cluster migraine headaches?  <br>   Todays Video: Cluster Headaches: My POV on Excruitating Pain!<br>     <br>   Cluster Migraine Headache remedies <br>     Cluster Headache.

Maybe ask your doctor about some thing else?
BG8vMyZjaa	If your doctor's advice was not to bowl don't you think it would be best not to do so?<br>  The advice was given for a reason.<br>  Congrats on the recovery, don't spoil it by going against what is best for you.|`|WkLJI40baa	If the doctor told you not to, then don't. If it was a friend, I hope you bowl a 300.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Just don't do anything that is going to jeopardize your recovery.  If the doc said don't do it, then don't do it.  Is bowling worth coming out of remission?  No way.
1PLFUli0aa	well the food not digesting wouldn't cause high blood sugar, and usually if you have indegestion, it is caused by high blood sugar.  I would say your long acting insulin is not working correctly, or you are not taking enough. only your doctor could tell you for sure though. <br>  <br>  I am type 1 diabetic and have had it since I was 8 years old! I am 23 now and I do have highs during the night occassionally, and I adjust my insulin regimen to control it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7GrncwiYaa	This sure sounds like gastroparesis. I have been doing some reading on digestive issues and this rang a bell. The source www.mayoclinic.com has very good info on this. You get a description of symptoms and what you can do or expect from them.  Good luck - tummy problems are NO fun.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	eat earlier...5 pm. & don't eat too much.
Q9e6sqOTaa	First thing you should do is go get a cup of coffee or something with your sister, and really talk to her. If she says all is fine, then maybe you will notice in her behavior. But maybe she will be willing to talk to you about it. Just let her know that you care a lot and just want the best for both her and her child. Then maybe you could attend a narcotics anonymous meeting. There you could share stories with people in similar stuations and how they cope. And if your sister refuses to cooperate with anything, then you need to just tell her that you don't want to take anything to extreme measures but you will do whatever you have to for everyones safety. I really hope the child is ok.. good luck|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Just take your niece and take care of her.<br>  <br>  Calling CPS would be the worst thing in the world, that is like sending a child to hell, it is worse than you can possible imagine.<br>  <br>  If you are really concerned move with your niece somewhere it would be difficult for your sister to do anything about it.<br>  <br>  Crackheads where I live usually get someone to babysit their child and then never come back for them.|`|j7HncXuuaa	the child is the top priority!  They will try to get her help-but she will have to commit to it and stay away from users. How would you feel if something unspeakable happened to that child?|`|AA10500537	have a heart to heart talk with your sister and tell her either clean up her act or you will get cps involved , <br>  keep a watch on the baby.
Hq2oUqnDaa	this EXACT story was told to me like 5 months ago....maybe its like a myth haha idk or maybe we both know the person that it happened to idk..|`|hOpAWXPYaa	I have no idea if thats possible but eww thats straight up nastyyy.
mAlvOFnWaa	how about a serious answer. <br>  I have gotten sore nipples b/c they get dry during the winter. If this sounds similar to what your experiencing, try putting some lotion on the girls after showering. Otherwise I can't say that I've had issues with weather cycling. Your breasts will be more tender at different times during your menstrual cycle as well. It may also be a sign of early pregnancy.|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	my breasts are always sore. damn horny boyfriend!|`|RTVkXnavaa	haha! i didnt know dat cud happen! i love to warm them up with my hands or mouth|`|a945c1f3af60e0fd27ec1b2cc1cebfc5aa	Not being funny but, if you need any help..........I'm your man!!|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Lol erm no can't say i have.
08sclDACaa	firstly when seeing your gp tell him how concerned you are. all gp's should take everything seriously unfortunately some are more idle and lack interest that others... if you feel your gp doesnt take you seriously and your concerns are of what somet important then you can request a second opinion and even a third if you are not happy. you need to unfortunately keep pushing them into doing somet about whatever it is your are concerned about. if all else fails you could just head down to A n E and tell them how distrssed you are tha tno one is taking you seriously, if a doctor agrees to see you a report will be filed and the surgery will be fined ..... when seeing your gp you may want to mention if nothing gets moving and tests arent made you will be taking it further, i hope you have agp that will of course take allmatters seriously i wish you well|`|mmMgfhf2aa	I've had this with a doctor who said "I don't think it's serious enough" so I had to insist that it was dealt with. I then got treated by another GP in the same practice. You have to be firm with them. They are there for YOU. You're the best judge of your own body and can tell when something isn't right. Take someone for reinforcement if you don't think you can be strong enough.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	I am going to answer your actual question first. I quite understand your own cynicism, when something does go wrong it is natural to blame something for it.<br>  <br>  If a plumber fails to fix your toilet you develop a healthy distrust of plumbers, similarly if a doctor deals with you or a relative and things don't come out right.<br>  <br>  It is of course unrealistic though unsurprising that people blanketly become critical. As a GP for 25 years I can tell you that GPs do listen and as the years have gone by they have compelled to do more and more tests many of them on the vast army of worried well. With each passing year they become increasingly compelled to look over their shoulders and perform tests with less and less real medical indication, just in case they miss something.<br>  <br>  As a result of this, have no fear, your GP is likely to listen to you, is likely to take what you say seriously and is likely to investigate whatever your problem is, irrespective of how likely or unlikely it is to represent significant pathology. He dare do no less.<br>  <br>  Secondly I think you were unnecessarily rude to Rhianna who gives helpful advice to literally hundreds of Health Answers' questions.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Your GP will arrange appropriate further diagnostic tests, referrals and/or medication providing there is a medical indication. Make an appointment to see him and explain your symptoms.<br>  <br>  GPs get one of you in at least 3 times (if not more) a week. GPs, like everyone do make mistakes, nothing in life is 100%, however the vast majority of the time they do get it right. Remember you only hear about the bad cases because bad press grabs attention. Has it ever entered your mind that the reason you aren't being referred for tests is because you don't actually need them?? Do you think it gives Doctors some sort of pleasure by not diagnosing you? What do you think they are there for! If you need further tests, your GP will arrange it. <br>  <br>  Jade Goody had been having problems for years and she had been given various diagnostic tests, she was tested for C. of the Ovary and bowel in 2005. No test is 100%. Jade was just unlucky, but Jade's case is rare. I am sorry about your mother, but for goodness sake get a grip.<br>  <br>  Oh dear if you have some Nursing background then you should know what I am saying is correct. LOL your entire question is cynical! Maybe I was being a bit hard on you though. Perhaps losing your mother in such tragic circumstances has made you (understandably so), have a fear/anxiety that you won't be treated? Discuss this with your GP too. They are there to help you.|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	When you have maked your appointment and you go to your appointment make him aware of your worry's and insist on test's. They have to do test's if you ask one. There job is to put you at ease. Also im sorry to hear about your mum darling but Jade Goody was acctually scared about going to her smear test, so she didn't go , the system did not fail here it was acctually her own fault (this is true and she addmitted it in an interview on tele!!! I sympathise with her though and i really like her, thats how she has inspired people/young girls as its making them see that if they don't go it can lead to seriouse health issue's !!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck hunn xx|`|mR5RkClpaa	i dont know how you can, they are making too many mistakes, and they are only doing part of there job,like for instance i am on a drug for an illness and this drug makes you lose pottasium, and i know you are meant to get blood tests, and get your pottasium levels monitered,but i have never had one blood test, i am going to have to go to a private gp, to get tests done|`|uB4ZQOEDaa	Gp's are in the first instance there to refer you to someone who can help so ask for a referral if you feel you would rather speak to a specialist.  if your gp isn't keen then ask to see another gp for a second opinion or  a third etc.  Its your health so push for help - at the end of the day that's what we pay taxes for!!!!!!!!!!!!!  good luck , I hope everything turns out okay for you.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Go to see him.<br>  <br>  If necessary, you can be referred to a different GP.
FOQqDyLFaa	try telling your parents...or the police...... i know it seems hard but its the best thing to do... at least you wont be on your own with the problem.... good luck  x|`|6qsocyK3aa	Ring the police! Or, if you're in the UK, ring Crimestoppers (Google them for the number). It's completely anonymous. You have no reason to put up with these selfish bullying lowlifes.|`|AA11430368	it's a shame you didn't just go to the police immediately when you were 12 and this person asked you to start stealing from people in th first place. As you didn't, you do have a moral obligation to tell the police about this person now. I agree that it is a great idea for you to learn some sort of self defence but don't do this as a solution to this particular problem.. what you gonna do, attack them.. then what? they get better and come after you.. go to the police|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	kick the S**T out of him,i mean you 16 now you can't be a p**sy anymore,so get him b4 he does anything to you|`|2KC467tFaa	Tell the cops.

Learn different types of martial arts i would go for some karate or tae kwan do. But if there is capoeira or krav maga or muay thai my favorite definitely take those i might be middle class but when people come try to beat me up the come out with some bad s***. this will help you i dont try to much to beat them up you want to knock them out or stun them so you can run away the point is quick jabs and the run your a**away.I hope this will help you man dont let them get in your head.

fk9AvB25aa	You also can't get herpes from masturbating alone (unless you have herpes on your mouth, touched it then with in seconds touched your genitals). It's usually passed on to the genitals when you have oral or regular sex with some one that either has oral or genital herpes. If you haven't come close to having oral or regular sex then I seriously doubt that this could be herpes. It could be a reaction from masturbating.<br>  Most of the time the initial out break is painful, but if the out break is mild enough it could look like just pimples and feel like a rash.

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.

I do expect to be thrashed and damned for my answer. But hey, the truth hurts.<br>  <br>  Your husband is wasting his time. Acupuncture does NOT work. It's a big sham-quackery. There is no evidence that shows acupuncture being a viable medical treatment of any disease or illness. It works like a big giant placebo. I know, you're going to say it does work. I ask you to find me an unbiased, good structured journal (of medicine), without any confounding variables that states acupuncture works. The medical studies I have read all state there isn't any evidence showing any change in acupuncture treatments. <br>  <br>  The answer is, your husband can be one if he wants, but he's working to be a provider of sham medical (non-medical in this case) practices. I don't mean to sound rude, but it's all true. Look it up on pubmed.com, biomed.com or any other reputable source

SYaSbJb5aa	First off, using alcohol and drugs to escape is a deadly choice.  For years I abused them both, convincing myself that it was fine.  It really only aggravates the problem.  The fact that you are aware of this, and conscious to the fact that it's probably a bad idea, shows that this isn't the lifestyle you want.<br>  It was only when I quit smoking dope (10 months ago) that I started to feel more confident and excited about life.  It used to be that every day I woke up, rolled a joint and just got high, then burnt out, high then burnt out...all day long.  I convinced myself that I enjoyed it, but looking back, I know I hated every minute of it.   I still drink socially, but it's not every day anymore.  <br>  <br>  People, especially your family, probably get you a lot more than you think.  But it sounds like your current situation isn't doing much for you.  Maybe you need to branch out from your social group.  Maybe it means moving away to a different city, maybe it just means joining some clubs in your area (sports, art, culture, school).  <br>  <br>  There's no right or perfect answer to this.  I think the best piece of advice I can give, is for you to do what makes you happy.  Don't be fake, and don't say things just to keep people happy.  If people don't like the real you, they can F off.  Find people who understand you, and have the same interests as you.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

7HCcGlkxaa	Taragrim is terribly wrong.<br>  <br>  I will try to simplify things-<br>  <br>  A.D.D - Attention Deficient Disorder- which means it's difficult to pay attention. There aren't really any signs BESIDES that.<br>  <br>  A.D.H.D- Same thing- but you're hyper. Signs often include acting up, grades slipping and incapable of maintaining a job/healthy relationships.<br>  <br>  Bipolar Disorder- EXTREME, EXTREME mood swings. There are two different types- Bipolar Type One, which is just the mood swings and Type Two- which includes psychotic tendencies. <br>  When you are bipolar you are either manic (REALLY hyper, make impulsive decisions) or very depressed, sometimes there are neutral periods, but they don't last forever.<br>  <br>  Many people are misdiagnosed with these- and many people claim to have them. It's actually rare you will have any of these, but the people that DO have them, it's obvious- your friends are probably faking it.|`|6uQh4VSpaa	ADD/ADHD refers to an inability to concentrate on the task at hand.  People often fidget, daydream, etc instead of paying attention.  The H (hyperactivity) is generally only used to describe children/teenagers, in which ADD often comes along with hyperactivity.<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is one of the most misunderstood terms in psychiatry.  It is not "mood swings" or "getting angry easily".  It is all of the symptoms of depression, along with a mania: almost like being high amphetamines/cocaine, without the drugs.  People in manic episodes often spend money recklessly, have sex haphazardly, sleep very little or not at all, talk way too fast, can't sit still, and generally think they can do anything.  Episodes of mania last for weeks, and episodes of depression last for months or years.  Bipolar disorder is generally a life-long illness -- there are drugs that help, but it doesn't usually get cured or 'go away'.  The disorder most commonly starts in the 20s.  About 1% of people have (or will develop) bipolar disorder.|`|UJO8EUPGaa	Symptoms of ADD are that you can get really hyper and cant concentrate<br>  on certain things.  Often people with ADD talk alot.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of Bipolar are LOTS of different mood swings, or one moment<br>  your really happy, and then when someone says something you might get really angry for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  Im not sure about the ADHD though|`|p7ZdohGTaa	ADHD and ADD people cannot concentrate very well. ADD may not have high activity levels. Many ADHD people are very sensitive to outward stimuli and could be though of as bipolar, since they can be calm for a little while and then irritable and very upset, if they happen to have food sensitivities.|`|AA11634944	ADD stands for attention deficit disorder. It is a disorder that makes it difficult for the sufferer to pay attention. These are the type of people who may be smart, but don't do well in school because they have a hard time paying attention to the material. They tend to "zone out" and often need medication to stay on track.<br>  <br>  ADHD stands of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is much the same as ADD except the sufferer has a difficulty paying attention due to their hyperactivity. My mother had a student in her class years ago that was ADHD and without his medication he was on top of his desk, running around the classroom, screaming at other students etc. When medicated it was the difference between night and day. He was cool, calm, and collected.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell:<br>  ADD=hard to pay attention<br>  ADHD=hard to pay attention because of hyperactivity<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes extreme high and lows in a persons emotion. These people will go from being happy to angry and back in a matter of minuets. We all have these tendencies to jump around from emotion to emotion but the difference with being bipolar are the strengths from these fluctuations and how frequent they are. Think about it this way; a situation that would cause a normal person to be mad would cause a bipolar person to be extremely angry, hypothetically, of course.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

ToILKl6waa	Relax. Anxiety is prevalent around the world - thus, you're certainly not alone. For your body, it's a normal reaction to stress. I would be worried if you DIDN'T get a physical response from stress! Learn to believe and accept that. <br>  <br>  First of all, limit the things that are causing you stress. If a late assignment contributes to the stress, do it. If it's a situation you can't avoid, keep confronting the situation and the anxiety will lessen. Feel the fear and do what you have to do anyway. Let the anxiety do its course. When you start to feel anxious, instead of opposing to the negative thoughts and thinking, "OH NO! GO AWAY PANIC," welcome and encourage the anxiety. Science proves that if you do so, the anxiety will not mount. Drink a bit of water and take a deep breath. Try to stay in touch with the nature around you and away from panicky thoughts. Panic is just a feeling. It does not define who you are.|`|XEvK4urxaa	I sent you an email|`|4ea275b41b6c56f0526600a3f5521117aa	This could just be a reaction to the stress. You could be a little tired and a little burnt out and finally having a chance to sit down quietly, maybe it all just caught up with you. I've done that. It doesn't seem to bother you while you're sweating it out, it catches up with you when you finally slow down.<br>  Panic attacks can be nothing more than a sodium imbalance. I recommend you find something salty and eat it and see if that doesn't make you feel better. Does this sound like a good idea? That would be a good sign that this is just what you need. Get a bowl of soup or some orange juice. Maybe some tomato soup or some salsa.<br>  Your body may be just trying to tell you something. In a dietary or nutritional kind of way, food should help correct the imbalance and help you get back to feeling like yourself again.<br>  Don't let this upset you. Rather you need practical solutions. This could happen to anyone after over-doing it. You need to know yourself and you need to know what you can do to make it right again. You can start here.<br>  I hope this works out great for you.|`|65p86fMtaa	You prolly have GAD (Generalized Anxiexty Disorder). it makes you panic for no reason. i have it. i get exactly like you when i hit the mall, main st, school ect. i don't recommend you takeing prescriptions. try to talk to somebody to make you feel comfortable, excersie alot, running helps. also recognize your stress trigger to see what make's you freak out. Most important stay chill, i know its hard. Stay busy so you won't stress out. Herbal tea can help too. it helped me. and if you  start to panic at school, look at the ground and clear you head. and ignore it by talking to friends about something,<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|HNycdO3Raa	i have attacks to like this i just wait it out becasue i have been having attacks for years now so i have endurance now. but i think you should see a doctor he can give u medecine that really works. Also you could try relaxing strategies to help cope|`|N8C9sEQDaa	About panic attack sufferers can be read in <a href="http://super-info-blog.blogspot.com/?q=panic%20attack%20sufferers" rel="nofollow">http://super-info-blog.blogspot.com/?q=p...</a>|`|nZXLvfDoaa	try something called St johns wort|`|g9vw4ovGaa	There is medication you can take. I have always had severe anxiety, and when my husband deployed, had panic attacks. The point where I couldn't breath, I felt dizzy and it felt like my chest was collapsing. Right now, I am on Effexor XR and Klonopin. Ever since I started taking it I have lost the nervousness, the sense of worry, and haven't had a panic attack since. Good lucky honey and don't feel like there is something wrong with you, alot of people have this disorder.|`|tAFPbAUaaa	The first panic attack I ever had was similar to your experience. I was too scared to even move, so I just laid on my couch until my roommate came home. I went immediately to the doctor and was on medication for about a year. This was ten years ago. I still have anxiety, but have learned to avoid full-blown panic attacks like that simply by talking myself out of them. Every two or three years, it gets to be too much and I end up going back on medication. Then, after a while, I think I can manage without it.<br>  Go ahead and talk to your doctor about your anxiety. I wish you the best of luck.|`|tVF9O1Olaa	That does sound like a panic attack and there are many ways to help overcome it. The best thing to do is catch it before it develops into a full blown attack, i can now tell when i am going to get one as i start getting a faster heart beat and a funny feeling this is when you should start doing the techniques to stop it developing. <br>  <br>  When you first get that feeling concentrate on your breathing, breathe in for 3 seconds hold for 3 seconds and then breathe out for 3 seconds. Repeat this and focus on every breathe as this will distract you. This should help but if it does develop into a full blown one then hold your hands over your mouth and breathe in and out for 10 seconds, no longer as you will feel dizzy. Then do the breathing techniques above. Hope this helps|`|uJBnZWtcaa	When something really scares you, like a tiger suddenly jumping out of a doorway as you walk by, the hormone adrenalin shoots into your bloodstream and gets you ready to fight for your life.  We don't have too many tigers roaming around but for some reason some of us are ready for them.  The quick way to get rid of all that adrenalin in your body is to move - do jumping jacks, run in place, turn in circles, run around the block - just move.<br>  <br>  See a doctor to make sure that your adrenal glands (they sit on top of your kidneys) are OK - they probably are.  He or she can prescribe you medication that will take the edge off.  Be sure to ask about learning to control them.<br>  <br>  When you feel an attack coming on, breathe slowly into a paperbag.  The feeling that you can't breathe is caused by hyperventilation - you've actually been breathing too fast and too shallowly getting lots of oxygen into the blood so that your muscles will have enough to power them while you fight that tiger.<br>  <br>  When you feel an attack coming on, concentrate on your breathing. (The paperbag breathing helps you do this.)  Slow it down, take big, slow, deep breaths, hold for a few seconds and slowly release. It's important that you control your thoughts so you don't help the attack. You need to replace "OMG!!! I CAN'T BREATHE!!!" with "I am breathing very slowly in, in, in. Now, I am breathing slowly out, out, out".  I also used to self-talk: "I am not dying. It's only a panic attack and I'll live."<br>  <br>  Panic Attacks are more common than you think. In fact, having panic attacks has usually nothing to do with your physical or emotional health. It's a problem with the wiring of our nervous systems.  Most PA suffers are just as normal as you are.<br>  <br>  Don't keep them secret.  Tell whoever you're with that you have to go take care of your panic attack. Just tell them matter-of-factly, like "Oh, give a few minutes.  I've got to deal with this panic attack." Taking them public takes some of the scary out of them. It gives you a support base, too, because you'll begin to understand that your friends will be there for you. (Hey, it's not catching!)  My friends know that unless I get the aisle seat, they're going to be interrupted if I have to leave to take care of my attack.  Just being on the aisle relaxes me because I have an easy way to get away if I need to - so I don't feel anxious about it and I don't have an attack.<br>  <br>  Learn to relax through chants or meditation.  I used to have PAs on my 50 mile drive to school and found that if I just chanted my dogs' names and nicknames, I relaxed and headed off attacks.  It sounds dumb but I kept trying different words and phrases and the dog names worked so I stayed with them.  Also, since PA's involve stresses on the whole body, I used a cd of a whole body stress and relax meditation where you lay down and start by curling your toes and feeling the stress on them then relax them and feel the relaxation. You work your way through your feet, legs, thighs, abdomen, etc. all the way to your head.  It teaches you to be able to replace stress with relaxation.  You have to practice to gain the control but it works.<br>  <br>  Much luck to you....you're not alone.

2KC467tFaa	It sounds like you have a bit more confidence and knowledge of who you are and what you want. Everyone is constantly changing, so don't think you're weird or alone in that department. Be whoever you want to be. Do what makes you happy. Don't worry about how different you are now than what you used to be. I have the same core personality as I always have, but I am completely different than a few years ago. It's normal. It's called experiencing life. Good for you for losing that much weight. I bet you feel so much healthier. You probably have more self-respect as well. You're watching out for yourself. Hip-hop is usually very materialistic and shallow. Maybe you also notice that and have made a decision to filter out what you allow in your life. You're getting stronger. That's not a bad thing. As long as you are true to yourself, you're not doing anything wrong.|`|Q9e6sqOTaa	It's perfectly normal. Some people don't even find out that they're gay until they're old. I think you're just becoming more accepting with yourself therefore you have more confidence interacting with other guys.. And the not getting in trouble anymore part just means you're maturing. There's never anything wrong with that.. Just less punnishment.. lol. All that matters is that you accept yourself for who you are.. As long as that's good, don't let anyone else tell you that how you are is wrong. Just be yourself and do what you wanna do! :)|`|keUnf6Rjaa	i suggest that since you need help and guidance. that you read your bible and pray.   when i have problems similar to yours i pray for holy spirit and guidance and i like to read the bible.<br>  that what helps me.  sorry if i couldn't help you. i am just going by my experience.|`|yJWgTzuXaa	Ok so here is a question (add it to your original one)  why are you worried about changing?  from what you say - its not sounding like a bad thing.<br>  <br>  xx|`|4Q1asqr5aa	uhhhhhhh.....wow?<br>  thats all im sayen........
8NKppITlaa	I'm not going to pretend it is easy to get over this, i'm going through the exact same thing. i'm 18. i often find myself acting jealous of friends just because they seem to have more of a life than me. maybe you need to join a club where you can break out of this shell.<br>  <br>  Its not a permanent fix but i joined a karate club, it makes me feel better for about half of the week. But to get over it maybe you need to talk to someone. i'm seeing a counselor but then again my problems run deeper than my lack of friends, if you are finding yourself becoming depressed over the situation then maybe counseling is for you.|`|LAbQy9d4aa	I'm in similar situation.<br>  Though, I'm 19, my flat isn't nice at all...<br>  How to get over?<br>  Find a girl... then tell me how you did it..|`|XEvK4urxaa	I sent youu an email xx|`|8UoXiODCaa	awwww talk to me:)<br>  I'm 16 in cali<br>  very fun<br>  i'll make you feel good:)<br>  message me:)<br>  yerblueeyedblondie@yahoo.com|`|iHC5mSLEaa	As you pointed out, to be happier, going out with friends a lot helps. so starting with your hobbies issue, instead of staring at a computer screen, in place of that why don't you go out exercising or to somewhere you can meet new friends. if conversation is an issue, talk about your studies, your other friends, your family, your life basically. things you find boring about yourself others may find interesting to know about as long as you are willing to listen to their life story as well. if your at college/university/school you could start talking to people you haven't met or spoken to. just be open and friendly to everyone and you'll find great friends!
fRI8Lsjyaa	I wouldn"t exactly say you have bi polar. Is it possible that there has been any type of big change in your life? The mood swings and crying for no reason could be all the feeling you are trying to bottle up leaking out occasionally. The fact that you quickly become normal again could be you regaining yourself and putting your problems back in that bottle. Hyperactivity could also be a way of protecting yourself. Do you often feel like you want to look good and put others in a good mood or too laughter? If so that is a way of fighting the truth. I would sit back and think if there is some major issue in your life you are trying to ignore and try to deal with it. Or find someone who you can talk about it with.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Your question is difficult to answer. I suppose even a physician might not be able to answer your question directly since many things can cause similar symptoms. My question is whether you had some of these problems, even as a young child. Did you get upset at little things, seem happy a bit later, etc.? Did you have problems with homework, too? Although in girls, I think this can come on a bit later, due to menstruation, some things to look into would be ADHD and food sensitvities. My son was tested for food sensitivities when he was a child. He had a major problem with peanut products, which would cause tempers to flare for no apparant reason. Sugary things would make him silly and giddy. But when the sugar 'high' wore off, he might get crabby. Tomatoes and oranges caused irritability. Each person is different. That does not mean these things are affecting you. Another thing that affects ADHD people is the fact that they are often reminded frequently of their failures and inability to keep up, on things. This can be frustrating and cause discouragement. Try to give yourself credit when you try, even if you did not fully complete a task. Thomas Edison was ADHD and was actually homeschoole. ADHD people often get more irritated with simple stimuli, because they cannot block it out, as easily. Look up ADHD and Candida, and see if you can alter your diet; see if this might help, but do it for several weeks. Read as much as you can on this subject.|`|MubGySVAaa	This sounds like you have some sort of anxiety problem. Both bi-polar disorder and ADHD are anxiety based. Don't jump to conclusions though, please visit a doctor. the internet is like Wikipedia-useful for getting a rough idea of information, but it is not a great place to get a diagnosis. <br>  <br>  Are you an adolescent? If so, these symptoms may be normal. Your hormones will be going through extreme shifts and your body is changing rapidly. It would make sense that you are going through a rough time.

4liezL3oaa	it should be fine, just as long as u don't take them together. But just in case, ask ur doctor or pharmacist.<br>  <br>  :]|`|pZIiYc8baa	I do it all the time. I take a daily allergy pill and often have sinus or other infections that require antibiotics. But if you are concerned then call your pharmacy or your doctor. A pharmacy should be able to tell you about drug interactions because they deal in drugs every day--now didn't that sound bad? But you know what I mean|`|b7y1SCAOaa	While I cannot say this 100% because you did not say what your "allergy pill" is, doxycycline does not interact with antihistamines, which is probably what you are referring to. The major thing you want to watch out for with any type of tetracycline antibiotic like doxycycline is not to take it with milk or any medications or foods that contain things such as calcium, magnesium, or aluminium.<br>  <br>  Again, I don't know what your allergy pill is, but if you are talking about an antihistamine, then there is no interaction, and you need not worry about taking them together.|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	Best thing to do is to pose that question to a doctor.  Do you have a telehealth phone line in service where you live?  If you do, maybe call that up and ask that question to them.<br>  <br>  As well, a few pharmacies will give you reports with most of the medications that they prescribe.  Those reports should say right in them if there are any other medications that they will clash with, whether prescribed or over the counter.|`|DNUPVvioaa	i agree with asking this question with your doctor or even pharmacist
fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	nothing much you can do- it needs time to heal. Keep the area warm and lay off the excercise (including stretchings) for a few weeks. One week is probably not enough so try and stay off the practice next week.<br>  <br>  Difficult to say without a physical exam- but the worst case scenario (like lots of painkillers and lots more excercise) means a broken tendon and/or muscle- which would mean you in surgery instead of Costa Rica<br>  <br>  Pain - it is your body telling you to take it easy|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	You may just be sore.  If you can stretch out and then still run ok then it was probably just soreness.  A pulled muscle hurts real bad and you would know if you did or not.  Plus it would maybe turn Black and Blue.

That is a brave and difficult thing to do, yet it shows deep down you really want this to end, and to be whole again.<br>  <br>  As you already know, cutting yourself isn't healthy. IF it was, everyone would be doing it, right? So what you gotta do is talk to someone you trust. If that's too hard, then contact Samaritans online. They will put you in touch with someone who can help you unwind the tangle of thoughts and feelings going on inside you, and find where the thread begins. <br>  <br>  Also, if you read through this section, you'll find other cutters like yourself. So you are not alone, ok? Half the time, you feel like it's only happening to you and no one else. I wish that was the case - that cutting was so rare, almost no one does it, but in reality, it's becoming a 'default' action of far too many people in pain.<br>  <br>  But anyway, take that step. Talk to Samaritans or another online counseling service. They ARE there to help, not tell you what is right or wrong for you. <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|t8gHU5Glaa	I had the same feelings, sort of. Heres what I did: Why are you cutting yourself? For attention, depression, lonliness, low self esteam, or maybe because your bored? When you feel depressed find a get away. Some of my getaways inclued:<br>  Reading<br>  Anime<br>  Music<br>  Comics<br>  Drawing<br>  Tennis<br>  Video Games<br>  Sewing<br>  Chrocheting<br>  Cooking<br>  You'll probably have different ones but, for me I always keep a good book by me. <br>  <br>  If your wanting attention then reading is a good one because if you imagine yourself as the main character then you feel like your getting more attention. <br>  <br>  If your doing it because your depressed then you can listen to music that expresses happier feelings then hum that song to yourself when you feel down and it'll make you feel better. <br>  <br>  If your doing it because you feel lonley then get online and go to online game websites like <a href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaiaonline.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.virtualfamilykingdom.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.virtualfamilykingdom.com/.</a> Or you could search one of your hobbies online and chat with other people about your interests on the forums. Or make a good friend on there and tell them how you feel when your down in the dumps.<br>  <br>  If your cutting because you have low self esteam then you should go online and find outfits that fit your figure to look good on your figure, get good sleep, eat healthy, wash well, && look for good hairstyles for your face shape and make up to go with your skin and hair tone. So, really what I'm saying is the healthier you are the pretty you are. <br>  <br>  But, if your just doing it because your bored find something to do. When you get the erge to cut then you should grab a deck of cards, play a sport, exercise, or even just watch something interesting on TV.<br>  <br>  Also, when your mother says stuff like, ignore her. She doesn't want you to feel bad, doesn't want you to die, and doesn't want you to really hurt yourself. She may be right about the PMS, but one thing you can do is watch what you get mad about. I once got really mad because my mom switched the radio channel. Then, I realized I wasn't mad about the radio I was mad because my mom didn't take me serious if I got angry. It's annoying but they just see people our age as someone without enough power to do anything too serious when we're mad.<br>  <br>  Just DON'T EVER: cut yourself again, go to drugs, or anything a 13 year old shouldn't do.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your sister! ;)<br>  I know you can do it. :P<br>  I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  God, this was looong.|`|cfa3657dcc60470676e06bb7d0e6b88faa	This is not "normal" behavior, although cutting has been made somewhat popular in prime time television....this is a way of expressing yourself that puts all the pain back on You. No, this is not healthy although it is understood by counselors and adolescent psychologists. <br>  <br>  You don't deserve to be hurt and hurt. If you are in such a high stress situation that you feel you have no other means of expressing yourself, please reach out to a trusted teacher, minister, or auntie or someone who is trust worthy and will not take advantage of you.<br>  <br>  There are several things that can be compiled with cutting; infections, scarring, and accidental suicide. You are a valuable person, and if your mom loves you, she will enfold you in her heart of love and care - both of you get help together....okay.|`|9pLI73pqaa	Yes, dear, you need some assistance and you are wise to be seeking it! If your Mom cannot help, find a mature adult whom both of you trust, perhaps a counselor at school or a youth leader at church. <br>  <br>  It is also true that many teens experience difficulty, so it's not all that unusual at your age. You are going to extremes and need to get to the root of the cutting so you can deal with the problem. Keep looking until you find someone who can be of real help. If you can't find anyone, ask again on this board for some suggestions.|`|1W4e8JBIaa	You need to be healthy not a cutter. You must start your new life and moving on.

It is not normal 13 year old behavior i thought that too. Eventually it got the point where i was commited twice. The best thing for you to do is try and talk about it with some one you love and trust very well and also seek some sort of counseling. The best time to do it is now dont wait i did and now i have alot more problems in my life then there should be. Trust me counseling will help because you can openly talk about why you do it without being judged and also they will put you on medication to help you keep calm. I hope you take this seriously and i hoped that i could help you because its better to try and help then not at all.|`|fRI8Lsjyaa	13 is a really hard age. That is a time when people question who they are and can often feel out of place. Maybe through cutting you don"t want to kill yourself, but it is a cry for attention. I don't know what your family life is like but I am getting the vibe that you aren't getting what you need there. I often had problems in my life and my parents didn"t understand...although I think they were partly to blame for them. One thing that helped me through was talking to others. I was very well befriended with the school nurse. I could talk to her about everything. She would even excuse me when I needed to leave class and just talk to her. Young friends are ok but honestly through an adult you also get more of a parent like feeling of attention and positive energy which helps A LOT!|`|MFWEkkd9aa	Ok my lovely, you are aware that you don't want to do this any more, and that's the first step :)<br>  Can you visit your Doctor, all visits are confidential and, they WILL help you - you will probably be asked if you want to go to councelling, have a mentor - someone you can talk to freely without any worries.<br>  I'm so proud of you for taking this first step to getting better, I'm sure you'll be just fine, you are so brave.<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|R5TccYeAaa	Oh..im srry :[<br>  <br>  Well i am a 13 yr old.......and........i dont cut myself.<br>  I think you should rlly try to stop...ik it'll be hard for u..but rlly..it could hurt you later on in life. <br>  Im srry to hear tht tho :[<br>  <br>  and if anyones a jerk about this...dont listen to them..they r just being mean. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope u r able to stop! <br>  <br>  <br>  dont even think about suicide!!! <br>  u seem like a wonderful person, and plzz dont even think about suicide, it rlly is a horrible thing.<br>  but idt its just a phase..u have to want to be able to stop...and i hope u do.<br>  good luck.|`|80piiicYaa	No it not normal, iv heard that cutters do what they do because it gives them some sort of stability in their life that they can control. I dont know what to tell u except to stop doing what becauseur doing because u can really harm ur self.

I've got about 4 friends that cut and i used to do it. It is normal to want to cut yourself and its is definitely normal to be confused. You should stop cutting is all i can say. Its not helping you, if you really want help go to the hospital, if you go there and you show them your wrists they are legally obligated to help you. Don't kill yourself that doesn't solve anything. But you obviously need help, i have no idea who you are, but i'm sure that you'll be smart enough to do the right thing and get help which is what everyone needs, some people just need it more then others, i'm sure you're a great person, so don't think anything but that.|`|4DAqNHcEaa	when i was 13, i was a cutter too. i was basically addicted to it, like you've basically stated you were. this may sound a bit hypocritical, cause i was like this, but you shouldn't think cutting is the only way to solve your problems. i used to be in so much pain after i did cut, cause you can't admit it doesn't hurt, but yet i still did it. one day though, the last day i did it, i cut over 30 times all in one place and then i realized that cutting isn't the best thing to do. even though you have a screwed up life i'm sure there's people with even worse lives who don't cut and they can inspire you :]|`|gdVpLMz8aa	Talk to someone babe, i used to do it ages ago when i was about 16 i am 23 now, its not normal behaviour it means that theres something your not happy with in your life speak to someone babe or mail me jadecara@live.co.uk and  talk to me about it and we can try and work something out babe so sorry your not happy but it does get better i promise you it gets better xx

You may have small cuts inside, and the doctor will want to give you an antibiotic to combat any infection.  There is so much bacteria that is down there, and it's so easy to get that out of whack.<br>  If it's just a mild soreness, don't take baths (which can irritate your skin by over drying and heat), stay clear of thongs, don't use fragranced soap, and let it breathe when you can.  (if you're home ditch the undies and wear loose cotton pants).  <br>  When you do wear undies wear cotton ones.

gSo4dR7oaa	That depends on many things, including your body's response to the virus, the medication, and whether or not you take medication as prescribed. (Medication is not always prescribed when HIV is first diagnosed, but it is important to take it as directed when it is prescribed.) If you see a specialist and take your medication as directed when it is prescribed, and take care of yourself otherwise, you have a good chance of living many years before developing AIDS.

You could just go on medication but when you stop then the emotional reason is still there and the depression will come back. I personally think it is best not to go on medication but my opinion should not affect other people but i would warn them against side effects! I do feel GP's are quick to prescribe medication without exploring other options first like counselling, group therapy.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I've struggled with depression since things that happened in my childhood (Im 23 now).  I only sought medical help for it last year because I believed that having a diagnosis of mental health problems would have a negative impact on my life.  I realised the thing that was having the biggest negative impact on my life was my depression left untreated.  As soon as I saw my doctor I wished that I had done it sooner!<br>  <br>  To cut a long story short, I'm now on a combination of anti-depressants that seems to be suited to me.  My mood is MUCH more balanced than it used to be, I dont get the lows that I did before.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that if someone has clinical depression then they shouldnt be scared of taking anti-depressants.  Some people are really against the use of psychiatric drugs which I dont really understand.  Im sure they wouldnt hesitate to take medicine for a psychical problems, so why should mental illness be any different?<br>  <br>  Medicine isnt a "magic cure" for depression though.

Hopefully, though, it will do the trick.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|neu1gyQmaa	Yes i am on medication now for it and have been on it since october at first i didn't like it but after giving it some time i seen that it does help.|`|kGld130yaa	Hi there, yes I took medication. It was Prozac and in 400mg tablets. Ive been told since that this was quite strong, but to be honest, I never felt any different when taking them.
yotafojtaa	I have exactly the same thing right now, all you can do is the same thing as me and drink LOTS of water. It helps your throat and can clear your head a bit. Also, try and rest as much as possible. Eat oranges too, they contain lots of vitamin C which is especially good for you when you're ill :)
QjZgUSMkaa	Rhianna G, Health insurance can be very tricky. Since I live in Alabama I'm not sure about Minnesota regulations, so I suggest you visit a nearby insurance agent. <a href="http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Health-Insurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Healt...</a> They should be able to help you.|`|vc36XGXNaa	healthplans.bebto.com - my family have this health insurance.

xvey8ixPaa	No, there really is no alternative. I am deathly afraid of shots too. I know this seams wussy, but ask for a valium to take before you get the shot. It will take the edge off. But, for me, I just suck it up. I tell them how I react, i work myself up for it. I relax as much as possible, and I HAVE to watch them do it so I am not surprised. The shot  is so way worth your trip. Have someone you trust and that understands your reaction go with you. That way you can take the valium! They can drive, and you won't have to deal with someone that does not understand you.I feel for you! Good luck!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	there are none -grow up because the pain from an injection is less that the pain of bumping into a wall.|`|6be1690c7fe8ce017a68606b85137484aa	Think about how fun this trip will be, and how much you will miss out if you don't get your shot. It only takes a moment or two, and it will be over with! <br>  The last time I had to get a tetanus shot, I got myself all worked up and freaked out; and I didn't even feel it. The only soreness I felt was (in the muscle where the vaccine was injected) that evening and the next day. If it is bothersome, a little tylenol will help.<br>  I have fainted during blood draws and I experience vertigo when getting shots and IV's. I experienced this because I either hyperventilated or forgot to breathe, due to nerves. Nerves are likely the cause of your problems as well.  I am afraid of needles, but I am not near as bad about it as I used to be. I am still uneasy, (bit not terrified) and have to lie down. <br>  Ask to lie down, and just look away. The nurse will also talk to you to distract you. They do not want to hurt you. I even had a nurse apologize to me when I jumped slightly when she was inserting an IV yesterday. There are many, many needle phobes out there, and I am one of them.<br>  I was never offered any alternatives. You will have to get a shot, but it doesn't take long. Also, the more you deal with this type of thing, the less scared you will be in the future. I like being able to go in, get it over with, without feeling absolutely terrified. Head to the doctor, get it done and over with, and you will be on your way to one awesome summer trip.

87756LlTaa	You need to find a new doctor.  Or let the teacher write the prescription, since she is evidently qualified to diagnose you son with a relatively rare disease that will affect his ability to get college funding, jobs, and loans in the future.<br>  <br>  As a doctor, I watch teachers and parents force kids onto addictive, brain altering drugs.  Diagnosing ADHD formally takes months.  There is a long list of criteria to meet before the diagnosis can be made, and more than 90% of kids actually have another problem.  It is just easier for most parents (or doctors for that matter) to drug kids.  <br>  <br>  Now that I am done with my rant and my utter frustration about the misuse of medical knowledge.....<br>  <br>  It is very possible that you son does have a true form of ADHD.  If so, then your previous doctor is required, at your request, to release your son's full medical record(s).  If the process was complete, or mostly so, and done correctly, then the new doctor should be able to use this information and get your son the correct treatment quickly.  However, if the previous doc cut corners, didn't complete it, etc., then the new doc will not risk being sued by relying on his old info.  You always have the right and obligation to find the right doc for your son.  <br>  <br>  If the symptoms are this bad, then it is worth saving up for a few appointments if they are not covered by insurance.  I just hope your son doesn't wind up being one of millions who has been misdiagnosed.  Concerta, adderal, ritalin, and the others, all have major risks and life-long side effects.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck - I encourage you to find a new doc, one who will see your son sooner.|`|xuCY36yWaa	call the old doctor and explain the situation,ask for help or a referral to a competent doctor who cares.perhaps he can phone-in a refill till then

Using a clean dressing press gently so the fluid leaks out the hole.

Q9e6sqOTaa	First get some muscles. Start working out. And working out doesnt mean u have to go to the gym.. lol. Just start off with basic push-ups, sit-ups, running, biking, etc.. Make a routine and do it everyday. And when it gets easy, then add to it. run with weights. do more sit-ups/push-ups... And get some "cool" clothes. They dont have to be expensive designer clothes though.. just mix and match but find someone to kind of model after.. Someone that you view as tough.. And for the mental part, start hanging around "tough" guys. Or listen into convos.. You will easily pick up how to talk.. And get a cool hair cut.. If it's short, spike the front. And if it's long, make sure it doesn't poof out or anything that looks dorky.. But it's important that you stay friendly no matter what.. being mean never made anyone look/sound tough. it just made them a jerk that no body wanted to be around. lol.

That should definitely do it! <br>  <br>  But if you don't want to depend on someone else all the time, maybe try setting 3 different alarm clocks to go off at the same time, or set them to be really loud, so you simply would not be able to sleep through it or ignore them. Also, if you are not able to wake up easily, it means you aren't getting enough sleep. So try going to be earlier (aim for at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep), and your body should be able to wake up more easily. <br>  <br>  Is there a sound you really HATE (like a song, or a noise)? If so, see if you can somehow make that sound to wake you up and get you out of bed.

Y4ogWjHOaa	No, it is usually low blood pressure. You need to get it checked out.Try to get up more slowly. if you feel your blood pressure might be low as these symptoms would suggest, lie down again and raise your legs as high as you can on pillows, cushions, whatever you have to hand. Have your head as flat as possible (no pillows) Lye in that position for about 10 - 15 minutes. Then lower your legs to a flat position while remaining flat. Stay like that for a couple of minutes. Gradually sit up but don't stand up yet. Get to a sitting position on the side of the bed and very slowly begin to stand up. this should have made a difference.<br>  <br>  Please see your doctor or practise nurse to get your blood pressure checked though.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X|`|DEkQe6Zpaa	It could be--or it could  be that you're getting up too fast.  Try slowly getting up and if it still doesn't go away, go to the doctor.|`|g3IKGbr1aa	possibly ,could be low blood pressure,
8asG4WCwaa	walmart and may other pharmacies (walgreens, CVS, etc) carry inexpensive meters and strips.  I have several TrueTrack meters (each pharmacy gets to put their store brand ID on it, but they are still the same meter - which is nice because I can get trips anywhere, which can be a problem with other meters).  <br>  <br>  If you check around, the meter kit (meter, lancet device, a few strips and lancets, all in a zipper case) can be gotten free with the purchase of a bottle of strips ($25  to $50).  I like it because the strips are about fifty cents each and the meter cheap enough that if I loose it, it doesn't hurt my wallet to buy another one :-)  <br>  <br>  I like the true track lancet device better than the onetouch device, far less painful as far as how hard it slams into your finger :-) And test on the side of your finger, not the tip or pad because your use those areas a lot more.  <br>  <br>  They are pretty much as accurate as any other meter (no variation between truetrack and onetouch when I had both), just doesn't have all the extra features more expensive meters have (I used to have One Touch and never used any of those other features, most of them more applicable to type 1s). <br>  <br>  If you just need to monitor your levels and not juggle carb counts and different types of insulins, a cheap meter is fine.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	County hospital might give you a meter.  The strips are expensive.  It takes a minute to check your blood sugar.  Test on the upper arm, it doesn't hurt.|`|1PLFUli0aa	I am 23 years old with type 1 diabetes, I use the OneTouch Ultra Mini!

It is quick, you simply set the code to the code on the strips (takes about 2 seconds) and you are ready to go!|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	Many pharmacies will give you a free meter if you buy a box of test strips. The test strips are what get expensive, about a dollar each. If your doctor writes a prescription for them, your insurance may cover part of the cost.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	If you have insurance call your doctors office and request a prescription because the strips are expensive.  The Wal Mart or Target  brands are about half the price and still give you a result in about 5 seconds.  They just don't have as much memory.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	Yeah the trouble is, some SSRI's are quite activating (your symptoms) while others can be quite sedating.  On top of this, if you give two people the same SSRI, one can be activated and one can be sedated, and it's a puzzle to see who does what.<br>  <br>  Just stick with it, you should see the antidepressive effects within the next 2-3 weeks.  If by 6 weeks or so there's no change, you should see you doctor about titrating you onto a new medication.

One is to keep your hands clean and not to touch your mouth and eyes with hands that have not been thoroughly washed.  Two is that you are aware of how AIDS/HIV and other STDs can be transmitted.  <br>  <br>  There are plenty of germs out there besides.  Some people feel that by casual exposure you can build an immunity to various diseases.  (I;m not talking STDs now) But since you are concerned, you have to make a decision to be cautious so that you won't feel as horribly scared as you do now.<br>  <br>  You might want to discuss this with your lab teacher because it was wrong of this boy to wipe his blood of you or your clothing for any reason.  That is improper, thoughtless behavior and certainly is not a good idea in a lab (or any other setting)<br>  <br>  Check around for a free clinic, get a friend to go with you.  You'll feel better once the results are in and you see that you're okay.<br>  <br>  If you are not in counseling for the bulimia, perhaps this is good time to do that.  While you are sensitive to what can happen to you from the world around, you need to treat the world within.

I also used to have constant bacterial vaginosis that no one could explain, it was the tampons as they’re a major cause of health problems like that but so few people know about it no one ever suggested it to me…within the 6 years I’ve been using menstrual cups I’ve not had a single infection of any kind. Huge savings too, I mean with my flow being as heavy as it is it would cost me so much to still be using tampons and pads, I’d hate to think how I’d manage at the moment being out of work if I had to buy tampons and pads every month! Yeah, and it’s also good for the environment, 12,000+ tampons a woman throws away in her lifetime, then there’s all the harmful manufacturing, eep. It’s also nice to know the companies who make these products are so friendly, small companies rather than heartless corporations, they don’t use menstrual taboos to make women feel bad about their bodies, they also don’t constantly risk women’s health and lives through harmful ingredients or not safety testing their products. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, yeah I use a cup, now my periods are much easier, I do loads of work for all the different menstrual cup, cloth pads, sponge and organic menstrual product companies – leaflets and stickers in bathrooms, talks at GUM clinics etc. and I’m going into a full-time career in sexual health as a result of cups (I thought ‘if I didn’t know about these, what else don’t I know about?’ and started studying sexual health). Cups are by far the best invention ever and the best thing to use during periods!|`|f2ef10d3d131060a658a610b8e839133aa	Mooncups ROCK! Not quite so sure about the reusable pads, though.... don't they have to be washed all the time? Also, they're more expensive than conventrional pads (as far as I can gather)|`|8551IHm0aa	could you explain what they are|`|GIkyDUulaa	i didnt even know those existed...never heard of them before|`|9RcwQgNpaa	I've bought a  menstrual cup (femmecup) a few months ago, and (this will sound like I work for them or something!) it's brilliant.  I don't use anything else now, it's less messy than tampons were and I've not had any yeast infection either, which I often had after using tampons.<br>  <br>  I wish I'd had one for the last 20 years!<br>  <br>  No one else I know uses one though.  I told a couple of friends about them but they thought I was a bit strange I think.  Oh well, I think they'd take off if more people knew about them.|`|A32d7lIlaa	Yes, I use a DivaCup and a LadyCup and LOVE them!!!<br>  <br>  ~I don't understand how people think cups and cloth pads are gross either, since being on your period is pretty disgusting no matter what you use!|`|FWWegktKaa	no I don't use reusable stuff, I use sanitary towels.<br>  I've heard of them before and I know people who use them so your not the only one!|`|DUPtQntlaa	I don't but I've heard of menstrual cups.|`|zKAtOueQaa	i use pads|`|LrGmpacOaa	I use a cup. Best invention EVER. I have a DivaCup but I've been considering trying Lunette.<br>  <br>  However, there are some things about the Keeper company you should know.<br>  <br>  They have recently come out with the silicon "MoonCup." However, there has been a UK-based cup company called MoonCup for years. The Keeper company then took legal action to ban the MoonCup UK from being shipped to the US.<br>  <br>  This is very under-handed, since there is no possible way a menstrual cup company was not aware of the competition, and MoonCup UK has been around for YEARS before the Keeper invented their silicon MoonCup.<br>  <br>  I would urge you to consider whether or not it is truly ethical to purchase from such a company in the future.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of other manufacturers to choose from. DivaCup is available in stores in the US, and MiaCup, Lunette, LadyCup, FemmeCup, etc will all ship to the US as well.

After he wants to go up and down a couple of times, he's going to want to go full speed ahead. Sweetheart, that's the trick from a man that will try and persuade you to do whatever it takes to get in your panties. And if you decide to do it, make him wear a condom, you can still get an STD from just a "few seconds". THINK SMART!|`|Qq8Ss9yKaa	No, please stop by my house later for no sex.<br>  <br>  You know the real answer, you just want to do it without actually thinking you are doing it.<br>  <br>  Kind of like saying "if I drink half a shot of vodka, is that drinking?"<br>  <br>  Whatever floats your boat in your mind. But it still sinks in the real world!|`|3PQpb3Ybaa	Sex is defined as penetration, no matter how short the amount of time.

And if you do this, make sure you use a condom because there is a possibility you could get pregnant from trace amounts of sperm that can sometimes be present in pre-ejaculate.|`|fnCbVvaoaa	yes. it is a form of sex and it can get you pregnant. it is known as the withdrawal method.|`|DjA307Vcaa	sex  <br>   when a man puts his penis inside a womans vagina <br>  usually done for pleasure by teens and horny people <br>  done to make babies <br>   <br>  |`|fb04839aeb38d0d795844ac87cf2917eaa	Yes it is sex and yes you can get pregnant from it.|`|Xi9s3w8oaa	Penetration = sex :)|`|eR2rrcJcaa	sex is when the PENIS ENTERS THE VAGINA.|`|dJ0IVr7Haa	Yeah, I tried that a few times with chicks!  1/2 fell for it!|`|cA9k0SL1aa	 HA!

Some people think even oral is sex. It is up to debate. He didnt ***, and it obviously wasnt good or complete-so if you want it to be a no...its a no. |`|hopUhqBRaa	yeah it is...it doesn't matter how long its for it is still sex, you can get pregnant, so if you are SURE you want to do it make sure he wears a condom and you have birth control pills.|`|UjidmqR8aa	Yep. <br>  <br>  Even if he was in you for one second, it's still sex, and you can still get pregnant. <br>  <br>  But there is no guy on earth that would only go up and down a couple of times.|`|WQ7MNKxfaa	LMFAO.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	Could be anything from a brachial cleft cyst, to mumps, to bad mono, to a viral infection to a swollen lymph node.<br>  <br>  Easiest thing to do is to see your GP or ENT if you have one, they'll be able to determine it by an examination and some bloodwork if needed.|`|CJCHyiuCaa	dont know and i really dont care its your problem|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	is he having dental issues such as a cavity that could be abcessed? <br>  <br>  just a thought...
AA10363258	I would recommend going to the doctor about that.  It looks kind of serious. good luck.|`|ELcwi4XRaa	could be a yeast infection, or shingles.
AG9msdUDaa	It seems to be an epidemic these days that people cut themselves. I only knew one person who did this growing up and now I know 5 plus almost every other question in the mental health section on this site seems to be related to this kind of thing some days. <br>  <br>  So I did a little research because this is an unusual trend and I found out that they have done some animal studies on this phenomenon. Yes, animals self-harm to. So why would animals do this if they don't have to worry about school and work and family etc? They found out it was a l-tryptophan deficiency leading to a serotonin deficiency in the brain and the self-harm releases endorphins which can be used in the brain to make the missing serotonin! Crazy right?<br>  <br>  So one thing you can try right now today is to eat food high in l-tryptophan like turkey and avocado's etc and make sure to keep this up for a few weeks and see how you feel. OR you can simply order this as a supplement online! Give it a try, you never know, it may work.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can look into is other nutritional deficiencies related to depression/anxiety. For that just ask your doctor for a general metabolic profile (GMP) and ask to actually see the results. You need to be mid range to actually be ok.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	You NEED help. <br>   You also need to try to get out of the bad situation (so long as it is actually bad and you aren't just overreacting).  It is good that you and your friends made that pact, but you should tell her you are having trouble keeping it.  She can help you!<br>  <br>  Your mom thinks you are being stupid for almost killing yourself!?  It IS stupid, but it is a kind of stupidity that means you need help.  If she won't take you to a psychiatrist, go yourself or talk to your school counselor.  They will be able to either convince your mom to get you help, or, if your situation is bad enough, get the state to take over your case so you can have a better life and get the treatment you need.<br>  <br>  You should go see a psychiatrist and they will probably give you some meds to help you feel more stable and less suicidal.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	Stop cutting youself. Life may be hard and rough but everyone gets over it. By killing yourself is not going to work, trust me. Its self control hun. Talk to a school counselour or someone you really trust, such as your best friend. If she is your best friend she will help you through this. <br>  Good Luck :]|`|qpmfZu8eaa	Hey. im 15 yrs old and went through the same thing when i was 14.....if u ever need to tlk to someone, im here. message me or IM me n e time... take care{i understand}|`|8KFpNE3Kaa	email/ i.m. me<br>  <br>  have all the same thoughts...|`|ltXxNfwRaa	I'm sorry for your pain and I know how difficult it is.  What youre doing isnt stupid, but a cry for help.<br>  <br>  I think your mom is scared and doesnt quite know how to deal with your situation.  She may think that if she acts like what youre doing is dissapointing, then you'll stop... when in actuallity you feel regretful for opening up to someone who you think you can trust, but doesnt understand.<br>  <br>  I used to have the same thoughts... I didnt cut myself but there were other things that I did... when my ex boyfriend's dad killed himself, I saw how painful it made everyone around him.  Suddenly the thought of ending my own life wasnt so great after all.  In reality, if you were successful with suicide, you might be done with pain yourself, but think of your friends, family, mom, dad etc... sometimes it doesnt seem like people care, but a lot of the time its only because they are selfish and dont realize what they have until its gone... but suicide isnt one of those lessons you want to teach anyone.  Think of how devastated you would be if your mom or one of your friends did what you were thinking of doing... sometimes the thought alone would hurt so bad that you wouldnt want anyone else to go thru that!<br>  <br>  You dont belong in a hospital, or a mental institution or anything like that... you would probably be best talking to a kids helpline or check with your school if there is an annonymous coucelling program where you can speak to someone that isnt going to judge you.<br>  <br>  Once you're 18 or older and you've beaten this... you'll look back and be so glad you stuck it out, because you'll be in control... you'll be the one that chooses the people in your life and filter out the ones that dont make you happy and do whatever it is that you want to do etc.  I did that and I couldnt be happier!  14 is a tough age, you dont have much control and it seems like time is taking forever to tick by... but it'll be worth it if you stick around!<br>  <br>  Even something like this, answering other people's questions can free your mind from all of the hurt you have inside because you'll be possibly helping others... invent something... build something... do something that requires your attention and defers your thoughts away from suicide.  Just take it one step at a time and really try talking to someone other than your family... good luck!|`|S5EWaOD3aa	get a hobby. when i was suicidal i got in weight lifting and eventually i stopped even thinkin about it. More than anything it made me feel better about  myself, it might work for you too.|`|BdM2BZ69aa	I'd suggest going online and searching for local counseling groups, preferably with people your own age going through similar situations. Also, Finding a blog site, and using it like a sort of secret journal venting out frustrations. Even just typing when you feel like cutting, type what you feel, and what you're trying to achieve by cutting, instead of actually cutting. Sometimes writing and reading these things helps a lot more than just thinking them. I hope you find mental peace and are able to at least lessen your self-hurting.|`|MubGySVAaa	Please, for your own sake, get some help from a mental health professional. Cutting yourself is not the answer, and it is great that you are reaching out for help. There are people out there who can help you, and this is the hardest part. You've gotten through the bit that most people can't admit-that they have a problem. You can get through this.  I suggest reading this website, it helped me when I was suicidal: <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/</a><br>  <br>  Your mother is probably scared and doesn't know how to help you. Don't hate her for it, just understand that she may not have the answers. Do you have a school counselor or a therapist you can go to? Any of those people will not judge you. You have a mental issue, and they want to help. <br>  <br>  I am deeply sorry that you feel this way, but you can get better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, and hang in there. You can do this!

e3b4913f44cd6f4d8fa6eb99cb4520caaa	You can look at this in one of two ways. Snakes can represent chamge and or fear, fear of change and hope and dashing of hope. The change comes from the nature of the snake changing its skin periodically. It can therefore represent regeneration and hope. How can you tell if the snakes in your dream are good or bad omens.  You admit that you are afraid of snakes. Your pug brought them to you dead. Is he forcing you to see some dashed hopes, futile dreams or the defeat of those dreams that awaits you.  You venture out (a bold sign) and find your garden infested with small snakes. They are alive and fast and can hurt you, but they are none the less small and next to growing plants another sign of growth and regeneration and change. Looking on the positive side, the dead dreams and hopes that you saw earlier have been replaced by  more realistic hopes and dreams. Least you ignore them, they bite you and demand attention. This tells me you are in a state of flux about to disgard some old perhaps harmful notions or people in place of newer and perhaps beneficial ones. Overall, I see the dream as positive and a harbinger of real change and hope.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	No, it just means that what you see gets all packed into your brain. Thats what happens when you sleep. So for example say you eat a bunch of ice cream that day or you watch a scary T.V. show your brain will "combined" those together in your dream. And your afraid of snakes so thats why, nothings wrong.|`|RvqYrdBHaa	some say that snakes in a dream signify really sleezy or sneaky people in your life.  or distrust of something.  uncomfortable with a situation that you feel forced to confront|`|B5Y46XBoaa	I don't like snakes either and nowadays I'm surprised we're not all having snakey dreams.

If you just got your contatcts they are probably the newer silicone hydrogel type. Opti-Free is recommended for that type. Most of the others like Renu have a chemical in them that is know to cause corneal staining (cell damage) if used with silicone hydrogels. Check for an ingredient with "biguanide" as part of its name. If it is present then that solution should not be used with silicone lenses. Even some brands of saline have it as a preservative.

Don't just go off gaining random pounds by eating many fatty foods. And also, if you want a more defined butt, eat foods high in proteins and maybe some fats, but then work out. Do work outs and stretches and other types of weight training that focuses mainly on your glutes. I know of some but you'd need an aerobic elastic band thing. I hope i helped!!!|`|zHL6LRejaa	build muscle and try not to eat all those greasy foods
zEKIsUd5aa	You can easily drop 5-7 pounds of water weight by changing NOTHING about your diet except cutting out ALL drinks except water... and if you need caffeine, choosing Coffee over sugary soda. And only drinking one cup a day.<br>  But it's just water weight. You may notice your stomach going down a little, but you are not going to be in a smaller pant size or anything.<br>  BUT... if you do the water thing and cut out all eating after 6pm and all candy and junk food... you can loose more and have more significant results.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, be safe, no diet pills or Energy drinks.|`|f2b988a779dc23c67eceb390d5da9084aa	It depends on how much you weigh to begin with<br>  for someone who has quite a bit to lose,its easy to lose 10 pounds the first week by just regular dieting and then faster the first week it goes down to 2 pounds or so a week....<br>  <br>  now if you dont have a lot to lose then you wont lose as much the first week....<br>  the amount you lose depends on 2 things....<br>  the amount of exercise you do<br>  and the amount of calories you take in each day<br>  <br>  but one good thing for you is you always lose more the first week no matter what,because its water weight....<br>  <br>  eat things like oatmeal,fruit,vegetables,chicken breast,canned tuna in water,baked or grilled fish,fat free yogurt,baked potato with salsa on top,diet pop,lots of water<br>  <br>  exercise twice a day for 30 minutes each time<br>  walking counts with or without a treadmill<br>  you can even do those walk away the pounds videos inside ur house<br>  dancing is another good exercise<br>  bicycling,roller skating/blading<br>  etc...<br>  stay under 1200 calories each day<br>  dont add salt to your food<br>  only use splenda sweetner<br>  no sugar<br>  no butter<br>  only drink water,diet pop,crystal light,or coffee|`|2uOAl0W0aa	You can safely lose 6 pounds in 9 days using the Isagenix 9 day cleanse system.

Go back to your smaller size and try again this time waiting maybe 3 or 4 weeks instead of 2. When you gauge make sure you use something for a lubricant. This can prevent bleeding as well.
0TT5q0cUaa	Treatment depends upon the type of tumour and the extent of spread of the cancer. In most cases, radiation therapy or surgery are the common treatment methods. Surgery may involve total removal of the larynx (laryngectomy) or partial cutting away of the vocal cords. In both the procedures, a hole is made in the neck through which a tube is inserted into the windpipe to help the patient to breathe. This may be temporary or permanent. In cases where a laryngectomy is performed, the patient has to learn a new way to speak with the help of artificial devices and this requires extensive speech therapy. <br>  <br>  Radiation therapy is also a common method of treatment. Cancerous cells from a localised area are destroyed with the help of high powered rays. Radiation therapy is used in conjunction with surgery in cases where there is recurrence of the tumour after surgery. Chemotherapy may be done in case the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. <br>  <br>  there are a lot of hospitals in new delhi which can treat throat cancer.<br>  <br>  Aashlok Hospital <br>  25-A/AB Block, Safdarjang Enclave <br>  26165901/02/03/04 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Aditya Varma Medical Centre <br>  Vikas Marg <br>  011-22448008, 22043839 <br>  011-42440108 <br>  avhrc@rediffmail.com <br>    <br>  All India Institute of Medical Sciences <br>  Aurobindo Marg <br>  26569461, 26561123, 26864865 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Anand Hospital <br>  B-52, Main Najafgarh Road  <br>  25506688 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Anand Hospital <br>  21, Community Centre, Preet Vihar <br>  22520480 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Balak Ram Hospital <br>  Timarpur <br>  23914315, 23984204 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Bara Hindu Rao Hospital <br>  Malka Ganj <br>  2919706, 2919562 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Base Hospital <br>  Delhi Cantonment <br>  25691997 <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre <br>  1, Tughlakabad Institutional Area, <br>  26056148, 26056153 <br>   <br>  batra@del3.vsnl.net.in <br>    <br>  Central Hospital, Northern Railway <br>  Basant Lane, Connaught Place <br>  23734009|`|jQt1NOOxaa	there are so many hospitals in Delhi. still you can think about AUT.Be vegetarian, use Auto urine therapy.

G6V4oRjKaa	To get rid of inflammation you may want to look into the study of THC which has been found to be a very effective cure used in the right proportions to reduce inflamatory tissue, without any psychoactive effects.<br>  <br>  Hemp seed oil contains next to no THC whatsoever. hemp seed oil is very nutritious as hemp seeds are used to fatten livestock and are also used to feed birds and other animals. shelled hemp seeds are a very healthy snack. <br>  <br>  They contain every necessary vitamin, amino acid and raw fatty acid needed to stay alive and be healthy, you could practically live off them. They also contain omega 3 essential fatty acids which aid in improving brain and joint functions (haha he said joint... you numb nuts) 100g of hemp seeds is equivalent to 570 calories. <br>  <br>  It provides proteins that contribute to a healthy life style and a balanced diet. Recommended daily intake for a person with an average build, is 2-4 dessert spoons (up to 50 ml) per day, or in the case of therapy this can be increased up to 150ml per day for approximately 7 days then reverting to the normal daily intake amount. The requirement of oil intake is now widely accepted as being 15%-20% of calorific requirement (daily average of 2000 calories for an average adult). EFA oils contain embodied energy of 9 calories per ml, which is mainly used by the body for structural, hormonal and electrical functions, rather than energy.<br>  Hemp oil can also be used externally on the skin, easily absorbed and moisturising, suitable for poor condition skin. <br>  <br>  Apart from the obvious health benefits many things can be made from hemp seed oil such as bio-diesel, and even biodegradable plastic substitutes. From the actual plant: 1 hectare of raw plant material can produce the same amount of paper as 4.5 hectares of woodland trees.<br>  <br>  The hemp we are talking about has nearly no THC content, this has been selectively bred out of industrial hemp strains and can not be used as a drug. Nevertheless even hemp cultivation requires a license and is illegal if you don't have one.|`|VPlKbDplaa	Bromelain might help with both inflammation and chronic pain.....particularly arthritic pain or back pain:<br>  <a href="http://www.painrelief101.com/natural-health-treatments/bromelain-reduces-inflammation-and-pain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.painrelief101.com/natural-hea...</a><br>  The omega 3 in hemp seed oil coul dhelp also.

afJz77pjaa	I'm really sorry she's reacting this way. Some people are just more emotional about it than others. Let her know that you are the same person and that testicular cancer is very treatable with a high percentage of full remission. And make it seem like it's not a big deal. Yes, cancer is hard to cope with and it is a big deal, but you do what you do to survive. Even if it means cracking jokes about it and letting people know you're fine, even if you're not. <br>  <br>  Let her know that curing cancer is part psychological and that you need her to be positive for you. You can have all the best medicines in the world, but without a positive attitude, it can be a struggle. <br>  <br>  And if all else fails, I'm sorry to say, if she can't handle this bump in the road, how will she handle other things, like the cancer spreading? There are people out there that would cope with this situation better and will help you with your battle, not bring you down. <br>  <br>  Best of luck with treatment. I know it's not a walk in the park.|`|AA11020187	There is no normal way of handling situations like this as everyone deals with things in their own way. However, it seems that she has been given the message that her behavior is expected and acceptable otherwise she would have known from the beginning and would not have just “found out” about it. She has some growing up to do. Treat her like an adult and talk to her about your issues not her mother.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	You have misunderstood her,what you should give to her is form a group of people in your city &have discussions about cancerous people  so that she can accept cancer as just a disease.Many are like her ,we have to convince them|`|Ohcyim3Kaa	Hi.  I looked through your questions because sometimes people make this stuff up.  So I saw the rest of your comments.  One thing puzzles me, though - you said it was Stage One.  Does your comment at the end mean it's spread?<br>  <br>  Here's why I ask.  As you've been told, you'll probably be fine, but if you require further treatment, there's going to be ups and downs where you don't feel well, physically or mentally.  You cannot have someone in your life who is draining you! Your GFs reaction isn't all that unusual, but it's also not acceptable.  You may be approaching a point where you need to tell her she's either with you or she's not.  You need people in your life who are there for you, not those explaining why they're not.<br>  <br>  Also, I noted that you talk to her mother frequently.  It's good that you're close to her, but it's not good if talking to mom becomes a substitute for talking to GF.  No one knows for sure what's going through GF's mind except GF.  So, since you're 30 and I assume GF is in the same age group, you need to get mom out of the communication link :)<br>  <br>  Finally be sure there's isn't something else causing her behavior.  Again, the only way you'll know this is by going to the horse's mouth - GF.  If she's having other problems, you might be too much for her to handle.  That's very understandable, but if you're planning marriage or this is a long-term commitment, her priorities need realigning.  You need to be at the top of her list, especially if she's at the top of yours.  (And if she's not, that may be another problem!).<br>  <br>  Oh well. I didn't mean to write a book.  Best of luck and give this some thought.|`|SQLSOeHcaa	When someone you love is diagnosed with cancer is "very hard" "emotionally".. also "mentally"... not knowing how to react, what you should do... or not do.... say or not say...... I know this, because my brother was diagnosed with lung cancer!... I had to do some research and talk to a few people for support because I was so overwhelmed with emotions and instead of staying close to him I kind of distant myself for a while... It's totally normal... But, he told me how he felt and we were able to break that barrier.<br>  <br>  How to react when someone you  love has cancer can be a bewildering experience for everyone involved. Insensitive comments, awkward pauses and ridiculous gaffes can come pouring out as soon as the 'C' word is mentioned....i think you should let her know exactly how you feel, she is probably afraid of saying the wrong thing, reacting in a way that might upset you, etc... I don't think she is ignoring you, it's just such a difficult thing to deal with not only for the patient but also for the people around you that loves you!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and stay POSITIVE!<br>  <br>  God Bless!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://a2eatwrite.blogspot.com/2009/01/help-for-those-suffering-from-cancer.html" rel="nofollow">http://a2eatwrite.blogspot.com/2009/01/h...</a>|`|gVITlOMUaa	everyone has a different response to their loved one when told of the news of cancer.My husband was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on July 1st 2008. He probably had it for even 9 months before that because he was complaining of stomach pain. At first I didn't know what to say or how to act or what to do! But through prayer and meditation ( everyone has different ways of dealing with it) I was able to muster  up the courage I needed to bravely face the disease with him and  ended up taking care of him for 7 months and being there for him 24/7 which was the most important and valuable thing to me. I loved him and always will . Your girlfriend might be in shock right now and may not come around but in time she might end up realizing that you need her and she needs you and in the long run perhaps she will become brave and be b y your side as well. Time will tell and hopefully she will come around.

The doctors need to see your grandma and examine her as well as evaluate all her laboratory tests.  They can then make an educated decision about how to best treat her.  If she is in the ICU and has a good internist looking after her she's in good hands.  Talk to the nurses and doctors who are caring for her.  They will have a good handle on what's happening.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of an underlying disease and not a specific illness. Nausea is the sensation that the stomach wants to empty itself, while vomiting (emesis) or throwing up, is the act of forcible emptying of the stomach.<br>  The timing of the nausea or vomiting can indicate the cause. When appearing shortly after a meal, nausea or vomiting may be caused by food poisoning, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), an ulcer, or bulimia. Nausea or vomiting one to eight hours after a meal may also indicate food poisoning. However, certain food borne bacteria, such as salmonella, can take longer to produce symptoms.<br>  Adults should consult a doctor if vomiting occurs for more than one day, diarrhea and vomiting last more than 24 hours, or there are signs of moderate dehydration.|`|bbn2YvrKaa	You might have a stomach flu or food poisoning.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is that you stay hydrated.

If you work in a place that is dusty for example this can cause irritation. this filmy substance is a way for the eye to clean out what is irritating it. try to find an eye wash and cleans the eyes especially before bed, but if it is alot you could contact your doctor and see if you have an infection|`|VYGViBb6aa	welll your eye cleans itself to get rid of dirt using the little pinhole nearest your nose so its probably dirt but maybe an infection see your doc to make sure

Seriously, that's hecka lame. And I have a friend who's on zoloft and she's 16 and it helps her immensely! You don't have to be 18 or whatever that other person said.. Try another type of antidepressant. They're all different and each will have a different effect on you.. I take prozac and it helps me.. I've cut myself too and it's hard for me to explain when I'm not really upset, but basically I think it's because it's the only thing in my life that I have full control over.. And I feel like I've screwed a lot of stuff up so it's almost like a rewarding punnishment(if that makes any sense..).. lol.. But basically you should keep searching for someone you can talk to that really helps you and you can tell anything to without feeling like somethings holding you back.. Someone you can trust... It sounds like you also get stressed a lot for one reason or another and having a person you can vent to really helps sometimes.. Just stay away from drugs and alcohol to get you through.. It really added to my problems... Good luck!

iK3YYRaTaa	For Type 1: In the fall of 1920 Dr. Frederick Banting had an idea that would unlock the mystery of the dreaded diabetes disorder. Before this, for thousands of years, a diabetes diagnosis meant wasting away to a certain death. Working at a University of Toronto laboratory in the very hot summer of 1921 Fred Banting and Charles Best were able to make a pancreatic extract which had anti diabetic characteristics. They were successful in testing their extract on diabetic dogs. Within months Professor J. J. R. MacLeod, who provided the lab space and general scientific direction to Banting and Best, put his entire research team to work on the production and purification of insulin. J.B. Collip joined the team and with his technical expertise the four discoverers were able to purify insulin for use on diabetic patients. The first tests were conducted on Leonard Thompson early in 1922. These were a spectacular success. Word of this spread quickly around the world giving immediate hope to many diabetic persons who were near death. A frenzied quest for insulin followed. Some patients in a diabetic coma made miraculous recoveries. <br>  <br>  While insulin is not a cure, this medical discovery has and continues to save millions of lives world-wide. The production of insulin has changed a great deal since 1922. Modern science and technology has made high quality insulin and delivery systems available to diabetic persons.<br>  <br>  For Type 2:Metformin is the oldest and most effective.Discovered around 1920.|`|Y4ogWjHOaa	If you mean a diabetes medication, Metformin is the most common tablet or  insulin by injection.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X
OMZRWrmtaa	This is an unusual problem.  Does this ever happen when you have NOT eaten bacon?  I'd suspect  it has something to do with the fact that bacon is oily, and that smells and tastes based on oil are more permeable.  It's possible that you have tonsiliths, which are tiny pits on your tonsils that collect food particles.  Not every person has these, and they develop later in life as you become an adult.  I'm still not entirely convinced it's a biological problem, though.  There are cases of neurological disorders where a person smells or tastes things that aren't there.  This sounds scary, but in your case, is probably less likely.  You should mention this to your doctor on your next checkup, or if you're concerned about it, schedule an appointment.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	The cops are steaking out your house this is why you can smell bacon|`|l1qNr8gQaa	If you eat pigs you will smell like a pig from every pore.|`|MEHpgZzZaa	try eliminating bacon from you diet completely for a few months (its not all that healthy anyways). if it continues, go see a doc -its probably not bacon by then|`|AjPbtm7oaa	You probably got some stuck in your teeth & it's decomposing.

0TT5q0cUaa	The symptoms of AIDS are the symptoms of the diseases that attack the body because of a weakened immune system. One should never, therefore, attempt to diagnose HIV infection on the basis of symptom or signs only. Patients with HIV/AIDS may present with a variety of manifestations which include: <br>  <br>  <br>  Fever, sweats, chills <br>  <br>  Fatigue <br>  <br>  Loss of appetite, weight loss <br>  <br>  nausea, vomiting <br>  <br>  Sore throat <br>  <br>  Diarrhoea <br>  <br>  Cough <br>  <br>  Shortness of breath <br>  <br>  Body rash <br>  <br>  Skin problems<br>  <br>  It is important to always keep in mind that all the above symptoms are non-specific and commonly occur in a variety of conditions. To establish a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS a blood test that has been confirmed is essential. A physical examination and other tests are necessary to rule out other illnesses.|`|aCDWwsisaa	AIDS doesn't have any "symptoms", it damages your immune system so that your body cannot effectively fight off any infectious attack...people don't actually "die" of AIDS, they die from one or more of dozens of opportunistic infections...so victims exhibit the symptoms of those infections.|`|AA12156890	The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.<br>  <br>  Early infection<br>  When first infected with HIV, you may have no signs or symptoms at all, although it's more common to develop a brief flu-like illness two to four weeks after becoming infected. Signs and symptoms may include:<br>  <br>      * Fever<br>      * Headache<br>      * Sore throat<br>      * Swollen lymph glands<br>      * Rash<br>  <br>  Even if you don't have symptoms, you're still able to transmit the virus to others. Once the virus enters your body, your own immune system also comes under attack. The virus multiplies in your lymph nodes and slowly begins to destroy your helper T cells (CD4 lymphocytes) - the white blood cells that coordinate your entire immune system.<br>  <br>  Later infection<br>  You may remain symptom-free for eight or nine years or more. But as the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may develop mild infections or chronic symptoms such as:<br>  <br>      * Swollen lymph nodes - often one of the first signs of HIV infection<br>      * Diarrhea<br>      * Weight loss<br>      * Fever<br>      * Cough and shortness of breath<br>  <br>  Latest phase of infection<br>  During the last phase of HIV - which occurs approximately 10 or more years after the initial infection - more serious symptoms may begin to appear, and the infection may then meet the official definition of AIDS. In 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) redefined AIDS to mean the presence of HIV infection as shown by a positive HIV-antibody test plus at least one of the following:<br>  <br>      * The development of an opportunistic infection - an infection that occurs when your immune system is impaired - such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)<br>      * A CD4 lymphocyte count of 200 or less - a normal count ranges from 800 to 1,200<br>  <br>  By the time AIDS develops, your immune system has been severely damaged, making you susceptible to opportunistic infections. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:<br>  <br>      * Soaking night sweats<br>      * Shaking chills or fever higher than 100 F (38 C) for several weeks<br>      * Dry cough and shortness of breath<br>      * Chronic diarrhea<br>      * Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth<br>      * Headaches<br>      * Blurred and distorted vision<br>      * Weight loss<br>  <br>  You may also begin to experience signs and symptoms of later stage HIV infection itself, such as:<br>  <br>      * Persistent, unexplained fatigue<br>      * Soaking night sweats<br>      * Shaking chills or fever higher than 100 F (38 C) for several weeks<br>      * Swelling of lymph nodes for more than three months<br>      * Chronic diarrhea<br>      * Persistent headaches <br>  <br>  If you're infected with HIV, you're also more likely to develop certain cancers, especially Kaposi's sarcoma, cervical cancer and lymphoma, although improved treatments have reduced the risk of these illnesses.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Weight loss, fragile bones, liver problems, kidney failure, a very low immune system, and eventually death.

0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	Probably not likely, but of course you can never be sure. What you do have to worry about a lot more is STDs. STDs are transmitted particularly easily from men to women through anal sex. You should certainly go get tested for STDs as soon as you can, and be sure to use a condom in the future, no matter what other form of birth control you're using in addition.

If you're using it to treat a vaginal infection you don't eat it...you wear it!!!!<br>  <br>  But only use natural, pro-biotic/live yogurt...no sugar or fruit!!!!<br>  <br>  "Eat"....lol, priceless!!!!!!!  Roflmao!!!!!|`|8pw8qDjPaa	i havent heard of eating yogurt to help a yeast infection. you have to put it on the "site" lol! i was told to freeze it. take a tampon out and put some yogart in the applicator then freeze it... then you put it in your vagina. you're supposed to use original yogart... no yogart with anything added to it or any flavor or anything! there something in the yogart thats supposed to help kill the bacteria or the yeast or whatever its called. i'm not sure how long to do it... but normal yeast infection methods you have to use for a week... so i'd say at least use it for a few nights. it would probably work best if you do it when you go to bed so the yogart will kinda stay in. make sure you wear a light pad though in case you leak. i'm not going to lie, its really uncomforable to stick an icicle up your vagina.. but it did help a little. i havent done it long enought to know if its actually going to cure it or not though.|`|7G4hisdzaa	You need to get yogurt that is "active".

Zt6eh6VRaa	There is no quck way to get rid of acne, but here's a good start:<br>  <br>  You can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.

7PivTe5yaa	Social ramifications - all depends on the individual and how they are impacted by fragile x. Like autism fragile X is a spectrum disorder, some (mostly females) may have no social ramifications other than how they personally deal with knowing they carry a genetic disorder which may not come into play until they are much older. A female who might have limited symptoms may suffer from social anxiety, very much an introvert, very shy. <br>  <br>  A child/adult with more severe symptoms anxiety, sensitivity to noise, light, strange environments, transitions may opt out of many community experiences, have a limited circle of friends. <br>  <br>  Phenotype - Once again you must keep in mind it is a spectrum disorder not all will have the same characteristics, some may have none, some may have many. In addition, some of the features are common in many individuals who do not have fragile X, i.e. long face, large protruding ears, Strabismus, Hands and feet manifest nonspecific findings, including hyper-extensible finger joints, hand calluses, double-jointed thumbs, a single palmar crease, and pes planus, dental overcrowding and a high-arched palate, macroorchidism  in adult males.<br>  <br>  Is it preventable - well yes if you know you have it you could choose not to have children or use PGD/IVF.<br>  <br>  Is it fatal - no, individuals typically have a normal lifespan.|`|KTTmuMtAaa	That's a great answer SallyN, got it all in one.<br>  Fragile X Syndrome is caused by an inherited X chromosome passed down through generations until it has mutated enough to cause the full blown syndrome. The way in which it is passed down is the same as Downs Syndrome, only few know about FX because it is physically less apparent in babies and tends only to be recognised when mental<br>  and physical development starts to fall behind.<br>  Because of the extremely high risk of the child inheriting the disease from premutation carriers (50%) the best course of action is to undergo IVF with PGD. <br>  FX is the most common cause of mental/physical disability in the world - much more publicity is needed.
v0j2pJupaa	Tanning does put you at risk for skin cancer but it may be a risk that some of us wish to take -- other people smoke or drink or drive too fast, some of us like the sun too much.  <br>  <br>  So if you are going to tan from time to time I would use lots of sun screen (don't burn yourself and ruin your vacation!) and you can use a  spray bottle of water to cool off.  I also love to get into the pool or ocean and that cools me down.  You can also use a wet towel over your face and eyes.  Or put one part of your body in the sun and another part of your body in the shade.  It also helps to "flip" from side to side.  Have fun!|`|BSfXOKGcaa	If you want to tan, be very careful. Still use sunscreen, you'll burn yourself extremely bad if you tan without any sunscreen.|`|cdoLcoc0aa	This is probably not what you want to hear but tanning is very bad for your skin. You may look good for a few weeks when you're young, but when you're older and your skin is wrinkled and damaged from the sun you'll realize what a bad idea it was. If you must go out in the sun, use ample amounts of sunscreen every hour or so and try wearing a hat.|`|9zBAACz4aa	DONT TAN! use fake tan

You should both head back to the doctor's office, just to make sure that you are both disease free.

Don't do this everyday, do it only 2-3 times a week or try putting lemon juice diluted on your face. Reduce your stress levels, maybe that's the main cause of our acne. Drink water instead of soda. Make sure the food you eat dosen't contain a lot of oil because this can cause more oil in the oil glands of your face. I don't really know about this one but i'll just say it, you can try homeopathic acne tablets. It cures acne naturally but it takes around 2 months until your acne goes away.

VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi Lauren,<br>  <br>  First thing is that you are not crazy.  The points I would like to mention here which you recognise are:<br>  <br>  -  You self-harm<br>  -  You know that self-harming is controlling your life<br>  -  You have isolated yourself rom society<br>  -  You have mood swings<br>  -  You have a problem that needs looking at<br>  <br>  I mean the points raised by yourself above is a great start for change.  Your behaviour is normal considering your condition.  You are also looking at the right way to sort out your problem by wanting to go and see your doctor.<br>  <br>  When you go to see your doctor, just tell him/her that you self harm and you want to stop.  A Doctor would never push you to answer his/her questions.  Only tell him/her what you want him/her to know about your reasoning.<br>  <br>  Checking out website for charity organisations who deal with people with self harm issues might be an idea.  You could also look into finding a counsellor whom you can talk to about your feelings.  Counsellor are trained to be non-judgemental so you don't have to worry.<br>  <br>  If you don't like one counsellor, change it until you meet one who you feel comfortable with.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	The doctor more than likely already knows, if not suspects.

I decided to see my doctor, who prescribed me a low-dose form of valium (can't remember name, begins with an L), but she said I shouldn't rely on that and I should talk to a therapist.  I also did this, and he is convinced that there is a root cause for the nerves, and we are working on getting to that.  I hope he's right, because I understand how awful it feels.  One thing both he and my friend who is also a therapist said is that it will go away eventually.  I am trying to believe that right now.  But I recommend talking to someone about it, even if it's only a couple of sessions.  Also try relaxation exercises like yoga and reducing caffeine.

That part of your anatomy is very flexible and my guess is a healthy bowel movement is bigger than the stick.  If you are having no problems then it is probably OK.<br>  <br>  The bending over is to check the Rectum and  Prostate Gland (which surrounds the urethra but is able to be checked by a digital exam in your butt).  While weird it does not hurt.  They are checking for abnormalities in the rectum and deformities or enlargement in the Prostate.<br>  <br>  Do not worry, your secret is safe from this exam.

UfBIhYwPaa	It is very common for her menstrual cycle to go crazy during chemo. I was 20 when having chemo, and I had a constant period for the first 2 months of chemo, and then for the rest of chemo, and nearly a year after I finished, I had absolutely nothing. And then it started to come back and it's now regular. <br>  <br>  She should tell her oncologist, who should refer her to the gynecologist, just to check nothing is wrong and that it is actually the chemo causing all this. When she finishes, she should start to get her periods back at some point.|`|3dOrdQGbaa	It's complex, it depends on her age, the type of chemo drugs she's having, and how long or how many cycles of chemo she has. Generally the younger she is the more likely it is her fertility will return. There are still fertility treatments you can pursue if she has trouble conceiving. I really recommend the two of you talk to the oncologist about it, he or she may refer you to a fertility clinic too.<br>  I'm 31 and last year I had 4 rounds of AC chemo for breast cancer, my periods stopped after the first cycle of chemo then started again 3 months after my last one. Just remember even if she isn't menstruating there is a small chance she can still get pregnant, so it's important to use birth control during chemo.

2Hot9EJiaa	For some artificial sweeteners are ok, but for my husband they were horrible.  Instead of lowering his blood sugar, it increased it, and he was one of many people who used Splenda and other sweeteners for awhile and could not walk-  as soon as he stopped the splenda and others, he could walk again- not as safe as some think, huh?|`|7oYpbSjIaa	no.|`|pTjEof56aa	No,it helps you not get diabetes because there are zero carbs and zero sugars in splenda.It has nothing to do with getting diabetes.
AA10723498	The only way you will know is by being tested.  Some of the symptoms you are having could also be the flu.  body aches, sore joints. It's all part of the flu.  No one on here can tell you if you have leukemia or not.  Only a doctor can do that by ordering the proper tests.  Sorry, I can't help you any more than that.|`|QS9JDB6Yaa	yes you can have leukemia at 16. you should get a check up with your doctor to be sure|`|yw7AeZn2aa	An enlarged spleen is often a sign that there is cancer elsewhere in the body because the spleen filters all the red blood cells etc.  If this is really a fear, you should call your doctor and tell him- for leukemia its as simple as a finger prick to tell whether further testing is needed. <br>  <br>  Great strides have been made in curing leukemia since your dad died (Im sorry). Most types of leukemia are very curable.  And few are genetically linked.

rT3MfFvuaa	No don't.  Never mix prescribed medication with herbal medication without checking with your GP first because you could suffer from an adverse reaction.  It would be like mixing a prescribed antidepressant with St John's Wort - you just don't do it because of the reason I mentioned above.  Either go prescription meds or go herbal but don't mix them both together without seeking the advice of your GP or a reputable herbalist.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	from what i found the main interaction is sleeping pills or valium, no reports have yet been found that Valerian has side effects with cipramil<br>  <br>  Expected Outcome; Side-Effects; Counter-Indicators and Warnings<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Valerian works almost immediately. For unknown reasons, a small minority may find valerian stimulating instead of calming.<br>  <br>  Aside from its strong odor - some find that valerian root smells unpleasantly like dirty socks - valerian is well tolerated, with only occasional mild gastrointestinal distress. With constant use, side-effects can include headaches, excitability, digestive upsets, or sleep and heart disturbances.<br>  <br>  No drug interactions have been reported, but the possibility still exists that valerian might enhance other central nervous system depressants, such as sedatives, sleeping pills, and alcohol. Erring on the side of caution is recommended, by not combining valerian with any of these substances.<br>  <br>  Approved for use as a food, valerian is listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list. Although valerian does not appear to impair driving ability, it can diminish vigilance for a few hours after it's taken. Thus driving a car or operating hazardous machinery within a few hours of taking valerian is not recommended.<br>  <br>  Warning: If you are on any prescription benzodiazepines, do not stop taking them without your physician's advice, as there can be severe consequences. <br>  <br>  Safety in young children, pregnant or nursing women, and those with severe liver or kidney disease has not been established.|`|Y46YE1e2aa	not advisable to mix medications unless cleared by your gp to do so, best check with him/her first.

You can, however catch it again with a new partner, or if that partner she is currently with got it from her and didn't go to the doctor and get treated. What was the time span between infections? It if was a long time then there are other more important issues on the table, like more serious health problems from not treating the infection soon. A woman with Clamidia for a long time is at a very high risk for PID, infertility, and cervical cancer. I would sit her down and tell her that whoever she is having sex with, she MUST always be using protection. 2X clamidia should prove that!

pi6tB6Wuaa	The Poison Oak rash is cause by a chemical called urushiol. This is present in poison oak leaves, branches, roots, everything. When you touch it, the oil is absorbed into the skin. This is a poisonous substance, and the rash is the result of your body's immune system fighting against this invader.<br>  You can get Poison Oak by touching the plant, its leaves, roots, whatever. If an animal, such as your dog, gets in Poison Oak you can get it from petting the dog (the dog won't get the rash though). You can get it from your clothing that touches Poison Oak.<br>  The rash doesn't appear until after the oil is absorbed into your skin, because it is caused by your body's immune system.<br>  So the answer is no, once you get the rash, you can't spread it around by scratching. The oil that seeps from your wounded body isn't urushiol, its secreted by your body.<br>  <br>  The reason most people think it will spread is because of secondary infection. You touch a poison oak plant, the oil is on your hands. You rub your face, it gets there. The oil is spread. Now after a while, there isn't as much oil to spread around, so some parts get hit more heavily. What this means is, the rash appears soon is some spots, and takes a couple of days in other spots. This gives the illusion that you've spread the rash by scratching or whatever.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you aren't getting brand-new infection from your clothing. Whenever I go hiking, as soon as I get home I put all my clothes, shoes, everything in a bag, and wash it all. Only through extreme paranoia can you avoid poison oak. The alternative is to never go anywhere fun.

If they still have blood on them and you dry them it will set in the blood and it will never come out.<br>  You can also use hydrogen peroxide.

fRI8Lsjyaa	Do you day dream a lot? Or have a lot on your mind. I am 24 and had the same problems in school. I have even wanted to do a load of laundry and have come to find I already did it. Also I have to check times ex: when the bus comes a lot. My long term memory is fine. I don't think you have a problem. Just a lot on your mind and perhaps you are a little disorganized? One thing helps me a lot is I have a schedule book. A small one that fits in my purse. I go in ahead of time and write down places I need to be and times far in advance. Ex: before each month you can use innitals for each class and the time. (if they have a rotating scale.) if not tape the schedule in the book. Also, when you get information you want to remember for any reason. Write it in the book immediatly. If you're friend wants to meet next friday. Check your book if it works and write it in on the day you want to meet. Not under the current day you have that you want to meet next friday.<br>  Another thing that helps is I have a lot of calenders at home. Three to be exact. One in the living room, one by my computer and one on the wall in front of my toilet. It may sound funny but it is a place everyone goes to on a daily basis. It is an easy way to be reminded of what is to come.<br>   You would be surprised how it helps.|`|aVNAkmP0aa	i have bad memory loss too, but its my fault cuz i smoke too much pot. its cool though some things arent that important, like what u ate for breakfast.|`|AA10349378	Short term memory is dependent on how you ''code" the information as it goes into your mind. Most short term memory problems in young people relate to issues in this coding area. You need to concentrate on doing the one thing you are trying to take in -- if you are looking at a list of grades for example and have to learn yours what else are you doing? Are you chatting to friends, laughing, thinking about other things too? Focus on the task in front of you and just that. And concentrate on what you are doing ''in the moment''. Look up the author ''kabat-zinn" on mindfulness. The other thing is that having problem  with memory is signs of stress, not getting enough sleep, and proper nutrition. So tend to that as well. Good Luck.|`|YNYZgK6baa	what do you  think bout all the time himmmmmmmmmmmmm boys yeah

Zt6eh6VRaa	It depends on what type of acne you have on your back - do you have mostly noninflamed bumps or are they red and inflamed?<br>  <br>  If they are noninflamed, try a strong exfoliant - use a scrub and strong AHA like glycolic or mandelic.<br>  <br>  If they are inflamed use a strong benzoyl peroxide - leave it on all night (but where a white t-shirt so you don't bleach your pj's or sheets!). Also, consider getting a benzoyl peroxide solution with some sulfur in it - it makes the bpo stronger and more anti-inflammatory. Do NOT use a scrub to cleanse your back if you have this kind of acne.<br>  <br>  If you want help with your back, we have programs for people with acne and you can get one-on-one counseling through your whole program of getting clear.

Apply this oil on the back acne everyday for minimum 15 days or else apply fresh Aloe vera juice or the gel and wash after a few hours. When washing your back use a loofah, sponge or exfoliant to help remove any dead skin cells that may clog up pores. Use a gentle action and don’t be too harsh otherwise you will end up breaking the skin. You should probably change your shirt twice a day to avoid bacteria buildup.

Acne is a dead skin cell problem inside the pores, NOT a bacteria problem, believe it or not. Antiobiotics won't keep the root cause of acne from happening. <br>  <br>  There is good science behind Proactiv and that is why it works for some people. But Proactiv skin care products just are not strong enough for people with stubborn acne and/or the skin adapts to the regimen. <br>  <br>  For most people, Proactiv seems to work nicely for about three weeks and then it seems to stop working. Since Proactiv never gets to see your skin or talk to you about how your skin is reacting or adapting, they can't very well recommend the products strong enough to get rid of acne conditions that are difficult. <br>  <br>  It takes potent exfoliants and anti-bacterials used in the right way to get acne under control. If you don't have someone guiding you through this process, you will either:<br>  <br>  1. Not have strong enough products and you will still have acne; or<br>  <br>  2.

Or try taking a nap and seeing if it makes it way out before you wake up.|`|Ysr0vsDAaa	Hi, first off, i'm sorry this happened to you! That sounds terrible.<br>  Alright here's my opinion:<br>  <br>  First of all i think you should continue flushing your eye, make your parents believe you, or pay attention! If not, you could call your family doctor or someone you may know who is a doctor. Absolutely DO NOT rub it, very smart instinct of yours to not, but please don't. It will scratch and may permanently damage your eyeball, also make sure it's still in and that it's not just sore now. That's about all i can think of hun, hope you get a solution soon!

gAOAdOHraa	I am in my 20's and flat chested and my breasts have never been an issue when it comes to guys.  Probably because I don't make it an issue.  These guys are teasing you because you take the bait and bite back at them.  They enjoy teasing you because you fight back and this is entertaining to them.  If you ignore them and give them a "how old are you" look they won't hassle you anymore because you won't be providing them with entertainment.  You still have a lot of growing to do, but if a guy EVER made fun of me about my breast size I would know that they wouldn't be worth being with and would be out of my life damn quick.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	make your foot meet there balls..laugh loudly after.|`|dqvZmj22aa	The sad thing is, 12 and 13 YO boys do ANYthing to get a girl to notice them.  Good ways like flattery, jerky ways like teasing, etc.<br>  <br>  At that age, they have no idea of the "right" way to get your attention, so they do whatever stupid thing comes to mind.  So think of it like training a puppy.  Reward when they do something right, smack them when they mess on the carpet, and ignore them when they try to get your attention by whining.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but try and be totally blank faced.  If they see they aren't GETTING to you, they'll find someone else to tease.|`|HAueVh8Naa	well guys dont know stuff about girls which they think they do .when i was 10-12 in school people made fun of me because i had big boobs and i would hide them by wearing sports bras and baggy shirts lol ppl always find a way to do stuff like that .you are 12 your boobs just started growing .if it bothering tell your teachers kids in your class should not be saying stuff like that ecspecailly about your breasts|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Just ignore them.

gVejeg9maa	Ok, assuming this is not a joke.   Here's your sign.  That said, First your confusing blood leaking from the ear for a hazy milk like substance call cerebral spinal fluid.  Secondly, it can be serious anytime you lose consciousness, However, considering its been an hour + and you haven't call an ambulance yet, I can only assume you are not experiencing any of the following symptoms- dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, weakness, or tiredness(one of the most important one). If you do notice any of these get someone to take you or call ambulance to take you to the ER.  You may also notice what we call "raccoon eyes".  It is a darkening around the eyes.<br>  Good luck.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	I would take an educate guess here and say that you are using commercial pads such as Always or Kotex, so first thing I would suggest is switching to another menstrual option. Commercial pads are made out of plastics and synthetics which prevent air getting to your groin, thus making you sweaty and uncomfortable so more likely to move about in your sleep, also as they are stuck in by glue it means they are more likely to come unstuck, move about and gather up, thus making leaks more likely. You could go for cloth pads like Lunapads <a href="http://www.lunapads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lunapads.com</a> which are the same as the pads you’d be using now only they are cloth so more comfortable and they are held in place with fasteners around your underwear which limits gathering and offer additional protection, you can also add extra layers to the pad at night. Lunapads also make a good padded panty, these are basically underwear with pads built-in, they are much more comfortable than pads and give you better protection. Another pad option would be period belts like Reddy’s <a href="http://www.reddyspads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddyspads.com</a> these are pads which are about three times the size of normal pads that fasten around your waste, as they are bigger and sit closer to your body they offer more protection.  <br>  <br>  As a note – even if you wanted to use tampons you can’t wear them at night, when laying down there is less menstrual flow going down into the tampon, thus the tampon will absorb more of the vagina’s natural fluids, this causes splitting and ulceration of the vaginal walls increasing health risks. As a note TSS is not the only risk from tampon use, they are also a major cause of vaginal infections, can increase menstrual flow and menstrual cramps, and are linked to illnesses such as cancer and endometriosis. <br>  <br>  You could always use another internal option such as menstrual cups, because these don’t interfere with your vaginal functions or contain harmful chemicals as tampons do it means that they can be worn at any time, including at night, without any health risks for up to 12 hours. They also don’t leak because they hold more fluid than tampons or pads and create a slight seal in the vagina preventing blood coming out. I’d suggest a smaller cup to someone who normally uses pads, Ladycup <a href="http://www.ladycup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ladycup.com</a> would be best for you, they are far easier to use, mess-free, safe, hygienic, and convenient, and of course will help prevent leaking during your sleep. Softcups are another option, these are a similar idea in that they collect menstrual flow, so there isn’t the health risks you get from tampons, but they are more difficult to use than menstrual cups, but some women prefer using softcups as they are disposable, look at Instead’s softcups <a href="http://www.softcup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.softcup.com</a>  <br>  <br>  Short of that if you carry on using the pads you use now then your only option is to put something down on your bed like an old towel or period blanket, this will protect your bed and you can use it like a nappy when you get out of bed to avoid mess as you get to the bathroom. Wear more layers of clothing to protect your bed form leaking. Or you’ll just have to get up in the middle of the night to change the pads more often.|`|No16LnAqaa	i know it's uncomfortable but maybe you should try wearing two pads at night, just to keep it inside.<br>  Also wear tight but comfortable underwear to ensure the pads will stay in place throughout the night.<br>  hope this helped a bit.|`|oAIXNK9naa	You could try the heavier type of pad. <br>  Black underwear is the way to go too, plus you can also buy a few pairs of black, underwear shorts to wear over your underwear. This will hold everything in place.|`|QS39iV01aa	sometimes i have this problem 2. i wear underwear that's a little bit tighter or a smaller size than i usually wear when im on my period and sleeping. maybe you could try that, hope i helped, good luck!|`|sU60NqWWaa	Get the pads with wings.|`|qp6PkCAbaa	some pads are only for nights and for extra ...use those or simply change to another brand
q3CNTfvKaa	Don't worry it's a very painless test.  There are two types of ultrasounds an OB or GYN can do - either the one with warm jelly on your tummy and a wand is rubbed on your stomach/uterus to view inside your body OR they do a vaginal ultrasound.  It is similar to a pap smear/or a normal  annual visit to the GYN.  Gel is used and a thin wand is entered to do the same, view your uterus, ovaries etc.  It is not painful at all, you may be nervous if you have never been to a gynegologist  for your annual check up.   Most females should have one every year starting at age 18 or whenever they become sexually active and every year after that.<br>  <br>  Your doctor should explain everything step by step when you are there and if you are nervous you can take a parent with you or someone you trust.   Again it is not painful and its is a completely safe test to do.  Pregnant women have both types of ultrasounds all the time to validate the baby and mom's health. <br>  <br>  Be sure to ask questions of your doctor when you get there to help quell any other thoughts or questions you have.   Its your right to ask questions and that will help you build trust with your doctor.  Best wishes on your results.|`|QyQ6XoLbaa	I think my ultrasound experience was different that others who commented.  I had one when I was 19 when I had an ovarian cyst (it went away on it's own after switching to a different birth control pill).<br>  I was asked to drink a lot of water before I went in for my appointment so that my bladder was full.  The technician used a wand that she put a latex cover over (like a one-fingered glove) and some jelly lubricant on it and inserted that into me.  She also had the gel on my stomach.  She was able to move the wand around and get a really good look at what was in there, and I could see the size and shape of the cyst.<br>  It did not hurt at all.  The hardest thing really was having to pee through it, which is not a pain issue.<br>  Good luck with your ultrasound.  I really don't know what it could be, but your doctor is checking it out just to be on the safe side.  It seems that having an ultrasound is not uncommon, even for young women.|`|AtinnDupaa	they make you drink a lot of liquid until you have to pee really bad. then you lie on a bed thingy and they put gel on your stomach and move the whatever its called around on your stomach. make sure that you wip it all of afterwards cuz its really uncomfortable...|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Ultrasound is a non invasive way of picturing what is going on inside your body but designed for soft tissue, rather than x-ray designed to show hard tissue. For the examination you will be asked to undress your midriff area and lay down the technician will then pass a probe over Your abdomen which will pick up bounced back sounds and so build up a picture of inside your body. It is designed to show abnormalities and cysts etc. You may be asked to drink a large amount so that your bladder is full and forces other organs up and into the proper position for viewing. If you are at all concerned ask the person carrying out the test to explain it to you and they should be happy to do so.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	ultrasounds are completely easy. All they do is put jelly on your stomach and move a wand over the part they want to look at. Nothing else involved.|`|e304c56bff79ec6d59f96a991c27676aaa	Ultrasounds are completely painless. I have had many many ultrasounds cause I have had problems with kidney stones for years. They just gel on your stomach and move a little wand type thing around on your abdomen. It bounces sound waves off your organs and such and transmits the picture to a computer to help them look for abnormalities. They may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds every now and then to get a better picture. I don't know exactly what they are looking for cause I don't know what other symptoms you have but I promise it is completely painless and a way for them to detect abnormalities.|`|9LJjNYaMaa	im a guy. and yes i had an ultra sound. i got hit in the balls so hard by my friend the left one hurt for weeks. it was really awkward. they put this goo on your area and rub this machine thing on it and an image shows up on the screen. my balls were fine. but the old lady doing it said, do you wanna see it? and i looked at the screen and said, oh im a boy!! she didnt think it was funny.|`|cyt7oh97aa	If it's your ovaries then it could be a cyst on them.  They'll use an ultrasound to check and see if they are larger than they need to be.  If that's the case then you'll have surgery to get them removed, but you'll be fine after that.|`|JjbragXNaa	An ultrasound is completely painless.  There's too many things that could possibly be going on.  Wait for your doctor's diagnoses.
RdV8pEesaa	yes just tell her , or go and get treatment for it so the verucca goes away
BNAzjSO1aa	If two out of three tests were positive then I am afraid it is likely that you are pregnant, you need to see a doctor as soon as possible and get the pregnancy confirmed as soon as possible. I suggest that you talk to an adult you trust and ask for their support during the coming months. Any way good luck and see a doctor soon.|`|fLHGIR9jaa	Yeah, go to a doctor. Only (s)he can tell you for sure.|`|arsAqGf7aa	This would be best answered by your doctor.  You should really see him as soon as you can.  And have him put you on birth control while you're there.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If you have 2 positive pregnancy tests then you ARE pregnant.. you really need to see a doctor.
5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	I suppose your assessment of what may be happening is certainly possible...but I'd probably consider some type of soft tissue obstruction as opposed to boney obstruction.  <br>  <br>  After dislocation, this can lead to tears in soft tissue, such as the labrum.  Even after prolonged healing, irregular articular surfaces and soft tissues can cause disruption to normal joint movement (think of it as someone sticking something in a door hinge...even a small fragment can obstruct movement.  <br>  <br>  "stiffness" can also be a problem...when you maintain one position for a long time, you deprive your tissues of blood and oxygen.  The stiffness and pain is to encourage you to move it to restore normal blood flow.  <br>  <br>  Yet, there are a variety of possiblities. take home message: EVERYONE gets some type of joint pain at some point, and the vast majority resolve on their own.  Its the persistent problems, or problems that fail to improve require follow up with the appropriate care provider. <br>  <br>  If it persists or happens repeatedly, yes I would follow up with the surgeon.
8UTwY1bOaa	So simple, and yet so trying. Have you ever heard the phrase "Just Say NO!" This is not a joke. I've been a mental health and addictions professional for 20+ years, now retired, and I've read all the WONDERFUL promises that all these expensive treatment plans and hospital programs put forth, but maybe I read more than they wanted me to. I read the fine print!! And in each and every worthy program, somewhere amidst all their wonderful promises of beating an addiction, whether it be in the middle of their promises or at the end of them, or on a separate page of their fancy brochures, they include the words, "Of course, if the patient chooses not to follow our recommendations (aka: "do what we say", aka: don't repeat the addictive behaviors), we cannot guarantee success in our program." So, what they're saying, bluntly, is, if you don't stop doing what you're addicted to, you'll never get beyond your addiction. Gee, I heard former First Lady Nancy Reagan get laughed and booed off the stage for pithily interpreting all those words into the most efficient treatment plan ever: "Just Say NO!" Now let me tell you that no matter how you deal with your addiction, just like with any addiction, you will NEVER "get over" your addiction. You will have it "under control", and the minute you go back to your addictive behaviors you will be, as they say in the trade, suffering relapse. So YOU decide when you'll undertake a very difficult process of breaking an addiction, no matter which the addiction is: "Just Say NO!" over and over and over and over and over again, and then when you still get "haunted" in the future, you'll be more capable of dealing with it. Oh, and there has been a program called "Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous" established by The Augustine Fellowship. The last address I had for them was P.O. Box 119, New Town Branch, Boston, Massachusetts 02258. That's where I ordered a book from them for my clinical practice. That was back in 1988 so I can't guarantee they're still at that address, but you can try and they may have an address for some porn addiction treatment program. All good programs use the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous as their core program, but they change the words "alcohol" and "drunkenness" to whatever words are appropriate for the specific addiction being addressed. If you seriously want to get rid of your addiction, Just Say NO, repeatedly, forever, and see if you can adapt the 12 Steps of Alcohol Anonymous to your addiction, and live it thoroughly. You will succeed then.|`|hL4nWbzmaa	How to avoid porn addiction on the Internet<br>  <br>  1. Consider installing porn content filtering software( Strongly Recommend NetDog ,you can get it from www.netdogsoft.com ) on your computer. it will help to protect you from stumbling into pornography by accident, That's important.<br>  <br>  2. Do not try to guess what the address of a Web page is. Many pornographic sites have similar addresses of respectable sites. For example www . whitehouse . com is a porn site. The real address is www. whitehouse . gov<br>  <br>  3. Never click on Web site addresses that you receive in an unsolicited email.<br>  <br>  4. Do not open attachments that come in email that are unsolicited.<br>  <br>  5. Use filtered search engines or reputable directories to find the information you need.<br>  <br>  6. Do not search for terms like girls. Think before you enter a search term.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stick with reputable sites.<br>  If something looks questionable, don't let curiosity get the best of you.

GBSO1Efraa	Certainly.  I deal with depression most of the time but I sill care.|`|rpU209Xfaa	first off, when you are depressed, you know it...<br>  there is a big difference...<br>  but you can still care for things...<br>  i have depression and i still care for my awesome boyfriend, my grades, and to certain extincts, my close friends...<br>  but you do in fact care about certain things...|`|gPtU4vvgaa	Yes you can still care about things, you may just not want to be around things.|`|0uDuXHtcaa	Yes, you definitely can care about others, you're depressed not selfish or careless. However people with depression tend to not care about Themselves, which becomes the major issue. <br>  <br>  Well, the difference is..depression is when bad stuff clog your mind 24/7, you think about ending it, you drink to get out of it, you lock yourself up in the dark, you dont smile at anything or laugh, everything is down, you are pessimistic. <br>  <br>  Feeling sorry for yourself seems like your case, which happens to everyone occassionally. If you still care about grades and stuff you are not depressed, because depression causes you to think about NOTHING positive..and i mean aiming for good grades is positive, and if you care about family..thats just normal, everyone does, depressed or not.<br>  <br>  xx good luck (:|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Depression isn't something you either have or you don't.

It doesn't mean that you don't care about things.<br>  <br>  I'd say serious depression is when you have a feeling of hopelessness in general about life, i.e. personal insignifigance, lack of goals, no vision of how to be happy, insecurity. If you don't feel these, you might just be having a series of bad days. Either way, when you're at your lowest- it can only get better!<br>  <br>  Keep looking up!|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	Depression has a few symptoms.<br>  Persistent sad, anxious or "empty" mood<br>  <br>  <br>  Sleeping too much or too little; middle-of-night or early-morning waking<br>  <br>  <br>  Reduced appetite and weight loss, or increased appetite and weight gain<br>  <br>  <br>  Loss of pleasure and interest in activities once enjoyed, including sex<br>  <br>  <br>  Irritability, restlessness<br>  <br>  <br>  Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment (such as chronic pain or digestive disorders)<br>  <br>  <br>  Difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions<br>  <br>  <br>  Fatigue or loss of energy<br>  <br>  <br>  Feeling guilty, hopeless or worthless<br>  <br>  <br>  Thoughts of death or suicide <br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest you ck out the link I have below  <br>  The National Institute of Health made the site.|`|9LJjNYaMaa	ive battled with depression for 10 years. i have taken meds most of my adult life. some days youre just down and some days your fine. i realized, to hell with this, im normal. ppl have bad and good days.some ppl really are super depressed for long periods of time. now im just battling anxiety and panic attacks that i cant beat. would rather have depression.|`|vRfcSOe5aa	no. i know plenty of people who suffer from depressions that still lead lives with happiness. its more about the extremeness in the ups and downs. i mena there are def. cases where people are always unhappy but that doesnt mean that they are emotionless towards everything else, not always.|`|quPY9x7qaa	usually depression means that you care too much and because of certain circumstances your hands are tied or you feel helpless.|`|qIyO5jJcaa	Usually depression happens when you care too much about something or other.|`|EGnDovaqaa	yes because the neuron receptors are reacting to your low seretonin levels do to your heavy heroin use. lay off the dope.|`|MVOwK7ueaa	Yes, you can.
KAwYumFfaa	Have you had an accident before that pain occurred? If so, your hip bones might be broken or if not, the bone it your thigh. You should get that checked if you did have an accident.<br>  If not, then that might just be the muscles. I always have that thing after i play badminton or cycling when i dont do some warm up first with my muscles. So, ive learned and every time i hav to do some strainuous activity i do some stretching first. Also, try to go to a doctor who specializes in aligning bones not that you have fracture, its those that stretches ur bones so that proper alignment with will be achieved, i just forgot that kind of doctor...sigh
vbjgMBdVaa	not possible my dear|`|4O1weDNjaa	Never.
SqNPj54Kaa	If you have them several times a week then you should probably have a doctor look at you.  However, you say occasionally, and that could be perfectly normal.  You most likely have seen a clot because a tiny blood vessel broke (the reason for the nosebleed itself).  Once broken, it takes about 2 weeks for that darn vessel to hear properly and just the act of touching your nose can break it open again and cause another bloody nose (thus, the clot, because the little vessel was healing by clotting, broke again, and now you visually see it).  Also, if you have been in a cold climate, the dry air is tough on your nasal passages.  Best solutions would be to drink enough fluids, keep moisture in the air, try not to touch your nose, and if it happens 3 or more times a week consider seeing the doctor.|`|OEu0wy2waa	Nothing serious. If you pick your nose a lot it may be an idea to go a little easier. Seriously though, if it keeps bleeding a lot for no reason go and see your doctor just to get it checked out - but it won't be anything bad - now get off the computer and do some homework..!|`|WOM8ZavGaa	YES. Go to a doctor ASAP if these are happening constantly. My grandmother has this problem, and she has to monitor it. She also had to get her nose cauterized.|`|vt8tazGdaa	yeah. threats range from temporary incapacity from blood loss to giving someone AIDS.|`|JRBbiXt5aa	Nope, in fact its very healthy too|`|AA11411905	It will really vary<br>  nose bleeds are more common than for others and clearly if you were HIV positive it would be a problem, but it wouldn't go a miss to ask your parents/school nurse but if it was serious would your folks have already done something?|`|Mq8409Vraa	Nope I don't think it is, nosebleeds are very healthy :-)|`|OJ2nbUoLaa	Tht is pretty bad but no its not dangerous|`|eGJNQS5Gaa	yaaaaaaa|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	you need more vitamin K to clot your blood so that doesnt happen
5eoO6qosaa	That would be me. Had it done because I knew that I had enough children. It also allowed me not to have to remember to take a pill on time, no more extra chemicals running around inside. And it was sort of a relief not to have the worry of did we make a baby when we had sex.  And as far as the problem stories, they are a small percentage of the total procedures done.  Good Luck! :)|`|W2N2WaLZaa	Guess the lack of answers tells you what you need to know.

AA11375099	Some people fear chemotherapy because they have heard horror stories about it in the past and they are afraid that they do not want those things to happen to her, but that is the past and you get over it.<br>  <br>  If she does not follow the procedures of chemotherapy then she is putting her life at risk, the probability that she can beat the cancer with only radiation is slim.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best, nothing we can say here will change her mind.  If her oncologist cannot do it, how can anyone here do it?<br>  <br>  Impossible answers to an impossible situation.  I am truly sad for you.  Enjoy the time you have with her.  I hope what she decides to do is enough for her to live.  I truly do, I am sorry for you both.  <br>  <br>  Dave|`|Ohcyim3Kaa	Sometimes people here can be helpful with either direct experience or knowledge, but you won't get anything at all if you don't take the time to write the question more thoroughly.  Of course, the doctor is best, but if you want to hear from people with personal experience you need to provide a bit more info, starting with the type of cancer.|`|WkLJI40baa	It really depends on the type of cancer. If they felt they have removed the cancer, they are using radiation to kill any small cancerous cells that can not be seen.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	What type of cancer does she have?|`|lcg1u1U7aa	You need to talk with your mother's oncologist about this, any answer you get here will be mostly a guess.
AG9msdUDaa	Your spine is likely out of alignment, which can happen quite easily with improper sitting or walking posture. See a chiropractor, he/she can fix it and stop the nerves from being pinched.|`|rqxpZlzpaa	Sciatica is a condition in which pain shoots down an leg or arm as a result of a pinched nerve. Pain that runs along the course of the sciatic nerve is referred to by laypersons as sciatica. It especially appears in the back of the thigh also causing pain in the lower back, buttocks, hips, and/or adjacent parts. Sciatica is pain caused by general compression and/or irritation of one of five nerve roots that are branches of the sciatic nerve. The pain is felt in the lower back, buttock, and/or various parts of the leg and foot.    Generally, sciatica is something older people have to endure. Perhaps it's a simple matter of a hip or pelvic bone out of place. Sciatic pain is more commonly due to a back problem not a leg or knee problem. Have you had an MRI of your lower back, I would ask your Dr. about that, especially at your young age.  Going to see a Massage Therapist will help alot. They can show you some stretches you can do at home to loosen up your muscles in your low back ,legs and butt, that will help out alot.  Surgery for sciatica might be warranted if the sciatic nerve pain is severe and has not been relieved with appropriate manual or medical treatments. Patients should seek immediate medical attention if they have any symptoms of progressive lower extremity weakness, loss of bladder or bowel control.  The single most useful thing is a back rehabilitation course. It consisted of exercises which strengthen the spinal muscles and surrounding muscles. Also try and find a pain support group which you can attend. Others in the same situation can be a great support. Some groups also have relaxation sessions, hypnotism and other alternative remedy sessions to help their members.  Try ibuprofen,( if you are not pregnant) it helps a bit sometimes, and a hot water bottle, and lay down for a while. Also hot bath sometimes helps.  Unfortunately, if you don't get professional help, it is a condition that can worsen over time and will certainly not heal itself. You can find chiropractors in your area that are willing to adjust their pricing according to your needs and income.  Stay active and go outside. As annoying as it is sometimes to not relax on the sofa, it is really good for you to stay active. If that means walking then fine. Well, there is a fairly new one-time treatment called Atlasprofilax. This treatment really seems to stop a main cause of sciatica, and I know of some persons who got rid of all symptoms within a short period of time.  Never put ice directly on your skin, but try putting it into a ziptop bag, put that into a damp clothe, and put that onto you effected side buttock for about 20 minutes. This should help relax the piriformis, which could be in spasm, causing sciatic nerve pain.  Oil of wintergreen, which contains methyl salicylate, is widely used externally for its anti-inflammatory activity for arthritis, rheumatism, sciatica, and sore muscles.

hMF3kg3Baa	If I was going on a trip even if my periods were no where in site I would still bring pads.|`|5eoO6qosaa	It is better to bring them and not need them, then to have to run around trying to find some if you do need them.

It's somewhat normal for it to do this.

Stay prepared.<br>  Good luck.|`|AtinnDupaa	it could just be that your body regulated with someone else's recently. it happens to me all the time. also, i've had it for 2 years now, but sometimes i skip or have irregular periods, like for two weeks at a time and then it doesnt come until way later. you should definitely bring backup. you never really can tell when its going to come if youve missed a cycle. if you keep skipping cycles/have irregular periods try birth control pills. it may sound weird but it really works. good luck!|`|3CBWubtAaa	you're preggers|`|gokbhnhhaa	You should bring pads and tampons and that stuff because it wouldn't be that good if you got it and you didn't have that stuff so it is better to be safe then sorry so i would bring them|`|P8uxu93Iaa	THATS normal. maybe ure on deit or something, maybe u changed the way u eat or u cut out protiens for a while and maybe carbs.. <br>  <br>  its all hormonesso its normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  always bring ur pads in ur purse.. u will get ur period.
Ohcyim3Kaa	It's impossible to answer this without more info.  Even then, it would be hard to guess.  <br>  <br>  For example, if early stage cirrhosis or fatty liver is caused by drinking, and the person stops drinking, there's every chance they'll be fine.
