And where's the business locator, i.e., city, state, country which normally follows the last entry in the <title>; and<br>  <br>  2)  There is a missing <keywords> metatag which needs to be properly designed and placed on your opening webpage.<br>  <br>  And finally, here's a helpful definitive tutorial from google.com which clearly defines how metatags are designed and placed:<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GdcQdJODaa	Search engine optimization (SEO) is such a broad term. It can be quite overwhelming if you try to take the whole of it in a single bite. There are so many facets of search engine optimization, from how search engines work (and they all work a little differently) to how a web page is designed. There are enough elements to worry about that you could spend far more time than you can afford to invest in trying to achieve the SEO you have in mind. However, search engine optimization doesn’t have to be such an onerous task that it can’t be accomplished. Not if you understand what it is and how it works.<br>  To increase the traffic u need for your website:<br>  You can:<br>   Create a web site that contains meta tags, content, graphics, and keywords that help improve your site ranking.<br>   Use keywords liberally on your site, so long as they are used in the correct context of your site topic and content.<br>   Include reciprocal links to your site from others as long as those links are legitimate and relevant.<br>   Encourage web site traffic through many venues, including keyword advertising, reciprocal links, and marketing campaigns.<br>   Submit your web site to search engines manually, rather than waiting for them to pick up your site in the natural course of cataloging web sites.<br>  <br>  You can’t:<br>   Trick search engines by embedding hidden keywords in your web site. This is a practice that will very likely get you banned by most search engines.<br>   Artificially generate links to your site from unrelated sites for the purpose of increasing your ranking based on link analysis. Most search engines have a built-in mechanism that will detect this type of deceptive practice.<br>   Artificially generate traffic to your web site so that it appears more popular than it is. Again, there are safeguards in place to prevent this from happening, and if you trip those safeguards, you could end up on the banned list for many search engines.<br>   Force your web site to appear in search engine rankings by submitting the site repeatedly for inclusion in the rankings. A good general rule of thumb is that you should submit your site once and then wait at least six weeks before submitting it again. Submitting it repeatedly<br>  will, again, only lead to something nasty like being banned from the search engine.<br>   Expect search engines to automatically rank you at the top of your topic, category, or keyword as soon as the site is picked up. It could take a little time to build the “status” that you need to reach a high search engine ranking. Remember, SEO is a process.<br>  <br>  For more information, i suggest you read Wiley SEO book by Jerri L. Led ford or you can visit this site, www.neuracom.com.

OacSIfSiaa	Lets try and get you the proper answers.  <br>  First of all, if satisfied, then that is far better for you as in most cases no bank or mortgage broker will help you until you have any defaults taken care of.  So you are ahead in that point.<br>  <br>  As to the reporting time for the defaults it is as per the FC RA Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c] and will remain on your report for 7 1/2 years from date of last missed payment. <br>  If those defaults are just late payments then they will remain for seven years from the month in which the late payment was due. If there are multiple late payments in one account item, then they will each expire individually.<br>   Once it has reached that time period it will be removed from your credit report.<br>  <br>  Now to the part regarding inquiries being made.  Credit Reporting agencies can see you are obviously shopping for the best rate and will only count the inquiries as a single one if they are all done within a 14 day time period.  This also applies to any loan shopping for autos.<br>  See the following: <a href="http://myfico.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/myfico.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=160" rel="nofollow">http://myfico.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/myfic...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|AA11758925	in this economy it probably will, but usually it all depends on your beacon score, your best bet is to order your credit report (transunion and equifax) with your score on it to. mostly buying a house they use your transunion.

This way you can search many realtors for a house without them constently pulling your credit report which will bring your beacon score down the more you try.

It takes 6 years for a default to come off your credit file (whether satisfied or not) so your credit score will be low until that time has passed . I think if you have a 25+% deposit there is a chance you'll get a mortgage as this makes it lower risk for the banks. You could always apply for your credit score from Experian (you can do it online) and see if it's good enough to apply for a mortgage?

YiDVUCdwaa	Most security positions do not require experience to be hired. The only thing you'll have to pay attention to is whether the security position is an armed position or unarmed. Armed positions require an age of 21 or older and training in firearms with a certification before you can actually be hired and for the most part the cost of the certification is totally on the person taking the training and cost anywhere between $200 to $800. The certification also needs to be renewed every 1 to 2 years. Doing security work is a great way to get your foot in the door for law enforcement and you can make a lot of connections. Look for security companies in your area and submit a resume/application to them.

OacSIfSiaa	The answer is found under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and varies depending upon the type of debt.  Various debts are reported for the followng periods of time<br>  <br>  Inquiries - Two years.<br>  Late Payments - Seven years from the month in which the late payment was due. If there are multiple late payments in one account item, then they will each expire individually.<br>  <br>  Charge-Offs - Seven years. The time runs from the date of the delinquency, plus 180 days. <br>  <br>  Collection Accounts - Seven years. The running of this time limit is the same as with charge-offs. The date of delinquency still refers to the original delinquency with the original creditor, regardless of when the collection agency began working the debt. This includes debts that have been bought by a collection agency. Collection agencies cannot legitimately "re-set the clock."<br>  <br>  Lawsuits And Judgments - Seven years or until the governing statute of limitations (your state SOL) has expired, whichever is longer. In can vary from 10 to 20 years as a judgment is renewable.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy (Chapter 7) - Ten years (from the date of entry of the order for relief or the date of adjudication. Bankruptcy (Chapter 13) - Seven years. Paid Tax Liens - Seven years from the date of payment.<br>  <br>  Now you also have your State Statute of Limitations which allows the creditor a certain time period to seek legal action to collect.  If the debt is "time barred" (past the state SOL) then they can not take you to court. This also varies state by state.  You can find your state SOL at this web site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.statuteoflimitations.net/debt_collection.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.statuteoflimitations.net/debt...</a><br>  <br>  Both are different in time frames but this does NOT mean you do not have to pay.  Even if a debt has reached the SOL in either your state or on your credit report, they can still hound you for payment.  Many often sell the debts to other collection agencies and many will try to use illegal tactics to collect but you are protected by the FDCPA.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	For the 6 year rule to apply - there needs to be no contact between you and the creditor between that time.. if you write offering x,y,z etc then it becomes null and void - it is there so that after a 7 year period of no contact the thing is written off because in law it is deemed the creditor had more than enough time to pursue and the debtor should not have this hanging over them all this time..<br>  <br>  If you are now getting pursued seek advice.. it could be the creditor knows they are running out of time but DO NOT reply without seeking advice - National Debtline are ace.

Statutue of Limitations that limits how long they can go to court for a judgment may be shorter or longer than that (varies by state).  But SOL is only useful if it applies and you bring it up as a defense before or when it gets to court.<br>  <br>  If they take it to court and get a judgment, that can add 10 years to collect the debt with more teeth to pursue payment (liens, wage garnishment, etc.).|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Simon C is TOTALLY RIGHT.<br>  Why has he got thumbs down?????<br>  <br>  The debt never 'dissapears' you will always owe it, however you cannot be legally forced to pay it through court action.<br>  <br>  It's 6 years, and you must never admit to owing the debt, otherwise the 6 years starts again.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Gosh I wish I could just 'leave' my debts.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	I've always read that the time limit is 7 years.  The creditor has a certain length of time to pursue the matter in court (I dont remember what it is but it wasnt terribly long).  Once that limit has passed, they cant sue you for the money, but they can still report it to the credit bureau at any time up to the 7 year limit.  The time starts at the last activity shown on the account.  So, from what I understand, if you decide (after a few years) to suddenly make a payment, the 7-year clock starts over.  However, I've read other articles that say this isnt true, so you'll just need to do your own research.  If you pull your credit reports, it will show the "date of last activity".....if that was over 7 years ago and it hasnt already been removed from your report, you can write a dispute letter to the bureau and ask them to remove it based on the time-line.  Yes, some companies (most, in fact) will eventually give up and sell the debt to a collection agency.  They pay a mere fraction of what the debt is actually worth, but will try to get the entire balance out of you by harrassing and threatening phone calls.  They will threaten to take you to court, which they really wont do because (after only paying pennies-on-the-dollar for your account) it would cost them more to go through the court process.  They will also threaten to report the debt to the credit bureau, if the original creditor didnt already.  This, they can do....unless the account is over 7 years old.  According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they report it after the 7 year limit is up, you now have the right to sue them (but the cap on the amount you can collect is only $1000, and not likely worth your time and money).  The clock does NOT restart once the account is sold to a collection agency, but they will lie and tell you it does.  They make their money off the unimformed people that they scare.  If they begin with harrassing phone calls, simply ask the operator for their mailing address and inform her that you will be sending an official request to cease all phone calls.  (This is when they lay on the threat about how they tried to work it out with you but, since you choose to stop communications, they have no choice but to proceed with a lawsuit).  The person dishing out that threat is just a flunkie phone operator and has nothing to do with the decisions to sue or not to sue.....she's just reading what's on the computer screen in front of her.  Your debt is 5 years old so no one can take you to court to make you pay it but---again---they can still report it.  Chances are, the original creditor already did.  On your report, it will say something like "referred for collections".  This is (as you know) a major blemish on your report.  So, in another 2 years, pull your reports again and see if the debt has been erased from the bureau.  A lot of times it isnt.  They're REAL quick to put things on, but very slow to take them off.  Just dispute it and wait about 2-3 months. (Yes, it really does take that long!)  If you continue to pay your other financial obligations on time for the next 2 years, by the time this debt gets erased off your report, your scores will start to go up nicely.|`|oFiGyMWraa	Nothing will erase the debt. <br>  <br>  But the Limitation Act means that it is not possible to enforce the debt in a court more than 6 years after it was last acknowledged. If you refuse to pay nothing can be done to force you without a court order. So after 6 years the debt is effectively unenforceable.<br>  <br>  If you acknowledge the debt within the 6 year period the clock will be reset. So be very careful about writing to a company about an old debt, because you may inadvertently give them more time to chase you. <br>  <br>  Even if the 6 years expires the debt continues to exist.

After that they must surrender all claims.<br>  <br>  The part that hurts hard is that you have to live with bad credit for those seven years. Then it takes about a year to contact your credit bureaus to erase that. THEN it takes about 2 years to establish the credit again.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Yes it is accurate.

Your credit profile gets cleaned up yearly and after 6 clean-ups- as long as you've not had ANY other bad credit during those 6 years your credit score will be normal.

Sh5xpL0Kaa	Why don't you just sell your car. Declaring bankruptcy at 20 years old is going to ruin the rest of your life. It could affect you getting a job, a lot of companies are checking FICO scores before hiring now. There's has got to be a better option, do not take the easy way out|`|NbmnWwqEaa	Bankruptcy is not allowed in some cases . . . nowadays.<br>  If the car is the only debt you have and it's recent; you will not be allowed to declare bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy is for when you have debt way beyond your ability to pay it back due to unemployment, low income, etc.<br>  <br>  You have to PROVE to the court that you are "trying" to pay your bills ... Consumer Credit Counselers may be a better start before full bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy stays on your credit for TEN YEARS . . . not seven.<br>  <br>  You can get a job with or without a bankruptcy. In fact, in most cases, you have to get a job. The only jobs that do "credit checks" are jobs in financial institutions -- and I think they are looking for too much debt.<br>  <br>  >> Some employers are doing credit checks, yes. They do not all refuse employment for bad credit scores. Just be honest, if they do credit checks. I took bankruptcy in 1997 and bought a car soon after and had great jobs. It didn't prevent me from getting a job. I had done everything I could to pay my bills -- including Consumer Credit Counselors and bankruptcy was all I could do to stop harrassment and homelessness. So, it helped me. <<<br>  <br>  Due to laws, such as EOE (Equal Opportunity Employment), a lot of jobs cannot refuse to hire you.<br>  <br>  You are probably not in enough debt to declare full bankruptcy . . .<br>  <br>  College, is it on student loan? If you declare bankruptcy you have declare EVERYTHING, including good credit cards. Plus, if you have good credit, you will not qualify for bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Yes, the car company will not let you declare bankruptcy. They would garnish the wages of your father-in-law for the full price of the car.<br>  <br>  How about just selling the car? Have someone else buy it and take over the payments . . . then, with the money you get for the car, get a cheaper one. That is your only answer.<br>  <br>  The court will refuse bankruptcy on one item, anyway . . . especially if you have another signer and he has money. They will just make him pay it.<br>  <br>  And that will be bad for you in the future, when you need his help for something else.|`|S6cdLN0Kaa	They will go after your father in law.  <br>  <br>  Banks aren't lending money unless you want to pay ridiculous interest rates anyway, so I wouldn't worry about getting a loan in the futre.  <br>  <br>  You might want to sell the car and pay the difference, since your father in law will have to pay anyway.<br>  <br>  If the loan is with Wamu/Chase or Bank of America, I hope that you smash the car into their building and leave it their parking lot.  It would nice to see someone treat them with the same level of respect that they treat their customers.|`|AA10628838	The problem with this is your father-in-law's credit will be affected.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	With the new bankruptcy laws that took effect, you wont be getting off the hook as easily as you think you will.<br>  <br>  Your father in law's credit is going to take a bad hit and he probably won't be too happy about that. <br>  <br>  Get ready for seven years of hell.|`|eF92uM2Saa	Oh man don't screw up your father in laws credit! That's just wrong.<br>  <br>  Yes, it can affect your ability to get a job.  It will also affect what you pay for any kind of insurance.  If someone does give you a loan again, you will be paying the absolute worst interest rate you can imagine.<br>  <br>  Are you upside down in the car?  Go talk to your father in law.  Tell him the truth and see if he can help you work something out.<br>  <br>  You do not want to file for bankruptcy unless you absolutely can't do anything else.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	You will probably be refused credit for up to 10 years and employers may be reluctant to hire someone. Bankruptcy shows irresponsibility. How does a 20 year-old accumulate that much debt?|`|wJGJUVswaa	i no your broke|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	Your father in law will owe the entire amount and if you don't tell him in time to make the payments on time it will ruin his credit. That is why they had you get a cosigner. You will cause your husband great embarrassment and his father a lot of money for your decision not to live up to your responsibilities.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy is something reported for ten years but the rest of your life some people will find out about it. <br>  <br>  Companies won't hire people with bad credit if you deal with money and some consider it a sign of irresponsible behavior so won't hire. Their is no EOE class protected by reason of irresponsibility so it is a legit reason not to hire. You probably will never get a security clearance or some careers. <br>  <br>  Ask your father in law if he will take the car and sell it then you can pay him payments on any amounts you are upside down.<br>  <br>  Getting a car loan for another car will be hard and you may not get student loans and when you graduate finding a job and if you ever save enough for a home down payment you may not get a mortgage.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy cost a few thousand in attorney fees but you can talk to one free to see what the cost is. Since your father in law will have to pay for the car it probably won't do you any good.

So your allowance will be calculated using your annual salary after all taxes are deducted.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	if your salary is $70,000, they will give you $10,000 as a moving allowance, but it will be run thru like a payroll check with taxes deducted, so you will only actually get maybe $7500?
AA12206708	First off, you guys ought to learn how to spell principal.  LOL<br>  <br>  To be honest, it depends upon the terms of your loan.  Have you reviewed the paperwork?  People don't realize that there are different ways of financing a car and how they apply interest.  MOST banks, lending institutions will set up a simple interest loan, where any excess is applied to principal (prepayments), AFTER the current month's interest is applied.  However, there ARE still loans that are based upon the rule of 78, whereby you have to "essentially" payoff the car and they rebate your interest back to you at the ending payoff.  Interest was added for the full term of the loan to your payment calculation and then the monthly payments are figured.  This is not the best way (for the consumer) to have the loan set up.<br>  <br>  Please review your paperwork/contract.  It will tell you more.  Also take a look at the TIL (truth in lending) disclosure, the form with the boxes at the top.  By law it has to state info about prepayment penalties, etc.  Most reputable loan companies are going to allow you to pay off your car early.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Any extra money you pay make it a separate check and marked it as an extra principle payment.|`|G1XqmETjaa	go ahead and pay extra and mark the payment as principle payment. they should credit the account that way. but they do not always have to depending on the contract you signed. if they put the extra towards interest and principle it will still pay out early however when they put the extra towards prepaying interest it will show the account prepaid which will allow you to skip a payment in the future in case of an emergency. and at the end of the loan they will have to recredit your account for the prepaid or unearned interest and lower the final payoff.

fb1e7616e1c623b16e467894d58ab980aa	I work for Countrywide.  Landsafe orders the appraisal from appraiser's that are "approved" licensed appraiser's.   "Approved" meaning appraisers that do good appraisals and return them in a timely fashion.  They are not on our payroll.  They just get paid for doing their job.  We do have some appraisers that are employed by Landsafe but I really doubt that's who is doing your appraisal.  They usually do reviews if there is a problem.  You shouldn't have a problem.|`|1d5a771d5453562b745de964f84446fcaa	Landsafe is countrywide's own appraisal division. They are known for being very conservative in their values.

If you have any other questions about landsafe write me @ mdesdunes@sicloans.com|`|cad56fe7012d3f93d1b2133fe73da52daa	Bingo.  Countrywide owns Landsafe.  That's why they only use them.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately, Landsafe is really just a middleman.  They only retain a few actual appraisers on staff as review appraisers.  The rest, they have gone around the country finding decent, conservative appraisers to contract their work through as needed.  They couldn't possibly support having appraisers on their own payroll all across every part of every state.<br>  <br>  Rest assured, their appraisers are experienced, and had to provide numerous samples of their work in order to get contracted through Landsafe.  <br>  <br>  I've used them a handful of times for review appraisals and out-state jobs, and have always been satisfied with the job done.

8zN9SgBVaa	WAIT !!!..you need to read the papers and watch the news hun. Right now you are talking about the $7,500 (or %10 of the purchase value of the home whichever is less) tax credit for first time home buyers which is actually an interest free 15 year loan from uncle sam. The new proposal on the docket for 2009 is a $15,000 (%10) home buyers (not first time) tax credit that does not have to be payed back. so hold your horses and it will turn out in your favor. Do not amend your taxes because you can claim either the $7,500 tax credit or the $15,000 on your 2009 taxes whichever benefits you most. I sure hope this has helped you.|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	Two choices:    (1) You can amend your return for 2008 and mail it in to the IRS.  They will process and send you your additional refund in 2-3 months.    (2) You can wait and include the purchase on your 2009 return and then you will get the credit soon after you file your 2009 next year.    Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  Enrolled Agent    This advice is based upon my understanding of the tax law at the time it was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.  See my profile for more information.|`|2QuW98BXaa	you can file another return before April 15th and the IRS will disregard the one you filed earlier.    just remember that it's more of a 15-year loan than it is a tax credit, and you will be paying it back $500 per year over the next 15 years.|`|att4qXouaa	DO NOT file another return!!!!!!!

Back then, it was quite easy to qualify, but that may have changed in the new environment.

You can also use a financial calculator, available free from many financial education websites, to determine how quickly you can pay off your car loan at various monthly payment amounts.|`|ztFk9lh4aa	If you're in the financial situation to do it, i agree with Doreen for expressly that reason. Build your own credit history. With that regard, a longer loan term with on-time payments will be better for your credit than a shorter term loan. However, you really don't want to be paying off a car for more then 3-4 years, so do what you can comfortably to pay the loan off earlier than 5. Now is a great time for a car buyer to get into a new car for a fraction of what it cost a couple years ago. Make sure you have the best deal possible. Shop around - mention you're still shopping around and maybe an even better deal will present itself, whether that be in a lower purchase price for the car or 0% financing for something similar. Good luck, and enjoy the new car!|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	chances are you currently owe a lot more than the car is worth, so you would have to come up with the difference to pay off the old loan or add it on to the new car loan, which will immediately make that car worth a lot less than the loan on IT as soon as you drive away - I say keep the current car until you reach 200,000 miles - that's my goal with my car - then I'll give it to one of my kids|`|7a1604768bf7474c9170d8cc6d86d9f2aa	I wouldn't take out a loan for a car.<br>  I definitely wouldn't pay for a car for 5 years.<br>  <br>  Car debt is just another consumer debt, on a 5 year loan you will probably spend the first 1.5-2 years upside down (owing more than the car is worth) and paying way too much interest in the long run.<br>  <br>  Why not pay off the current car, start saving for the next car then (by applying that payment to savings where it earns interest for you, rather than profit for the lender).<br>  <br>  The slide-show in "sources  is worth the few minutes it takes to watch, it explains the downside to car payments better than I can.
A5OnwUjAaa	Is the person you interviewed with easily available if you went to the store or office? Like if you went there and said "May I please speak to so and so..." they would say sure and let you in? If not or if they are by appointment basis, make an appointment first. If they try to deny you access by the secretary saying "what's this about?", you can say "it's a personal matter, that I'd like to discuss with them in person."    Then talk to the person you interviewed with.    Say "Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the position the other day, I received an online notice saying I wasn't hired. Could I just take 5 minutes of your time to discuss why I wasn't the best candidate and what I could have done to improve my chances? It would really help me in staying proactive in my job search efforts." and give a sincere smile even if it was over the phone (people can hear a smile in your voice) but try to do it in person if possible, it's harder saying no in person.     Giving an exact time like "Could I just take 5 minutes of your time to discuss...." makes the person feel like "ok, this person isn't going to beg me for a job and make a scene, this is going to be quick." So it's important to give a specific time of minutes in your request.    At the end say "Well thank you for your time (insert name). I truly appreciate your input, here's my card if you feel there is a different position which I may qualify for." and hand them your business/contact card. You can buy some card design paper from Walmart to use with your home printer.     As always remember to look good/clean, smile, be positive etc...    Also, someone above in the other answers said something along the lines of "you have a right to know why you weren't hired." and that's not true. They don't have to tell you anything if they don't want to, that's why you have to go in there and be nice to get the info you want. Another person said large companies won't tell you or give you a generic answers, no point in replying back to large companies, etc... Well, emails to large companies won't work...phone or in person meetings might. Even if you get a generic response, which you might or might not, you could use that time to ask how to improve and get some face time with them showing you're a go getter/ follow through person.     Best of luck to you in your efforts!    PS: Emailing straight to their inbox might work (not a generic email address), specially if you are sure you don't want to go in person, which I recommend, but it may not be for you. There's a higher chance to get a generic answer but at very least they'll have some pleasant memory of you that will last another week maybe.They get so many emails|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	You can send an email thanking them for their time but it would be considered inappropriate to send an email asking why they didn't hire you.     Besides, they would just give you some generic answer like: "We could not find a place for you at our company", "We've decided to go in a different direction", etc. They would never be specific.     If it was large retailer like Wal-Mart then I wouldn't even send an email thanking them, it'll have no chance of ever reaching the person you interviewed with.|`|uCqxkEhUaa	I would ask them to tell you why.  You have the right to know.|`|WU7xMQCyaa	Lots of people would have applied, you should thank them for there time, it is up to you if you can ask why you wasn't hired but there is a lot of competition.
AA11223133	Hi yes you can make money on the internet, however there is nothing that will get you rich quick and you certainly wont earn a fortune.<br>  <br>  Firstly log on to www.slicethepie.co.uk (or .com cant remember) and sign up and go into their scout rooms. They pay you 3p-15p just for listening to songs people have uploaded and reviewing them. (3p is what you get paid the first few days and weeks and the better your reviews are the more they pay you).  I've get paid form them without fail every month.<br>  <br>  www.valuedopinions.co.uk is one of the best ones I've found for surveys, but you could get one every day for a week and then nothing for a few weeks.  But its still a good way of earning a bit on the side.<br>  <br>  Also, do you carry out much research / or search for things on the internet? And I bet you use google right? Well I use a special search engine via yahoo and it actually pays you 2p every time you do a search and they pay you after you've earned ￡20 via paypal or your bank if you prefer. Its not much obviously, but if you're on the internet anyway, why not get paid for it. <br>  <br>  If you want to know the link and stuff for that then just email me katehughes2706@yahoo.co.uk|`|7a1604768bf7474c9170d8cc6d86d9f2aa	Work odd jobs, put up fliers at the local market advertising your services as a dog walker, snow shoveler, leaf raker, lawn mower, etc etc.<br>  There is good money in odd jobs, you just have to look/act professional and be cheerful and you should get plenty of repeat customers.<br>  <br>  Online surveys are mostly scams, and even the ones that do pay are too much hassle for almost no money.<br>  Money comes from work, investing, and selling.

AA11758925	when they say you will get mail-usually means you have been declined and will receive there letter that you were declined. Don't know how you got a credit score of 999 :) Sorry- but it seems like all the bailouts these companys are getting to loan more etc. had a reverse effect and they actually are lending less and making it more difficult to obtain a loan. Personally, my fiance applied thru citi-financial for a loan for 2500 with a very great credit score to consolidate two credit cards to one montly citi payment and was told she was declined and would need a co-signer. 2 years ago my credit was fair and they gave me 3500 instant.  I know the branch manager and he told me that a year or 2 ago they would have gave her whatever she wanted.- but look at citi stock and i guess you see why. The true question is this bailout money to loan more isn't being used for it, but it sure buys these companys luxury vacations- bank of america a luxury suite for there corporate people at super bowl, jets etc. Great bailout to use for vacation i guess.|`|EatBSWv2aa	Hum that is weird if you say your score is 999  then you should of been qualified  because i have a friend whos first card she got was from a dept store & it was Macys, she didn't have any credit & they qualified her there in about 10 minutes with a $100.00 limit & even gave her a 15% discount on her purchase.

Finish by adding that you would be willing to meet them at their preferred date and time, if they would like to interview you.<br>  Good luck.

QoVL5cDHaa	Has you Mum made a will? What will happen depends on the terms of that, but the debts won't go away. Most likely outcome will be that you and your sister will have a choice. Pay the debts and inherit the house, or sell the house, pay the debts out of proceeds, and share the monies left.  If your Mum has all these debts, she may have used the house as security, so lenders may well put a charge on house. If the house is her only asset, debts will be set against that first. If there are any debts not settled by sale of house (no assets remaining) you and your sister are not personally liable. In that case lenders may get so much in the pound when house is sold. If lenders hassle you, and they do sometimes, you do not have to pay anything, once estate assets are used up. If you kept house sale money, and there were still debts, then they could come after you.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Despite what bizzy thinks, their debts do NOT go away if they leave an estate, which, as they own a house, they will.

She could try transferring the house into your name though so they can't take it away to pay the debts. Anyway, I doubt that you and your sister would have to pay for anything.

bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	I would file a stolen identity against your mother and have a report put into all of your credit files requiring your direct permission for any credit.  What your mother did to you is bad and she is using your sister in the same way so you might want to have your sister do the same thing so that you cut your irresponsible mother off from both of your credit.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	I dont believe you can enter into a binding contract (like an agreement to repay a debt) before the age of 18 so, if you had loads of time to pursue the matter, you can get a lawyer and fight to have everything absolved that was in your name before the age of 18 and place it all  back on your mother.  It gets a little trickier though after you turned 18.  I believe that you didnt know any better at the time, but the courts wont look at it that way.  You were of legal age and your mother had your consent.  Besides, it would be really tough to prove any of that unless she had forged your signature on all the credit applications.  The only way to get out of any of the trouble she got you into would be to expose her activities and get her into trouble with the law.  Personally, I think she deserves to spend time in jail for ruining your future and stealing your identity, but you expressed concern over not doing anything to her that would cause her to stop allowing visits with your sister.  The only other thing you can do is to just wait until the bad information starts to drop off your credit report, which is typically 7 years from the date of the last activity (last payment or last charge). Although it IS a good time to buy a house, is it NOT a good time for you and your husband to buy one.  You need to start working on repairing your credit now, and dont even start looking at new homes until BOTH your scores are up closer to 700.  Unless you bust your mom, you're going to have to just suffer the consequences of her bad decisions and fix the credit issues yourself.  Even if you DID bust her, it still takes a long time to clean up the mess that is caused by identity theft so, my advice would be to just forget about a home for now.  Although it doesnt seem like much of a difference between a score of 500 and one of 700, it can actually take YEARS to get your scores up into that range.  They go up SOOOO slowly, and only a few points at a time.  And there are a ton of things that can negatively affect your credit report that you might not even be aware of.  It took me 4 years to clean up our credit, and our scores were in the low 600's.  I took advantage of the time by reading up on how to repair credit and how to buy a home without getting screwed, and we also saved up some money for a down payment and all the closing costs.  Start now by pulling your credit reports and seeing what you have to deal with.  It's probably so messed-up you would be wise to seek the help of a credit counseling agency.  (Check the company out first through the BBB since there a million scammers out there).  From this point on, make very sure you pay all your bills on time.  It does no good to bust your butt cleaning up your credit if you're just going to let delinquencies keep it ruined.  You need to educate yourself, first and foremost, on the world of credit and reporting bureaus.  Read up on it and, when you're closer to being ready, read up on buying a house.  If you go to a mortgage lender without any knowledge of what you're doing, you will be screwed.  I'm sorry to say, but I believe you have several years to go before you can get things squared away, so you have plenty of time to educate yourself.

AA10464818	The Government has created a portal to help individuals who need benefits because of life events. Visit http://www.govbenefits.gov    The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt.    Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.    There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.    You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.

Personal purchases such as that are NEVER deductible.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Write your "games and such" off your taxes how?  Like a deduction for games you've purchased?  Games you got for free from GS?  I don't think I quite get what you're saying.  But I'll tell you this, I spent more than $2500 last year on gaming gear so if there's a deduction out there, I wanna' know about it!    Kudos to you if positive info comes in on this.    Peace!  The Reverend|`|7rCVGVvKaa	It sounds as if your manager has no idea what he is talking about.  If you purchased games for personal use, then NO, you cannot write them off on your taxes.

This is mostly for security reasons as fraud is rife and you could pretty much be anyone handing that cheque over.  Although I've heard a few shops may still take cheques but don't get your hopes up as this is only a very small percentage that will take them.  Most people only use cheques nowadays when sending a payment through the post to pay for utility bills ie, gas, electric.  Nowadays most shops won't even accept signatures when paying for goods and accept whats called chip and pin where your card will have a chip embedded in it and you type in a pin when purchasing goods.    Hope this helps.

The Penn Foster Career School as another poster suggested is NOT accredited by the American Bar Association.  That is key and what 99.9% of law firms and offices look for.  It indicates what the school taught you follows the ABA academic curriculum.  Additionally, there are certain things you learn in paralegal school no way in heck you can learn online.  You are given on hands instruction in certain areas and how to fill out various legal forms. Again, you cannot be taught this online which is why the ABA has never approved an online institution.  This is just like the Concord School of Law.  An online program and ABA does not recognize them.  In fact, if you graduate from this online program you are only allowed to take the Bar exam in the state of California.  Let me lastly add, per that Foster school website it states in the States of California and South Dakota, a Paralegal Diploma will not qualify graduates for employment as paralegals.

With this example, if you make $50,000/ 12 months = $4166 x 35% = your mortgage, tax, insurance probably shouldnt exceed $1458 per month.   Yes, you can afford a home, but what mortgage would you qualify for is the real question.  Use a mortgage calculator and make sure your montly payment doesnt exceed $1458 after adding insurance and tax estimates. :)|`|OLoKKuPvaa	you can afford a home with a purchase price of $100,000.00.   This is based on 20% down  $20,000.00.    This is at a rate of 6.125 (yuck) Conventional  30 yr fixed - Amortized payment and you would pay NO points and NO prepay penalties.   THIS is based one fact that you and your husband have Fico scores of AT LEAST 740.     Your payment would be  $621 which includes taxes & insurance.  There...that's your answer.  SO....how can we get more house??    1)  Payoff your debt........(but do NOT close your credit cards...the more AVAILABLE credit with 0 balances the better)  2)  Keep ALL payments current and NO LATES......and if you don't have ALOT of credit...GET MORE.....open a few credit cards...charge on them then pay them off.......and DONT use them.  Your Fico score will go down a little but will go UP as time goes on and you DONT use the card but have made yourself new/Avaliable credit.   Remember..the higher Fico score...the better your interest rate/pricing will be!!    3)  SAVE SAVE SAVE your money and then SAVE some more.....20% down is the BOMB and NO Mortgage Insurance! OH YEA!!  ...there are programs where you can put less down BUT the rates will be higher meaning a higher payment and expensive monthly mortgage insurance.    4)  CHIN UP!!!!  Where there's a will there's a way!!   It may take time but will be WELL WORTH IT......Homeownership ROCKS!!  Good Luck!!    Sincerely,  laid off in Livermore!

This determination is based on many factors, such as the intent and nature of the contract between the payer and worker, the level of control that the payer has over the worker, whether the worker provides his own tools, the degree of financial risk assumed by the worker, as well as many others.    Presumably, your "employer" has determined that you are an employee as opposed to a self employed independent contractor.      If you disagree with this determination, you should speak to the employer and explain that you want to be treated as an independent contractor rather than an employee.  But you should understand that it is not simply a matter of arbitrary choice; but rather that the employer has to consider the situation in light of the factors mentioned above.    See below for the Canada Revenue Agency guide that deals with the issue of employee vs self employed.

It works in following manner:<br>  Interest paid on the home loan <br>  As per Sec 24(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 a deduction up to Rs. 150,000 can be claimed. This deduction is claimed towards the total interest that we pay on the home loan towards purchase or construction of house property while computing the income from house property. <br>  <br>  The interest payable before you acquire home or start the construction work would be deductible in five equal annual installments commencing from the year in which the house has been acquired or constructed.<br>  <br>  In case of self- occupied property, this deduction is allowed only for one such self - occupied property. The interest towards home loan taken for purchase, construction, repairs, renewal or reconstruction of house property is eligible for deduction under section 24(b).<br>   <br>   <br>  Principal repayment of the home loan  <br>  As per the newly introduced Sections 80C read with section 80CCE of the Income Tax Act, 1961 the principal repayment up to Rs. 100,000 on your home loan will be allowed as a deduction from the gross total income subject to fulfillment of prescribed conditions. Let us consider a hypothetical example.<br>  <br>  Your taxable Income: Rs 5,50,000 <br>  <br>  Principal repayment for the same year: Rs 1,10,000 and Interest payable for the year: Rs 1,60,000 <br>  <br>  Total Deductions allowed: Rs 2,50,000 (Rs 1,50,000 towards interest payable & Rs 1,00,000 for principal repayment of the loan) <br>  <br>  Thus, your taxable income will reduce to Rs 3,00,000 ( Rs 5,50,000 - Rs 2,50,000 ).|`|OZyb6acOaa	There is rebate only on housing loan. only If, possesion had recd. by you. there is two type of rebate:<br>  1. for Payment of Interest on Home Loan U/s 24(b) : upto 1,50,000/-      p.a. including 20% Intt. paid uptill date of possession.

FkQXcZW9aa	First thing to do with SEO is to pick your keywords.  This choice should be based on the volume for that keyword (the is no point optimising for a word no one uses)  , the commercial intent (the word may be relevant but not lead to sales eg I am more likely to buy from the search "dog kennel" than the search "dogs".  Obtainability what is the level and volume of competition (its much easier to actually get some words than others - dont wast your time on words where the competition is fearce).  Failing to pick you words wastes more time than anything.<br>  <br>  Remember some links are worth way more than others - So Focus your efforts here.  1.  high Page ranked sites.  2. if you control the anchor text (use selected keyword.  3.

Too often, Web site owners believe that they need thousands of links to rank well in the search engines. That is simply not true, regardless of what vertical, or industry, your Web site is in. For optimal success, your approach should be dictated by quality over quantity. Developing the skill set required to quickly evaluate potential link partners includes learning how to identify the age of a domain, the uniqueness of content, and the potential for incoming traffic. Evaluating potential link partners for quality and focusing on those quality links is a key part of the link-building process and provides an opportunity for you to focus on some of the important factors that search engines take into consideration when determining the quality of the Web sites that link to<br>  your Web site.<br>  <br>  Once you have identified potential link partners, you want to determine the anchor text to use for each link. This part of the Google algorithm focuses not on how many links you have pointing back to your Web<br>  site, but on what those links say. Approaching the rest of the link-building process with a list of keywords that you want to use as anchor text is essential to your link-building success. You should use a variety of anchor text throughout your link building to ensure that the search engines can determine the overall theme of your site.<br>  <br>  For more details you can visit this website, www.neuracom.com.

I have done this type of work in the past and it can be very tough but also rewarding.<br>  I would say if you are being paid by the family for companionship then that it what your 'job' is.<br>  When I did this type of work, the transportation and errand running WAS part of my job and what I was paid to do.  It seems though your job is to visit with her.<br>  I would speak with the family and let them know what is going on.  Maybe they would be willing to impress upon the assisted living center that transportation/errands are included in the price they pay and they shouldn't be putting these responsibilities on you when they aren't part of your job description.  I would stress the fact that the purpose of your employment is to spend quality time with their loved one and picking up her prescriptions, etc detracts from the little time you have to spend with her.  I know these conversations can be difficult, maybe a well thought out and sincere letter to them would be a good way to lessen the uncomfortableness.  Maybe the family would be willing to pay you extra for transport, mileage or errands.<br>  As for the next time the workers ask you to do something that they are being paid to do, I would simply tell them that is what they are being paid for, "I am here for companionship and it is your responsibility to take care of these things."  They certainly won't like it but that is not your problem.  It is your problem that you have gone along with this up until this point and unless you want to continue being pushed around you really need to assert yourself.  I believe you have done these things even though it's not your job because you are a wonderful and caring person, it doesn't make you any less those things to stand up and speak out.

kbJt4065aa	They do that so that they can jack up your interest rate for being over limit. I had a couple credit cards that did that to me. They lowered my limit by thousands right before they added on the interest for the month. They can't legally lower it below the balance. So, what they do is wait for the day before they put the interest onto the balance and they lower it the day before. Then, they add your interest and an overlimit fee as you are now over limit. Now your interest is 27% because you went over limit.. <br>  Balance transfer now if you have the credit to do it. Do it quickly because in a week or so when they know your at your limit your credit score will lower for having the card maxed out. <br>  I couldn't balance transfer mine as I waited to long and tried to fight it with them while my credit score was dropping and I didn't know it. Now I'm filing for bankruptcy as I was on unemployment when they did that to me. I went from 9% interest to 27% interest on just about everything. Because they got greedy and kicked me when I was down already they won't be getting anymore of my money.|`|6ce7986cabba45af8f81fc1ecc5ef3a6aa	With the credit cards I have dealt with, none of them are every lowered below the credit line, as the other gal said, they are not legally allowed to do that. You usually have anywhere from 80 - 100 dollars left available at the time the limit is lowered.<br>  <br>  What happens is either A) you don't realize your limit has been lowered and then go over the limit, or B) your statement prints shortly thereafter and your finance charges put you over the limit.<br>  <br>  I would suggest calling and asking to speak to a supervisor. Explain the situation, and they may waive your over the credit limit fee, if your interest rate went up then lower it, and somehow bring you back below the limit. As a supervisor with a credit card company, I am seeing this happen and always bring the customer back below the credit line. Also, they cannot say "we will not raise your limit." If you call and request a credit line increase, then they have to put it through and not discourage you. If they are, then they are in violation of a regulation they must follow.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief credit card companies do not wait till a couple days before your cycle ends then lower the limit so they can collect fees.

7qr2GprBaa	This is how I started saving money when I was having financial problems just out of college:<br>  <br>  Write out a list of all of your monthly bills: Rent (or mortgage), car payment, student loans, electric and/or gas, phone, cell phone, cable, etc. These are roughly the same every month. If you are not on a budget helper plan with your utilities companies, get on one, at least for now, so there are no surprises. <br>  <br>  Next, think of any quarterly, semi annual or annual payments you have to make, like car insurance, health club memberships, association dues, etc. Figure out how much you spend on these bills over the course of a year and then divide it by 12. That how much you would spend on these bills if you had to pay them monthly, so put that amount into a savings account every month. That way the money is there when you need it, and you're not getting the bill and thinking OMG where am I going to get the money for that!<br>  <br>  For day to day expenses, I wrote down every penny I spent for 2 months, and I mean EVERY penny, right down to a soda at the mall or a newspaper out of the vending machine. After 2 months I added upt what I was spending my money on and figured out where I could cut out or cut down. For example, instead of buying a paper every day, I just bought the Sunday paper, because that was really the only one I took the time to read. Plus, it came with a ton of coupons.<br>  <br>  I didn't have to do this, but some people find it helpful to have different envelopes with the money they need for a bill that's coming up. If you are the kind of person who spends their money if it's in the account, it can be helpful to withdraw the money and put it in an envelope marked for that bill. Then when the bill comes in the mail, put the money back in the account and pay the bill. <br>  <br>  I added an extra $50 a month to that savings account for car repairs. I didn't have a car payment, and my car was older, so I knew there were going to be things that needed repair. Fortunately I didn't have to use it that often, so I was able to really start saving money. <br>  <br>  Credit card debt. I had a ton of it, so I quit using my credit cards. Every month I paid 10% of the balance due on each card until it got down to $1,000, then I paid $100 + the amount of interest the company charged each month. Just so you know, you can cancel your credit cards and still have a balance on them...you don't have to wait until they are paid off to cancel them. If you think you will be tempted to use the card, then do this. Keep one, just in case you have an emergency, but keep it at home, or leave it at your parent's house, so you're not tempted to pull it out of your wallet for that "bargain" you just can't pass up. As each of these credit cards got paid off, I added $100 to the amount I was putting into savings every month. <br>  <br>  If you find that you still have "too much month left at the end of your money", take a good look at your budget and see where you can trim. I cancelled my cable, because I really didn't watch that much TV anyway. If you just can't bear to live without that, call the cable company and find out where you can trim the fat. cut back to basic and/or drop all your premium channels. Call your car insurance company and ask how much you would save if you increased your deductible. Tell all these companies you just lost your job. They may be more sympathetic to helping you and might divulge little secrets that the general public doesn't know about. <br>  <br>  If you have way too many expenses for your income, the one big thing to do is move. If it's at all possible, ask your parents if you can move in with them for X number of months until you can get some bills paid off. If that is not possible, consider moving in with some roommates, or if you own your own home, advertise for roommates to live with you.

However, the most important component in the Forex market - or any other market, in fact - is to have an edge that you believe will allow you to profit over a period of time. Many of those tools that you mentioned can help capture that edge, but you need to have a firm understanding of why you are using some - if any - of the tools you mentioned, before you go about using them. This, unfortunately, is the hardest part of trading successfully: consistently capturing a market inefficiency enough to profit.|`|I1VivZxfaa	Ditto to Common Sense's comment.

Prefer Companies listed in your home country or North America (US & Canada), UK etc where their are strict laws against fraud. Prefer Public listed companies( like  listed on stock exchanges)<br>  <br>  * Again even if company looks  promising it's good idea to search for <br>  "[company/website name] scam" to check.<br>  <br>  * Once you sign up, don't go out spending money to promote your referrals unless you have at least seen a REAL check.<br>  <br>  * Remember no matter who tells you, you will not make millions of dollar from home, I have not seen anyone myself.

vp8806Eraa	The short answer is yes. Any overdraft is supposed to be a "temporary borrowing facility", and unfortunately this means that all banks have a clause in their Terms and Conditions which allows them to demand this money to be repaid.<br>  <br>  The best solution is to get a face to face appointment with your bank manager so you can sit down and talk it over with them. It is well within their power to agree a payment plan with you - ask for them to freeze any further charges or interest, and agree how much you can afford to pay back each month. Be honest with the manager, and they should be able to do a deal with you. <br>  <br>  In the unlikely even that they refuse to create a payment plan with you, then you will be better off financially to get a loan (shop around to get the best interest rate) to use to pay off the overdraft, as the interest rate they will charge you on the overdraft is likely to be much higher than that of the loan.|`|0e8mlXveaa	You need to check the terms and conditions of the overdraft but I think you'll find most of them do state they can request full payment at any time.

The distinction is (in theory) clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; but, if you buy a bond or a share of stock, this transfer payment is excluded from the GDP sum.

NZuJR79oaa	I disagree slightly with poster one.  Your effective tax rate, not your age is the determining factor for what to choose.<br>  <br>  With a traditional IRA, you put in before tax money that grows tax differed.  You pay taxes on the money when you withdrawal it.<br>  <br>  With a ROTH you put in before that money and it grows tax free and can be withdrew tax free.  <br>  <br>  For those in top tax brackets the 35% savings is worth doing traditional.  If you are in a lower tax bracket, the tax deduction doesn't do you much good, since it only saves you 0 -15% percent.  <br>  <br>  Also, there is no way of knowing what the effective tax rates will be when we retire.  It is possible that all income tax brackets will be increased by 10% or even 30%.  This is why the ROTH is superior in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you are low income and contribute to any retirement account, you may be eligible for a significant tax credit of up to 50% of your contribution.  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf</a><br>  <br>  There is the table and form showing how much credit you will get, so it is possible that you could Fund an ROTH IRA with $2000 and receive a $1000 tax credit.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Roth is what you want if you are anything under 35 years of age.<br>  With the roth you put in money (after you paid taxes), and it grows over the years.<br>  When you are old, you will not have to pay taxes on the interest and gains on that account.

OacSIfSiaa	It is somewhat better then a charge off.  It would all depend upon how much the settlement was for.  They will report it as being paid in settlement but will also show the remainder owed as charged off.<br>  <br>  Unless they agree to a pay for deletion, it will be on your report for 7 1/2 years from the date last missed payment.<br>  <br>  However it will go from a derogatory to a potentially negative entry and the affect will diminish over time.  Creditors will see that you at least came to an agreement and met your end of the deal.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|jcauTPLZaa	It will show up on your credit report for many years to come.

FxWppY7Baa	Buy land with barns and fencing and pasture. than you will need feed, feeding equipment and a lorry or van to haul the stock to slaughter. once slaughtered you will need to bring them back and have freezers or refrigerators to hold the meat until sold. it will cost several hundred thousand pounds to get started even for a small holding (buildings, fencing and livestock are expensive). <br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest working on the kind of farm you someday think you want to run for at least a season before spending a lot of money on the project. this way you will learn what needs to be done for the job and more importantly you will know if you really want to farm or not. farming pays poorly, the work is very hard and when working with livestock quite dangerous|`|6g1MUG5xaa	buy a ranch first then some animals<br>  <br>  <br>  |¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨---<br>  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__<br>  |__________________|||_|___|)<<br>  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|8d68a003da01c4ae915afd4904337634aa	I would suggest maybe becoming a farm hand and learning the ins and outs from an experienced farmer, then buying your own property.

e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	It's not insurance.  It's a "discount plan".  What that means, is they never PAY anything.  You buy a list, of providers that will give you a discount.<br>  <br>  20% off a $100,000 hospital bill, will still leave you with $80,000 in bills.<br>  <br>  Call your local hospital, and your local providers, and ask them what additional discount they'll give you, with your Ameriplan card.   Then ask them what the cash discount would be, for the same service.<br>  <br>  Although Ameriplan is the most reputable discount plan out there, it's still a DISCOUNT plan, and will never pay anything on your behalf.  Many providers won't honor it.  It's not regulated by anyone, and no one needs a license to sell it to you.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	It's not health insurance, it's like a "club", where you get a discount from participating doctors and other providers. A lot of people "recommend" this, and most of them are making a profit from selling it. What they don't tell you is that you can't use the plan unless providers in your area accept it. No providers in my area accept it. But the company would be perfectly willing to take your money anyway. Be very careful. ?|`|94V4c3nUaa	making use of the SE such as google or yahoo to generate some ideas first if you would like to get the massive information,nonetheless if you would not  want to put so much time,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a direct and useful resource for your questions.

Employers don't delay those kinds of decisions for long.<br>  I will assume that the upcoming meeting may be a discussion about steps that can be taken to survive this recession.<br>  Hopefully, and I did this as a first step in one recession, among 7 that I experienced, I had to cut my commission rates for sales personnel.  I also had to reduce medical benefits for all, including myself.  Profits just would not support those current expenses.  I minimized my draw as well, and let my people know it.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you are layed off, now, or later, try to reduce your living expenses, especially debts.<br>  This, hopefully, will allow you to make it with unemployment payments.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

OacSIfSiaa	I have often seen people state that  closing unused credit card accounts will help improve credit scores but this is simply not true. Closing an account means there is either no increase in score or your score can even go lower.<br>  Closed  accounts are not removed from your report. The payment history on closed accounts will continue to be displayed and considered in the calculation of your credit score.<br>  <br>  Closing an account also alters your debt utilization ratio.  This is the amount of credit available compared to how much you owe.  Closing an account will lower your available credit thus increasing your ratio which will lower your score.<br>  <br>  If you have noticed an entry on your credit report indicating you have “too many bankcards,” this simply refers to the number of bankcards on file.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Creditors (like for car and house loans) dont like to loan money to someone who doesnt have a financial back-up.  So Judy is right----it is best to keep the credit card that is the oldest because they want to see a long history of how you handle your finances.  When you get the balances paid down to zero, put the cards away in a safe deposit box, or someplace else other than your purse.  You may want to keep ONE (with a small credit limit) in case you run out of checks at the grocery store, or for emergencies.  I agree if you have any cards that charge a yearly fee, it's better to cancel them and take the small hit to your credit report.  There is no way to have perfect credit because you are danged if you do, and danged if you dont.  It is considered good to have small balances on credit cards that you have high limits on.  It helps your credit score to pay off your credit cards, but it doesnt help your score to always keep a zero balance on those cards.  See what I mean?  It's like they make up the rules as they go along, JUST to keep you from having a perfect credit score.|`|jtnQmAlRaa	You have to call the companies and tell them to close your account. Otherwise if you shred your card and tell them nothing, the account stays open and it doesn't matter.  Even closing a credit card account can hurt your credit score because sometimes they like it when you have  a credit balance.  The thing to do is pay your bills on time, all the time.  Don't worry about the credit score because is is a harmless number that doesn't mean Didley.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Closing credit cards will hurt your score.<br>  You may be closing your oldest account, a big part of your fico.<br>  You may also be reducing your overall available limit on all your cards.<br>  Best for score:  open cards - 0 balances.<br>  Use them for stuff you need - and pay in full each month.<br>  Only close accounts if they carry an annual fee.<br>  If your oldest account carries a fee, open a new card first, then close the oldest.<br>  /|`|bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	Part of your score is from the amount of available but unused total credit lines you have.  By closing the account you are reducing the total available credit.<br>  <br>  Part of your score comes from time.  If this account was only open a year or two, it probably won't matter on this category, but if it was open a long time, you lose the points associated with long relationships.
426c7e7a5991d86301d54a664d725cfbaa	Communication Skill is important in every industry. In IT this is more important as you are tyring to develop something which is someones thought. So it is not dependent on what's your job profile. If you are Business Analyst, Communication is very  important as whatever you communicate will be converted into code. If you are developer it is equally important to tell others what you have done and how you have achieved the task. And as manager it is of utmost importance, you need to communicate within team and outside team with top management and clients. <br>  Anyways don't you think communication is important in every part of life|`|cWuumdy7aa	you need to be good engineer and communication skill is important only if you are in marketing.|`|qBCGH52haa	Depends on what you want to do.

Prices are low right now but just remember they can go up anytime and you dont want to get your self in a whole.  If you get a long with your parents then i would consider staying there.  Well also it depends on how old you are and if your going to college or not.  If you are going to college than i would definatly stay with your parents beacuse that will save you a lot of money.  That is what i am doing.  I help out around the house (not that i have to but i do) and it is way better than wasting my money on somewhere to live when i dont have to.   But i get a long really good with my parents so thats why i like it there.

AA10368727	You have to contact your financial institution to find out when they post direct deposits.  It's different for different banks.  My bank (Bank of America) makes the funds available as soon as they're aware of it (Friday morning).  Some banks don't make the funds available until they actually post it, which could be as late as the next business day after they receive it.  And some banks don't make the funds available until the second business day after they receive it (the business day after it's been posted).  This is why the IRS, although they transmit it to the banks on Thursday Night/Friday Morning, says that your return will be deposited on the following TUESDAY...because they're covering all the contingencies for the various bank policies out there.<br>  <br>  Yahoo!

qHwfuNKIaa	Sell space, not stuff.<br>  <br>  Selling products is not as simple as it sounds. I suggest that you work out a deal with the school to stage some kind of event. Maybe a Bingo night or a pancake breakfast.<br>  <br>  Extending the same basic idea of selling space, organize some kind of sale. Offer cafeteria, auditorium, or parking lot tables for $20.00 per day so that folks can bring in their own stuff and sell it. Keep in mind that this could be promoted as a 'green event' because some of the stuff would be gently used items - the buying of which might reduce the carbon footprint and all of that happy-sounding stuff.<br>  <br>  Advertise your event on the school website and canvass the area to get the word out. You'll make some money and you won't have to invest in inventory - which may or may not sell.<br>  <br>  Another idea would be to organize a book fair with a major publisher, like Follett. <a href="http://www.flr.follett.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flr.follett.com/</a><br>  <br>  the school gets a 'cut' of every item Follett sells. They set up in your library or cafeteria and people buy books, videos, and other good things.<br>  <br>  If this is a team project, present your ideas to the group and let your teacher provide the tools needed to reach a decision as to which idea(s) are/is best.

L4rlu2BDaa	Your credit rating/report is solely yours. When companies credit check you they base there decision solely on your credit not anyone else. However they can turn someone down if someone who lives with them has a bad track record, they can't base his decision solely on your rating but because you are a tenant and some of the income he would have declared will depend on you paying your rent. seeing that you've missed a few bills, will show that some of his income isn't safe to calculate and they can decline saying he can't afford the repayments. In theory if you didn't pay your rent he probably wouldn't be able to. so they will base there decision on your bad history reflecting on his income level.|`|AA11908567	Credit rating is on an individual.|`|Hae8acnpaa	If you both share an address and you have bad credit it will affect anyone else living there.

You can shop to be competitive on this rate. These services are a good idea because you have other considerations like unemployment.

If the business of your business is not payroll, don't do this yourself - keep your eye on the ball.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	HAHAHA PAYCHEX, OMG they cost money the payroll processing people like ADP and Paychex.  Okay first of all you decide on what the employee's hourly rate is going to be and we will use 10.00 an hour for an example:<br>  <br>  Let's say your employee works 40 hours in a week.  10 x 40 =400.00<br>  <br>  Now you have to deduct Fica, Medicare, State, and Federal Tax from that<br>  <br>  Fica is .062 so .062 x 400.00 = 24.80<br>  Medicare is .0145 so .0145 x 400.00 = 5.80<br>  For federal tax you can use the Circular E and for the State Tax you use the State Tax Withholding Booklet.<br>  <br>  Deduct those amounts from the 400.00 along with the deductions of 24.80 and 5.80 and come up with a net pay and that is what you write the check for.<br>  <br>  Then you have to make a tax deposit and that works like this<br>  Fica x 2<br>  Medicare x 2<br>  Federal Withholding<br>  <br>  You make a check out for this amount and deposit it at your bank<br>  <br>  Then you make a check out to the State for the State tax withholding and send that to the State.<br>  <br>  If you don't have Federal and State Taxpayer Identification numbers you will have to fill out forms to get them.

Therefore, they should be reimbursed for the expenses they were not obligated to pay as the accident or cause of injury was not your fault.

Anything extra is for permanent injury that you will deal with going forward.<br>  <br>  Also, you probably did not pay as much as they paid the healthcare providers.

Daq9gituaa	We have become geared to expect an instant gratification. In other words, when you hit the enter button, you expect a response as soon as you release the enter key. Getting an immediate response or reaction has become commonplace thanks to computers being able to react so quickly. The people that are posting the obnoxious "WMR" do not understand that the IRS wheels only move so fast and that they are not helping by constantly checking for WMR updates on the IRS page. Patience has become a lost quality in the younger generation. They expect everything to happen yesterday.<br>  <br>  PS - Scotty -I have just recently seen some of your responses on Y!A.<br>  I have enjoyed the occasional witty and sarcastic remarks that you have injected on occasion along with some very excellent answers to questions. ( I guess folks will think I am brown nosing)<br>  <br>  Excellent point by CMASS Stan.|`|838bf62c54d3b8485e9f70388fa64a81aa	And you think the questions re refunds are bad here:<br>  <br>  TurboTax Live Community gets a lot of questions/complaints about the IRS moving the DD refund date, blaming it on TT for some reason. It's the taxing body who's responsible, not your tax prep office or software.<br>  <br>  I will echo the sentiment about spending your money before it arrives by adding this: if filers would do a better job of estimating their withholding on their W-4 forms, you'd already have the money in hand instead of fretting about the timing of a mongo-sized refund every Feb-March.|`|ggQLK1Mqaa	I agree w/ the sentiments already expressed, and would just add that is also a function of people being worried that it "didn't go through" or that something went wrong, and oft is probably a latent concern that they aren't going to get their money at all or that something is wrong with it rather than solely a desire to spend it right away.  There's discomfort in the uncertainty of not having it, which drives the demand for it to be there NOW.<br>  The prev comment about the speed of computers is dead on; and while I don't find myself fretting over when I get my refund, I find it interesting that I have gotten more impatient over the years in general as the speed and ease of use of computers has increased.  If it takes a webpage more than a few seconds to load I'm like COME ON!!!!!!  (literally saying this aloud.)  I've noticed it spill over into other daily activities too, which is unsurprising I suppose, but I wonder what implications this will have for future generations who are weaned on computers before they've learned to form sentences.|`|dGcEbqJHaa	I do agree with the other posters that we've become accustomed to instant gratification, but the reason there are so many questions this year is also due to the inordinate number of mistakes and delays made on the IRS end.  I've never had any issues with my taxes before and this year I was told I would receive my DD on Jan 30...I patiently waited until it still wasn't there on Feb 5 before I called to inquire.  I was told by the IRS that it WAS deposited, then had a message about initiating a trace, THEN I was told that they were mistaken and it was not, in fact, deposited and that it was now pulled for review.  Same thing happened to MANY other people.  I didn't spend my refund (which is not a refund of "extra" witholding, btw, and can't be adjusted - it involves other tax credits and business transactions and such), before I got it, nor am I destitute without it.  I am, however, extremely anxious because I've been told five different things...and I'm very careful about such things...straight arrow, rule follower...it's incredibly uncomfortable to be told that there's a problem and not given any details - that's why so many people on here are looking for a tiny bit of reassurance that it's really not a big catastrophe that's happened just to them, and it will be resolved.  Instead of judging people you don't know, perhaps you should just be thankful you didn't get thrown in the unlucky pool of taxpayers who are struggling to figure out what the heck happened with their tax returns.  Somehow I have a feeling if it was your paperwork that was pulled and you were told your tax return was going to be held indefinitely without reason, you'd be raising a pretty big stink.  I mean, you can't even tolerate strangers asking questions of one another without comment on how they're handling their own taxes and finance...don't really see you biting your tongue over your own.<br>  <br>  ----touche!  You did make a valid point, and I definitely agree that folks should increase the exemptions on their W4 if they're getting large amounts back from witholding at the end of the year - I just think a lot of people don't understand how it works. Personally, I think high schools should have a mandatory class on taxes, credit cards, and personal budgets...|`|AA11798704	Unfortunately these days people suffer from what I call a "microwave mentality."

California state posted on their site that there could be a delay of up to 45 days past April 15th and if a budget was not approved it is possible you could get an IOU. We've had some movement on the budget though in the past 48hrs so people are now back on the "where's my money" train.|`|7n1Fg3d0aa	Its not about spending the money before it comes. Its about being helpful, at least the IRS could tell me when its coming...or BETTER YET why its being held up. I guess you guys are not in the situation, so you dont understand. For me personally, I use my return to invest in my business and this year that investing involves opening a second location, I am excited to get things going but I cant until I receive my refund...So can you see why its important to ME? Stop judging people...<br>  <br>  <br>  scotty - I actually prefer to get a large refund rather than having that money throughout the year. Then I have it to use as an excellent resource for making more money. Every year I use my return to invest, and every year it makes more money for me. I have opened 2 businesses with my returns. Please dont lecture me about how I can save it in an account with a high return...just wont work for me. lol<br>  <br>  I just wanted to make a point that not everyone has spent their return before it came, some people are just wondering what happened and when it's coming. I am not freaking out over it, I just think it would be fair for the IRS to give SOME info about it, after all it is MY money.<br>  <br>  <br>  jumjak - now you have me worried. We spoke with the IRS this morning after recieving a new code, we went from a 1121 to a 1201 and so we called to "investigate" and they said the refund was sent out today. So we are all happy until I just read what you said and wondering if the same thing just happened to me. The deposit is not in my account yet....hmmm uh-oh. My bank said it could be at least 48 hours before it shows up. <br>  <br>  I also have never had any issues getting my return on time, this year was the only time I have had this happen. I filed the FTHB tax credit, and I am pretty sure that is what is holding things up for a lot of people. Also, that made my return over 10k, and I think they automatically flag returns over 10k. but this is just an assumption AS NO ONE HAS ANY REAL ANSWERS...lol<br>  <br>  stop judging me for judging you while you judge others for judging...lol jk|`|D4XWrwuaaa	How true. It seems irresponsible to spend the money simply because a computer told you it would deposit on a certain date. You should know it is there first.<br>  <br>  Also, the software I used (H&R Block) didn't specify a date. They said the deposit would be there in 7-10 days. They also have a disclaimer saying you should check with your bank to know when deposits are available to you.<br>  <br>  For instance, if a deposit goes in on 3/1, it might not be available until 3/2 if it goes in after the end of business on 3/1. And it could even be 3 or 4 days if it goes in over a holiday or over a weekend.<br>  <br>  Be responsible people. Check your account available balance before you go blowing your refund!|`|fSlZQzS4aa	People want their refunds yesterday and think that complete strangers can tell them why they don't have it.

If you get laid off and collect unemployment, the benefits you collect, get charged against the UC accounts all your former employers you had during the "earnings" year used to calculate your benefit - they don;t pay your unemployment benefits directly - it just gets charged against their acct - too many unemployment claims against a company in a year and their unemployment tax rat could increase going into the future. The unemployment benefits you receive might only be about HALF of what your were making when you were working and some of it is taxable income to you (used to be all was taxable - Prez Obama just change that).<br>  <br>  So long as the company has actually been paying into the unemployment system on your behalf - you will still get benefits if they totally close down|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Not directly.

Mutual funds will invest your money on a large group of stocks and, depending on their risk level, generaly do ok. If you want something that is guaranteed, then you should go with a CD.

I3CNklLKaa	Directors and Officers Liability Insurance cover protects companies’ directors, officers and senior managers against claims arising from their decisions and actions taken whilst managing their business. <br>  <br>  If a Director is perceived to have failed in any of his duties then a claim could come from any one of a number of third parties including: <br>  <br>  ? Shareholders <br>  ? Creditors <br>  ? Government and Regulatory bodies <br>  ? Employees <br>  ? Auditors <br>  ? Liquidators <br>  ? Customers <br>  ? Suppliers <br>  <br>  In a claim situation the Director’s personal assets are at risk. Directors cannot rely on the company indemnifying them. Often such an indemnity from the company will be in contravention of the Companies Act. Regardless of the stipulations of the Companies Act in the event of insolvency there will be no prospect of the company indemnifying the Directors and Officers. <br>  <br>  The Directors and Officers Liability Insurance Policy will pay on behalf of the Director his legal costs and expenses and any civil damages awarded against him.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Skier is right and had the best answer.

In other words, I don't know if you can do that (most plans don't allow it) and I don't know if I would bother even if I could.<br>  <br>  Instead, why don't you put it into a traditional IRA for a tax deduction?  You can't put the whole $10K in for one year, but you have until April 15 to put $5K in for 2008 and then put the other $5K for 2009.  That way you get a tax deduction of $5K for each year.  (You would need to amend  your 2008 return to take advantage of the 2008 deduction but that is not a big deal).|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	no trick - if you want to increase your 401k contribution by $7500 for the year - that's fine - if might be better to use taht money to pay off any credit cards or loans (other than car) that your have first|`|UDxL7lPqaa	You can't "stick it into your 401(k)."

I have had a needlestick injury and it is scary and emotional, but everything turned out fine. Most if not all hospitals now use a needleless system, meaning the only needles involved are what is used to stick the patient. You no longer use  needles for connecting IV tubings together or giving drug injections into IV lines.  What about Respiratory Therapy or physical or occupational therapy? You would still be helping patients, but with little or no needles involved.

It may be different in your area though. Also check out the Youth Offending Team - it has similar voluntary positions but you would be dealing with younger offenders.

So yes you do have a good chance but if you put it on a CV your employer might think you would not have time to do a full time job. Magistrates have to attend so many sessions per year.

dJnRFpWWaa	The DJIA is supposed to reflect economic reality and that's what it is doing, Of course economic reality is always subject to unsustainable speculation on the upside and panic selling on the downside. So overshooting in good times and undershooting in bad times is endemic to equity markets.<br>  <br>  The most important piece of information for investors to know is how the Obama administration views the current economic debacle and how it forms conclusions regarding what needs to be done to fix the fundamental problems plaguing the American economy.<br>  <br>  As Wilbur Ross pointed out yesterday morning on CNBC if you subtract the total amount of mortgages that tapped homeowner equity that was used to finance consumption we had three flat/negative years and three years of growth of 1% or less. Financing consumption by borrowing equity from your home is unsustainable even when it is used for laudable objectives like financing your child's college education. Now that the home cannot be used by homeowners to consume beyond their means, we are in a pickle.<br>  <br>  It isn't, however, an unsolvable pickle. Jim Cramer was suggesting that we allow distressed homeowners to refinance their mortgage debt into a new 40 year loan with a fixed rate of 4%. I assume that the first would have to conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan amount limitations, so the balance of the mortgage debt would have to be written off entirely or it would have to be repackaged into a second mortgage that was due and payable upon the sale of the property or in 40 years, whichever comes first.<br>  <br>  Other more conservative commentators believe the federal government should encourage foreclosures to take place and concentrate on ensuring that former homeowners and their families have the means to rent a suitable home until they can get back on their feet. This approach avoids rewarding people who behaved badly, but it also comes down hard on those who didn't.<br>  <br>  It's very clear that either you either avert mass foreclosures through refinancings, subsidized or not, or you wring bad loans out of the system by encouraging mass foreclosures, hit your bottom, and begin to rebuild in a sustainable fashion. Or some combination of the two.<br>  <br>  Regardless, the problem will get solved. But as taxpayers and stake holders in the American economy we want the problem solved rationally and at the least expense to the public treasury because we have other problems such as a terribly inefficient and costly health care system and educational system, that need to be addressed.<br>  <br>  The stock market lows are similar to the stock market highs in this respect.

I1VivZxfaa	It depends on what type of stocks.  In general or are you talking about stocks that depend on certain commodities (eg. oil, gas, sugar, etc.).  <br>  <br>  This form of analysis is called seasonals.

The first trader I know to make this to apply it to even the months and days of the week was the same person who invented the Williams %R indicator perhaps 30 years ago.<br>  <br>  In any case, there seems to be a statistical tendency for certain types of stocks to move up, down or sideways based on historical analysis; however, there is no guarantee to predict timing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  <br>  ps.

It's a good way to start or  rebuild your credit as long as you make payments on time and don't go over the limit.<br>  What I didn't like about them was even when I paid off the total amount, they had monthly fees that I wasn't aware of  & when I didn't send in the $5.fee  or so, they tacked on a $25. late fee! So I closed the account.<br>  Their enrollment fee may be higher now , I still get stuff in the mail saying they want me back. After reading the agreement form it said you start out with a $200 limit but their start fee of $149. reduced you available credit to $51. So you are in debt before you even use the card.<br>  I was pissed paying them $30. I didn't feel I owned so why would I agree to start again & give them $150 for nothing?<br>  But if you need to start or build credit it may be worth it as long as you pay on time & pay every month rather you have a zero balance due or not. <br>  $5.00 isn't that much if you are aware of it and late fees aren't tacked on.
49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	I really do sympathise with you as I expect to be in a similar situation myself shortly.<br>  <br>  That's what is wrong with Britain though - people who are on benefits are better off than a lot of those who are working, and some people such as yourself who honestly want to work find that it simply isn't feasible.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can suggest is, could you relocate?  The person above has already said how she had to move to a cheaper house, and I was wondering since you said that childcare facilities are limited in your area, could you move to an area with better facilities?  But then there's always pros and cons to every area - I live in central London where there are great childcare facilities for preschoolers, but I am thinking of relocating as I honestly don't want my child attending a state school in central London.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know what research you've done already, but I have heard that half the people at the Job Centre don't know what the hell they're talking about.  You need to research yourself online to see what help there is out there, and also try other points of contact like your local council.  Apparently people at the Job Centre don't bother to look anything up, so if they don't know about it off the top of their head, they don't tell you about it.<br>  <br>  I know you really want to be working but, if you still find it impossible to get a job and find that you need to claim benefits, can you look into doing some voluntary work?  You sound like you miss the social interaction of having a job and the fact that you used to have somewhere to go outside of the house, so this would at least solve those problems even if you still didn't have any money.|`|ZYouNFQbaa	I was a single parent, my children were 7months and 2 when I found myself on my own.  It was hard work I can tell you. We moved to a small flat that was cheaper rent, not ideal but livable. I missed having a garden. I registered my children for day care, they were open 7.30am til 6pm. I could do half days or full days depending on my work and with the tax credits, they paid toward my child care. Things, were tight, we didn't go out, the children only had new clothes if they were essential or for birthdays and christmas. If you really want to work then you will, you will find a way to make it work. The government does a lot for single parents, the job centre not quite so much, but you also have to help yourself and make sacrifices.|`|NA4jIz4Zaa	I read your question and couldn't help thinking: excuses,excuses,excuses!!!|`|w58roqZ3aa	Hi there i have found one site while searching online that will knock you off your feet,you can make more money on it then any other site, out there you can actually make a full time income for this one site and it is free to join and work on.Nothing beats that one i tell you any way,Here is the link.I know they pay as i have been paid over 400$ + an Ipod Shuffle From Contest I won,So check it out, do some offers and make some cash   <a href="http://homebiznuss.com/livejobs.html" rel="nofollow">http://homebiznuss.com/livejobs.html</a>   (you can also work there part time or Full Time).

First, what you have done with your friends giving out your advice is you have started to develop a niche market. You have also become a thought leader to them.  People would buy your book because what you have done is given them a recommendation and people are looking for recommendations today they need the procedures out in front of them.  They don't want to look through mounds of information.  There is a process out there that will teach you to write your book in 12 hours of actual writing time and many famous people have used it and got their book to a New York Publisher.<br>  <br>  2.  People would be more inclined to read about someone they could relate to.  How it worked for you, the struggles you went through, etc. You tap into your markets feelings, emotions, pain, struggling, etc.<br>  <br>  3.  If I were to a book like this, I would probably spend between $15-$20.<br>  <br>  4.  Actually there is a great deal of benefits from writing your book.  You can actually build a business with your book and sell high end coaching services and products.  You develop your niche market and your readers will follow you.  You have something to offer.  When you write your book you have to think of becoming successful and all the new opportunities you will enjoy.   You will have celebrity status and be recognized as the #1 expert in your field.

Now computers running WIN OS (XP, Vista etc) are everywhere.<br>  <br>  The controversy is that other software creators argue that Bill Gate's company Microsoft was hiding their windows codes which made other software programs that other companies made not run well or optimized on Windows, While Microsoft's own software ran more efficient (example Wordperfect vs Microsoft Office). Also microsoft was putting extra trial/free software such as internet explorer in their Windows OS program, consumer would use Internet explorer more than say "firefox or Netscape" since they wouldn't download or buy these internet program if they were already provided one. This lead to unfair competition / monopoly and anti-trust action against Microsoft.

AQxZQv7paa	There's no company data on how much an average Primerica agent makes. Even though there's over 100,000 licensed reps in Primerica, not everyone does work. Why? Because everyone is an independent business contractor. There's no quotas to meet and no pressure on the sales force to do anything.<br>  <br>  When I first started, I didn't make any money in my first 3 months. My entire first year I made less than $1000. I had no experience, I had no market to work with, and constantly needed help from my uplines. As I gain more experience and became more independent, I made more money. I've been in the business for 4 years now and currently make an average monthly income (in last 12 months) of $6000. About $1000 to $2000 of it comes from overrides and the rest is from my own pen.<br>  <br>  I don't know what your experiences will be when you start at Primerica. Maybe you will earn money right away or more than what I make in my first year or maybe make nothing. Your income will be base on your performance.|`|pRibsCSXaa	Of course there are no statistics on how little the average agent makes, no one would join if they showed that.  However, if they regularly "brag" that they're the biggest marketer of life insurance, with over 100,000+ reps,  we can make some assumptions.  <br>  <br>  If they took 336,373 applications and ALL of them got issued (Not possible, but let's pretend), that would mean the AVERAGE agent paid less than 4 policies last year.  If the AVERAGE face amount was $299,200 and the AVERAGE premium from that was around $500/year, and the AVERAGE agent makes 50% of that (if they're lucky), the AVERAGE agent makes less than $1,000/year.  Now, let's assume that just 1 of those 4 policies are exposed to be ridiculously overpriced by the local State Farm agent, and one of those policies gets replaced, now the AVERAGE agent makes less than $750/year.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what others say, or how many "thumbs down" ratings I get from PFSheep, the numbers don't lie.  However, the "recruiters" do lie.  They make you think everyone is making money.  The joke is on the last guy that signed up.

It can be quite overwhelming if you try to take the whole of it in a single bite. There are so many facets of search engine optimization, from how search engines work (and they all work a little differently) to how a web page is designed. There are enough elements to worry about that you could spend far more time than you can afford to invest in trying to achieve the SEO you have in mind. However, search engine optimization doesn’t have to be such an onerous task that it can’t be accomplished. Not if you understand what it is and how it works. <br>  To increase the traffic u need for your website: <br>  You can:<br>   Create a web site that contains meta tags, content, graphics, and keywords that help improve your site ranking.<br>   Use keywords liberally on your site, so long as they are used in the correct context of your site topic and content.<br>   Include reciprocal links to your site from others as long as those links are legitimate and relevant.<br>   Encourage web site traffic through many venues, including keyword advertising, reciprocal links, and marketing campaigns.<br>   Submit your web site to search engines manually, rather than waiting for them to pick up your site in the natural course of cataloging web sites.<br>  <br>  You can’t:<br>   Trick search engines by embedding hidden keywords in your web site. This is a practice that will very likely get you banned by most search engines.<br>   Artificially generate links to your site from unrelated sites for the purpose of increasing your ranking based on link analysis. Most search engines have a built-in mechanism that will detect this type of deceptive practice.<br>   Artificially generate traffic to your web site so that it appears more popular than it is. Again, there are safeguards in place to prevent this from happening, and if you trip those safeguards, you could end up on the banned list for many search engines.<br>   Force your web site to appear in search engine rankings by submitting the site repeatedly for inclusion in the rankings. A good general rule of thumb is that you should submit your site once and then wait at least six weeks before submitting it again. Submitting it repeatedly<br>  will, again, only lead to something nasty like being banned from the search engine.<br>   Expect search engines to automatically rank you at the top of your topic, category, or keyword as soon as the site is picked up. It could take a little time to build the “status” that you need to reach a high search engine ranking.

FINRA is a self-regulated agency that answers to the SEC. The website is listed below.<br>  <br>  Commodity and futures brokers are disciplined by the NFA.

Your income tax extension can be filed in less than 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  And remember, even though you may be interested in the reasons to extend your income tax return, the IRS doesn’t care or ask. As long as your application is filed correctly, your extension will be granted by the IRS and your new tax deadline will be October 15.<br>  <a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/stress-management-articles/5-good-reasons-to-file-an-income-tax-extension-384797.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlesbase.com/stress-manag...</a><br>  <br>  One reason could be that your taxes are too complicated and you just procrastinate until the deadline has passed.<br>  <a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/143634/taxes/why_you_should_file_a_tax_extension.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_gu...</a><br>  <br>  If you are not able to file your federal individual income tax return by the due date, you may be able to get an automatic 6-month extension of time to file. To do so, you must file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Income Tax Return  by the due date for filing your calendar year return (usually April 15) or fiscal year return. <br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=98155,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,...</a><br>  <br>  You can get an automatic six-month tax extension for filing Form 1040, Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ by filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return on or before April 15th (April 17th for 2006). By filing the extension tax form, you avoid the late filing tax penalty. However, Form 4868 does not extend the time to pay your tax. You must pay the amount of the tax estimated to be due for the tax year.

Don't have everything together, can't get it or yourself together to do it.  Dread of process, Fear of having to pay, etc.<br>  <br>  An extension is an extension of time in which to file and NOT an extension of time in which to pay.

Daq9gituaa	Any amounts of your tax liability that are not paid by 15APR09 will have penalties and interest charged to you for non payment. It might be to your advantage to take action for yourself to get the ball rolling on your unpaid taxes.

The extra funds would then go to paying the IRS debt.|`|vjDKnBHSaa	I know that if you owe the IRS money and don't pay it all by 4/15 then you will get interest and penalties.  If you set up a payment plan, you are still gonna pay interest on the balance until it is paid off.  If you both are claiming single w/no dependents then your tax refund at end of yr will be bigger (which may be this guy's plan) so when you file next yr your refund will be used to off set the tax bill you have this yr.

bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	The tick is a change in price.  A stock is said to be on an uptick when the last price change was upward.  The uptick rule said that short sales could only be made on stocks with an uptick.  This was to prevent short sellers from forcing a stock into a nosedive.  It was more of a limit when shares traded in eighths (12.5 cents per tick).  Now, with shares priced in cents, nobody has to wait long for an uptick, so the rule didn't do much except make for compliance problems with computer systems, so it was eliminated in the US a couple years ago.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	The uptick rule is a securities trading rule used to regulate short selling in financial markets. The rule mandates, subject to certain exceptions, that, when sold, a listed security must either be sold short at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected or at the last sale price if it is higher than the last different price.|`|LmizpuiHaa	Uptick rule was introduced by SEC in 1934 as Rule 10a-1. The rule states that whenever you short sell any security, you should quote the price higher than the last quoted price or at least equal to the last quoted price.This rule prevent the short sellers from adding to the downward momentum when the price of an asset/security is already experiencing sharp declines.<br>  <br>  By putting a short sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that his or her order is filled on an 'Uptick'. Instruments that are not much liquid and for which enough buyers are not easily available to enter into long position, need to follow uptick rule. <br>  <br>  It keeps the price of such securities not to go down to unjustifiable low levels.|`|9m96dsZIaa	The uptick rule was eliminated in 2007. But it was originally designed to limit the executions on short selling. If you short shares of stock (sell them first, buy them later) it had to be done on an uptick.<br>  <br>  A tick is just the change in two consecutive prices. If a stock trades for $50 and the next trade is $50.01 it is an uptick. If the next trade is $50.02 that is another uptick. However, if the next trade is also $50.02 that is called a zero-plus tick (meaning there is no immediate change but the last change was an uptick).<br>  <br>  Under the old rules, if you shorted a stock, it had to be done on an uptick or a zero-plus tick. The idea was to eliminate traders from shorting stocks in a severe downtrend (lots of downticks) thus making the stock fall harder. The SEC felt that traders could unfairly profit by continually shorting a falling stock.|`|POgWt901aa	Forex trading-<a href="http://tradingsforex.info/" rel="nofollow">http://tradingsforex.info/</a>

snh9wzpnaa	20% is 2.5 times as much as 8%.<br>  So just take what your employee says is 8% and multiply it by 2.5.|`|7QuSEwosaa	First of all, it your employer reports 8percent of your tips, then just let it be. Why do you want to report more? It's common to report 8-12 percent of tips and nothing more. Usually the money it takes to tip out the bartender, bus boys/girls/ hostesses, expo, etc takes away a lot of tips anyways. If no one at your restaurant tips out any more then 8percent you will just be bringing more attention to yourself from the IRS. Anyways the easiest way I can tell you how to find out 20percent is to take half of the dollar amount of the 8percent and then double the whole dollar amount of the 8percent and add the other half, that would be 20percent. Example; If 8percent is $5,000 then you'd have $2,500, you'd add $5,000 plus $5,000 and then add $2,500 to get your TOTAL of $12,500 being the 20% rather then $5,000-the 8%. That's the only way you can do the math problem with only the 8%. If you had your total sales you could multiply your total sales by 20 and then divide by 100 to get the dollar amount of 20percent.

If you were unfairly terminated you or forced to quit, you may have other rights besides the right to unemployment compensation. For more information, call the Employee Rights Project at Bexar County Legal Aid.<br>  <br>  What is "unemployment compensation"?<br>  Unemployment compensation is a government program that pays benefits to unemployed or part-time workers who are searching for work. The benefits are based on what you earned before you quit working, and usually last up to 26 weeks. The money comes from a tax paid by most employers. The Texas Workforce Commission runs this program.<br>  <br>  Can I get unemployment compensation?<br>  The best way to find out if you qualify is to check with the Workforce Commission. You can get unemployment compensation if you worked enough time in the year or so before you apply for benefits AND you are able to work, available for work, and actively looking for full-time work UNLESS (1) you were fired from your last job for misconduct OR (2) you voluntarily quit without "good cause." If you have a health condition that kept you from working in the last year and a half, but you are now able to work, give the Commission proof of this from your doctor. If you find part-time work, you can still get part of your unemployment check while you look for a full-time job.<br>  <br>  What is "work-related misconduct"?<br>  "Work-related misconduct" involves serious misbehavior that you knew or should have known could get you fired. Often, misconduct involves violations of an employer's policies about issues like absenteeism or work procedures.<br>  <br>  Some examples of misconduct include: missing work without properly notifying your employer, using the employer's supplies or services without permission, lying to the employer, disobeying direct orders by a supervisor, and refusing to cooperate with co-workers.<br>  <br>  Common reasons for termination -- such as inability to do the job, unsatisfactory performance, bad attitude, or personality conflicts -- are not necessarily "misconduct" and might not disqualify you from getting unemployment benefits. Some examples of behavior that is not misconduct include: <br>  <br>  Missing work or coming in late for an unavoidable reason or with permission from the employer<br>  <br>  Respectful disagreement with the supervisor<br>  <br>  Looking for other work on your own time<br>  <br>  Objecting to mistreatment by the employer<br>  <br>  Filing for worker's comp or unpaid wages<br>  <br>  Accidentally damaging property<br>  <br>  Refusing to work on certain days or to perform certain duties due to religious practices known to the employer<br>  <br>  Failing to work because of a medical problem<br>  <br>  Refusing to do something illegal<br>  <br>  Asking for clarification of conflicting orders<br>  <br>  Being unpopular with co-workers<br>  <br>  Participating in a union<br>  <br>  Refusing to submit to a lie detector test<br>  <br>  You can also defend yourself by showing that you could not prevent what happened, or that you acted in response to wrongful acts by your supervisor.<br>  <br>  What is "good cause" for voluntary quitting?<br>  Some reasons that can be "good cause" for quitting include: not getting paid wages or overtime, harassment by supervisors or coworkers, major changes in your job that make your job worse, unsafe working conditions, and unfair discipline. Before you quit, you must tell your employer about the problem (preferably in writing or with a witness present) and give the employer a chance to fix it. Also, if you can prove that you quit to avoid being fired, your employer will have to prove that you committed "work-related misconduct."<br>  <br>  How do I apply for unemployment compensation?<br>  Write out a statement explaining why you lost your job. Go to the nearest Texas Workforce Commission office, ask to file for unemployment compensation benefits, and give them your written statement. Be cooperative, and be sure to give truthful, complete, and consistent information about your situation. Give the Commission copies of any documents that back up your story. Always keep copies of your statement and the other documents you give the Commission, in case the Commission loses your papers or claims you said something different. NOTE: You will have to reapply for benefits every two weeks while you're out of work.<br>  <br>  Carefully read over the booklet that you get when you apply. Make sure to look through the sections on "special circumstances" and "special programs." These t

Just be there for her.|`|dPULl5hjaa	If you're any kind of a friend, tell HER!|`|WSIZKAQcaa	NO!! Mind your own business. Firstly, the lay off may not include her. Also, if you tell her and she ends up quitting she won't be eligible for unemployment then.|`|oojO4WAraa	Not unless you are the boss.  Otherwise, keep your mouth shut - it isn't your place to pass on unsubstantiated gossip.|`|h5cPbPj5aa	Wait for manager to tell.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Even though it's tempting to tell her, I would leave this up to the manager's discretion. As you said, even though it's probably true, you aren't 100%, and there is no need in upsetting her over something that has a chance of not happening. If you tell her and she does get laid off, she will have to wait in anxiety until the manager finally tells her. If you tell her and she doesn't get laid off, she might start "acting out" (maybe not working as hard, not getting along with others) thinking she's losing her job anyway, and if she doesn't end up losing it, that will reflect poorly in the manager's eyes. Long story short, as much as you feel it is her right to know, if it's true, she will find out soon enough. If she finds out that you knew all along (but don't tell her after the fact, this is just in case she somehow finds out), tell her you weren't 100% sure on the matter and didn't want to risk upsetting her. Good luck.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	If you're good friends with her, you should tell her.<br>  I would want someone to tell me so I can get everything in order that I need to, and that way I can prepare myself for the meeting with the manager.<br>  She has a right to know, especially if everyone else already knows and is talking about it behind her back|`|Sozc3MyFaa	No. Spreading office rumors (even if they turn out to be true) is just poor professionalism and just plain gossipy.  You could theoretically get into some trouble for this as well.  So just MYOB and once she is laid off (if she is) then be a supportive friend.  If this is being whispered about, she might hear it anyway. ANd no need to rub in with "yeah I heard about it months ago..."  Just be a sympathetic but adult friend.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	The fact that her mgr has a chance to tell her but is not doing it may mean that she's going to catch a break?  How approachable is her mgr?  Is it someone who cares about doing the right thing or just a jerk out for him/herself?  If the mgr is approachable, tell him/her about the rumors and why you think allowing the rumors to swirl about your friend without resolution is unfair.  Only tell your friend if you can trust her not to tell that you are  her source.  You have to look out for yourself first!<br>  <br>  On second thought, I agree with righty above.  Going to the MGr may make you look bad.  Just do your job well and be a friend in need.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	It is not your place.  You don't even know it is factual.  When she does talk with her manager, then you need to be a kind supportive friend, but it isn't your place to tell her, and if you do and it comes out (and it always does) you might be the next one on the chopping block.

614e7536de4e88e30f1c294b767a4d00aa	There are a number of publications, including several from the IRS which provide the information.  Generally, however, the computerized systems we use will average out the depreciation based on age.  EX:  A building has a life expectancy of 100 years (normally).  if it's 25 years old, there is 25% depreciation.  In some states (mine) we only depreciate materials, as labor doesn't depreciate. I think, however, that is different from state to state depending on the laws.  If they are depreciating the dwelling itself, it's usually based on age (but there is a maximum amount, as obviously it won't depreciate past a certain point no matter how old it is, if you can still live in it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps

CKPMkfvfaa	Yes, under the new stimulus plan signed by Obama. They government will pay for 65% of your COBRA premium if you were laid off after September 2008|`|dRezbY31aa	Yes, it does, but there is no wording on the bill concerning when this will take place. What it does address: the time-frame that the COBRA administrators must notify "eligible individuals" within 60 days of the effective date of the bill. It also gives the Health Secretary 30 days to begin an "educational outreach program" so I guess we'll find out then.<br>  <br>  FYI - eligible individuals for the purpose of this bill are people who were involuntarily terminated from their job and only if you were terminated September 1 2008 through December 31 2009. The subsidy will last for 9 months or until you qualify for benefits elsewhere. When you do qualify for benefits elsewhere you must notify the COBRA administrator immediately or face a monetary penalty.|`|GAHTFuLPaa	make use of the SE like google or yahoo to get some ideas first if you want to get the massive information,however if you do not want to spend so much time,here <a href="http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/free-online-health-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...</a>  is a direct and good resource for your questions.|`|qBCGH52haa	Yes...the government will subsidize up to 65% of the COBRA insurance premiums for low-income workers.

And she told me up front that there was alot of people that was not putting in what they got on the rebate checks and that was holding alot of things up, so we can be pissed at the IRS, but if people would of filed that, then the IRS would not have to go in and check it out. That is what is causing the delays!<br>  It Stinks, for alot of people.

l2kQZQkwaa	If there is insurance involved, there should be no money paid up front other than your office visit copayment.  The provider should bill the insurance company for the service(s) provided then send out a revised bill showing how much of the bill was paid and what the balance is.<br>  <br>  If you are paying up front, the doctor's office should refund money that was paid over what the co-insurance amount is.  <br>  <br>  I know this it totally confusing,...<br>  <br>  Here is an example...<br>  Your insurance is with XYZ Insurance and you have a PPO plan that has a $250 Deductible and XYZ pays 80% of the bill (leaving you with 20%) if you use an XYZ contracted provider.  There is also a $25 office visit copay that is not subject to the deductible.<br>  <br>  Type of service: Office visit for a sore throat - <br>  Treatment: the provider does a throat culture (or whatever)<br>  <br>  Costs:<br>  Up front: $25 - you do not pay for any lab fees at this time.<br>  The provider submits a bill to XYZ in the amount of $100 for the lab costs.<br>  <br>  Insurance pays: XYZ states that for this service, only $50 of the lab fees are allowed so they pay 80% of $50.  <br>  <br>  You pay: Because you used a contracted provider you pay 20% of the $50 ($10) AND the provider CANNOT bill you the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount.  <br>  <br>  If this is what is happening, you should call the insurance agent or broker who is responsible for the administration or sale of the plan.  They are there for a reason and have the resources available to help you with any claim resolution.<br>  <br>  I know this was long, but I hope I've answered your question.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	If the doctor bills the insurance $114 for service, and the insurance company allows $68.01 as payment to a participating physician: <br>  <br>  -the doctor would "write off" $45.99<br>  <br>  -your co-insurance would be deducted from the ALLOWED AMOUNT of $68.01<br>  <br>  -and YES the account should be credited with any payment above the co-insurance / deductible amounts<br>  <br>  If further clarification is needed, please e-mail me.|`|qBCGH52haa	I would argue that the ex should pay the difference as a stupidity tax.  The only thing the doctor's office should be accepting upfront as an in-network provider is the co-pay.  They should then bill for the remainder after the doctor's office submits the bill to insurance.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would talk to the billing person at the doctor's office and try to get it straightened out so that the next time the ex shows up at the doctor's office, all they charge her is for the co-pay and let the insurance company and the doctor's office settle all the other finances.

If they are, they sure are not doing a good job.  Every single time that the nose wakes you up, call the police.  Eventually, the police will do something it by talking to your management company etc.  It is your right to a quiet environment especially at night when you need your rest.  You can also complain to the owners of the property...the management company does not respect your rights as a good tenante.  Make sure you document every time you have complained to the management company and every time you called the police.<br>  Good Luck<br>  I work for a management company that respects their tenants rights to a safe, quiet, place to live.
AA10464818	It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business. <br>  <br>  One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product. Another exception could be the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs <a href="http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/sbir/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/...</a> , which fund the research and development of technological innovation that meets specific government needs.<br>  <br>  Your best bet actually will be from the states if they offer grant programs for women (or any other special interest groups -- minorities, women, disabled, veterans, etc). Or check with non profit organizations, particularly women organizations if they offer grants.

(See <a href="http://www.sba.gov/financing" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/financing</a> for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance.

When I started my business, they denied me. I didn't have BAD credit, I just had NO credit history.  I created a business plan with a lot of help from friends in the financial business and another who was a corporate attorney. I took the plan and began talking to friends who had some money and they invested small amounts. They had friends who they convinced to invest, and so on and so on. If your product/business idea is good, then you can find people who have the money to back you. It's time consuming, yes. It's frustrating, yes. But in the end it's well worth the time and effort. I started my company five years ago with just enough to get my product to market and a small amount of advertising. This year I am totally in the black and operating at a profit. It takes much perseverance on your part and a willingness to literally just be "balls to the walls" when it comes to marketing yourself and your idea. Don't let yourself be discouraged when you hear the word no. Just keep plugging away. Naturally it was probably a bit easier for me as my company was begun when the economy was in better shape. However, even with the economy as it is there are a lot of folks out there who still have money and are willing to invest it in a company.|`|qBCGH52haa	Draw up a business plan/proposal and approach your local banker for a business loan.
