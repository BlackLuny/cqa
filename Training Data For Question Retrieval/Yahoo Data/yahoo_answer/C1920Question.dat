20090202104519AAR4VEB	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Connecting XBox 360 to PC at College?	So I'm trying to connect my XBox 360 to my laptop and it seems that I need to set up some type of network, but I don't know how or even if I can at school.       Currently the way I have everything set up is there is an Ethernet jack in my room that I have going into a hub. From the hub I have connections going to my wireless router, my laptop, and the Xbox.       With this equipment am I able to set up a network on the college's network or am I going to run into issues. If so, how would I go about it (I'm assuming I'd use the wireless router as a router, because it does have other ethernet ports...technically it could also serve the purpose of my hub but I think I ran into issues with this, but I may be imaging things)

Everytime I turn it on, it shows 4 red lights blinking, except the only thing is the top right arc is dimmer than the rest, but still noticeable.      Now I know 4 blinking lights means their is something wrong with the AV cables. So, I got a new AV cable, put it in... and it STILL DOSEN'T work.      I also know that 3 blinking lights means the Ring of  Death. I know I cant fix that....      So, one day later of not touching my xbox, I was curious to see if my xbox was still broken. Strange thing is.... I turned the xbox 360 on and it worked... I played for about an hour and then the next day I wanted to play again, except it gave me the 4 red rings! again...       Does it just randomly work when it feels like it or what...      So I am curious, what is the problem!?

I also know I could have saved myself $300 by going with the powershot but I want to do photography professionally eventually and feel like if I were to show up with the powershot I wouldn't look as professional. I know what matters is if you got it or not not really what camera you have although some do take clearer pictures. I have no clue what to do. I'm not too happy with the zoom on the Rebel and I hear it's better on the powershot.

I know this is alot but I want the best bang for my buck.

It's so basic and texting is really slow lately. Sometimes my messages won't even send. Battery life seems to be getting way shorter as well. Anyway my problem is that my family wants to switch to Rogers and get new cell phones. But we can't afford to until our other contract ends. What can I do? I feel like I have no options but to wait until august! :( and I honestly think my phone won't last that long. I might destroy it in frustration before then. :P      Now another question.      What phone would be best for me? I'm looking for something that has all of these features:      *Something stylish and eye-catching   *Camera   *Speakerphone   *Internet access   *MP3   and others I kind of forgot about! ^^;      Also if somebody can give me a link to some upcoming phones, or a list or something, that'd be great!
