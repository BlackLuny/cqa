It updates itself daily, sometimes several times a day so you do not have to wait to be current. Most of its serious security functions are password protected so that they should not be able to be changed easily. It does not slow your system down too badly while it is scanning so you are generally able to continue what you are doing. PC-cillin also scans for spyware, malware and phishing. It will not transmit your credit card information without your approval. It has an excellent firewall. Some of the computer sites, like CNET are now recommending Symantec 360 because it has been greatly updated and is more efficient. Noticing Classic's answer above, I have to say that AVG 7.5 Free is an excellent choice in a free program.

AA11214984	HTTP cookies, sometimes known as web cookies or just cookies, are parcels of text sent by a server to a web browser and then sent back unchanged by the browser each time it accesses that server. HTTP cookies are used for authenticating, tracking, and maintaining specific information about users, such as site preferences and the contents of their electronic shopping carts. The term "cookie" is derived from "magic cookie," a well-known concept in Unix computing which inspired both the idea and the name of HTTP cookies.<br>  <br>  Cookies have been of concern for Internet privacy, since they can be used for tracking browsing behavior. As a result, they have been subject to legislation in various countries such as the United States and in the European Union. Cookies have also been criticized because the identification of users they provide is not always accurate and because they could potentially be used for network attacks. Some alternatives to cookies exist, but each has its own drawbacks.<br>  <br>  Cookies are also subject to a number of misconceptions, mostly based on the erroneous notion that they are computer programs. In fact, cookies are simple pieces of data unable to perform any operation by themselves. In particular, they are neither spyware nor viruses, despite the detection of cookies from certain sites by many anti-spyware products.<br>  <br>  Most modern browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies, but rejection makes some websites unusable. For example, shopping baskets implemented using cookies do not work if cookies are rejected.<br>  <br>  HTTP cookies are used by Web servers to differentiate users and to maintain data related to the user during navigation, possibly across multiple visits. HTTP cookies were introduced to provide a way for realizing a "shopping cart" (or "shopping basket"), a virtual device into which the user can "place" items to purchase, so that users can navigate a site where items are shown, adding or removing items from the shopping basket at any time.<br>  <br>  Allowing users to log in to a website is another use of cookies. Users typically log in by inserting their credentials into a login page; cookies allow the server to know that the user is already authenticated, and therefore is allowed to access services or perform operations that are restricted to logged-in users.<br>  <br>  Several websites also use cookies for personalization based on users' preferences. Sites that require authentication often use this feature, although it is also present on sites not requiring authentication. Personalization includes presentation and functionality. The Google search engine allows users (even non-registered ones) to decide how many search results per page they want to see.<br>  <br>  Cookies are also used to track users across a website. Third-party cookies and Web bugs, explained below, also allow for tracking across multiple sites. Tracking within a site is typically done with the aim of producing usage statistics, while tracking across sites is typically used by advertising companies to produce anonymous user profiles, which are then used to target advertising (deciding which advertising image to show) based on the user profile.<br>  <br>  Technically, cookies are arbitrary pieces of data chosen by the Web server and sent to the browser. The browser returns them unchanged to the server, introducing a state (memory of previous events) into otherwise stateless HTTP transactions. Without cookies, each retrieval of a Web page or component of a Web page is an isolated event, mostly unrelated to all other views of the pages of the same site. By returning a cookie to a web server, the browser provides the server a means of connecting the current page view with prior page views. Other than being set by a web server, cookies can also be set by a script in a language such as JavaScript, if supported and enabled by the Web browser.<br>  <br>  Cookie specifications suggest that browsers should support a minimal number of cookies or amount of memory for storing them. In particular, an internet browser is expected to be able to store at least 300 cookies of 4 kilobytes each, and at least 20 cookies per server or domain.|`|Cytf5LWdaa	If you play the FPS game Joint Operations, a "Cookie" is a rather dangerous person, that spends all day sharpening her knife and praticing her satchel throwing. if you ever come across one, lead her a bit more than others, and pray she doesn't get near you.|`|J77vMtzsaa	Biscuits|`|tGX4hLsraa	yes ...i have seen this particular being called ''cookie''...<br>  <br>  a dangerous thing and to be avoided at all cost's...<br>  <br>  if seen ...run away.........|`|01a01119be7f5a77d3a3b71aff6578edaa	cookies are delicious dumbo|`|WG5ittAZaa	Well..... i must say,,, i have to agree with larmarine.<br>  <br>  Cookie is dangerous and sneaky... muhahahahaa...<br>  <br>  but no really...   Cookies are short pieces of data used by web servers to help <br>             identify web users. The popular concepts and rumors about what a <br>             cookie can do has reached almost mystical proportions, <br>             frightening users and worrying their managers.                                                                  <br>    Any platform that can use a modern web browser.                                                                    <br>     No damage to files or systems. Cookies are only used to identify <br>             a web user though they may be used to track a user's browsing <br>             habits.                                                                      <br>  SOLUTION:  No files are destroyed or compromised by cookies, but if <br>             you are concerned about being identified or about having your web<br>             browsing traced through the use of a cookie, set your browser to <br>             not accept cookies or use one of the new cookie blocking <br>             packages. Note that blocking all cookies prevents some online<br>             services from working. Also, preventing your browser from <br>             accepting cookies does not make you an anonymous user, it just <br>             makes it more difficult to track your usage.         <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|bjQBwI08aa	a bakery item, my favorite are peanutbutter, yum....|`|effa79c5567a10463ae7886adc920f55aa	Cookies are actually harmless text files that certain web sites will place onto the hard drive of your computer. Your Internet Browser will then load the information into memory while you are visiting their site. The Cookie itself, actually takes up very little space and acts as an identification card for the visiting site. You can compare this to visiting your favorite restaurant where your food server will usually remember certain aspects of how you like your food prepared and what you usually order. This information would obviously be based upon his familiarity of your prior visits. Well Cookies actually act in a similar manner and do not contain viruses as a virus must be executable file. Let us look at some of the ways that Cookies act as an identification card.<br>  <br>  Why Sites Use Cookies?<br>  <br>  There are numerous reasons why websites would want to use cookies. These range from statistical purposes, such as how many visitors came to the site. This can be further broken down into are they new visitors or actually repeating visitors and how often do they visit. The Website would actually create a unique id for each visitor and store this information into a database.<br>  <br>  Cookies can be used to store your personal preferences, referred to as customizations, that you set while navigating their site. For instance, if you visit Yahoo.com, you can sign in to create your very own personal yahoo page where you can customize it according to your news and weather preferences after providing your zip code. You can even change the color of the page layout as well.<br>  <br>  Online Shopping sites can use cookies to keep track of items that you add to their shopping carts and quick checkout options. The cookie will keep track of every item that you add to the shopping cart while you continue to browse through different pages or even entirely different sections of their site. Every item you add is stored within the Web site’s database along with a unique ID value that has been assigned to you. Therefore, when you select the check out option, the site automatically knows what items are in your cart by retrieving those selections from its database. This is why sites such as Amazon or eBay will prompt you to enable cookies in case you have disabled them.<br>  <br>  Cookies also provide web designers and programmers with a quick and convenient method of keeping their site content fresh and up to date according to the interests of their users. Modern web servers use Cookies for back-end interaction as well, allowing them to securely store any personal data that the user has entered within a site. Therefore, on return visits the user now only has to enter partial information to access their account and purchases can be made quicker as their payment information is on file regarding their previous purchases.<br>  <br>  In closing, as Cookies are actually small text files, they really can not damage your computer system or any files on your hard drive. Once again, they cannot transmit viruses as viruses are executable in nature. Some users may just not want to be tracked and this is one of the primary reasons why many people just disable accepting cookies.|`|5vj80F4Paa	Little treats for kids, they usually have them for a snack.

gPzLD9gmaa	The Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta will go live on May 16th at 12:00 AM PDT and run through June 6 th at 11:59 PM PDT. That means that folks who purchased specially marked copies of Crackdown, or won a spot in the Beta through the “Rule of Three” or other regional promotions, will be able to log into their Xbox Live Gold accounts, download and play the Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta and enjoy an early peek at the multiplayer aspect of the game. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you’ve been sitting on the fence, and are interested, you can still enter the Beta by picking up a specially marked copy of Crackdown, which would ordinarily be a chore, but thankfully Crackdown is an awesome action game which might ironically distract you from the Beta I’m pimping here. Bungie is also giving out a few Friends and Family spots to valued community members, but those are few and far between, so it’s safer to assume you’re not getting in that way.

FepSo61Caa	Insertion Anomaly - The foriegn key value does not have a matching primary key value in the realted table<br>  <br>  Data Anomaly - Simply means the data in the original structure does not match the current structure. Acommon example is using one field, such as name suffix, for a different type of data, for example a prison number. We see this type of data anomaly when users need to accomplish a task (addresses printed out with a prison numbers attached) and the resulting business rule was not defined or implemented in the system.

dmi3NEFuaa	With the default configuration of IE/Windows OS, any new IE window that opens up, does not open in maximized size. Even if you maximize those new windows manually, they still go back to their own size the next time you open them. To fix this, following is the solution :<br>  <br>  1- Close all instances of Internet Explorer except one. Open a new window, and close the original. Type (case sensitive) the following into the address bar (where XXX,XXX is your screen resolution), and press ENTER -> javascript:moveTo(0,0);resizeTo(xxx,xxx) <br>  <br>  2- When the new window re-sizes, hold the CTRL key and close the window. New windows should now open at full size, with everything visible. <br>  <br>  this works<br>   i tried :-)|`|bcffc9caef5278d0c48b5c1bc7cb4a15aa	i have the same problem

Unfortunately, there is no way to circumvent the typical three week claim review period unless the seller responds to PayPal and admits that the transaction was fraudulent and you are owed a refund.  Given what you have stated, I doubt that will be the case.  My experience was great with the PayPal claim and after the claim was reviewed, I was refunded the entire transaction.

0PkI4pTmaa	...Do you want just the CPU or a whole computer? <br>  <br>  There's no reason to spend $1200 on a CPU alone. A 6000+ for $170 is a great value, or an E6700 for $320 is one of the best performers out there at a reasonable price. The best you could get would be an X6800, but at a $1,000, it's not really worth it. There are quad-core processors but they're clocked lower, and since no game uses quad-core, there is no reason to get one.<br>  <br>  If you meant the whole computer, this one is pretty good: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883107230" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> but if you get this one: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883107398" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> for $1100 this one is MUCH better. While I said a Quad core processor isn't really worth it, this one is still a great value since it's clocked higher than the other, and it has more RAM. Now $100 won't get you a great graphics card, but if you can afford an extra $100 or $150, you'll be able to get a great graphics card (for $260 total an 8800GTS 320MB will be great - and would make the total cost $1360).

Most music file formats such as mp3 and wav are already compressed.

In order to turn a 3mb song into a 999kb song you would have to lower the bitrate a lot. Also, you may have to cut the song time down. Meaning  you'd have a very quiet, hardly discernable song that only played halfway through. <br>  <br>  but if you want to attempt it:<br>  <br>  1.

AA12025549	I have an older computer just like that one. It won't turn off. What you should do is get a surge protector so you won't have to unplug it all the time. All you will have to do is turn off the switch on the surge protector. <br>  You should clean it out by defragmenting it, disk clean up, and system file checker. <br>  View the add/remove programs. Any programs you don't need or want UNinstall them. <br>  do a Run and type in "msconfig". Any programs that start up at start up that you don't use everyday, disable them. You can always open them from its desktop shortcut.<br>  My W98 emachine, I still use it. At times I get online from it too. Though I can't upgrade IE to 7 version or download newer programs,but I keep it to play the card games it came installed with (freecell) and other games I download to it from a CD that I don't need to be online. <br>  I like my new Vista computer. It still gives me hard times but so did the W98 when it was newer. <br>  You should start saving for a Vista computer. WXP will become unsupported too, in about 5-8 years. |`|iYPSVgK8aa	It is hard to say what is going on with your computer when you say "it runs harder then it should".  If it is running windows 98 there is a good chance that it is an old computer and may have problems running newer programs.  <br>  It does sound like there are some physical problems with the computer if you have to unplug the computer to shut it off.  There may also be some software issues if it is freezing up.  <br>  It might be time to look at replacing the desktop with something a littler newer.  Trying to repair the desktop might be as expensive as buying something new.  <br>  You could check out the Dell refurbished website.  www.dell.com/outlet.  If you shop around on the site you can find pretty good deals.  |`|NGZAIbKIaa	Take the heat sink off of the processor, clean it, put a thin layer of toothpaste on top of the processor to freshen what's left of the thermal paste.<br>  Take the RAM cards and all cards out of the expansion slots and clean the contacts with a stiff eraser and put them back.<br>  Clean all of the fans, ports and dust out.<br>  It should run a bit better now and you can install Xp if you like, but the unplugging it while it is running will damage the O.S. files, they need to save and shut down slowly.|`|RM4u3M4oaa	As long as this computer does what you need it to do, you can keep using it.  I would expect it to crash pretty soon.  When it does, it isn't really worth saving.  I don't think Windows is supporting Windows 98 anymore.  It'll be nearly impossible to upgrade being as old as it is.|`|rEoGgrelaa	how does a stationary object run hard?  |`|F8j0tFdRaa	if it's running windows 98 and you just bought this... you were ripped off<br>  <br>  It is time for a new computer bud.

CsIvy5MAaa	You generally don't get warranties with ebay. It's a "Buyer beware" market.<br>  <br>  Just make sure the person you buy from has a positive feed back (I don't buy from anyone who has less than 95% usually) and a good number of sells. That way, you should be safe, as them selling you a bad laptop/scamming you will probably end up hurting them more, since they're making good money with ebay.|`|Oa6cXdsBaa	no its best if you went to frys, bestbuy, etc<br>  why buying off ebay? because its unsafe, the person selling may have put in viruses, and much more  plus there are no warranties if your laptop crashes in like a day BUT at the stores u can get  year warranties if you buy thier laptop<br>  <br>  what laptop are you trying to buy?<br>  they might have it at frys, bestbuy,<br>  and some more
oOly8Wj2aa	Using a custom 404 to load all of your pages is not the correct way to do this. You should instead be using a RewriteRule to redirect all incoming requests to your PHP scripts, and then handle them from there.<br>  <br>  What you're seeing is pretty much exactly the behaviour I would expect!<br>  <br>  However, if you do want to carry on doing things the way you are, the simplest fix would be to force the header response code to be correct at the top of your PHP pages, using code like the following:<br>  <br>  header("HTTP/1.0 200 OK");<br>  <br>  Put that line near the top of all your PHP pages, and the problem will be solved. It's not the best solution, but as you've already started in such an unusual way, if you want to continue, here's the answer.|`|f5d911179b5535ec45cbb6bd90b28248aa	Any time you start having problems like this, it is usually because it is not W3C compliant and/or you are calling browser specific calls which means you have to do some more coding that detects what browser you are using.<br>  <br>  You will have to go through the error logs of your web server to find out what the errors you are getting and start working on it from there.|`|AA10393890	I suspect the problem is here:<br>  <br>  Spry.Widget.CollapsiblePanel.prototype... = function(element)<br>  {<br>   var children = [];<br>   var child = element.firstChild;<br>   while (child)<br>   {<br>    if (child.nodeType == 1 /* Node.ELEMENT_NODE */)<br>     children.push(child);<br>    child = child.nextSibling;<br>   }<br>   return children;<br>  <br>  child may be a reserved term in the ie DOM, I usually use a capital to avoid this situation change child to Child and children to Children.

fIMzG1Ciaa	The term "server" is generically used to describe a class of machines that provide "critical" services, and thus have lots of redundancy and capacity built into them. A "server OS" has a lot of additional features in it that are important to managing an enterprise.<br>  <br>  In reality, ANY computer that offers a service can be considered to be a "server". That service could be a web server, a name server, a printer server, or in your case a file server. It doesn't matter what the service is, as long as its providing one, it can be considered a "server."<br>  <br>  You do not need any special OS to run your home server. All you need is one that provides the service(s) you require. For the home user that wants a basic network and file storage, any modern OS you can get a copy of will do the trick.<br>  <br>  Linux vs Windows is very much a religious debate, but I say, whichever one you can easily and most effectively administer would be your best bet. People might be able to post academic performance tests where they can prove this OS is faster than that OS or more secure....but its all relative to the environment (machines and network involved, types of file transfers being made, number of users, etc) and if you can't administer it, it will do you little good. <br>  <br>  Have your laptop, put your favorite OS on it, configure it for what you need and enjoy!

Also you might have downloaded a virus so a few virus scans should be done.<br>  <br>  Your speaker software (drivers) might have been corrupted so if you don't find a virus, or even if you do you should reinstall the drivers.  That should fix your sound.  To reinstall your drivers you must get the driver disk that was given to you with your computer upon buying it.<br>  <br>  Unless there is a hardware problem, that should fix it.  If that doesn't fix it then you need to send it back while its still under warranty.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped,<br>  -Brandon

dfjIBHe3aa	Look, most sensible people who are just starting on Linux dual boot.  Linux is a whole other operating system.  In fact, it is a UNIX-derived system and you learn about that command line stuff people are always complaining about by typing "UNIX tutorial" into your search engine.  It takes time to adjust to the world of UNIX.<br>  <br>  That means you should keep Windoze if you can for dual boot.;<br>  <br>  I don't use I-tunes.  But I have two thoughts on the matter.  One is the above: you probably need at least a year of dual booting, and two is the other issue:  I've met Ubuntu and Edubuntu developers who talk more about security than anything else and seem to indicate that except in outside projects like edubuntu (which has just been reorganized) their focus seems to be on Security and on updates, on the path of getting packages onto your computers.  They exactly do NOT do all that Bells and whistles OS stuff, except they negotiate with other companies.<br>  <br>  The interface you will get on Ubuntu is provided by the X.Org Foundation, the Gnome Foundation (or KDE or XFCE people -- they aren't exactly a foundation) and the Compiz Fusion people if that's what you want on your desktop.  Things get on Ubuntu's desktop early not because they put them there but because they don't stand in the way of them getting there.  It's not likely that I-tunes will run on other distros before it runs on Ubuntu.  Shuttleworth, the man behind Ubuntu, has no doubt held discussions about getting it and will no doubt be proactive as soon as it looks like they are going to release it for ANY Linux distribution.<br>  <br>  You might consider installing rather than partitioning it.  I heard about something called wubi here, it's at <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wubi-installer.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wubi-installer.org</a><br>  <br>  And it runs Ubuntu on top of Windows.  I recommended it to someone who thanked me but someone else here has complained that since Windows is less stable than Linux (and especially Ubuntu Linux) it will occasionally freeze up and you can't do anything because it's windows causing the trouble.<br>  <br>  Definitely read about repartitioning your hard drive: about shrinking the Vista partition and putting Ubuntu on the excess.  Read about it before doing it.

AA11611248	You can run antivirus and antispyware programs, but the sad fact is if you have found one virus on your computer, you probably have several. Cleaning the computer now requires you to follow these steps, because modern viruses and spyware entrench themselves in files that your computer needs in order to run:<br>  <br>  1. Virus-check your data files (not application files-- you have installer CDs for those).<br>  2. Back up the data files, getting them off your hard drive.<br>  3. Get your original operating system CDs that came with your computer.<br>  4. Boot your computer from the operating system CD.<br>  5. Select the option that erases your hard drive and then reinstall your system software.<br>  6. Turn on your software firewall that came with your operating system.<br>  7. Reconnect to the internet, and download *all* Windows updates, no matter how long it takes.<br>  8. Reinstall your application software, and update the applications as much as you can.<br>  9. Reinstall your data files.<br>  10. Create a limited user account on your system that does *not* have administrator access, and web surf only from this account.<br>  <br>  Yes, this is a pain in the butt. No, there is no other way. No, antivirus and antispyware programs cannot fix this problem on its own.<br>  <br>  So, what do you do in the future?<br>  <br>  1. Never click on links you find in an e-mail.<br>  2. Never open an e-mail attachment, ever.<br>  3. Only download files from a reputable website that you know is on the up-and-up.<br>  4. Never use bit-torrent and other file-sharing programs.<br>  5. Never use an unsolicited drive-checking site.<br>  6. Turn off all java and java scripting by default, and only enable java and java scripting for sites that you know you can trust.<br>  7. Never read an unsolicited e-mail, and delete spam immediately. It is possible to be hacked by reading an e-mail alone.<br>  <br>  Please adhere to the 'dont's' I provided above, because you will have to repeat the cleaning steps that I listed first *every time you get infected.* Anti-spyware and anti-virus programs are good to have, but they are a second line of defense. The best way to protect your system is you, and changing your behavior.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|11xWCVneaa	well, it could be a virus or the computer is getting heated up early. in such a case you would rather get another fan fixed into your cabinet..|`|JRb6aQSMaa	If you are having a virus or Malware problem, you should receive professional Malware removal support from a site like <a href="http://geekpolice.net/" rel="nofollow">http://geekpolice.net/</a><br>  <br>  I recommended it because they provide real fast support and a cure is guaranteed.

Scientific and professional are terms that do not describe the benchmark that TweakHound performed. And there are a few clues pointing in that direction. First off, the introduction of the test reads: "unless you've had your head in the sand you've heard (or seen) that Vista is slower than XP. I thought I would run a few benchmarks too see just how much slower it is." Now, my view on this is that if you start with the idea that you want to demonstrate that Windows Vista is slower than Windows XP you're going to find a way to prove just that. <br>  <br>  Second. If you are going to perform a Windows Vista benchmark, you might as well use a methodology that is equilibrated and that does not handicap one operating system over the other. Now Microsoft has promised to publish a methodology for Windows Vista benchmarking since late January 2007, but has failed to do so as yet. However, comparing a Windows Vista in a default configuration with a tweaked Windows Vista and a tweaked Windows XP, like TweakHound did and then claim that Vista is slower than XP simply won't do. |`|LfZCBaWCaa	Vista is really a good operating system.<br>  People gave it a low rating because of higher system requirements, low compatibility to some programs, and also some old devices will not be supported in Vista.<br>  That's why most people prefer XP rather than Vista.|`|FyVgb4iLaa	vista is king, don't worry.It works fine than xp.

I've never heard of Icore but it looks good. Many users will tell you to get about 6 security programs. If you use a virtual machine, you can have one, and you'll be better protected than almost all users. You will have to spend a little time learning how to use a virtual machine.

JGBhN6FUaa	The "javascript:void(0);" is just telling the <a> tag that you are referencing JavaScript code. I usually write <a href="javascript://" ... ><br>  <br>  Also, if you look at the window.open method's parameters, you will notice that the second parameter is simply a name to give the window that is about to be opened. In the case above, the code you found will call the window by some random number. <br>  <br>  If I'm not mistaken, Math.random() will produce a random floating point number between 0 and 1. Then this is being multiplied by 100,000 so that the number is now a floating point number between 0 and 100,000. Finally, the Math.floor() function will round the floating point number down to the nearest integer. (ie. 1.2-> 1;   5.9-> 5)<br>  <br>  You don't need to mention any of that by the way. All you really need is <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="window.open('securechat.html');... Speak with a technician </a><br>  <br>  The other parameters are not mandatory, they simply allow you to change how the window will look like. Providing a name is only useful if you plan on referencing the popup window again from the parent window.

jeMNcPPYaa	I mostly use Firefox, but for one of my favourite web sites I have to use Opera, because Firefox refuses to believe the chat window is not something it ought to block.<br>  <br>  I know others will say 'switch off popup blocker', that makes no difference, it is a part of FF that can not be switched off.<br>  <br>  Here is my take on modern Browsers.<br>  <br>  Firefox - great for general browsing, the Download Helper is a great addon.<br>  <br>  Opera - Was once my main browser, it coped well with everything, the session system is great to use, doing a bit of programming? switch to your 'Developer' home pages, a bit of history 'switch to your 'History of Yorkshire' home pages. But Opera did an upgrade and things started to go wrong, suddenly some sites would not open properly, there would be crashes that close the whole browser (instead of just the page with the offensive code). It became a pain in the backside.<br>  <br>  <br>  IE - I don't know what MS have done to IE in order to fix the mirriad of bugs and hacking holes, but the result is the slowest browser.<br>  <br>  Google browser - This has a reputation for high speed. It has less menu and buttons, but you find it doesn't need them. What ever you type into the browse box it understands what you want. It decides if you are searching and works out as you type a probability list. I think it is a very good browser, I tried the beta and it had some bugs, but once the dust has settled will reinstall it.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Opera - can download torrents<br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  Maxthon2 - gets rid of ads on webpages<br>  Flock - Great with Facebook, My Space,etc.|`|Nui0BRAEaa	I have Internet explorer but heard allot of good for firefox|`|RQwFq0Fwaa	FIREFOX is for mac computers<br>  ie8 - vista<br>  ie7 - xp|`|Syvig9Q9aa	Safari is a VERY nice browser:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/safari/download/</a><br>  <br>  Firefox is also received very well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/</a>|`|JFOj2Gf2aa	i would go for safari beta 4 version is out now which makes things even faster and smoother than before, and that was good , keep away from ie, if you don't go for safari def. go for firefox|`|SVan9rTdaa	i suggest:<br>  Opera<br>  Firefox<br>  Chrome<br>  Safari<br>  <br>  but never ever get internet explorer! it doesnt conform to web standards|`|bbc94e509cc1cde8fbb2273c1fbd2897aa	Firefox is the best.

T5MR7fNHaa	The 'Local Loop' is the copper telephone line between the telephone exchange and your home.<br>  <br>  The Internet is (or was) defined as 'The sum of all computers that communicate using IP [the Internet Protocol]'.<br>  Your PC is a part of the internet any time it's online!<br>  <br>  PoP dates back to dial-up modems, it does not relate to Cable or ADSL broadband. It was where the ISP located it's own modem banks for it's end of the dial-up circuit.<br>  <br>  ADSL and Cable broadband are rather different.<br>  <br>  With ADSL, radio frequency signals are sent down the phone line and separated from the voice signal at each end by filters. This allows you to use the phone at the same time as the internet, but because the phone lines were not originally intended for this use and lose a fair bit of the radio signal, the speed you get very much depends how close to the exchange you are and how good the phone cables are between you and the exchange.<br>  <br>  In a cable modem, depending on the exact technology used, the ethernet data (which in turn carries the IP packets) is translated to radio frequencies which are sent & received down the coaxial cable.<br>  <br>  This is converted back to (e.g.) either wired or optical ethernet in the cable companies local equipment, which could be a mile away or on / under your street corner.<br>  <br>  As the cable companies gear is designed to work with high frequency signals (VHF or UHF), cable internet can, at least in theory, give far higher and more consistent speeds.|`|260feace6d64b2faf51e9ce75a95f6bcaa	Yes you are absolutely right.

AA10371281	You can do this in many ways!<br>  <br>  <br>  1st- you can make a collage of pictures under paint.  This makes a really cute layout.<br>  <br>  <br>  2nd- you can upload the single picture you want as a layout to www.photobucket.com.  Once you have uploaded the picture, under it should be three things with codes.  Copy the "url" code.  Then go to www.mygen.co.uk.  This is a profile generator that allows you to make your own layouts.  When you click on the tab where you make your background you simply put the code you copied earlier into where it says "image url".<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|AA10088529	upload them to another site and use html to make them a background|`|AA10788102	a scanner might help after that I have no clue

Dieser Beitrag ist im wesentlichen eine Zusammenfassung der Biographie von Bill Gates: "Der Weg nach vorn", zu bestellen unter: <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3455110444/qid=1108949720/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/028-2817401-2834967" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/34...</a>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Einleitung<br>  <br>  <br>  Heute ist Bill Gates der reichste Mann der Welt, lange Zeit war es der Sultan von Brunei, einem winzigen Land auf der Insel Borneo im Südchinesischen Meer. (Bild) <br>  <br>  Dieser Sultan besitzt rund 42 Milliarden Dollar, w?hrend es Bill Gates heute auf 57 Milliarden Dollar bringt. Dieses Geld ist allerdings auf Aktien bezogen, nicht auf Bargeld. Soviel Geld kann man sich kaum vorstellen, man k?nnte dafür 700‘000 neue Ferrari oder Rolls Royce kaufen, soviel Ferrari oder Rolls Royce gibt es gar nicht, oder in der Schweiz 80'000 Einfamilienh?user bauen, oder das sch?nste Beispiel, Bill k?nnte, wenn er 80 Jahre alt werden sollte und nichts mehr dazuverdienen würde, jeden einzelnen Tag mehr als 6 Millionen Schweizer Franken ausgeben bis zu seinem Tod. übrigens zu den Autos: Bill sammelt tats?chlich Luxusautos, er hat sich z.B. einen Porsche nach Mass anfertigen lassen für anderthalb Millionen Schweizer Franken.<br>  <br>  Obwohl Bill so reich ist, weiss man über ihn selber nur wenig, weil er ganz zurückgezogen lebt und sich kaum je fotografieren l?sst. Sobald aber die Presse irgend etwas über ihn erf?hrt, geht die Nachricht um die ganze Welt und wird kommentiert. <br>  <br>  Als Bill im April ein Bild kaufte für 39 Millionen Dollar, machte man in Amerika den Witz: Um sich dieses Bild zu kaufen, musste Bill einen ganzen Tag sparen! Oder als ihm vor drei Monaten jemand an einem Empfang eine Rahmtorte ins Gesicht warf, wurde dieses Bild nicht nur in allen Zeitungen gezeigt, (Bild) man kann die Fotografie, wie Bill sich den Schlagrahm aus dem Gesicht wischt und die Brille putzen muss, sogar bis heute im Internet abrufen. Und sein spektakul?res Haus ist Dauerthema in den Illustrierten, aber davon sp?ter. Auch der Rechtsstreit um den Internet Explorer sorgte für Schlagzeilen. (Bild)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jetzt also zuerst Bills Jugend<br>  <br>  <br>  Er wurde am 28. Oktober 1955 geboren in Seattle, im Bundesstaat Washington in den USA (Bild).<br>  <br>  Sein Vater war Rechtsanwalt, und seine Mutter Lehrerin. Bill war der einzige Sohn, aber er hatte noch zwei Schwestern. Als Kind fiel Bill nicht weiter auf, er besuchte die Lakeside Schule und spielte mit anderen Kindern. Er hatte aber, im Gegensatz zu Einstein, keine Schulprobleme und erzielte sehr gute Noten.<br>  <br>  Als er 13 Jahre alt war hatte er die erste pr?gende Erfahrung mit Rechnermaschinen. Die Mütter jener Lakeside Schule, die er besuchte, veranstalteten einen Wohlt?tigkeitsbazar, wie es in Amerika sehr üblich ist. <br>  <br>  Mit dem Gewinn aus diesem Bazar wollten sie ihren Kindern etwas zuliebe tun, und die Mütter entschlossen sich, das Geld auszugeben für Benutzungszeit am Schulcomputer. Computerzeit war damals teuer, man konnte eine Stunde am Grossrechner ?kaufen“ oder besser ?mieten“ für 40 Dollar in der Stunde, also etwas 60 Schweizerfranken für eine Stunde am Computer. Das war im Jahr 1968, und die Computer damals hatten noch gar keinen Bildschirm, eigentlich waren es einfach Rechner, verbunden mit einer Schreibmaschinentastatur, und einem ratternden Drucker, und darauf spielte Bill mit seinen Kollegen tic tac toe, bei uns w?re das Schiffliversenkis. Dieses Spiel dauert, wie wir alle wissen, mit Papier und Bleistift nur etwa eine Minute, mit dem Rechner damals dauerte es aber eine ganze Stunde, weil der Rechner natürlich noch nicht viel leistete. Bill schrieb das Programm für tic tac toe selber.<br>  <br>  Bill war aber trotzdem total fasziniert. Computer waren damals riesengrosse Maschinen, die ganze Zimmer füllten, (Folie) und Bill sagt heute, was ihm gefallen habe, das sei, dass er eben dieser riesengrossen Maschine Befehle erteilen konnte, die einfach immer ausgeführt wurden, und zwar genau nach seinen Anleitungen. Dieses "Anleitungen geben" – heute sagt man Programmieren – gefiel Bill so sehr, dass er seine ganze Freizeit nur noch mit dem Rechner verbrachte, und er hatte Freunde, die genauso fasziniert waren wie er, n?mlich Paul Allen und Steve Ballmer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Zu Bills gesch?ftlichem Werdegang<br>  <br>  <br>  Sein bester Freund Paul Allen (Bild) war noch geschickter als Bill, er verbesserte n?mlich schon damals, 1968, die Computersprache BASIC. (Folie) BASIC heisst ja übersetzt ?grundlegend“, aber eigentlich stehen die Buchstaben für ?Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code“, das heisst auf deutsch: ?Computer-Anleitungssprache für Anf?nger und für alle Anwendungen“ und die beiden dachten überhaupt nicht daran, diese Sprache irgendwie für eine Firma einzusetzen, sondern sie erfanden st?ndig neue Spiele, mit Autos z.B., und mit dieser BASIC Sprache gaben sie Befehle ein, um zu sehen, welche Spielstrategie am ehesten gewinnt gegeneinander. <br>  <br>  Es ist ja klar, dass den Lehrern an der Lakeside Schule auffiel, wie geschickt und begabt Bill und Paul mit dem Rechner umgingen. Die Lehrer konnten ihnen dabei nicht helfen, denn sie verstanden selbstverst?ndlich viel weniger davon. Ein Lehrer bat jetzt die beiden, ihm zu helfen bei der Errichtung eines Stundenplan-Programmes für die Schule. Bill und Paul erledigten diesen Auftrag gl?nzend, Bill brachte es zudem mit ein paar Tricks am Computer noch fertig, und er erz?hlt dieses Erlebnis selber in seiner Autobiographie, dass er in eine Klasse kam mit fast nur M?dchen und ganz wenigen Knaben. Natürlich sprach es sich herum, dass Bill und Paul ?computerkids“ seien. <br>  <br>  Bills Eltern machten sich allerdings grosse Sorgen um die Computersucht ihres Sohnes, damals waren ja Computer noch eine absolute Seltenheit, und die Generation von Bills Eltern konnte mit den sogenannten bin?ren Zahlen nichts anfangen. Als Bill dann sogar Programme von Firmen unerlaubterweise knackte, bekam er von seinen Eltern ganze 9 Monate Verbot, sich am Rechner der Lakeside Schule zu bet?tigen. <br>  <br>  Die Eltern probierten noch auf eine andere Art, Bill vom Computer wegzubringen: sobald Bill 16 Jahre alt war, durfte er autofahren lernen und bekam sofort seinen eigenen Ford Mustang Cabrio, die Absicht der Eltern war, dass er dann weniger Interesse am Computer h?tte. Tats?chlich freute sich Bill sehr am Autofahren, es blieb bis jetzt ein Hobby von ihm, aber vom Computer weg brachte es ihn trotzdem nicht. <br>  <br>  Im Sommer 1972 – Bill war also erst 16 – gründete er mit Paul Allen zusammen zwei Firmen. Sie verdienten mit dem Erstellen von Programmen, z.B. Gehaltslisten für Firma – pro Jahr bereits ein paar Tausend Dollar. Dafür h?tten sie aber keine Firma gründen müssen, sondern der Ausl?ser war, dass sie in einer Fachzeitschrift lasen, die Firma INTEL habe einen Mikroprozessorchip auf den Markt gebracht. (Bild) <br>  <br>  Wieder war es Paul, der erkannte, wie bahnbrechend diese Erfindung sein würde. Zusammen versuchten sie, um diesen Chip herum eine Maschine zu bauen, und es gelang ihnen auch, nur wollte niemand diese Maschine oder eben diesen Computer kaufen, denn die beiden waren immer noch Teenager, und die bestandenen Gesch?ftsleute trauten ihnen nicht so recht. <br>  <br>  Nach der High School – da war er 17j?hrig - konnte sich Bill mit seinen gl?nzenden Noten und eben auch mit seinen wohlhabenden Eltern an der Nobeluniversit?t Harvard einschreiben. Am Anfang seines Studiums erz?hlte Bill allen Leuten, mit 25 Jahre alt wolle er seine erste Million Dollar in der Tasche haben, und wie wir heute wissen, gelang ihm das ja auch. <br>  <br>  An der weltberühmten Harvard-Universit?t war er aber nicht besonders glücklich, man konnte damals nicht Informatik studieren, weil es dieses Fach noch gar nicht gab. So studierte Bill halt Mathematik und etwas Jus, also Rechtswissenschaft, aber ohne Begeisterung. Was ihm hingegen gefiel, war, dass er an der Universit?t viele intelligente junge Leute zum Diskutieren traf. Als Zimmergenossen hatte er sich einen Ausl?nder und einen Angeh?rigen einer Minderheit gewünscht, und bekam dann einen Kanadier und einen Farbigen aus Tennessee zugeteilt. <br>  <br>  Nach zwei Jahren Universit?t rief ihn eines Tages Paul Allen an, um ihm zu sagen, dass INTEL jetzt einen zehnmal leistungsst?rkeren Chip auf den Markt gebracht habe, und das sei doch sicher der Zeitpunkt, um die Universit?t zu lassen und wieder eine Firma zu gründen. Nach gründlichen Diskussionen mit seinen Eltern brach Bill sein Studium ohne jedes Bedauern ab und gründete die Firma, sie hiess damals ?Traf-o-data“. Bill und Paul arbeiteten praktisch Tag und Nacht, um mit dem INTEL-Chip und BASIC ihren ersten Computer zu bauen, sie nannten<br>  den Computer Altair, der Name Altair ist ein Flugziel in einer Startrek-Episode. Dieser erste Altair Computer hatte nur einen Speicher von 4000 Zeichen, heute fassen die meisten PCs 8 Millionen oder mehr Zeichen. <br>  <br>  Der Erfolg kam langsam, und im Januar 1977 zogen Bill und Paul nach Albuquerque in New Mexico, (Folie) es war der Beginn von Microsoft. Nach zwei weiteren Jahren zogen sie nach Seattle zurück, ihren Heimatort, wo sie mit der Firma Microsoft begannen. Microsoft befindet sich heute noch dort. Aus dem 2-Mann-<br>  Unternehmen von Bill Gates und Paul Allen entwickelte sich in 20 Jahren eine Firma mit 17'000 Angestellten und einem Jahresumsatz von 8 Milliarden Dollar.<br>  <br>  Von damals an verlief Bills Lebensgeschichte als einzigartige Erfolgsstory, er h?ufte Million um Million an. über den Aufbau von Microsoft gibt es mehr Bücher als über Bill selber. Er arbeitete sehr viel, n?chtelang, und viele Mitarbeiter best?tigen, dass Bill oft nachts im Büro schl?ft, und zwar direkt auf dem Boden, nicht einmal auf einem Sofa. Als hart arbeitenden Manager und immer noch Programmierer hatte er keine Zeit für Skandale, und so warf ihm die Presse halt dann vor, er sei langweilig, weil er keine Klatschgeschichten hergab, und er sei auch h?sslich mit seiner unmodernen Brille und seinem langweiligen Haarschnitt. <br>  <br>  Wir haben ihn vor ein paar Monaten in einer amerikanischen Talk-Show gesehen, er kam als Gast, und ich fand ihn sehr sympathisch und normal, kein bisschen überspannt. (Bild) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bill als privater Mensch<br>  <br>  <br>  In den Zeitungen wurde ihm sogar negativ vorgeworfen, dass sein Lieblingsgetr?nk Coca-Cola sei und sein Lieblingsessen Pizza und Hamburger.<br>  <br>  Als er heiratete, im Dezember 1993, hoffte die Presse auf ein paar interessante Klatschgeschichten, aber Bill wollte keine Reporter bei der Hochzeit dabei haben, und seine Frau, Melinda French (Bild), war und ist eine seiner Angestellten, eine Product Managerin, also auch hier nichts Spezielles für die Reporter. <br>  <br>  Die Hochzeit war aber doch sehr besonders, die G?ste wurden auf die Insel Lanai geflogen, das ist eine Insel neben Hawaii,<br>  und die reichsten M?nner Amerikas waren dazu eingeladen, aber keine Hollywoodstars. Selbstverst?ndlich waren auch seine beiden besten Freunde, Paul Allen und Steve Ballmer, bei der Hochzeit dabei. Paul Allen arbeitet auch heute noch mit Bill zusammen, obwohl ihm in der Zwischenzeit eine ganze Anzahl anderer Firmen geh?ren.<br>  <br>  Erst als Bill begann, sein Haus zu bauen, das war 1990, er war bereits 35 Jahre alt, gab es etwas zu schreiben. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bills Haus<br>  <br>  <br>  Sein Haus am Ufer des Lake Washington ist wirklich spektakul?r, aussergew?hnlich. Bill nennt es Cyberhome. (Bild) Natürlich ist es mit dem Computer entworfen worden. <br>  Von aussen wirkt es kaum besonders, Amerikaner bauen sonst ?usserlich viel sch?nere Villen. Bill hat aber seine eigenen Ideen verwirklicht. (Folie) <br>  <br>  Der Bau kostete rund 50 Millionen Dollar, und enth?lt bis jetzt Elektronik für 40 Millionen Dollar, so dass Bill bis jetzt – und das Haus ist noch nicht fertig - 100 Millionen verbaut hat. Das Haus ist z.B. aus 500j?hrigen Douglastannen gebaut, die vor 100 Jahren gef?llt wurden. Die wenigen Douglastannen, die es heute noch gibt, stehen alle unter Naturschutz.<br>  Hier eine übersicht der kosten:<br>  <br>  Grundstück: 5 Mio<br>  Bau: 25 Mio<br>  Luxus-Extras: 20 Mio<br>  Umbauten: 10 Mio<br>  Elektronik: 40 Mio<br>  Total: 100 Mio (Sfr) <br>  <br>  Das Haus ist so mit dem See verbunden, dass Bill im Haus innen mit dem Motorboot losfahren kann zum Wasserskifahren, ein einzigartiger Gag auf der Welt. In der Empfangshalle k?nnen 100 G?ste zum Essen eingeladen werden, und in dieser Halle hat es auf einer Seite 24 Bildschirme in der Wand eingelassen, die man zusammenschalten kann, um grosse Bilder zu liefern. <br>  <br>  Jeder Besucher im Haus muss einen elektronischen Chip tragen, und mit diesem Chip versucht das Cyberhaus, auf die individuellen Vorlieben des Besuchers einzugehen. Mittels einer Steuerkonsole kann jeder Besucher im Haus seine Vorlieben eingeben. (Bild). <br>  <br>  Falls z.B. seine Frau Melinda in ein Zimmer kommt, erklingt in jenem Zimmer Musik von Jon Bon Jovi, weil sie diesen S?nger mag, oder, wenn Bill ein Zimmer betritt, leuchten an der Wand Bilder von Matisse und Renoir auf. Tausende von Bildern, von Van Gogh bis Picasso und auch die ganz Modernen sind gespeichert.<br>  <br>  Für jeden Besucher wird gespeichert, welche Musik und welche Bilder er oder sie mag, damit dann jeweils die passenden Kl?nge oder Wandbilder erscheinen. <br>  <br>  Ein anderes Beispiel für das computergesteuerte Haus: Wenn der Besucher einen Gang entlanggeht, zünden vor ihm die Lampen an und hinter ihm l?schen sie wieder aus. Auch die Temperatur des Badewassers wird gespeichert, oder wann der Besucher das Licht ausl?schte.<br>  <br>  Insgesamt hat Bills Haus 45 Zimmer,12 B?der, 3 Küchen, 2 Esszimmer, Pool, 20m Wasserfall und eine Garage für 20 Luxus-Autos, das ist, verglichen mit dem Sultan von Brunei, dem zweitreichsten Mann der Welt, nicht viel. Der Sultan hat einen Palast auf Brunei mit 1700 Zimmer und 250 Badezimmern, und in seinem Empfangssaal k?nnen 4‘000 G?ste zum Essen eingeladen werden. Der Sultanspalast kostete 400 Millionen Dollar, also 4 mal mehr als Bill Gates Haus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bill Gates Haus (Satelitenfoto)<br>  übrigens: Bills Haus l?sst sich über Google-Maps als Satelitenbild Betrachten. Dazu gibt man einfach seine Adresse: "16011 NE 36th Way, Redmond, WA 98052" in <a href="http://maps.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/</a> ein.<br>  <br>  Vor zwei Jahren, 1996, wurde Bill Gates Vater, er bekam eine Tochter mit dem Namen Jennifer Katherine. Dass auch ihr Kinderzimmer mit Computersteuerung vollgestopft ist, erstaunt natürlich niemanden.<br>  <br>  Ich m?chte jetzt noch einmal darauf eingehen, was denn an Bill Gates so revolution?r war. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bills Genie<br>  <br>  <br>  Bill erkannte, dass mit dem Mikrochip ganz neue Typen von Computern m?glich sein würden. Er sagte voraus, dass irgendwann einmal in jedem Büro und in jedem Haushalt ein PC stehen würde, und es sieht so aus, als ob dieses Ziel in der westlichen Welt bald einmal erreicht wird. <br>  <br>  Weiters machte er es m?glich, dass man mit seinem Windows-System – das war zwar nicht ganz neu – ?Fenster“ auf dem Bildschirm anklicken und Informationen hervorrufen kann, anstatt mit der Tastatur viel mühsamer zu arbeiten.<br>  <br>  Die Idee von Fenstern hatte Bill von Apple und Amiga geklaut.<br>  Besonders genial an Bill Gates ist jedoch, dass er die Bedeutung des Internet voraussah.<br>  <br>  Er sah voraus, dass die schnelle übermittlung von Daten genutzt werden kann für eine weltweite Kommunikation, er nennt dies ?Information Highway“, und mit dieser ?Datenautobahn“, wie man es auf Deutsch übersetzen kann, sind wir technisch immer noch am Anfang. Dieses Internet-System wird sich noch ganz gewaltig entwickeln.<br>  <br>  In einem Buch habe ich gelesen, dass Bills Erfindungen genauso revolution?r sind, wie es vor 500 Jahren die Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst durch Gutenberg war, als es m?glich wurde, Geschriebenes zu drucken und damit im Volk zu verbreiten.<br>  Mir scheint, dass dies ein sehr guter Vergleich ist, und dass Bill Gates auch noch im n?chsten Jahrtausend als der ganz grosse Erfinder bekannt sein wird.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE 23.11.2005<br>  <br>  Bill Gates Hasu kann unter maps.google.com betrachtet werden.<br>  Die Seite: celebrity-maps führt zum Link, den man anw?hlen kann. ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hinzugefügt am: 01.06.1999<br>  Ge?ndert am: 14.05.2006 <br>  <br>  <br>  Related Links<br>  <br>  Link   Beschreibung <br>  celebrity-maps   Zeigt die Wohnorte berühmte Pers?nlichkeiten an ;-) <br>  Der Weg nach vorn   Link zu amazon; Selbstbiografie von Bill Gates. <br>  maps.google.com   Bill Gates Haus auf Google Maps <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  User Anmerkungen<br>  <br>  15 User Anmerkungen zu dieser Seite|`|18f69a6447b00c055f81ed6d434f23f1aa	Irgendwo in Amerika|`|866c933b00671bb21088fdcd7f4a593faa	Stalkerin?

AA10460260	I was explaining this to my wife just yesterday, and came up with this analogy.<br>  <br>  RAM (Random Access Memory) is built for computer data SPEED.  When you want to access a program, the program gets large chunks of info from your harddrive and places it in the RAM, this is a "slow" process...so what the RAM does then is takes this commonly used information, and like a Sprinter brings it up to you.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you were at the store trying to buy a bunch of stuff (running programs), and you had all your money in your house...your RAM would be like your pockets.  You can quickly get the change and cash, but if you needed a LOT of cash, you would have to go back to the house.  <br>  <br>  House is Harddrive and Pockets are RAM.<br>  <br>  Make sense?|`|hTCGA5tGaa	Its RANDOM ACESS MEMORY when you have alot you can rune alot of things at once.|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	It is the memory that Windows uses to open programs.  It is also required to install and run windows.  It is memory that sits on your motherboard in slots.  You can upgrade and put more memory on your motherboard, which will allow your operating system (Windows) and the programs on your computer to run faster.|`|f31WGr0Faa	stands for 'Random Access Memory'.<br>  every application, program and game needs free space to access very quickly. How much depends on the program.<br>  <br>  Theoretically the computer could also use free Hard Disc space, but it takes too long to access. RAM transmits data at 6,4GB/s i believe.|`|u80jsemaaa	it stands for random access memory it's soul purpose is to open programs and run background programs, it called random access memory because the memory can be accessed in any order|`|wSXI64Q7aa	random access memory|`|18n8LGCQaa	RAM is the 'memory' you hear so often about.<br>  <br>  Data is stored on a hard drive, which is very slow in terms of data transfer.  Your CPU, or processor, on the other hand is very fast at doing things with that data.  The RAM aka system memory is very fast and sits between the hard drive and the CPU as a sort of 'data queue' for the computer.<br>  <br>  Increasing RAM improves the ability of the computer to smoothly and efficiently process data, which is why adding more RAM can so significantly improve performance.<br>  <br>  There are many different types of RAM, constantly changing as new technology is developed.|`|fWUiTuOPaa	RAM stands for Random Access Memory and provides space for your computer to read and write data to be accessed by the CPU (central processing unit). RAM mostly refers to computer chips that temporarily store active data to enhance the PC's performance. By storing frequently used files in the RAM, the computer can access the data faster than if it had to retrieve it from a far larger hard drive.<br>  <br>  Try to think of it like this if you have 1 empty pond and 1 big pond full of water and a bucket - and you want to move the water from the one pond to the other. <br>  RAM acts like this bucket - the bigger the RAM (effectively) the faster your computer <br>  <br>  (lol srry but I couldn’t think how to simplify it)|`|Mz6eWw2Uaa	ram stands for random access memory it stores data temporarily it retrieves the data from hard disk & feds to the processor.|`|0AX3ss67aa	Random Access Memory.

ripG5kr5aa	It depends on the printer model.  Generally it cost around Rs.2500 to 3500.  The output can also be around 3000 to 4000 pages.<br>  <br>  But I always prefer to get my toner cartridge refilled.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	The answer to both questions is that it varies considerably depending on the printer and the cartridge manufacturer. Cartridges from companies like HP are the costliest, but are also of the highest quality and usually provide the greatest number of prints. Prices for refurbished (or refilled) cartridges are 1/3 to 2/3's the price, contain lower quality toner, and may provide only 75% of the prints made by the HP. In my experience, refurbs have not been a good value because the toner tends to smear.|`|ecM7pdHwaa	<a href="http://compareindia.in.com/products/printers-laser/" rel="nofollow">http://compareindia.in.com/products/prin...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/in/en/contact_us.html" rel="nofollow">http://welcome.hp.com/country/in/en/cont...</a><br>  -<br>  Pre-sales enquiry<br>   <br>    Your enquiry will not register you as an HP customer.

And especially on large sites like amazon and ebay, trying to get free ads is a lost cause. The only 'free' way I can see is to spam their message boards with links to your site, but that is a) time consuming for you b)annoying to others and c)against all common sense, since you will get banned from sites where you practice such spamming.<br>  <br>  You could look into link exchanges, which is when you post an ad for another website on your page, and for every person that clicks on it, the other site will send one person to your site. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, advertisement costs. look into Google's AdSense.

Vv0m0QScaa	You should look for a grounding strap.  You wear it on your wrist, it has a wire attached to it, the other end of the wire clips on a grounded surface.  This prevents static electricity from jumping from your fingertips to the sensitive circuitry in the computer.  Instead, the electricity goes off of you through the strap.<br>  You can generate static electricity just from your clothes rubbing together, or from sliding around on your chair.  If you have rubber soled shoes on, you are insulated from the ground and the "charge" on you body will zap your computer.<br>  I won't guaranty this alternative method: you could work on the laptop in bare feet; that way you aren't insulated from the floor.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	You can touch the power plug every once and a while, I guess.|`|bda0a9de0301b3ee6300eb76526bffbfaa	you hide your notebook, get high, and forget about it. when you remember that you have hidden it, that's the time to find it and open it

If you can't keep away from myspace there are plenty of proxy servers out there but most schools know this and have them blocked from use.

TDgJH2Bwaa	I had the same exact problem, this is what you need to do. Plug in your ipod and see if the computer regonizes it, it did for me but the screen still stayed white. So if itunes regonizes your ipod go to the place where you see how much memory you have on your ipod. In that screen there is a button that says "restore ipod to factory settings" click it. If that doesn't work i have one more soloution. Hold down your home button and your power button for at least 30sec. For me i had to do both things to get my ipod up and running again, hope this helps!

67d41f4b35a8423190cfb8e63b306ef9aa	Using Java<br>  <br>  you could write a program that reads in an image, creates a bufferedImage then through a series of loops you could take samples of pixels or the whole image, using the method getRGB(x,y) which returns the integer 8-bit(256 colors) representation of that pixel. I would store the numbers in a 2D array. THEN find the average number, which would be the average color of the whole image, or samples of the image,(Depending on how accurate you want it, or how fast) and if the average color is with in a range that is considered red, then you have a "red-ish" picture <br>  <br>  and there you have it, hopefully that all makes sense|`|0VkYdSBSaa	if by 'red-ish' you mean everything has more red than need be, you could just start by converting all the hex numbers to decimal numbers in the color then find an average of each red, green, and blue.  They should all be somewhat near eachother.  If the red is high, then the image is reddish.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how bitmap files are stored/opened in programs, just a disclaimer.

If there is none, then make sure the hard drive is still connected inside the case.<br>  <br>  If the hard drive is still connected, you may have to install the operating system. No need to wipe it clean because it seems to have already done that.|`|I4TLCFf7aa	This usually means that the BIOS can't find either the hard drive.  Open your case and disconnect all cables that are connected to the hard drive, and then reconnect them.  Do this on the motherboard end of the cables too.  Now, with the side still removed from your computer, put your hand on the hard drive and start your computer.  You should be able to feel the drive start or "Spin Up".  If Windows loads, then all is fixed.  <br>  <br>  But if it still doesn't load, check the BIOS to see if your drive is listed or detected.  If the drive is detected and you still have no operating system, you could try running the Windows Repair Console, before you do a complete "destructive" reload of Windows.  <br>  <br>  USING THE WINDOWS REPAIR CONSOLE<br>  <br>  Put your XP disk into your CD drive and restart your system.  This will start the XP installation process.  When you come to the screen that asks if you want to install XP or if you would like to “Repair” XP, choose Repair.  This will open the repair console command prompt.  At the prompt, type:  chkdsk /r.  (There is a space between the k and the /.  Now hit “Enter”.  The repair should now start.  Allow it to run until it stops.  This can take some time, so be patient.  <br>  <br>  If all goes well, XP will replace or repair any and all missing operating system files.  <br>  <br>  Note 1:  Before attempting the above, you must first enter the BIOS to make sure that the boot sequence is set so that the CD drive boots before the hard drive.  <br>  <br>  Note 2:  If you do not have an XP installation CD, you can borrow one for this operation.  Since you are “Repairing” Windows and not “installing” it, you will not be required to supply an installation KEY.|`|1217200f8a7bd6b46b73eeb9ce169cbdaa	You can repair your computer with the system disk.

This is due to switching times/handshaking/encryption/etc.. Then, add interference from neighbor's' wireless units, microwaves, and distance from the unit, and before you know it, you are below 10mbits in no time.<br>  As a test, to see if interference from neighboring wireless units is your issue. (depends if you live in apartment or residential area vs rural).<br>  Log into your wireless unit, and see if you can change the channel in the wireless section/menu. Usually, all units are shipped with channel 6 enabled. Try channel 1 or channel 11 instead, and re-test your link speed. Any other channel is not worth the effort, as channels all overlap - you have to get as far away from the common "center" frequency as possible.<br>  Hope that helps.

CsIvy5MAaa	Are you sure the drive on the work computer is a DVD drive? I don't know if Real or Quicktime play DVDs, but I know media player does.<br>  <br>  Open up "My Computer"<br>  <br>  Does it say there is a disk in it there? If not, I'm betting it's not a DVD drive. If it says no disk, no program you download will help you out. If it shows the disk, try media player, as I watch DVDs in that all the time.|`|Xe1olUFDaa	First you might want to check if the computer you are trying to watch a movie on can even read DVDs. Some older model computer can't. Just look at where you insert the DVD and see what is says. It should say like dvd or something like that. If it doesn't you probably can't watch movies on it. And Technically their aren't any site that allow you to watch movies directly online with out a monthly subscription or a license to watch it. But I might be forgetting something. Sorry i couldn't really help. But i might have answered your question on why the computer is not reading it. Also try updating the media players. Its probably missing a file it might need. Not sure. Some DVDs need a certain "codex"(i have no idea what tat means but that is what i sometimes get with some DVDs) that your current player might not have. If the computer can even read DVDs in the first place.

z46THMt8aa	Right now Epson is having a blowout on the R280 for $60! It prints on DVDs.<br>  <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?oid=63069504&RMID=200903_high_inventory&RRID=1013876963" rel="nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consu...</a><br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.  <br>  <br>  Lasers are faster and sharper for text. Inkjets are better for photos. Laser toners are usually expensive but print thousands of pages. Ink cartridges are cheaper but print fewer pages. If you don't use the printer regularly, a laser will hold up, but if you leave your inkjet off for days at a time, the ink will clog and possibly ruin the printer.<br>  <br>  If you have a need to print out high quality photos, a laser can't touch an inkjet for that. But if you can skip the photos or don't need top quality, the Samsung CLP300 color laser does a nice job on photos and a great job on text. I got mine for $80 at Staples after a big rebate. I also bought an extra set of toner cartridges for $70 at <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> but even though I've done a lot of printing over the year, I'm still on the original set.<br>  <br>  If you dont need color at all, you can find a Brother monochrome laser for about $60. I have 2 HL-2040's going on a few years old on which I printed thousands of pages. I bought toner refills from northbaytoner for about $6 each, but you need a $3 part called a resetter in order to refill the toner. <br>  <br>  If you need high quality photos, only an inkjet will do.<br>  As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	if you want something that is very economical to run then have a look at laser printers, Be it colour or Black and White  they are much cheaper to use. faster but slightly more expensive to buy. but in the long run you will save on over all costs. <br>  <br>  check out the link below

If you want to stick with AVG, then un-install the current version you have installed, and install AVG free edition by downloading it from the link below.<br>  <br>  AVG Free Edition:<br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_avg_antivirus/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_avg_an...</a><br>  <br>  As well as virus protection (AVG), you should install some spyware protection and a good firewall. Although a firewall is built-into Windows, getting a third party one will give you stronger protection. Both of the programs listed below are also free.<br>  <br>  For spyware protection, I would recommend Spybot S&D:<br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_spybot_search_destroy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_spybot...</a><br>  <br>  For a good firewall, Comodo is the top of the free options:<br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_comodo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_comodo...</a>|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	Comodo Firewall<br>  ZoneAlarm firewall<br>  <br>  Avast antivirus<br>  AVG antivirus<br>  Comodo antivirus<br>  <br>  All the top name freeware.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	Avast, Avira, Comodo.

0AeH1pVuaa	Facebook, as a website and web-based application, is safe to use. Facebook would not knowingly host a virus, or any other kind of malware, on their servers. Again, Facebook would not knowingly infect user's computers. This would destroy their reputation instantly (given the speed that information travels around on the internet).<br>  <br>  Instead, third party applications are the ones to watch out for. It is known that some Facebook applications install adware on user's computers to deliver advertising. To avoid being infected, do not install hundreds of applications that you do not really trust or intend to use. And make sure you have up-to-date anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software installed and running on your PC.<br>  <br>  If you want to take safe browsing a step further, I would suggest that you install Firefox with the AdBlockPlus, and if you are a confident computer user, NoScript browser add-ons. This will make it even less likely for your computer to be infected through your browser, no matter what site you are visiting.

It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.<br>  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist. <br>  <br>  You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.<br>  <br>  Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|jE41oKZIaa	Try these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tarotsigns.info" rel="nofollow">http://tarotsigns.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://obamaone.info" rel="nofollow">http://obamaone.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://surfbros.info" rel="nofollow">http://surfbros.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://webvisa.info" rel="nofollow">http://webvisa.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="https://proximize.me" rel="nofollow">https://proximize.me</a>|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nshop1.com/3/" rel="nofollow">http://nshop1.com/3/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  -Unblock ANY Website<br>  -watch youtube videos<br>  -download up to 100 MB<br>  -hide you IP and stay anonymous<br>  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server<br>  <br>  I get new proxies here everyday:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxies">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if it's not working and i'll email you a proxy that I haven't advertised yet|`|wtofX47raa	try these i hope it helps you :<br>  <br>  www.adminsucks.com<br>  www.helpmyinternet.co.cc<br>  www.helpmylink.com<br>  www.gitudoang.com<br>  www.gitudoang.net|`|gHf4ryUqaa	You need to hit the books instead of trying to break into the school security, does getting kicked out school enough reason to stop this not sense?|`|PoJETtibaa	Try <a href="http://www.youtubeunblocker.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtubeunblocker.co.uk</a> :)|`|tcXozUXnaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Here are some brand new proxy sites list which will solve your problem.

You said that pulling the power plug and plugging it back in is the only way to fix it.  I'm also assuming that you have tried to unplug the mouse and restart it, and that failed, so you pulled the plug.  <br>  <br>  This mouse uses "Full Speed USB".  Are you using a USB 1.0 or 2.0 port?  Have you tried different USB ports?  The fact that you PC won't boot without pulling the plug is suspect, too.  You may need to update the BIOS.  Make sure you are using Signed Drivers for the mouse, as well.

You can also expose your APIs as .NET interoperable web services with a simple annotation.<br>  <br>  For developers who want to handle XML directly Mustang adds new parsing and XML to Java object-mapping APIs, previously only available in Java EE platform implementations or the Java Web Services Pack.<br>  <br>  Scripting<br>  You can now mix in JavaScript technology with your Java technology source code, useful for prototyping. Also useful when you have teams with a variety of skill sets.<br>  <br>  Database<br>  The final Mustang development kit will co-bundle the all-Java JDBC database, Java DB based on Apache Derby. This should enable developers (new to Java) to get a jumpstart on java development.<br>  Developers will get the updated JDBC 4.0, which focuses on ease of use. It contains many feature additions like support for XML as an SQL datatype and better integration of Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) and Character Large OBjects (CLOBs) into the APIs. Additional features that improve ease of use include removal of some JDBC boilerplate and some of the new annotations that make SQL strings embed better into your JDBC application – like decorating your getAllUsers() method with an @Query(sql="select * from user") annotation, and that being all you need. More annotation love for you.<br>  <br>  More Desktop APIs<br>  GUI developers get a large number of new tricks to play like the ever popular yet newly incorporated SwingWorker utility to help you with threading in GUI apps, JTable sorting and filtering, and a new facility for quick splash screens to quiet impatient users.<br>  <br>  Monitoring and Management<br>  The really big deal here is that you don't need do anything special to the startup to be able to attach on demand with any of the monitoring and management tools in the Java SE platform. Mustang adds yet more diagnostic information, and we co-bundled the infamous memory-heap analysis tool Jhat for forensic explorations of those core dumps.<br>  <br>  Compiler Access<br>  Really aimed at people who create tools for Java development and for frameworks like JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Personal Home Page construction kit (PHP) engines that need to generate a bunch of classes on demand, the compiler API opens up programmatic access to javac for in-process compilation of dynamically generated Java code.

But if you're using a laptop, no way to activate both speakers because most hp laptops only have headphone slots.|`|1217200f8a7bd6b46b73eeb9ce169cbdaa	I don't know why you would want to hear your Monitor speakers anyway, they are always worthless sounding.But if you insist, open your sound manager(if you have one) and change your speaker configuration from Stereo, to Quadraphonic, and both sets will work.

RjwyRrxtaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.<br>  Check your drivers.

What you need to do is to check the msconfig utility to check and edit what is loading with Windows.  <br>  -------------------------------------<br>  <br>  When attempting to speed up a computer one of the first places to go is the Microsoft Configuration Utility.  It list the programs that load or “boot” with the operating system and then run in the background.  To edit this utility, read the following.  <br>  <br>  To control what starts with Windows: <br>  <br>  Click Start and then Run.  (Vista – Start>All Programs>Accessories>Run).  In the run box, type "msconfig" without the quotes and then hit "Enter".  This will open the System Configuration Utility.  Click the "Startup" tab.  Now remove the check mark from any and all programs that you “do not” want to start or "boot" with Windows.  Now click apply and then click OK.  <br>  <br>  You will need to restart your system.  When the system starts you will see a box stating that you used the Config. utility, put a check in "Don't show this box at startup".  <br>  <br>  That should do it.  <br>  <br>  Do not remove any check marks from your security software.  You want it to load with your operating system.  As for the rest of the programs that are set to load with the OS, you will just have to experiment.  Stuff like Adobe Reader, Gama loaders, Word, etc, can be turned off.  They do not need to load with the OS, you can just click on their icons to launch these programs.|`|ChQWhMfWaa	You can delete the following:<br>  NTI CD and DVD Maker (You have Nero which is better)<br>  Adobe Acrobat (Unless you use it a lot)<br>  Adobe Reader (Unless you use it a lot)<br>  Ask Toolbar<br>  Div X Web Player (Just use YouTube or download videos and use something else)<br>  Encyclopedia Britannica (Unless you need and use it a lot)<br>  Google Desktop<br>  Google Earth (Unless you use or need it a lot)<br>  Google Photos Screensaver (You can set this from the desktop without the program: right-click on an empty place on the desktop, properties, screensaver, My Pictures Slideshow)<br>  Google Toolbar<br>  Microsoft Silverlight<br>  MSN (Unless you need or use it a lot)<br>  Safari (You've got Internet Explorer)<br>  And also delete TWO of the following three:<br>  Power DVD (Recommended to be deleted)<br>  Quick Time<br>  Real Player (Recommended to be deleted)

VMVW3E7Aaa	By Corel you mean PSP (Paint Shop Pro), right?<br>  <br>  I started off with that program. It is very capable and good enough for most people. I think it is slightly more intuitive than PS, and looks very professional. It can't do everything PS can do, but it is a whole lot cheaper.<br>  <br>  So since it is so good, why did I change to Photoshop?<br>  <br>  I changed because of the amount of support.

h8NzChhqaa	First some basics:<br>  <br>  1) Source code  is what a programmer writes. There is no computer which can understand source code.<br>  <br>  2) Machine code is what the computer understands. There are very very few programmers who understand machine code. <br>  <br>  3) Not all computers use the same machine code. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1) "translator" is basically just another word for "compiler". However, a translator would generally be [a program which translates source code that is written in one programming language to another]. <br>  <br>  2) A compiler translates source code into machine code or byte code.<br>  <br>  3) An interpreter is a program which reads and executes source code.<br>  Interpreters are the slowest means by which a program can be executed.<br>  <br>  4) A virtual machine is like an interpreter. However, instead of executing source code, a virtual machine executes byte code.<br>  When a compiler compiles a program to byte code, any computer which has a virtual machine installed capable of executing that type of byte code can run the program. This is why a program written in Java will run on (basically) any computer. <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  The advantage of pure compilation (I.e. compile to machine code) is speed. <br>  <br>  The advantage of interpretation is how rapidly a rapidly a program can be deployed. This allows programs to be written for routine tasks. Also interpreters can make the debugging of a program simpler.<br>  <br>  The advantage to a virtual machine is platform-independence (I.e. the ability to run on different types of computers).

What is your BIOS model? What kind of Motherboard, Processor, RAM? Does it make any beeping noises?

Some of them come with the Q9300 Processor. If you did try to OC it, that could be the issue as they have a locked Multiplier.<br>  <br>  Edit to add: Hm.. I'm really not sure where-in the problem lies... It's possible actually that you don't have a sufficient enough Power supply (PSU). I have had a similar problem and that was the issue. Most Dell computers come with VERY low end PSU's somewhere around 350 to 450 Watts. For what you are running I would suggest at least a 600 Watt power supply. They aren't very expensive, easy to install, and even if it won't fix the issue (it will void the warranty though opening the case) it is good to have a better PSU for future Computer Upgrades.

Your computer has thousands of these, and they act as message headers for information arriving into the computer.<br>  <br>  Each port can be assigned to a daemon program which monitors all incoming data with that particular port address on it.<br>  <br>  For example, your web browser monitors all incoming data flagged as going to "port=80", because that's where web page information goes.<br>  <br>  port 25 is the email port, for example.<br>  <br>  These virtual ports do not correspond to holes in your machine, where you can connect a lead.

This size does not include the terminating null character. <br>  lpBuffer <br>  Pointer to a buffer that receives a series of null-terminated strings, one for each valid drive in the system, that end with a second null character. The following example shows the buffer contents with <null> representing the terminating null character. <br>  c:\<null>d:\<null><null> <br>   <br>  Return Values<br>  If the function succeeds, the return value is the length, in characters, of the strings copied to the buffer, not including the terminating null character.

zorYTX59aa	I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

It is possible they are sister companies (the security company I used to work for had a sister company) but I doubt it as ADT usually just tries to take over smaller companies.|`|TTNgjOK1aa	ADT and Guardian are separate companies. ADT is one of the largest alarm monitoring companies, but you may see many small "alarm companies" using an ADT logo. Although ADT does have a large network company installers (Sales and Service Offices or SSO's), it has grown so large that they allow smaller companies to install and/or service their alarm systems. These are part of the ADT Authorized Dealer program, and you will usually see a logo on those company's websites. These dealers rely on other companies like ADT to actually monitor the alarm systems. Without monitoring, an alarm system is just a noisemaker, the same as a car alarm.<br>  <br>  ADT also has been known to acquire smaller independently monitored alarm companies. ADT has grown so much that smaller companies tend to have a hard time competing, and when they go under ADT often will acquire all of the old customers as it's own. When this happens, each customer of the old company would receive a letter telling them of the company acquisition and are now a customer of ADT.<br>  <br>  So, they are separate companies. The only way that would change is if Guardian becomes unstable and ADT acquires them, which appears unlikely since Guardian appears to have been around for 78 years, according to the website.

1F6KJt0oaa	I am not sure what currency you are working with but these prices seem a bit extreme.  I would think that for gaming and the like that you would need more video memory than 512 more like 1G. I am not sure why you would want Intel over AMD seems to me like you would be crunching some serious data and the added power of an AMD processor would be a good boost.  I get that most of what you will be doing is graphics which is a speed thing but for applications I would rather have power with that speed.  For gaming you would probably want to go with an advanced cooling system as well.  If you are talking American dollars then you can put a much nicer system together for 1/5 the money.

NTFS actually stores small files in the Master File Table (MFT), to increase performance. Rather than moving the heads to the beginning of the disk to read the MFT entry, and then to the middle or end of the disk to read the actual file, the heads simply move to the beginning of the disk, and read both at the same time. This can account for a considerable increase in speed when reading lots of small files.|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	(FAT ) Fat16 and FAT32 are of the older file systems NTFS (New Technology File System)<br>  Fat is not as organized as ntfs so it takes longer to read.

82L4k3nqaa	Those aren't file permissions they are the size of the directory entries.  That particular file ran out of space in it's default 4096 bytes and had to add two extra 4096 byte chunks to hold the names and inodes of all the files inside.<br>  <br>  So, to set the number to 4096 you have to delete some of the files in that directory.  However the file system probably won't recover the space (I've never looked at this) so you may have to create a new directory of the same name and mv only those files that fit into it.

One program that you can try is Advanced Systemcare3 which is a free program that will do numerous things to your computer that a novice would find difficult to do. It will optimise your system, defrag if necessary, get rid of spyware, optimise RAM, clean registry, delete temp files etc. plus a lot more. If this does not work you may need to look further. Anti virus can make your computer run very slowly. Spyware is another culprit. You can run malwarebytes antimalware that is a good program for getting rid of adware/spyware. You can also run several registry cleaners like JV16 powertools, Glarysoft Reg Cleaner, CCleaner. It is also very useful to get rid of programs on the HD that you do not use and stop any programs that you do not need on the start up menu. Updating all your drivers can also speed up performance. Lastly and probably most importantly increasing the amount of RAM you have in the machine can significantly increase computer speed.<br>  <br>  In terms of Antivirus use one of these free programs that you can download from the WEB. AVG, Avast, Avira or Comodo. Hope this helps. Good luck.

The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

bByVjwkvaa	Both NVidia and ATI are great brands. I have experince with both brandsand you can't go wrong with either. I usually end up getting ATI cards however since most of the cards I had before were ATI radeon cards. <br>  <br>  As far as I know, ATI right now has the best cards out there for you buck. NVidia has great cards as well, but tend to be overpriced at the moment. ATI's high-end cards that are pretty much equivalent to NVidia's high-end cards in terms of performance and specs but what gives ATI the edge right now is their lower prices.<br>  <br>  There's word that NVidia may lower their prices to compete with ATI but as it stands, ATI is the beter choice now. Hope that helps =)|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Radeon isn't a brand, it's a model. ATI is the brand. <br>  <br>  Right now ATI holds the single card performance crown with the 4870X2. It also holds some significant price advantages over nVidia. However, nVidia has a few things that ATI doesn't: namely CUDA and PhysX support. ATI does better with antialiasing and AF. However, nVidia cards scale much better than ATI, with the exception of the 4850. <br>  <br>  nVidia's strategy is to release a monolithic huge powerful card and trickle it down. ATI's strategy is to release a powerful card for the value and use scaling with crossfire to match up with the higher end cards, and they use the X2 strategy in a single card. The 4870 1GB by itself is an excellent card for 1920 and 1080 res. But for the 30", you really need to get the X2 which is two cards in one. I think overall, ATI is the better value and performance, but if you want bar-none top performance, putting two GT295's together (at near $1000!) is the best you can get really. But seems a little silly<br>  <br>  So...right now, ATI has the upper hand in terms of value and marketing, but nVidia is releasing the 280M soon and is going to rock the laptop graphics. Right now I'd put my money on ATI, but I wouldn't bet the farm on them keeping that.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Depends on what you want it for.  Also depends on the models.  I tend to lean towards AMD because I like to have a little torque in my rides so I lean towards Radeons.  Better is always relative though one man's better in regards to brands can be another man's worse.  Mostly it depends on what you are into.|`|D2uA1SKdaa	i like radeon cards slightly better. however the major thing u need to pay attention to is the mother board. there is always a chip set on the board and u need to either choose ur video card and then ur mother board to work best with the card or choose ur mother board and then the best video card. i use a nvidia video card because of the asus mother board i wanted, and i find the combination an excellent pair.|`|mxv6UyvJaa	Well Nvidia would always be my choice because their cards are usually the better cards for gaming.

A server is a huge computer, with large memory, RAM and ROM. It stores a large number of websites onto it's hardisk and each server has different websites on it. Therefore, if you are connected to one server you are connected to every other one in the world. <br>  <br>  The fee is only for the telephone lines or Fiber Optics that connect you to the server which connects you to the internet. The connections and service of the server is the reason you have to pay an ammount of money to be able to log in on the internet.

Just like Youtube got bought out by Google. <br>  <br>  Though Youtube has a different server it is still owned by Google, though its servers are http://youtube<br>  and not http://google<br>  <br>  Mainly A server is a huge modem that allows a lot of traffic through it. and is just as likely to be attacked by a virus or hacker as any computer or laptop is.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!|`|Pvl6OReJaa	NO one owns Internet.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.

Make sure they are all the way in and snug. <br>  <br>  If you have another power source, try plugging it in ther just to see if it will run. I recently had a drive from Seagate that failed and the replacement drive wouldn't operate at all, (3 PSU, 2 external enclosures). <br>  <br>  Simple things like I have indicated are the usual causes of what you are seeing. If your drive still won't work, I hope you can submit it for a warranty claim, as it has failed. Maxtor drives used to be very bad.

Just watch out for bandwidth overage charges.<br>  <br>  That plan gives you 2,500GB/month, or about 83GB/day. If you really get two million hits per day, that would work out to 44KB per hit to avoid overage charges. That's not realistic for a graphics-heavy and video-heavy site.<br>  <br>  I don't see the charges for overusage listed.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I were building a new site, I wouldn't worry about it. You have at least a year before you're going to have that kind of traffic. By then, you'll have a much better idea of how much CPU power, disk space, and bandwidth you need because you'll have your statistics.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you're transferring an existing site, you have to worry about it now. But then you should know more accurately what your usage is going to be and can do a better job of evaluating that.<br>  <br>  But the server horsepower should be plenty.<br>  <br>  Caution: RAID 1 is fault-tolerance, not backup.

However, if the computer game is legitimate, but was infected by a virus, then it is not a Trojan horse, regardless of what the virus may do when the game is executed.

If you're not recording from a mic and trying to get the audio from a video file, you need an editing program that will let you save that video as a wav/mp3/wma etc.  There are programs that let you convert videos to audio too.

I will assume VISTA and if so, go to Control Panel and select Device Manager (DM) from the list. Let DM develop its alphabetized list. Under 'Sound,Video and Game Controllers' you should see the name of your sound card. What you will be doing is checking to see if your card is "on" in software. This would affect both the speakers and the headphones as both get the sound from this card. <br>  <br>  Double-click that line and its 'Properties' window should come up. The initial tab is the 'General' one and it normally states that the device is working properly. If it isn't (and I suspect that in your case it is not) go to the tab marked 'Driver' . In the bottom half of the window that appears there should be five 'buttons'. You want to make sure the fourth from the top shows 'Disable' (which means your device is enabled). If it says 'Enable' then your card is disabled and you have to enable it by clicking that button. <br>  <br>  If this is your situation, then you may correctly wonder why the card was disabled when you didn't disable it. Great question, as I wondered that too when it happened to me.

I4TLCFf7aa	Disrupting a system restore usually corrupts the entire operating system.  You have to options to attempt to repair this.  You can try the Windows Repair Console or you can just wipe the system and reinstall Windows.  <br>  <br>  To run the Repair Console, read the following.  <br>  <br>  USING THE WINDOWS REPAIR CONSOLE<br>  <br>  Put your XP disk into your CD drive and restart your system.  This will start the XP installation process.  When you come to the screen that asks if you want to install XP or if you would like to “Repair” XP, choose Repair.  This will open the repair console command prompt.  At the prompt, type:  chkdsk /r.  (There is a space between the k and the /.  Now hit “Enter”.  The repair should now start.  Allow it to run until it stops.  This can take some time, so be patient.  <br>  <br>  If all goes well, XP will replace or repair any and all missing operating system files.  <br>  <br>  Note 1:  Before attempting the above, you must first enter the BIOS to make sure that the boot sequence is set so that the CD drive boots before the hard drive.  <br>  <br>  Note 2:  If you do not have an XP installation CD, you can borrow one for this operation.  Since you are “Repairing” Windows and not “installing” it, you will not be required to supply an installation KEY.

For other meanings, see Trojan Horse (disambiguation)<br>  <br>  The Trojan horse, also known as trojan, in the context of computing and software, describes a class of computer threats (malware) that appears to perform a desirable function but in fact performs undisclosed malicious functions that allow unauthorized access to the host machine, giving them the ability to save their files on the user's computer or even watch the user's screen and control the computer.<br>  <br>  Trojan Horses (not technically a virus) can be easily and unwillingly downloaded. For example, if a computer game is designed such that, when executed by the user, it opens a back door that allows a hacker to control the computer of the user, then the computer game is said to be a Trojan horse.

M7i30zP6aa	I have been using craig's list for the last 4 years and it's a wonderful site.  I sold 4 cars on there and bought 2, and plus alot of electronic stuff.  I got burned once with a defective router but the price was very low so I took the hit.  Here's what I learned:<br>  <br>  Posting <br>  - try to list your item with some photos.<br>  - do not put your real phone number on there unless you are very desperate.  Use services like grandcentral from google to route your call or you might get some nasty calls for no reason.<br>  - do not post your real email address on there unless you are ready for a big time spaming<br>  - take cash and cash only.<br>  - never ship <br>  - don't meet up too far from where you are.  I got stood up a few times and learn that quickly<br>  - everything is as-is<br>  <br>  <br>  Buying<br>  - if the price is too low, it's probably too good to be true<br>  - review the above line<br>  - look for ones that's close to you.  try to talk to the seller and find out more about the items<br>  - many times there are fake and damaged items out there, like iphone clone or water damaged.  make sure you test it out very well before paying<br>  - try not to meet up in crowd public place, like food court in mall or outside of a bank where there is security camera<br>  - let a friend or post online that you are meeting someone online so someone could back trace where you are if things go south.  this might be a bit too much but good to be safe.<br>  - always assume what you get on craig's list will have problem and calculate the risk (money you will lost) on getting it there.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Just read the Craiglist scam warnings and use common sense, and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  If you're worried, meet in person in a public area.|`|Zt9uuif9aa	i've used craigslist for selling many items and its been great...just follow the instructions about postings and about what not to do and you should be fine...good luck|`|618b763bcbdec675a22a2a35212b1e29aa	i use it all the time,it is very safe. i have 3 items on it rite now.
