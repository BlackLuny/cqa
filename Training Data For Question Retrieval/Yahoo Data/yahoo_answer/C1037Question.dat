20090308091417AA0Ac5j	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	When doing a throw-in, if no one else touches the ball can you (the thrower) touch it first?	For example today in my game I took a throw-in and the ball slipped in my hands and landed right in front of me on the field (that was pretty embarrassing!) so I kicked it of course, and then the ref. called something but I don't remember what.  Was my play an illegal one?      Also, the ref. kept calling "coming out."  What does that mean?      I'm pretty good at soccer, but really bad with all the rules and stuff! Thanks for helping!

Top Heavyweights:   -Shane Carwin (11-0) recently defeated Gabriel Gonzaga at UFC 96   -Cain Velasquez (5-0) set to face Heath Herring at UFC 99   -Cheick Kongo (18-4-1) set to face Antoni Hardonk at UFC 97      Also...

20090308093150AABZGzv	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Why do so many people who talk about pistol ammunition don't know what they are talking about?	So many times I hear people giving the most stupid advise on pistol ammunition. For instance people day thing like the .40 s&w doesn't have anymore power that the 9mm. Now I know that is just a flat out lye. I also get sick of people telling others about how the .45 is still the best defense round when the .40 s&w and 357 sig have much better ballistics and power. Yes that's right believe it or not just because it has a bigger bullet doesn't make it better. Ive shot and i have seen what all four of these rounds can do. In my opinion the best pistol defense loads in order of starting from my least favorite to most favorite are.      9mm      .45 acp      .40 s&w      .357 sig      Now all I want to know is why people think an outdated round like the .45 acp is better than rounds like the .40 s&w and 357 sig???

20090308095848AAVM4lG	Sports;Football (American)	Do you agree with this Mock Draft?	1) Lions - JASON SMITH - OT  Kind of a shocker, but not really..   With Cassel going to the chiefs there will most likely be a QB available at pick 20.   If not they still have the best LT in the draft..         2) Rams - EUGENE MONROE - OT With Brown now at C this pick really solidifies the O-Line.      3) Chiefs - AARON CURRY - LB They don't need a QB anymore so they go with Curry the best player in the draft.      4) Seattle - B.J. RAJI - DT Losing Rocky Bernard to the Giants hurts..  Not so much after this pick. Getting T.J. let's them pass on Crabtree      5) Browns - BRIAN ORAKPO - DE Upgrades the Browns pass-rush      6) Bengals - MICHAEL CRABTREE - WR This makes TJ's departure easier.  Although Andrews leaving hurts..      7) Raiders - JEREMY MACLIN - WR  200 yards a game??  Now they have a WR threat to help free up space for Mcfadden..         8) Jaguars - MICHAEL OHER - OT a need pick here..      9) Packers - EVERETTE BROWN - DE he helps in the new 3-4 scheme...      10) 49'ers - MATTHEW STAFFORD - QB = Alex Smith isnt gonna cut it, will Stafford??      11) Bills - ANDRE SMITH - OT sure he left the combine but he's still a top prospect. Gives Edwards time to get the ball to T.O.      12) Denver - REY MAUALUGA LB  they need this guy unfortunately...      13) Redskins - BRIAN CUSHING - LB   With Taylor out they would like to do DE here but the value just isn't right...      14) Saints - MACOLM JENKINS - CB  Saints get a steal here..      15) Texans - VONTAE DAVIS - CB they just miss out on Jenkins but get a very good CB..         16) Chargers - AARON MAYBIN - DE Penn State guy that they play at OLB if Merriman is not ready      17) Jets - MARK SANCHEZ - QBIs this the year the Jets take a potential franchise QB in the first round.        18) Bears - DARRIUS HEYWERD_BEY  Bears find their weapon on the outside...based on his 40 time he moves up this high. Biggest bust of the draft.      19) Bucs - PERIA JERRY - DT  after him there is a big drop off in the DT position..        20) Lions - TYSON JACKSON - DE    Lions go DE here since both 1st round QB's are gone..   Lions look to build the lines and then go bradford next year..   you heard it here...       21) Eagles - BEANIE WELLS - RB Westbrook will be more potent if he doesn't have to shoulder the load alon andwith Buckhalter leaving.   this pick is obvious need..   but a good value as well.. .       22) Vikings - ALEX MACK - C  With Birk out this guy comes in..  problem solved. Know they want a receiver, but Mack is too good to pass up.      23) Patriots - JAMES LAUARINITIS - LB  Patriots upgrade the LB position here...      24) Falcons - CLAY MATTHEWS - LB  Brooking and Boley gone no surprise here...third USC LB taken in the first round      25) Dolphins - LARRY ENGLISH - LB/DE = Need LB help and English will be the steal of the draft.      26) Ravens - CLINT SINTIM - LB  Ravens have to go D here...ready to slide into Scott's vacated spot      27) Colts - HAKEEM NICKS - WR   Colts look to replace Marvin Harrison..       28) Eagles - BRANDEN PETTIGREW - TE   Eagles grab the best TE  here..   nice value.  McNabb feels better..      29) Giants - Knowshon Moreno a top tier RB gives the G-Men a potent 1-2 punch combined with Jacobs and the best player avaliable.      30) Titans - FILI MOALA - DT This helps with  the Haynesworth loss..       31) Cardinals - LeSean McCoy - RB  Cards need a RB and luckily this guy is still here..      32) Steelers - Eben Britten OT  Pitt goes O-Line to protect Big Ben with the last pick..

20090308105426AAsUzgO	Sports;Football (American)	Which franchise is more in a decline right now?	Philidelphia eagles - loss of dawkins, LJ and buckhalter no real LB core   and a mcnabb who is getting less mobile every year he gets older, w/ no real threat except 1 maybe 2 wr, its hard to see how they are not same if not worse than last season.      NE patriots - Technically we are still in their dynasty since they were just in a superbowl 2 years ago, but with the loss of multiple hall of famers this season and no one knowing the status of bradies injurue or the full potential of sanders and meriweather over wilson(even though he left like a year ago) and harrison this is really their first make or break season theyve had in a while.      Chargers - Losing olshansky doesnt really hurt them that bad in a 3-4 system, but losing an RB that forces teams to play more run d to allow rivers to pass better can destroy te franchise, sproles is good, but because of the type of back he is (only a speedster, .........bush,westbrook, slaton...etc) Teams dont really fear speedsters except in pass catching since speedsters arent really built to take hits like a typical rb (larry johnson, LT, AP...etc) so they become alot more injury prone when the become premier backs...especially the older they get.      Buccaneers - There are 2 ways to look at the team, but the only way i see them getting better is by resigning all their vets...just for cheaper..their starting line-up right now would make a great bench....but just not a great starting lineup....bucs are using that age old potential of their young guys argument as to justify their season...................Cleveland browns and bengals have been using that strategy for years..........how r those clubhouses working out???      Jacksonville jaguars - its a shame when u see  expansion franchises in decline it seems like every year jaguars release all their inside defense (stroud, peterson) and all their o-lineman, They did it to leftwhich(who already had stone feet), and now they are doing it to girrard and MJD..Who needs a draft when jacksonville is always giving away pro bowl potential big men every year?? Its hard to see how they r getting better by setting up girrard for a cuncussion season like they tried to do leftwich..but with MJD....maybe the season can be salvaged in the AFC south.....................i doubt it, but maybe.

20090308105544AAd9nVQ	Sports;Cycling	Front right brake hitting wheel...how do I adjust?	The front right brake on my (old) mountain bike is hitting the wheel, causing a really bad squealing noise when I move the bike forward even without applying pressure to the brakes. I can adjust the brake pad manually with my fingers (essentially moving that u shaped part that connects the two brakes) but as soon as I apply the brakes and release them it shifts back to where it was before. I'm not sure I've explained the situation well enough for anyone to understand, but I'm not sure how else to describe it.       Obviously I know nothing about bikes and proper bike terminology since I use my bike mostly for recreation on nice days and sometimes for transportation, so I wanted to check to see what I should do before I start messing around with it. Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong area, but the sports > cycling seemed to be about as specific as I could get. Any ideas what I should do?      Also: the brakes themselves are not squealing when I apply them; in any case I've already checked to make sure they're debris free. I just think the noise is coming from the brake hitting the wheel while the bike is in motion.

They were exciting and fast, maaan that was a fun game to watch.      What about Mbenga? [In 17 minutes he was 4-5 with 10 points, 5 blocks, and 4 rebounds.] He was blocking like crazy tonight. Ariza had 13 points =], and Shannon's block and dunk were impressive.       Can we expect the bench to produce at this level on the road, or will we see them lacking again?

SAF had successful last year. But, will it continue for the remaining years? Performance wise, they are not very consistent.       I agree they won the test series in many countries last year. But, I feel it is not convincing. They had to work hard to win those matches. For e.g. they successfully chased 414 to win a match. But actually speaking, they did not dominate the first four days. This is not the case if you see Steve waugh's team. They won so many matches very easily. The real sign of being a champion team is to dominate the opponents and win convincingly. What are your thoughts?      No rude answers and racist comments please!

After days of intense speculations, all uncertainties regarding the Indian Premier League Season 2 were finally removed on Friday, March 6, 2009. The IPL will go ahead as scheduled – from April 10 to May 24, with a couple of matches being rescheduled. The venue for the opening match has been shifted from Jaipur to Mumbai.       The IPL series had come under a cloud in the past few days with the dates clashing with the Lok Sabha election dates from April 16 to May 13, and security concerns being raised in the aftermath of the attack on Sri Lankan cricketers in Pakistan. The 45-day cricket extravaganza involving 60 matches and eight teams is spread over eight cities and will conclude on May 24, 2009.       Will players and spectators respond with the same enthusiasm?      How will the S Lankan cricketers feel about it?      Will the absence of the Pakistani players have any impact?

Leia abaixo.      "Bairrismo vergonhoso      O que vimos da grande maioria da imprensa nacional envergonha a todos que gostam e levam o futebol a sério. O lance do pênalti que n?o houve a favor do Flamengo na partida contra o Cruzeiro mostrou o quanto grande parte da imprensa nacional é anti-profissional e, acima de tudo, bairrista. Se a mesma jogada gerasse dúvidas a favor de qualquer time fora do eixo Rio-S?o Paulo n?o teria tido a mesma repercuss?o.      Pseudos comentaristas de arbitragem, alguns que até já foram juízes de futebol, n?o tiveram a mínima considera??o com o Carlos Eugênio Simon. O árbitro foi colocado como desonesto, irresponsável e o pior dos mortais por ex-profissionais do apito que, quando árbitros, tiveram erros que decidiram campeonatos.      Um exemplo é o carioca José Roberto Wright, responsável direto por classifica??o escandalosa do Flamengo em uma fase da Libertadores contra o Atlético-MG, no Serra Dourada. Márcio Rezende de Freitas, da mesma maneira, tirou o título brasileiro do Santos em 95. Renato Marsiglia também errou muito em sua carreira, assim como Arnaldo Cézar Coelho, mas todos foram implacáveis nas duras críticas ao colega de arbitragem.      é por isso que os torcedores fora do eixo Rio-S?o Paulo têm que ficar atentos aos comentários dessa turma, que é acima de tudo de torcedores, que tudo fazem para distorcer os fatos e agora deram também para distorcer imagens.      Pena porque o futebol n?o merecia isso.      Conclamamos os cruzeirenses a ficarem atentos a essa gente que forma opini?o e acha que os outros s?o cegos. Se n?o aparecesse uma imagem salvadora, o árbitro Carlos Eugênio Simon estaria hoje, talvez, fora da Copa do Mundo.      Gostaria que esses mesmos donos da verdade viessem a público para reconhecer seus erros e se desculpar com a torcida brasileira. Mas será que eles ter?o coragem?      Tudo leva a crer que o verdadeiro objetivo é pressionar a arbitragem através de um massacre, para que favore?a a Flamengo e Palmeiras. E parece que a press?o está funcionando. No jogo Vitória e Palmeiras dois pênaltis claros n?o foram marcados contra o time paulista.      Veja o que aconteceu no nosso jogo contra o Internacional. O árbitro carioca Djalma Beltrame também deixou de marcar dois pênaltis a favor do Cruzeiro. Só que dessa vez os severos críticos acharam tudo normal. Felizmente ainda existem comentaristas isentos, mas já n?o s?o a maioria.      Abram os olhos mineiros, gaúchos e paranaenses porque agora a coisa tá dando muito na cara.

Ontem eu fiz uma pergunta que classifiquei como construtiva    http://br.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...       e algumas pessoas aparentemente se sentiram ofendidas (vai entender...). Ent?o vou fazer um outro tipo de pergunta:      Se você tivesse que apostar todo o seu dinheiro, em quem apostaria para ser campe?o brasileiro, S?o Paulo ou Grêmio? Eu sei que já perguntaram várias vezes quem será o campe?o, mas a minha pergunta leva em considera??o um possível prejuizo financeiro em caso de palpite errado. Eu apostaria no S?o Paulo, n?o apenas por ser s?o paulino, mas porque o S?o Paulo tem uma tarefa TEORICAMENTE menos complicada (e que minha conta bancária possa me agradecer depois, hehe). E você, em quem apostaria?

20090227100619AAJXrrl	Sports;Rugby	Tackling big guys (in rugby)?	I've been working on my tackling in rugby. I'm a little guy (5'11" 160). All the internet tutorials say to get low, (which I do), run quickly at the ball carrier (which I've been doing). And then to put your shoulders into his hips (cheek to cheek), wrap up his legs, and drive him into the ground. I'd been doing this very successfully against the other backs at practice, but when I ran a hitting drill with one of our props, I injured my shoulder. I ran as hard as I could at this fellow, put my shoulder into his hips, and he KEPT ON RUNNING. This was last night, I have a doctors appointment this evening to see just how damaged I am. The pain was excrutiating.       I thought that I was about to perform a textbook tackle. I was lower, faster, my head was behind him, I was 100% comitted. What can I do (in rugby, without shoulder pads) to take down these big guys without doing more damage to myself?

I'd be so stoked if it was a Raleigh equivelant, thats really what I'm looking for.  From what I've gathered online, They're above Huffy/Murray but not as good as something you'd get in a bike shop back then. Vintage department store type of bike, which really wern't so bad back then...       I asked if it was steel or aluminum, The lady said she could pick it up, and she thought it was lightweight. She asked me what the difference was so I don't think she's positive... I'm hoping the thing doesn't weigh a million pounds!

Quando citamos algo em diminuitivo, n?o quer dizer que está ofendendo, e sim carinho.   Isso é normal entre torcedores em pronunciar um time de timinho, timeco e o nome em diminuitivo!

20070603151156AABWBSr	Sports;Football (Soccer);Brazilian Football (Soccer)	Gostaria de ler a sua opini?o?	Como Atléticana que sou, venho observando o nosso maravilhoso goleiro Diego, mas estou apreensiva  quando ele faz defesa normalmente rebate a bola para frente ao invés de segura-la ou enviar para as laterais. pois se ali estiver alguém do adversário poderá aproveitar o rebote como  já aconteceu . Será que só eu estou observando isto ou estou errada ?
20070602174708AA7hhkX	Sports;Football (Soccer);Brazilian Football (Soccer)	Amigos quero uma opini?o?	Atlético jogou com um cal??o dourado e eu particurlamente n?o gostei, acho n?o tem nada haver com o Galo, eu fa?o a pergunta pois pode ser que eu esteja demode e n?o entenda de modas, mas amo o Galo de Preto e Branco. o que vocês acharam ? Por favor Senhores do time de lá , se me aborrecerem podes ter certeza que sei dar troco. Beijos aos de cá e os de lá
