F4IjI9qaaa	Absolutely!    I think of our spiritual existence as a big, long game of telephone - where you whisper something into someone's ear and see what it morphs into after 25 people have repeated it. I think God's word has taken some twists and turns along the way (resulting in all the various religions).    I grew up in the Methodist church, I too have more or less developed my own set of beliefs. I believe that each of the religions holds a piece of the divine truth. No one religion has all the answers.     Be well and good luck on your quest.|`|WiRjbGHmaa	When you view religions as merely beliefs you are free to enjoy the fruits of the religions without being enslaved by their dogmas.  This also applies to Atheism as well, for though it is not a religion it is a belief, no more or less valid than any other.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Any that teach love will have important, viable aspects.    I like a lot of the teachings of Buddhism, as well as Baha'i.  Their emphasis on unity is very appealing to me.|`|V4JLwTVyaa	Yes.  I don't like limiting myself to one particular area.  If I find certain things in different beliefs that I like or that I find to make very good sense, I'll add it to what I already believe in.  And I toss out the parts that I think are contradictory or are just set up to keep the people in line.|`|SFoMSEpgaa	I think it is nice when I see something that is in my own beliefs...I wouldn't go outside my beliefs to do anothers...Or I wouldn't have a belief anymore would I? I don't know. Good question.|`|iC1mo3toaa	I agree with you. I have my own religion but I do listten to pointers from others. Sometimes they bring up something and I say they inspired me about something. Many christians place too much importance to their demonination only. We need to put the word of God first. No one will get to heaven on a pastors ticket.
yywRjouyaa	I kind of like it. I mean simply it is the truth in simplest forms.     I have said many times "I am just not convinced of any god written in any religious texts" which in a way does leave room in my mind for all sorts of possibilities.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	He'd make a great politician|`|ojHFFpcBaa	Turnabout is fair play. I consider religious folks "unconvinced people". It all depends on your point of view.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Sounds polite and reasonable. My priest just says "non-believer"|`|f3nwI8ytaa	It's nice. It's also a bit patronizing.  There are many atheists who *are* convinced.  They're just convinced that there is no God.    peace|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I think an honest atheist -- if they exist -- would complain. Their whole "point" is they are convinced. I applaud the civility behind the attempt but don't it will get any sympathy from wiser-than-thou crowd.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	I like it. Maybe I'll say that from now on. What book was it?|`|aEdkaXmtaa	yes|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	thats much better than "lost". I dont get why they call us "lost", I know exactly where I am.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	I see how it's appropriate from a "convinced" perspective, but I don't think most atheists or agnostics are really unconvinced, in their own right.  I was under the impression that atheism was a pretty certain belief that there was no God, and that agnosticism was a pretty certain belief that human can never know for sure if there is or isn't a God.    I don't like using terms like "non-believer" or "non theist" for the same reason:  it defines people in oopposition to something that they don't personally embrace.  To me it's more respectful to define them positively, in relation to what they do believe.    I wouldn't like people defining me as a "unheterosexual," a "un-female" or a "non atheist."|`|1GytoT0xaa	Not bad, though I prefer the terms non-theist or humanist.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	It is nice.  As Paul used the term as well.  It is not what they are not convinced of; it is what they are convinced of that makes me wonder if fences are indeed necessary.|`|WynOhlMZaa	Sounds arrogant to me.|`|ulwXFrrJaa	I wouldn't mind that term.  then again, i don't mind the terms "non-believer" "atheist" or "agnostic" either.      The one thing that might be a touch questionable about "unconvinced people" is that it implies that an atheist is simply a person who has yet to hear the compelling evidence that will convince him.      from my perspective an "unconvinced person" is a Christian.  On any issue relating to faith where evidence is not a factor, using a word like "unconvinced" is a touch arbitrary.  can anyone really be convinced on faith based matters?  isn't that why it is called faith?  if it was fact based, you could educate someone and convince them.  on spiritual matters, non-believers are essentially being asked to be convinced in something without being provided any evidence for such a conviction.      either side, you could say, is "unconvinced" of the other side's theological stance.  we are all unconvinced from a certain perspective.|`|DpPAUqyKaa	I think it still sounds Hitler-esque.|`|mGzwEvQbaa	Well, it's his book.    I mean, as far as such things go, I would say he's relatively temperate.  I would take, "and those of you who are unconvinced," to, "you Godless tainted cretins who shall flame eternal."    But yea... his book... he's a pastor.  What did you expect?

However, ascribing human morals and perspectives to God could be an erroneous assumption that taints your conclusions.  Unless of course you consider morality to be an absolute in which case you must ask yourself where such a universal absolute came from, which of course leads you back to God.  So, ironically, your stance has done more to prove the existence of God than disprove it.|`|AA11992885	you are basing the idea of God on that he loves all of his creations?  that is idiotic, what if HE doesn't love all of HIS creations?  what if HE doesn't love anything?    hence, no strike    BALL    and possibly the second ball, i don't know what your supposed first strike was, that was probably a ball as well.....this is why the UMPIRES call the pitch, NOT the spectators|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Malaria is a prime example.

Don't fall over from reaching so far.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	I'm not a science major or anything but doesn't science have to do with being able to replicate something in a lab setting? Belief in a diety can't fit into that category.     If you say, "pollution causes health problems over 10 years at this level of pollution", that can be tested scientifically. Religious belief can't. Especially if the person wanting proof has a negative bias against the topic.|`|bOfDpTLxaa	if the planet were populate strictly by herbivores then it would quickly become a barren wasteland, as all plant life would be stripped bare from the earth. with nothing left to eat all the animals would quickly either die off or start eating each other. but since the animals are designed to eat strictly plants they wouldn't be able to process the proteins properly and become horribly ill. and just for a little added info, plants have feelings too its a proven fact! so no matter what anything eats its causing pain to something.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	Your argument isn't that God doesn't exist, rather it is that God isn't good.  As you said, "if god was real and loved..."   So maybe God is real but doesn't love as you expect Him to love.    You think it wrong that God, if He exists, would allow river blindness but where do you get your ideas about right and wrong?  The atheist view is that right and wrong come from society and/or from evolution.  If that's true, then we can't judge God for He doesn't come from our society or from evolution.      In fact, by judging God, you've tacitly assumed that He exists just by thinking you have a universal standard of right and wrong that you can use to judge His actions.|`|379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	>"When the plague broke out it was believed that to not get it you had to pray and then your priests dropped dead.    If your god was real than why didn't he prevent the millions of deaths?"    those people believed wrongly.     that aside, ... why do you think it would be within God's will to prevent those deaths? this assertion is totally nonsensical.    >"If god was real and loved all his creations, than why would he make some animals designed to kill other animals rather than make them all plant eaters?"  you say that like there is something wrong with animals killing other animals to eat.  ... theres not.  its just the order of things. theres no reason that order should be anything else.    >"The perfect example is the nematode worm which can only live in human eyes, causing blindness in thousands in Africa."  how is that a perfect example? that demonstrates *nothing*.    and to answerers:  >"every green herb for meat:"  genesis 1:30 does not say that. your translation is wrong.    additionally, you are tilting windmills. it is DEFINITIONALLY impossible, (not out of faith, but out of logic) to disprove the existence of God. any serious atheist could tell you that it is indeed impossible to disprove God, they only find that the correct/reasonable conclusion is that he does not, and/or that its unknowable, and/or that God existing or not has no relevance.    as a bottom line, you are having a fixation that death = bad. when its not. death is part of life.|`|Xt4n9h40aa	In the beginning, animals and humans in the Garden of Eden were created to eat vegetation.      "And God said, See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the land and every tree with seed in its fruit;  you shall have them for food.  And to all the animals on the earth and to every bird on the air and to everything that creeps on the ground-to everything in which there is the breath of like- I have given every green plant for food.  And it was so." (Genesis 1:29-30 ~ Amplified Bible)    Now, after the flood God changed all that.    "And God pronounced a blessing upon Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.  And the fear of you and the dread and terror of you shall be upon every beast of the land, every bird of the air, all that creeps upon the ground, and upon all the fish of the sea;  they are delivered into your hand.  Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you'  and as I gave you the green vegetables and plants, I give you everything.  But you shall not eat flesh with life of it which is its blood.  And surely for your lifeblood I will require an accounting;  from every beast I will require it'  and from man, from every man [who spills another's lifeblood] I will require a reckoning." (Genesis 9:1-5 ~ Amplified Bible)    So God blessed man with meat and vegetables to eat.  Now if you kill needlessly, regardless of whether man or beast, God will hold you accountable in one way of another.

zCIKCrc7aa	When my grandmother was alive, she always kept her house very insulated and the temp was always very warm.  It was Summer when she passed and my sister and I were assigned to cleaning out the house.  While doing so, we opened a hallway window.  When I started to sweat, I checked the window, noticing it was closed.  It's not the kind of window to slide close on it's own.  So I asked my sister to stop closing it.  She said, I was gonna tell you the same thing because she had just opened it again.  My sister then said out loud, Gramma, stop closing the window!

We call things what we call them for the sake of language understanding.I believe in God.? I come from the approach of where it can be considered logical to expect something greater than us gave us what we have, or at least the ability to progressively create it.? Evolutionary theory makes sense, but does not exclude a beginning creation in some form I feel we cannot possibly be certain of.    Too many events, too much natural order, and too many multi-billion-to-one events point me towards the realization something greater than ourselves is out there.    To say that Christianity is the sole route indicates a petty game I don't think God has material interest in playing.?

I believe in God because he has blessed me in so many ways and I am so greatful to him for that.|`|NFK3A68oaa	I think you're right.  And the evidence seems to side with you.    For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...    Best regards,  Mike|`|VWvI5RyBaa	It's hard to answer because it doesn't come from my head, it comes from my heart.  As for saying it's because my parents told me so, it wouldn't be entirely true.  Yes they told me but I was always odd in my views.  I don't want to offend any Christian but I am a Catholic and as such I went to Church on Good Friday(and still do).  However, even though I was very young, 5 or 6 years old, as much as I felt bad for Jesus, I always felt bad for Judas.

Your kids know nothing about the Lord other than what they have been programmed to say.  You've indoctrinated them.

Liberals think people should be free to express their experience in their own words.    Are you a fundie?  Insufficient data.  Here's a test, Exodus 4.24:    "On the way, at a place where they spent the night, the LORD met [Moses] and tried to kill him. 25 But Zipporah took a flint and cut off her sons foreskin, and touched Moses feet with it, and said, Truly you are a bridegroom of blood to me! 26 So he let [Moses] alone."     Did this really happen?  The Lord tried to kill Moses, but failed?  And he failed because Zipporah did a quick circumcision and touched Moses' feet with her baby's foreskin - this and this alone stopped God from killing the man he has just instructed to set his people free from the Egyptians?    If you insist that this happened, which it must have done because the Bible is the word of God etc etc, you're a fundie.

I  really don't like to call people names or associate them with Animals.    I have even seen snakes  enter into the house of the Lord.    Sheep, lizards, toads, spiders, birds, horseface's,  skunks, jackass's, elephants, hawks, buzzards, swine, beetles, cockroaches, termites, bats, ladybugs, turtles,  vultures, ants, chickens, old crows, wrens, black flies, lice, crabs, green frogs, blood suckers, rats, tit mouses, gopher girls, and last but not least dogs, cats, wessels, ducks, geese, monkeys, baboons, fish heads, mackeral snappers, bloated pot bellied pigs, Guinne Hens,  bulls with their cows.

Their sins "works" are not paid for, so they are expected at judgment to pay for them- with death in Hell. Christian do not need works to go to Heaven. We believe that Jesus paid for our sins, so we will not be included with he dead on judgment day. There will not be any sins on our "record". As for Faith without works- If you believe that Jesus died an excruciating death to save you from Hell, and you have Faith that God- the Creator of the universe takes special interest in you, and listens to your prayers. You will live in a way that pleases him. You will tell others about Him. You will have good works. It happens because of the faith, not because you need works to be a Christian. If you have no good works, you don't really believe- it can't happen.|`|XpaLyWYOaa	Personally I believe as it states in James 2:17-8 that faith without works is dead. However, I think that because some things here and there in the Bible were changed by men to appease people of the time through the dark and middle ages... there were some contradictions and some people have interpreted that grace is the only saving point and that they don't need to try and be good people or obey any commandments. I think it's just laziness and an excuse to not fully commit yourself to one's god. Because there are clearly several scriptural references stating that works is indeed a requirement of salvation.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	You are dealing with two different situations as well as taking verses out of context in order to support a belief.    Revelation 20 is the great white throne judgment. Those being judged are people who have lived and died through out time who do not have their names are not written in the book of life.    The only thing there is to judge them by is their works since they have not accepted Christ.    As to the passage in James.    Notice it says Faith without works by itself is dead. It does not say that works are required for salvation but that if faith does not produce works then it is dead.    What does Christ say about a vine that produces no fruit? It will be cut off and cast into the fire.    Faith is the vine, fruit is the works. They go together but if one is there without the other then it is useless.    Works can not save you. If they could then you could boast you have saved yourself.    Ephesians 2 8- 9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God 9not by works, so that no one can boast.|`|hTmKHWcPaa	Excellent question!  Salvation is by faith in Jesus Christ as YOUR substitute on the bloody cross at Calvary - You and I were condemned to die but, He took your (and my) place to be a perfect 'blood sacrifice' to the Father, to atone for your (and my) sins. (refer to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament to understand blood sacrifices) This is reconciling you and me to God the Father (formerly we could not approach). The divine exchange that occurred at the cross is too awesome to clearly understand. Your salvation is by FAITH in Jesus as the son of God and our substitute on the cross, plus nothing. After salvation having received so wonderful a gift you and I are motivated to mature and work in His behalf. He works through the mature Christian to bless a third party. God works through people to bless people. No on can earn salvation through works. There is one door only into paradise, and that door is Christ Jesus; no alternative.    Quoted from the Scofield Bible Commentary  Rev 20:12    judged     The final judgment. The subjects are the "dead."   As the redeemed were raised from among the dead one thousand years before (Rev_20:5) and have been in glory with Christ during that period,   the "dead" can only be the wicked dead, from the beginning to the setting up of the great white throne in space.   As there are degrees of punishment (Luk_12:27); (Luk_12:48) the dead are judged according to their works.   The book of life is there to answer such as plead their works for justification, for example (Mat_7:22); (Mat_7:23) an awful blank where the name might have been.     References from above:     Rev 20:5  But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.     Luk 12:26  Then if you are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest? Luk 12:27  Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not labor, nor do they spin, but I say to you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these. Luk 12:28  But if God so dresses the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much rather you, little-faiths? Luk 12:29  And you, do not seek what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, and stop being in anxiety.  [ Christians are commanded not to be anxious, which reflects a lack of faith in God taking care of them. This is one example of Gods taking care of little things how much more will He care for His sons and daughters in-Christ, true Christians.]    Luk 12:48  But he not knowing, and doing things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few.   And everyone given much, much will be demanded from him. And to whom much was deposited, more exceedingly they will ask of him.  [added: each judged according to his works or evil deeds]     Mat 7:21  Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of Heaven,   but the ones who do the will of My Father in Heaven. (added: i.e., false Christians in the local church)   Mat 7:22  Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power? Mat 7:23  And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; "depart from Me, those working lawlessness!" Psa. 6:8  Mat 7:20  ..surely from their fruits you shall know them.

For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father." The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. (Romans 8:13-16)     John 12:48-"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."    2 Corinthians 5:10-"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."  Romans 2:1-13 Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. (2) And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things. (3) But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God? (4) Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? (5) But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, (6) who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS: (7) to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life; (8) but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation. (9) There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek, (10) but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. (11) For there is no partiality with God. (12) For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law; (13) for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.|`|macZI2dzaa	Neither Revelation 20 nor James 2 are written concerning how one gains salvation.   Rather, Romans is a treatise on salvation.  See Romans 4, Abraham believed in God, and God accounted that faith as righteousness.  Abraham was justified by faith, prior to his works.  His works, as ours are just a response.  Ephesians 2.8,9 states, "By grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, so that no one can boast."|`|v7Wflu78aa	I don't know much about Christianity, but my understanding is that in Judaism living a righteous life, living according to the rules, is what gets a Jew "written in the book of life."

The other works besides that are compared to chaff and straw, and are said to be thrown into the fire and burned(they mean absolutely nothing). there is no way you can work enough to get salvation, but it doesn't mean that any good works you do don't mean anything, just that they are nothing compared to Christ.|`|qKSn0AVsaa	Because those people are lazy,and just want to fit their faiths around their lifestyles rather than accomplishing God's will and do what he requires.|`|xTcjL7a5aa	Paul is the one who started the whole faith without works thing when he was trying to do away with Judaic restrictions concerning Circumcision and dietary regulations.

When we have faith in Jesus' salvation we are also motivated to live our lives according to God's will. We will all fall short and not one of us could be saved without Jesus' gift of salvation, his grace.    Many think that all "good" people will go to heaven, but the two have to be there, both the faith and the works.  And conversely someone can insist they are Christian and saved because they believe Jesus died for them but their actions and words contradict that.    And I even had a retired man stumped on this one in Sunday school once. He thought that since he was a Christian and that his works were good he didn't have to go through judgment but that's not what the bible says.  He said he didn't believe we were judged. I said, too bad that's not what the bible says.  And in a few weeks he came back and said all this time, he never realized that because of his Sunday school teachers said differently. Well Sunday school lessons for children are watered down so as to not give the kid's nightmares. It's important that we as adults all make sure we know exactly what the bible says.    So I applaud your efforts of getting the information out there for those who don't realize that we all will be judged and that the proof of our faith lies in our works.|`|L1HVLylMaa	They are mistaken    It is as you say|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	It is very clear to me, that Jesus is telling us that works are important.  Why would there be so many verses of the Bible that speak of "obedience," "doing good," having behaviors that are kind, loving, charitable, and on and on if "doing" were not important.      Being Christian is all about doing and having works.   If they were not important, they would not be commanded.    There would be no point in doing them.  But because there are different and "many mansions" in heaven, the doctrine of being judged and having different kingdoms and levels in heaven becomes so clear.    We all receive life eternal due to the love and grace of Christ.  We are judged and assigned a kingdom due to our works.   Its all there in the Bible.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	Maybe you misunderstand the point. We say works are not required for salvation. It does not mean that works are not important. Indeed they are important.     For starters, they are an indicator of being saved. For another, we are rewarded for works. If we don't do any works, we are like one escaping the flames:    Salvation is the foundation:  1Co 3:11  For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.    Works are added to the foundation for rewards:  1Co 3:12-15  If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,  (13)  his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.  (14)  If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.  (15)  If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.    So, yes, we are judged according to works. Who made it to heaven though?   Rev 20:15  If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.    Not if they did works, but if their name was found in the book of life.    Also, like James 2:17 says, "Faith without works is dead". I do not ignore that. If I have faith, I do works. The works do not save though.    Why do Mormon's ignore Ephesians 2:8-10?    P.S. Nick from Utah - regarding, Notice, it didn't say "blessings in heaven" after already being saved, but instead talked about "salvation".    The faith saves. The works are proof that a person has faith. The works don't save. It's like a sheep goes "baa" and it's evidence for being a sheep. If I go "baa" it doesn't make me a sheep though.|`|y8yLVQJnaa	Just talking with Evangelical Protestants, they usually point out that Revelations 20 mentions "books" and also another book, the "book of life".  Usually they just rationalize that those who had faith are in the book of life, while those who didn't have faith were judged by their works to eternal hell by "the books".    The part about "faith alone" that doesn't sit well with me using the Bible is James chapter 2, both verses 14 and 24.    The context of James 2 starts out by saying some will pick and choose which commandments they'll follow and which ones they won't.  Then verse 14 says, "...though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith 'save' him?"    Notice, it didn't say "blessings in heaven" after already being saved, but instead talked about "salvation".    Then the next ten verses gives examples.    Verse 24 says, "Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."    I always notice how it doesn't say that faith is justified by our works, but that we're justified by both works and faith.    Then Evangelical Protestants use verses from the letters of Paul where he says, "We're saved by Grace through faith, and not works."  Paul also uses this saying a few times in his letters to various groups of people, but he alternates between "and not works", "and not the Law", "and not the deeds of the Law", etc.  There are many scholars who believe he was talking about the Law of Moses.  Paul also never ever even says "faith alone".  In the Book of Mormon, it says that no matter how hard we try, we'll all fall short.  The BoM says we can't save ourselves, and that we need help from our savior and redeemer, Jesus Christ.  In another part of the BoM it says we're saved by Grace after all we can do, which sounds consistent with the various parts of the Bible.  Whenever it says faith is important in the Bible, it never says "faith alone", and LDS prophets say that true faith is followed by works.  So we can't rule out good works coming forth.  Throughout the Bible, it talks about becoming a better person and obedience.    Although it doesn't say it's directly related to salvation, I have always enjoyed John 7:17, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself."  Regardless of the context of the chapter, the concept is the same.  Just because Jesus said to be obedient in one chapter doesn't mean that it's okay to be disobedient everywhere else in time.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	man I had the whole interpretation for you and then I touched a button somewhere and it all disappeared off my screen, you wouldn;t have cared anyways and I am not gonna take the time to rewrite the whole thing again.  james is talkign about getting a reward for you that is the celestial kingdom, for us that means gettign saved is a fre gift and if we wanta reward we must SUFFER on top of doing the will of the lord, miormons don't get suffering for their reward.

And, by the way it is found in the Book of Mormon. We are saved by GRACE after everything we can DO. So when the bible says we are saved by Grace that is true. When the bible says we are saved by works that is true. Repentence only works, through grace. We really don't have to pay for sins (bad works) that we repented from and had deep sorrow for. However, after we repent, then what mansion we obtain is by the quantity and quality of our works. Our Father is fair, and that is the only fair thing to do. If the world understood the bible and the prophets (at least 2 of them) wrote about the Celestial, Terrestial and one equal to the stars, he was talking of the places we will live after the resurrection. This will be the result of our works. We still will not deserve totally what we are given, and that part is the GIFT or GRACE.|`|AA10031161	The problem is that the Bible is rather contradictory on this (among many) topic.    Are we saved through grace or works? My personal belief is both- we must have faith that although my "works" are required, they will never be enough alone to save me. I must have faith that Someone else is there who has promised that His payment will make my work enough.      Thankfully, we can trust one passage- James 1:5- to help us clarify anything in the Bible.

Matthew 28:19,20  He also commanded them to love one another and by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love among yourselves.John 13:34.35    So faith and works walk hand in hand.

Isaiah 9:6 John 5:28,29    Many people believe we will stand up in front of God on the day of judgement and he will either give us life or condemnation.  The Bible brings out after the resurrection we will have 1000 years under God's Kingdom to live and prove our works then the last judgement will come and Satan will be let loose a little while.

I've tried.|`|rytl3lYiaa	i think it can be said for both groups, but i hate the ones that wont listen to reason or force there beliefs onto others, even going as far as mocking them in their opinion of their reglion|`|DQjAGWXQaa	I'm not mean just very witty.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	I respond in kind.    If someone asks a respectful genuine question, that's the type of answer I give.    If someone asks a spiteful loaded question meant to mock and taunt, that's the type of answer I give.    And yes, as an earlier poster pointed out, there's a time to be nice and respectful, but we also can't just sit back and let the religious force their beliefs on us and everyone else (creationism, gay rights, etc).    The problem is that some believers think that not wanting creationism taught in biology classrooms of public secular schools is on par with suppression and discrimination and censorship, or that by stating that you disagree with their religion, you're insulting them.|`|yoKHoKXjaa	You sound like an agnostic not an atheist. lol    Grow a pair!|`|rTkqpATpaa	You seem to be confusing not believing and stating that with being mean.|`|ehmeG65gaa	very much so.

You gonna finish that baby?|`|r3sg5Xsdaa	Wait aren't those atheists suppose to be educating us?  Giving us some well deserved truth that we need to hear?  Honestly, all atheists say basically the same thing about religion, God, and especially Christians. The only difference is that some say it nice and respectfully and some say it crude and mean.  Still the overall opinion is still the same.    So I don't get why you are, I guess embarrassed, by what those "mean atheists" are saying to people of faith.      So I am asking you, do you have an issue with the content and context,  or the way that the content or context is delivered?  ______  What? Someone disagrees.  There is a collection of atheists here and maybe more that feel that christians should be ridiculed, mocked, belittled, and even feared. Patterns mean everything too, not just first impressions.|`|g4TWs4YUaa	It's sad.

Yeah, you don't have a religion we get it! Im now glad you stoped me and showed me that there is ONE atheist with tolerance! I have a friend who is Hindu and when she talks about her religion, I just politely listen. I USED to think, can't atheists do that?!?            THANKS|`|RDxbbCHwaa	I am glad there are atheists like you. I think most atheists do in fact see things your way, but just like with any other group it's the loud angry minority that screws it up for everyone else.    I am a Christian and I get very frustrated about the extreme members of my chosen religion who go around claiming their superiority while the rest of the world is beneath them. It makes it very difficult for me to openly discuss my faith without being labeled an ingorant closed-minded kook. I welcome opportuinities to engage in a peaceful discussions with people about my beliefs and theirs. I've done this before with my friends and we've been able to respectfully disagree and not ruin our relationships.    To me I don't think it's which particular faith (or none) that you allign yourself to that's the important thing. Let's be honest: no one knows what the right answer is if there even is one. But we choose our beliefs because much of our life is about the pursuit of answers to the meaning of life and the reasons behind the universe.    Jesus Christ is my answer. Allah is another person's answer. Life simply is is an atheist's answer. Whatever gives you the most comfort and lets you live your life is fine with me. Just let me have mine and I'll have no trouble letting you have yours.    Blessings.

God even turned his back from Jesus at the Cross when he was crucified because of the sins that Jesus carried with him.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Whenever you sin, immediately confess to Him and then repent (change your ways). He will FORGET those sins!    He lives and longs to forgive you hon!

Where do you think you would be then ?  Sin is Sin no matter what it is...and it separates you from HIm and its you doing it not Him..be Thankful he is a Forgiving God..and will when you Repent forgive you. BUT HE also expects us to grow in Him and lay aside every weight and sin that so easily besets us...other words YOU have to grow up and put sin behind...and Stop doing it !!|`|JyAUAbsjaa	you worry way too much.

That is NOT true.     All saved believers are still sinners.  Everyone of us that is saved, will sin until we are with the Lord.      Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|TzY9vkinaa	Where did you read that???|`|a5Z1xfejaa	God is a myth. I'm telling you since you're young and naive.

He always listens to your heart. so if you mean it then he listens.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	I have three children six grand children and three grate grand children they can not do anything that I will not for give nor would I ever stop loving them.

It's funny how we look at God and feel that ooppps we goofed. To late now...we're gonna burn forever. But what we are not understanding is that God is the only one that is perfect. He knows that we are going to try and goof up. He knows that we are going to need to ask him to forgive us. He knows that we are fearful of not getting to Heaven.   He wants us to know that he is always with you. What was so interesting about what you said is.....Sometimes you say a prayer THEN ask God's forgiveness....What a wonderful testiment to your Lord. You talk to him about your day, you acknowledge him then you let him know that you need help. Every morning during your devotional ask God to walk with you thru out your day. Each night let God know how your day went and ask him how you could have handled a situation better. Girl...you are so on the right track and you didn't even realize it|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	God cannot look upon sin.  He loves the sinner, but not the sin.

Never stop believing in that. :)|`|f647EG9raa	When you accept Jesus as your Savior, all of your sins are forgiven. This means any sins you have before becoming a Christian and any that you will commit in the future are all erased. God sees those that believe in His Son as pure and blameless. He will never turn His back on any of His believers.  However, a Christian can turn from God when they sin and lose fellowship with Him. But never their salvation. And God will restore that Christian back to Him.|`|q6KmVWS1aa	God does not turn His back on anyone, people turn their backs on God.  If you ask for forgiveness and don't do the same sin-God forgives.  Yes, God still hears your prayers, and He will always care for you.  He said "I'll never leave thee, nor forsake thee" God is a forgiving God.  He loves us all the same, no matter what sin we have done in the past, He expects us, not to repeat the same sin.  remember: the flesh is weak, and by praying we can ask God to help us be over comers of sins!    He will always watch over you, He is the Good Shepherd, and the Good Shepherd never turns his back on His Sheep. We are the sheep!|`|in769nQPaa	Dont care about sins lifes nothing if you cant sin

Rn4GXoJAaa	I have seen some of the most hard-core atheists break down bawling and turning to Christ.    I have also seen very good Christians fall away, usually as a result of a compromise brought on by fear (ie stuff like, If I don't date non-christians, i will never find a mate, etc)    I think it goes both ways.      Edit: Of course, if by Christian you mean every sap who marks "Christian" on the census, then of course they fall away much, much quicker. I am assuming you mean actual "serious" christians.    As for statistics, I don't know, but I do know this:    Almost all Christians are saved BEFORE the age of 18 (something like 95% I think), and almost all Christian who "fall away" will fall away between the ages of 19-22 (college). Don't remember where I read that, but it is certainly true.      Edit again: I don't think this is the version I read, but this is a similar study:    86% of Christians today were saved before the age of 15.  10% of Christians today were saved between the ages of 15 and 30.  4% of Christians today were saved after 30 years of age.

How could someone be born Christian, born with the knowledge of God? (Apart from Jesus)    Poor argument I know but I will suggest that atheists never knew God in the first instance therefore could not fall away from God or convert.

AA11399548	The doctrine of resurrection says that the body that dies is the body that is raised. If you are male or female, that is what you will be in heaven. Christ was raised and still a man, and he returned to heaven intact. The Bible says we will be as he is, fully ourselves. We rise as we died but we rise glorified, no longer dying, no longer engaging physical sin. We will not procreate in heaven however, since Jesus said as much, but the Bible says nothing about heavenly sex. We just don't know, but if something is that good on earth, I can't imagine it (or something like it) won't be even moreso. We may regard one another physically more the way children do, without lust or embarrassment. That's just a guess though, since the Bible doesn't say, but if nothing wrong, bad, and evil exists there, then all the problems we have with our sexual culture will be absent.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Since we are going to be the bride of Christ, we will not be marrying each other etc.We will be serving and worshiping only our God,  and there is no need to be male or female.

Well still believing in that, you don't go physically then what are you becoming there? You're not human anymore... Well still you have hope to be happy, but could you really be happy knowing that half of your loved ones could be burning in hell... isn't it a little bit selfish, and if you are supposed to be happy you won't remember then, so what makes you think that you're gonna be yourself...     Isn't heaven too stupid to believe in it..|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	The Bible clearly says that you will always be you.

F4IjI9qaaa	First, I don't believe in Hell as an actual place where Satan torments you for ever. But that's another issue.    I would say that we bring punishment upon ourselves. There are consequences to every action we take and word we utter. The wise will experience their punishment and chose to learn from the experience. The unwise will also experience their punishment but for various reasons, chose to repeat the offending action and inevitable punishment. Kind of like the guy who choses a 12 step program or the guy who choses to shoot up again. The drug addict is serving an eternal damnation, don't you think? One of his own making - not of God's mean-spiritedness.|`|hQDapmICaa	It shows that no matter what you say, HE will do what HE has promised to do. You can't tempt HIM with foolish questions like this.     He is JUST and LOVING.    Why do you worry about HELL so much? Why can't you focus on HEAVEN?    Why can't you praise HIM for willing to forgive us of all our sins?    The DEVIL knows his fate. Why are you fighting for the DEVIL? Speak for God.    Peace!|`|QANyxTAJaa	Knowing, believing that you will be punished for doing wrong is also an aid to help you grow in the right direction.   Hell can make people seek God. Then we can grow into a relationship that would not have existed if it were not for the fear of Gods wrath when we were at a  weaker & less spiritual point. It can help bring you to a point that you would not give up even if there were no hell.  An adult who is a child of God is capable of a lot more responsibility than a child of our own. We are perfectly capable of understanding right and wrong and all God wants us to know. God does discipline Christians while they are on earth for the sake of growing. It is written that hell was made for the Devil and his angels. It is your choice if you choose to take the same path they are on or not.   Even though you have done Him wrong if you come to Him and want to make it right He will allow it. That is what makes Him loving and forgiving. The fact that He allows even those who denied Him to have blessings while on earth makes Him merciful. The fact that the world still exist today is evidence that He is patient with sinners ,wanting to give them a chance. It is written that He does not desire any to perish. Still God and evil do not, can not mix. He has given us a way to get rid of it, a way to make things right. A piece of Him, His only Son died in our place, our Lord Jesus Christ.   God is not a big fluffy push over, but He is a very generous and mighty Father. I feel safe under His strong, never wavering, never changing wing. God is love, hell is for those who dont accept His love.|`|vOuSZnKxaa	Punishment may be intended to teach, but most parents don't have a clue as to what they're actually teaching their child by punishing it.    All punishment does is teach your child what your reaction will be if they do certain actions.

For most of our history we have looked at it as an end in itself, however, relatively recently we have come to think of it in terms of a deterrent and as a way of teaching. Many religions have not yet caught up to this concept, although, in some ways the medieval idea of purgatory was a bit more advanced in that it allowed "working off your sin".    Very true, God as a parent fails big time in His approach to parenting and punishment.|`|KlXUrxBfaa	Discipline teaches, that is by example, punishment is when discipline does not work, if it does not work it is because the example was not good enough.|`|NDTLeIUKaa	as a Catholic, what you describe is purgatory in our belief system.  God does not get the satisfaction of knowing that anyone who did not follow him will be in pain forever?  However, purgatory cleanses the misdoer before going to God.  However, some people are just pure evil, and they are the ones sent to HEll. To most of them, hell is home, so no real punishment.  To some, yes, they will realize that they don't belong there, but it will be too late.  But that's just our Coo-Coo Catholic belief system.  Protestants don't believe in purgatory, so I don't know their answer.

If the Pope became physically or mentally incapacitated then the College of Cardinals could meet and declare that he no longer has control of his faculties and is therefore impeded in his office.     This would then open the way to elect a new Pope.    This possibility was discussed at the end of Pope John Paul II's life while he was suffering from Parkinson's Disease.

He is elected by the College of Cardinals, a group of people named by earlier popes to serve in the capacity of leadership of the church. The Pope is usually selected from this group, but any Roman Catholic could be named Pope.    Once named, the Pope becomes the head bishop of the church. Originally the Pope began as the Bishop of Rome, but as the church became more centralized and powerful, the Pope was treated as the monarch that ruled the church. Thus, just like the kings of Europe, the Pope rules until either he dies or resigns from the post.

Jesus is the head of man, man is the head of woman. A true christian man demonstrates his headship in a loving manner, as does Jesus, over him. He does nothing to oppress or abuse. He loves his wife, and takes her feelings into consideration in all matters. She does not do direct teaching in the congregation, because she recognizes that this is his responsibility. He also has the responsibility to teach his own family, so that's why it says she should ask him at home. There should already be a regular bible study with his family in place.   The bible says that much teaching is done by a large army of women, so she is not prevented from sharing her love of God, but not directly to the congregation. She teaches her children, and others she comes in contact with, because when she was baptized, she became ordained to preach. She has a huge part in sharing the good news, because as a rule, women are more teachable, and have a keener interest in other people.  I appreciate my husbands direction and headship in our family. I feel safe, and cared for, even tho if I had to, I could care for things myself. I have done it for years, before I met him. God's directive to women is not oppressive, except to those who find a christian lifestyle too confining. I don't, but understand how some might. I find the guidelines in the bible a safeguard for myself and my family.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	They make this atheist angry as well.

God taught that the "..head of man is Christ ..and the head of the woman is man.."  Paul writting to the Corinthians was addressing a certain situation in the church at Corinth.  He is advising the women to ask their "head" (their husbands) about things they did not understand rather than interrupting the meeting by asking there.  Now that is harsh as per today's standards but you have to read the rest of Pauls letter to get to full intent of his order.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I, for one, am not angry.

But it's clear now that you are proud and wilful and will not be corrected.    One last time, then; the verses don't make me angry, or upset me in any way. The misunderstanding of them, which comes from a mixture of lazy christians not bothering to do proper bible study, bad traditions of translation, and deliberately mysogynistic preaching, is what makes some of us angry, because it's done in defiance of God's word, which expects us to study the scriptures, and to make real efforts to transmit them accurately to other languages, and to abide by scripture as a whole.    Taken as a whole, Scripture simply isn't ambiguous on this issue. Someone here has already mentioned Priscilla and Aquila. You've been pointed many times to Romans 16. There are other passages and themes that Christians have pointed out to you. You have not responded with reasoned argument to any of these attempts to correct you. You have shown no basic courtesy in your repetitions of the questions, only accusations of disobedience.    As I've said before, we can only speculate on your motives, but they are at best, horribly misguided and based on ignorance. I believe the only possible conclusions we can draw now are either that you are so proud that you prefer wilful ignorance and disobedience, rather than submission to scripture, or that you are deliberately trolling, that is, asking questions without a sincere desire for the answers, but out of a desire to stir up anger and dissension. I don't know of a bible translation that uses the word 'trolling', though I suspect it will not be long before we have it, because it's the perfect word in contemporary English for the idea of 'stirring up dissension', which is what you seem to be doing.    I think if you want a biblical response to your obsessive questioning, you should look at Paul's condemnation of dissension, in, for instance, Romans 13 v. 13, or Galatians 5 v. 20. In future, when I see your 'questions', I will be following the advice of 2 Timothy v. 23, "Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels." and Titus 3 v. 9, "avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless."|`|2WnbP80Taa	God gives the to anger when it is righteous-Just as Jesus was 'angry' at the money changers and overthrew their tables and then cleansed the temple.

Women are thought to talk a lot, gossipping, etc., with their friends.  We still think that way!  It has been suggested that Paul is saying that women should not chit-chat in church - they should pay attention to the liturgy, and not hold conversations with each other.    To suggest that he is saying that a woman should never say anything in church is silly.  Many house churches of his day were led by women, and women church leaders are even named in the bible.  Kind of hard to lead a service if you don't say anything!  However, it is also rude to talk to your neighbours in church, when it disrupts what is going on.|`|QL0FOQMmaa	The verses don't make any Christians angry that I'm aware of. If anything, what some might find annoying is how others do not use the Scriptures in the context that God through Paul intended them and do not try to understand them in the full counsel of God's Word, but rather use them to oppress women in particular the same way that many used to use Scripture out of its context to justify oppressing black people. Paul was correcting a matter, as there was disorder and chaos in the meetings in the Church of Corinth. He was restoring order.  He was not forbidding women to speak. If we look just a few verses later, He speaks of women having their heads covered while prophesying. Can't prophesy, if you're not allowed to speak.  "Prophesying" is not limited to speaking prophetic words, either. Prophesy also means to teach. Priscilla taught (even corrected actually) Apollos. Priscilla was the wife of Aquilla. They were in ministry together, and held church meetings in their home.|`|WN4gHMLQaa	This is the views of society back in that time. It does not reflect Christianity, it's just how things were, obviously they ahve changed.|`|oGRsxfBiaa	I think it is because many atheists (and many Christians as well who don't bother with researching what these verses actually mean) use them to discriminate against women or go on a conquest to prove how terrible Christianity is, in the case of many atheists.     Here is some background information about these: Back in those times men and women sat in church separately. This particular church which is being talked about in that verse had a problem with noisy women who would ask their husbands questions about what is being taught across the room and interrupt the teacher. The passage you posted is how Paul suggests that church can resolve that issue, because it does not simply say that women should be silent in church, but that if they do come up with any questions they should wait until they get home to ask their husbands about it, for very practical reasons - i.e. not interrupting the teacher.

LLey4VRzaa	I'll let God answer this for you...    Genesis 7:1 The Lord then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. 2 Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, 3 and also seven of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	looking at some answers one person said there was seven of each animal.  i was told there was 2 at school!  as an athiest, this is a huge difference and a major, major contradiction. my guess is, the original said 2.  then people like u asked this kind of question and so it was changed at some point to seven?  here we go, changing the original story to able to answer questions.      is this the word of god then?  should his word be changed?    how can u spot a lie?  ok, simple, the more a person lies the more he contradicts what he said in the beginning.  his story will change as he tries to make it fit into reality, when there is no place for it.      noah may have been real, the flood may have happened.  but now the changing story is entirely different the original and is no longer valid.  christians have shot themselves in the foot.      and with so many contradictions such as this, is it any wonder why so many people will not believe?  they must say that if the story is now a contradiction, then was the original even true?    wow, the person above me nanny411 is saying that god made all the animals herbivours.  where did she hear that?  is she christian?  my point about contradiction has clearly been proven.  she has just changed the entire story to make herself beleive it was possible.    actually, the contradictions within each religion and between others is half the reason the world CANNOT unite!  religion is a thorn in the side of humanity.|`|M18zTiuvaa	I dont take that story literally, actually. It seems most likely that the flood was local, and judging from what Noah would have known about geography, it probably did seem like the whole world to him.   When you think about the fact that over a million land animals have been named, I highly doubt they could all fit into one boat. And of course each animal would be sensitive to climate and altitude changes. All that jazz.

AA11923447	If any scientists, atheists or otherwise, built a time machine, I'd definitely be interested in it. Who wouldn't? Why stop with Genesis? I want to know the answers to all of the many questions that a time machine might be able to provide  answers to. If they were to discover that the material in Genesis was mythological, so be it.

Get with it people!|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	Time travel for that purpose would defeat the purpose for one main reason... IF God does exist, he knows what you are about to do. He is not constrained by time as we are, therefor he is past, present, future. With that said, when you arrived in that time period with the intent to come back and say "Hey it's true", for the sake of everyone, he'd probably make you unable to travel back somehow. So it would be pointless.|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well the fact that you were actually sent to the past would be speculative. If they had the power to do that chances are they would also have the power to create the illusion of time travel. It would be very difficult to prove or disprove whether you were actually traveling through time or to an alternated state of time. On top of that it is said that the Genesis could be metaphorical or using a different numbering system than we currently use so it would be very difficult to prove anything. I personally think that if a person takes the Genesis literally that they will probably be disappointed, but that doesn't discredit the bible it just discredits peoples common view of the bible and its real message. All it does is discredit the way people perceive and interpret the bible. I don't think anyone really knows the true message of the bible because it is so cluttered with different languages, which have words that can be broadly translated, therefore distort the message. On top of that many of us weren't around during the time the scriptures were written so we have a hard time knowing whether some of the stories are metaphoric or actual. There is nothing wrong with stories being metaphorical but it is hard to decipher the bibles real message if you don't know the truth from metaphor. So to me if they made a time machine it wouldn't really matter to me because I have learned to not take the bible so literally. I think what is most important in the bible is the moral message not necessarily the characters, places, or time frames. Knowing whether or not Genesis actually happened like the bible said it did wouldn't really solve any of our own problems. It may solve whether or not Genesis happened but it wouldn't solve the fact that we like to waste our time fighting over subjects like this.
HVM5aXa8aa	No, it isn't like in movies or like witches you dress up as on halloween (which are not in any way based in reality btw).      Wicca is a Pagan religion which is primarily about a relationship with the gods. Wiccans hold rituals and observe holidays in honor of and to communicate with the gods, just as a Christian goes to church to worship their God.  Many Wiccans are not interested in witchcraft, though the practice is not condemned by the religion, so many Wiccans also practice witchcraft.     Here is a good link about Wicca, directed at an audience such as yourself, who knows nothing about the religion. http://wicca.timerift.net/wicca101/index...|`|FmazIF6Maa	Wicca (two c's).    Wicca is primarily a religion honoring the Creator of the Universe in the masculine (God) and feminine (Goddess) form.     Yes, most Wiccans do practice Witchcraft.     But Witchcraft is nothing like the pretend fantasy stuff perpetuated around Halloween, or in shows like Charmed or books like Harry Potter.    Witchcraft is burning an orange candle and meditating when you want to pass a test, or making an herbal tea and asking for blessings on it when you want to heal your sore throat.     I'm not sure what you hear, but I do know the things I hear people say are not true, like:  - Wiccans worship the creation, not the creator  - Witches call demons to do their bidding and worship Satan  - Witches hex and curse people and send evil spirits after them  - Witches sacrifice animals and have blood rituals|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, your best bet to learn about it is to read about it. There are hundreds of books on the topic, and it's the best way to get a large amount of info in a short amount of time.   In general, Wicca is an earth based religion, and is primarily polytheistic. Most Wiccans are nice, upstanding people, nothing scary or anything like that. And witchcraft is nothing like Harry Potter or Charmed.   But like I said, easiest way si to go read about it.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	Not to be rude, at least that's not my intention.    But...read a book or two.

ehBPus3Zaa	It just means that God will not destroy the world by  massive flooding of the whole earth again. He put the rainbow in the sky as a reminder to Noah and his family that He would honor this. And we have it today to remind us of that promise. He was sorrowful of having to destroy all of His creation except Noah and his family, of whom was the only people that God found worthy of being saved from destruction because they worshiped Him and kept His commands.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	He simply promises us that He will never flood the earth again - it was an awful thing|`|1bJ6KV0paa	they like death, rape, murder and destruction.|`|OZAxA6J5aa	Well, I really don't know why God decided to promise He wouldn't destroy the world again with another flood. Maybe it was to sooth all the scared people who had survived the flood.     I really don't see much meaning in it though. So God won't destroy the world with a flood. That only leaves 84,832 other ways for Him to destroy the world.

Btw, Vids are so much better.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I would not consider it cheating, but clearly you are not happy about him doing it, so talk to him about it.  One thing you have to consider is that men are pretty much obsessed with sex, even if they're good Christian men - they just hide it better.  Even though you don't like him looking at playboy, I really think that you should take comfort in the fact that he is just looking at some pictures (at the very worst - he might actually be reading the articles, which would be better, right?). At least he's not looking at real live women, and he's not actually cheating on you. Maybe you're better off letting him keep the magazines?|`|2rJwgk40aa	No.Looking at a picture doesnt constitue cheating.  every guy has looked at porn at one time or another,some women have too.It's healthy as long as you dont go overboard with it(Example.He looses interest in other activities because hed rather look at porn)    People are saying they arent real women,because many of those women have had boobs jobs,botox,and tons of other plastic surgery.Plus,the pictures are air brushed.So,in a sense,they are not real women.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	no they are pictures you cant cheat on your gf or fiance or wife with a pictures

RKLv4agEaa	From my World Religions class, I learned that Hindus have millions of gods and goddesses, but they believe that all worship and praise travels through their favorite god/goddess, and goes to the Brahman.  Which is like their Supreme God.      Ancient Egyptians believed in many different gods/goddesses, but I don't know the exact number.  Isis, Osiris, Horus....
AA11091234	Growing up I thought it was my fault (not feeling god's presence).   My brother told me it was all crap (& after a few years of struggling, I finally let go of my "what if I'm wrong" fear).    Edit:  There was even a time that I was angry with my brother (for vocalizing his non-belief), even though I didn't feel any kind of presence.    So I'd say "No"   No feeling, doesn't necessarily mean no belief, unfortunately.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Probably not.     The only thing I can offer for my reason as believing in God and Goddess is that I can sense/feel them, and that others have before me for millenia in some way or form.|`|02eopur0aa	Sensing and feeling are two different things....feelings can take you down a long winding road and could devastate your faith...believing and trusting are crucial to ones faith...it's time in the word and practice what it teaches...you'll know GODS' presence!|`|0fYzvVk2aa	I fully believe it's possible to believe in God without feeling His presence.

It's like asking me if I feel that my dad is alive and well in La.  My answer would be "I know he is since I just talked to him this morning.  Feelings don't have anything to do with it."    I strongly agree with OM, above me:  feelings are good, but they're not the hallmark of God's presence -- just like lack of "warm fuzzies" isn't the hallmark of God's absence.    Those feelings are your body's reaction to God's presence, but not a reliable indicator of it.|`|AA11723247	There is nothing in the Bible that says anything about your feelings with regard to faith.  Faith is a choice.  You are, however, promised peace and joy when you place your faith in Christ.|`|7GSDgniJaa	Feelings is different from faith. Even if you're not really sure, its ok, cuz feelings are just emotions. It's temporary. The devil can change your feelings by throwing you a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Thomas didnt believe and he said he would only believe God if he touched him. I've never felt God's presence after i accepted him. But that moment, i actually chose to jump off a cliff.|`|mptnpn9maa	I believe to feel God is to be a Spiritual person. Someone who keeps their faith without a sense of God's presence may be Religious - keep to a doctrine, obey the scriptures and observe the customs and traditions, but that person is not necessarily spiritual, which really means to be keenly aware and able to feel the spirit of God's presence.|`|AA10130895	the goddess is a invisible energy field    so how can one [feel gods presence]?    what they feel is a emotional energy which is not god    you can how ever feel your self expanding [ one with everything ]

TzY9vkinaa	Of course. He studied it regularly when he was trying to find which church to join, in fact the verse that started it all was   James 1: 5    5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.      You did not prove your point, please go back to my last question and answer it.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	You know he did.  Your point is probably going to be pointing how much of the Book of Mormon supports and echoes the Bible.  So I'll give you a link that answers that, though I'm sure you won't agree, at least it will give insight about this.    In any case, he grew up on the Bible, it was the only book (like many pioneers) that he had access to.  Illiterate doesn't mean he couldn't read... only that he didn't have formal education and didn't have many opportunities to read.  No great library or something.  The Bible is about the only book he had access to.  His mom read them the Bible from the time they were very young every night, from what I've read.    Add:  BTW, here's something to consider.  Since the only real book that most people would have been familiar with would be the bible, Joseph Smith would have had to be a COMPLETE IDIOT to just chug and plug verses from the bible into it.  As the site I pointed out shows, the differences between the bible verses and the book of mormon verses tend to be very significant as a proof of the book of mormon.    Oh... and the "book of the Hebrews" not only doesn't match up with the book of Mormon (I've read them both...), there's very little reason to believe that Joseph Smith had access to it.  Instead of believing everything you read on the Internet, do a little more unbiased research.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	He lived in New York and it was 1800's I am sure there was a copy or two about.

However, I have studies all sects of religion. The answer to your question is most certainly YES!  The first Bible translated into the English grammar was in 1611.

I have a 1611 translation.  It is very difficult to read.  In that time some of the letters were not sounded like they are today.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Obviously. He lifted some pretty long passages directly from it.|`|V2IJHt94aa	No.  He and his family were forbidden by law from accessing the Bible.  But he had circus folk smuggle in verses in his alphabet soup.|`|a8kAassWaa	The Mormon religion, also known as Latter Day Saints (LDS), was founded less than two hundred years ago by a man named Joseph Smith. He claimed to have received a personal visit from God the Father and Jesus Christ who told him that all churches and their creeds were an abomination. Joseph set out to impose a brand-new religion that claims to be the only true church on earth. The problem with Mormonism is that it contradicts, modifies, and expands on the Bible. Christians have no reason to believe that the Bible is not true and adequate. To truly believe in and trust God means to believe in His Word. And all Scripture is inspired by God, which means it comes from Him (2 Timothy 3:16).    Mormons believe that there are in fact four sources of divinely inspired words, not just one. 1) The Bible as far as it is translated correctly. Which verses are incorrectly translated is not always made clear. 2) The Book of Mormon, which was translated by Smith and published in 1830. Smith claimed it is the most correct book on earth, and that a person can get closer to God by following its precepts than by any other book. 3) The Doctrine and Covenants, which is considered scripture by Mormons, containing a collection of modern revelations regarding the Church of Jesus Christ as it has been restored. 4) The Pearl of the Great Price, which is considered by Mormons to clarify doctrines and teachings that were lost from the Bible and adds its own information about the earth's creation.    Mormons believe the following about God: He has not always been the Supreme Being of the universe, but attained that status through righteous living and persistent effort. They believe God the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as mans. Though abandoned by modern Mormon leaders, Brigham Young taught that Adam actually was God and the father of Jesus Christ. Christians know this about God: there is only One true God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10, 44:6-8), He always has and always will exist (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17), and He was not created, but is the Creator (Genesis 1; Psalm 24:1; Isaiah 37:16). He is perfect and no one else is equal to Him (Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25). God the Father is not a man, nor was He ever (Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29; Hosea 11:9). He is Spirit (John 4:24), and Spirit is not made of flesh and bone (Luke 24:39).    Mormons believe that there are different levels or kingdoms in the afterlife: the celestial kingdom, the terrestrial kingdom, the telestial kingdom and outer darkness. Where mankind will end up depends on what they believe and do in this mortal life. The Bible tells us that after death, we go to heaven or hell based on whether or not we had faith in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. To be absent from our bodies as believers means we are with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:6-8). Unbelievers are sent to hell or the place of the dead (Luke 16:22-23). When Jesus comes the second time, we will receive new bodies (1 Corinthians 15:50-54). There will be a new heaven and new earth for believers (Revelation 21:1), and unbelievers will be thrown into an everlasting lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). There is no second chance for redemption after death (Hebrews 9:27).  Mormon leaders have taught that Jesus incarnation was the result of a physical relationship between God the Father and Mary. They believe Jesus is a god, but that any human can also become a god. Christians historically have taught that God is triune and that He exists eternally as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). No one can achieve the status of Godonly He is holy (1 Samuel 2:2). We can only be made holy in God's sight through faith in Him (1 Corinthians 1:2). Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16) and is the only one ever to have lived a sinless, blameless life, who now has the highest place of honor in heaven (Hebrews 7:26). Jesus and God are one in essence, Jesus being the only One existing before physical birth (John 1:1-8, 8:56). Jesus gave Himself to us as a sacrifice, God raised Him from the dead, and one day everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Philippians 2:6-11). Jesus tells us it is impossible to get to heaven by our own works, and that only by faith in Him is it possible (Matthew 19:26). And many will not choose Him. Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it (Matthew 7:13). We all deserve eternal punishment for our sins, but God's infinite love and grace has allowed us a way out. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23).  Clearly there is only one way to receive salvation and that is to know God and His Son, Jesus (John 17:3). It is not done by works, but by faith (Romans 1:17, 3:28). When we have this faith, we will automatically be obedient to God's laws and become baptized out of love for Him, but not because it is a requirement for salvation. We can receive this gift no matter who we are or what we have done (Romans 3:22). Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12). Although Mormons are usually friendly, loving, and kind people, they are deceived by a false religion that distorts the nature of God, the Person of Jesus Christ, and the means of salvation.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	He did not translate anything.

His family was religious growing up. And he didn't "plug and play" the Book of Mormon from the Bible. Have you even read the Book of Mormon to even know?|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Joseph Smiths story is a very interesting read I highly recommend it to any one in to understanding religions.    My take is that as very religious He had what is known as a personal revelation and like so many before him interpret it in the way we see it today with of course many changes to fit the times. I can't explain the visions he saw but I do know this is not normal with true revelations.    He did have a back ground in the studies of Egypt mythology which is clear when one studies the whole of what it has become.    Revelation is evolutionary but always progressive. Down through the ages of a world's history, the revelations of religion are ever-expanding and successively more enlightening Page 1007-1|`|ZT9vNoNqaa	It's no secret that the Smith family owned a bible. What's so mind-boggling about the Book of Mormon's success is that it so blatantly does borrow from the KJV bible. For me as a kid growing up in Mormonism, this wasn't so obvious. For all I knew, people still spoke that way in 1830. (They didn't of course.)    But for the early Mormon converts, it must have been apparent. Why didn't anyone call him on it? "Hey Joseph, why does Nephi quote the gospel of Mark in 1 Nephi 18:21? That makes no sense." I guess the answer is that anyone who would ask such a question was unlikely to join the Mormons anyway.    Nowadays, the church is established and most members were born into it. So when a member today is confronted with the obvious contradiction of KJV bible passages, it's probably easy to ignore simply because it's so blatant. I mean it's not like the church is hiding this fact; many of the plagiarized verses are cross-referenced for you right in the book.    So let me spell it out for anyone who's never considered this before: plagiarized bible verses in the Book of Mormon are a major anachronism for what is supposed to be an ancient American story. Not surprisingly, apologists have their own way of seeing this, from Blake Ostler's expansion theory to overwrought explanations of Hebrew word origins, but who are you kidding?    Take a look at these verse pairs and decide for yourself. These are all from the first five chapters of 1 Nephi and yet-to-be-written (let alone translated to King James English) New Testament verses. You can find similar pairs on almost every page of the book.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	There is evidence that Joseph Smith used a Bible during the "translation" of the plates, specifically a King James Version from 1769. David P. Wright, a faithful Latter Day Saint, wrote that Joseph copied pages out of this version of the Bible and included several translation errors from this era of King James Bibles.|`|Ul17eQDoaa	Didn't you know? It ends up that Joseph Smith didn't really translate the BOM. The LDS church has already admitted it - after much research by their own team of experts, they have admitted that he did not translate it.    He also had access to a book that is strikingly similar to the BOM .. called the View of Hebrews.|`|q0gRmHlUaa	Of course|`|AA10637643	Yes, in fact, he was reading in James 1:5 and was prompted to inquire of the Lord which church to join... he had been questioning which of all churches were true.  James 1:5 admonishes us to ask God if we "lack wisdom" and He will "give(th) to all men liberally".  So, that's what he did.    What's your point?  If the book is fasle then take this challenge:        If one scoffs at the missionary's explanation of the Book of Mormon, he is in so many words claiming it to be false: That it is a deceiving fraud formulated through the efforts and talents of a common man. What is produced by one man can always be duplicated by another. The challenge that the Book of Mormon makes to the world is that of duplication. Because the book complies with every one of the following conditions, in order to produce a similar record, one must comply with the same conditions.       Here is the challenge: Can you accept it?       1. Write a history of ancient Tibet covering a period from 600 B.C. to 450 A.D. Why ancient Tibet? Because you know no more about Tibet than Joseph Smith (or anyone else) knew about ancient America.       2. You are 23 years of age.       3. You have had no more than three years of formal school education, and have spent your life in backwoods farming communities.       4. Your history must be written on the basis of what you now know. There was no library that held information for Joseph Smith. You must use none. There is to be no research of any kind.       5. Your history must be 531 pages and over 300,000 words in length.       6. Other than a few grammatical corrections, you must have no changes in the text. The first edition as you dictate it to your secretary must stand forever.       7. This record is to contain the history of two distinct and separate nations, along with histories of different contemporary nations or groups of people.       8. You must describe their religious, economic, political, and social cultures and institutions. Cover every phase of their society, including the names of their coins.       9. Change your style of writing many times. Many ancient authors contributed to the Book of Mormon, each with his own style.       10. Weave into your history the religion of Jesus Christ and the pattern of Christian living.       11. You must claim that your smooth narrative is not fiction with moral value, but true and sacred history.       12. You must include in you book fifty-four chapters dealing with wars, twenty-one historical chapters, fifty-five chapters on visions and prophecies. Remember, when you begin to write visions and prophecies, you must have your record agree meticulously with the Bible. You must write seventy-one chapters on doctrine and exhortation, and you must check every statement with the scriptures or you will be proven a fraud. You must write twenty-one chapters on the ministry of Christ, and every thing you claim he said and every testimony you write in your book about Him must agree absolutely with the New Testament.       13. Many of the facts, claims, ideas, and statements given as absolute truth in your writing must be entirely inconsistent with the prevailing beliefs of the world. Some of these worldly beliefs must be the direct opposite of your claims.       14. Included in your narrations will be authentic modes of travel; whether or not those ancient people used fire; description of their clothing, crops, mourning customs, and types of government. You must invent about 280 new names that will stand up under scrutiny through the years as to their proper application and derivation.       15. You will have to properly use figures of speech, similes, metaphors, narrations, exposition, descriptions, oratory, epic lyric, and parables.       16.

QDM3Y28laa	Simple Stuff:   We believe in Jesus Christ as the Savior, and we believe in the Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost.   We believe that our Church is the restored Church that Jesus founded when He came 2000 years ago. We believe in Prophets who receive messages and Word from God to be given unto man.   We believe in eternal marriages and families.   We believe that we were living in a premortal existence before coming to Earth. We came to Earth to prove to God our faith and to grow through mortal experiences.  We believe that after we die we will go to Spirit World, consisting of two places: Paradise and the Spirit Prison. Believers in Jesus Christ will go to Paradise and those who never learned or accepted Christ will go to Spirit Prison. And in Spirit Prison people grow and are given the chance to became believers in Christ. And after judgment day, almost all man will go to Heaven within the three degrees of it. Only those who had a deep, deep experience of God and denied Him and WENT AGAINST Him and His church will experience "outer-darkness".    I know, I said a lot, but those are our tenets in simple form.    We believe homosexuality goes against God's natural order, and we do believe it is wrong. Hate the sin, love the sinner.    I can tell you that I did not want to be a Mormon. I studied it for years, thinking it was interesting but was not something I wanted to join. Through prayer and my own searching, I found out the Mormon faith was true and though I've disappointed my family great, I know I will join the Church as soon I turn 18.    God bless!|`|TLLklriUaa	The Mormon Church just spent millions of dollars to ensure that homosexuals were stripped of their civil rights.

He claimed to have received a personal visit from God the Father and Jesus Christ who told him that all churches and their creeds were an abomination. Joseph set out to impose a brand-new religion that claims to be the only true church on earth. The problem with Mormonism is that it contradicts, modifies, and expands on the Bible. Christians have no reason to believe that the Bible is not true and adequate. To truly believe in and trust God means to believe in His Word. And all Scripture is inspired by God, which means it comes from Him (2 Timothy 3:16).    Mormons believe that there are in fact four sources of divinely inspired words, not just one. 1) The Bible as far as it is translated correctly. Which verses are incorrectly translated is not always made clear. 2) The Book of Mormon, which was translated by Smith and published in 1830. Smith claimed it is the most correct book on earth, and that a person can get closer to God by following its precepts than by any other book. 3) The Doctrine and Covenants, which is considered scripture by Mormons, containing a collection of modern revelations regarding the Church of Jesus Christ as it has been restored. 4) The Pearl of the Great Price, which is considered by Mormons to clarify doctrines and teachings that were lost from the Bible and adds its own information about the earth's creation.    Mormons believe the following about God: He has not always been the Supreme Being of the universe, but attained that status through righteous living and persistent effort. They believe God the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as mans. Though abandoned by modern Mormon leaders, Brigham Young taught that Adam actually was God and the father of Jesus Christ. Christians know this about God: there is only One true God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10, 44:6-8), He always has and always will exist (Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17), and He was not created, but is the Creator (Genesis 1; Psalm 24:1; Isaiah 37:16). He is perfect and no one else is equal to Him (Psalm 86:8; Isaiah 40:25). God the Father is not a man, nor was He ever (Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29; Hosea 11:9). He is Spirit (John 4:24), and Spirit is not made of flesh and bone (Luke 24:39).  Mormons believe that there are different levels or kingdoms in the afterlife: the celestial kingdom, the terrestrial kingdom, the telestial kingdom and outer darkness. Where mankind will end up depends on what they believe and do in this mortal life. The Bible tells us that after death, we go to heaven or hell based on whether or not we had faith in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. To be absent from our bodies as believers means we are with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:6-8). Unbelievers are sent to hell or the place of the dead (Luke 16:22-23). When Jesus comes the second time, we will receive new bodies (1 Corinthians 15:50-54). There will be a new heaven and new earth for believers (Revelation 21:1), and unbelievers will be thrown into an everlasting lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15). There is no second chance for redemption after death (Hebrews 9:27).    Mormon leaders have taught that Jesus incarnation was the result of a physical relationship between God the Father and Mary. They believe Jesus is a god, but that any human can also become a god. Christians historically have taught that God is triune and that He exists eternally as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). No one can achieve the status of Godonly He is holy (1 Samuel 2:2). We can only be made holy in God's sight through faith in Him (1 Corinthians 1:2). Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16) and is the only one ever to have lived a sinless, blameless life, who now has the highest place of honor in heaven (Hebrews 7:26). Jesus and God are one in essence, Jesus being the only One existing before physical birth (John 1:1-8, 8:56). Jesus gave Himself to us as a sacrifice, God raised Him from the dead, and one day everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Philippians 2:6-11). Jesus tells us it is impossible to get to heaven by our own works, and that only by faith in Him is it possible (Matthew 19:26). And many will not choose Him. Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it (Matthew 7:13). We all deserve eternal punishment for our sins, but God's infinite love and grace has allowed us a way out. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23).  Clearly there is only one way to receive salvation and that is to know God and His Son, Jesus (John 17:3). It is not done by works, but by faith (Romans 1:17, 3:28). When we have this faith, we will automatically be obedient to God's laws and become baptized out of love for Him, but not because it is a requirement for salvation. We can receive this gift no matter who we are or what we have done (Romans 3:22). Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12). Although Mormons are usually friendly, loving, and kind people, they are deceived by a false religion that distorts the nature of God, the Person of Jesus Christ, and the means of salvation.|`|rx20pKgOaa	I'm Mormon and I could detail all the different doctrines we believe but check out the LDS website - it can do a better job than me! :)    www.mormon.org|`|GPn55rjTaa	It is best to go to  LDS website.

Mormons do not believe that merely being attracted to the same sex is a sin in and of itself, but yes, they believe that actually acting on it IS, just like a guy being attracted to a woman he isn't married to isn't a sin, but having sex w/ her would be.  What I'm saying is that just being gay isn't a sin according to Mormons.    Suidice - We're obviously against it, but Mormons actually have a more liberal view of suicide than many other Christian denominations.  We do not believe that all those that commit suicide are condemned to hell.  God will judge them, not us.  We recognize that many of them may have had severe emotional and psychological challenges to be taken into account, and only God fully understands the circumstances.    Bible - Yes, we share similar beliefs in the Bible, but there are also differences, just like there are differences between other Christian denominations too.  They all claim to follow the Bible, but they all interpret it differently.  Mormons believe in and follow the Bible, though other Christian denominations disagree with our interpretation.

Also, they are completely against homosexuality so good luck with that one. The Mormon church is the one who just funded Prop 8 in California and because of it, the Prop passed.     But hey, if you kill yourself and you know a Mormon who cares about you - not all is lost in their opinion because they can baptize you after you die so you can go to Paradise with them - even if you do not want that to take place.    I've noticed a lot of people here are big on telling people to go to the mormon website to read about it - I think maybe you should see the view from the other side because obviously their websites are going to be biased and since that religion is based on a lie, I'm sure their website is as well. So if you want the truth from people who have been in that church and realized what a fraud it was so they left - go to www.exmormon.org - lots of helpful facts there LOTS.    Good luck to you!    *EDITED*: To reply to the original poster - You asked a question and I was giving you my opinion. Everyone else was giving you their pro-Mormon sites and I felt you should look at BOTH sides to get a better idea, rather than just one view. Yes, they are both biased but if you only look at the sites that are supporting it, then you're really not getting the full picture.. are you?    As a Christian myself, who has studied BOTH sides of that religion (I, myself, considered joining at one point in my life) - I can most certainly assure you that they are NOT Christian and while they proclaim to share the same beliefs in the Bible as Christian's do - they in fact, do not. Like I said, that site I linked to will give you some simple facts that would take a few seconds of your time to look it up and see the truth for yourself. If the Bible says one thing and the Book of Mormon or their D & C's contradict the Bible - then tell me how they can view the Bible the same way as Christian's do? Look it up yourself in your own Bible and the BOM/D&C - see with your own eyes, don't take my word for it.     FYI - Christian's believe that the Bible IS the complete word of God. That alone should tell you how Mormon's are not the same as Christian's. We do not need 10+ more books and writings .. we have the Bible and that is ALL we need. Our religion and our beliefs do not change constantly. We do not keep adding to the Bible to try and twist things around. We stick to one book and one word of God.     I still wish you much luck - if you are gay and decide to convert to Mormonism for this other boy you like - I wish you a LOT of luck because I would imagine, if he is hardcore Mormon, he is not going to say he is gay or he is not going to show it for fear of what will happen to him and his family within the church. They are extremely anti-homosexual.    Take Care|`|AA10637643	Doctrinally, ALL Mormons believe the same.  Our doctrines DON'T change depending on which church house we go to.      Homosexual acts and thoughts are sinful.  We believe also, any sexual act outside of marriage is sinful.  (Even gays who are "married" are still committing sin.)  These acts though, can be repented of.  We believe strongly in Christ's ability to forgive those who truly forsake and repent of the sin.    Members may have different opinions about things, but that is the doctrine.  We are not taught, at all, to condemn anyone.  But, we are taught to stand up for what we believe is right.  It was interesting when the whole Prop. 8 thing was going on - here in Utah there were members who believe the church should not have taken a stand and that gays should have the right to marry if they want to.  That was there opinion, not that of the church or of the gospel.    Suicide is kind of a tricky subject... partly because we just really don't know what will happen to that person after this life.  There is no real clear doctrine.  Of course, "thou shalt not kill" comes into mind, but we don't know their circumstance, what they are dealing with, how much gospel knowledge they have... or if they can be forgiven.  That is of course totally up to the Lord and He is really the only one who can answer that question.  I personally don't believe those who take their own life will "go to hell".  Many suffer from depression which is a disease - should they be held acccountable for that?  I don't know.  I know someone who committed suicide after 20 years of not being able to sleep, having delusions, and seeing demonic figures.  I don't think the Lord will hold him responsible for wanting to be "done" with all that.  But, you just never know.  Obivously we would encourage that person to get help, to try to uplift themself by living the gospel, praying for help... anything other than taking their own life.  When I was in high school, there was a suicide of a teen.  I had a teacher who said she believes suicide is a very selfish act, that the people leave behind all those who love them...    We do share similar beliefs, but not the same.  We believe differently about who exactly Christ is and who God the Father is.    Ask anytime.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	A must read and very accurate...

Context: For 5 of the 6 Sumerian forerunners of the Gilgamesh Epic, see MSS2652/1-2, 2887, 3026, 3027 and 3361.    Commentary: Mankind's oldest reference to the Deluge, together with 1/3 tablet in Philadelphia, the only other tablet bearing this story in Sumerian. The tablets share several lines from the beginning of the Flood story, but the present tablet also offers new lines and textual variants. Ziusudra, the Sumerian Noah, is here described as 'the priest of Enki', which is new information.    The Sumerian Flood story is one of the 6 forerunners to the Old Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, the source for the Old Babylonian myth Atra-Hasis, and for the Biblical account of the Flood (Genesis 6:5-9:29), written down several hundred years later.    According to British Museum, their Neo Babylonian tablet with the Flood story as a part of Gilgamesh, is perhaps the most famous tablet in the world. The present tablet is over 1000 years older.

Commentary: The list provides the beginnings of Sumerian and the worlds history as the Sumerians knew it. The cities listed were all very old sites, and the names of the kings are names of old types within Sumerian name-giving. Thus it is possible that correct traditions are contained, though the sequence given need not be correct. The city dynasties may have overlapped.

Sin had been inherited through Adam and Eve to all mankind.  God sent Jesus later on as a ransom sacrifice for our sins.     The earth became filled with wickedness as it is today partly because people became lovers of pleasures and themselves and violent rather than lovers and worshipers of God.     The Angels that came out of heaven to have relations with the earthly women gave birth to Nephilim, hybrid humans big in stature who caused havoc amongst the people. It could not continue.     The Ark was a test of Noah's faithfulness to God. Noah was asked to do so.... and he did it along with his close family members.    Others could have gone with Noah and his family onto the Ark, but they scoffed and laughed at his message about the coming flood and their destruction. (This is similar to our day. There is a message being sounded out by God's people and many are scoffing and laughing at the message that God is soon to step in and rid this earth of all the wickedness and injustice seen in the world today.) Those who do not heed this warning will have a similar fate as those who did not put faith in God and his instruction.

Romans 1:22-28 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.  Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie,  and worshiped and served created things   rather than the Creatorwho is forever praised.   Amen.     Because of this, God gave them over  to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.     In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.

I mean, I don't remember choosing to be heterosexual, but it could be an unconscious choice, right? And even an unconscious choice is different to being born that way.  It could have been an unconscious choice if, subconsciously, they felt that being homosexual would make them happier.  I'm just hypothesising here - I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a choice, and I haven't read enough to be able to say it's genetic.  I guess what I am trying to say, is that the people who say that it is definitely a choice aren't trying to offend, they're merely demonstrating how little they know.

So I think it's because they know that it's something that most anyone can "get into" under the right influences or circumnstances that they reject the idea that it's something that some people have no control over.   I'm sure some people are born with more of a tendency for attraction to one sex or the other, but like all human behavior, it's choice whether or not to indulge and act on those feelings.     Also some people DO want to be discriminated against and punished. They're called martyrs and there's a lot of them out there. They like to play the role of going against the grain, fighting against oppression (but first they have to find a way to be oppressed) and then be all dramatic about it.  No, I'm not saying all gay people do this or live gayly for these reasons, but SOME do.
3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	The first thing that someone should be considering is whether the idea of sin is actually real.    If God is supposed to be perfect how could She have made anything or anyone that wasn't perfect.  Think about it. The idea of sin assumes certain things about God that seem highly unlikely.     First it assumes a God who is too incompetent to organize a simple educational field excursion and figure out a way to get all of the students home safely.    How likely is this that God would not be smart enough to come up with a plan for our salvation that is going to work 100 percent of the time?    It also assumes that God must have created us imperfect if we are sinners.     One might assume that God would be able to create someone perfect each and every time if he chose to. Assuming God is capable of this, then it follows logically that we must be perfect creations if we are actually creations of this perfect God.    Unless of course you are saying that God chose to create us imperfect.    If God created us imperfect then anything that may go wrong is Gods fault, not ours. This seems a bit illogical at best so I think that we need to assume that What God creates would have to be perfect.    If this is the case and Gods creations are perfect, then nothing that we can do could change what God created perfect and make it imperfect unless we think that we are more powerful than God is.     How likely is it that we the creation could be more powerful than the creator. I personally find this idea somewhat amusing, and a bit absurd.    Religion tells us that God is perfect. If this is true then it could hardly be logically for Gods creations to be considered to be anything less than perfect.    If this is the case and we are perfect creations of a perfect God then Nothing that we can ever do could possibly change this perfection that God willed, unless we were so powerful that our choices could override and change the will of God.     How likely is that????    Think about it.    Love and blessings  Don|`|A01w1dHqaa	Sin is a lack of love, not from a rule book.

I dont think it says anything in the Bible about masturbation. But Jesus said that even if you look or think of a woman lustfully, you have committed adultery. When people masturbate, they usually fantasize about sexual interactions.     I think it is safe to say you can masturbate, but not with the lustful thoughts. It will probably make it harder to reach your..."goal" lets say, lol, but at least you're not committing sin.

Such records are the words of men, not very holy men, and they are not the word of God. The Scriptures always have, and always will, reflect the intellectual, moral, and spiritual status of those who create them. Have you not noted that the concepts of Yahweh grow in beauty and glory as the prophets make their records from Samuel to Isaiah? And you should remember that the Scriptures are intended for religious instruction and spiritual guidance. They are not the works of either historians or philosophers.Page 1768-1     It must therefore be evident that composite Christian theology encounters great difficulty in attaining consistency. This difficulty is further aggravated by the fact that the doctrines of early Christianity were generally based on the personal religious experience of three different persons: Philo of Alexandria, Jesus of Nazareth, and Paul of Tarsus. Page 68-2    Though the Hellenized Jewish beliefs were very little influenced by the teachings of the Epicureans, they were very materially affected by the philosophy of Plato and the self-abnegation doctrines of the Stoics. The great inroad of Stoicism is exemplified by the Fourth Book of the Maccabees; the penetration of both Platonic philosophy and Stoic doctrines is exhibited in the Wisdom of Solomon. The Hellenized Jews brought to the Hebrew scriptures such an allegorical interpretation that they found no difficulty in conforming Hebrew theology with their revered Aristotelian philosophy. But this all led to disastrous confusion until these problems were taken in hand by Philo of Alexandria, who proceeded to harmonize and systemize Greek philosophy and Hebrew theology into a compact and fairly consistent system of religious belief and practice. And it was this later teaching of combined Greek philosophy and Hebrew theology that prevailed in Palestine when Jesus lived and taught, and which Paul utilized as the foundation on which to build his more advanced and enlightening cult of Christianity.

As the first 300 years of Christianity were bible-free, and during that period Christianity spread like wild fire, I suspect that such proof would only significantly affect the beliefs of those Christians sects that are based on the doctrine "only Scripture".  As the huge majority of Christians belong to sects which are NOT based on that doctrine, I would guess that what we would see is a "migration" of Christians from the "only Scripture" sects to the "Scripture is secondary" sects.  Of course, many "only Scripture" Christians would abandon their faith.

AA10229197	Sturmabteilung      The seal of SAThe  Sturmabteilung? (SA, German for "Storm Division", usually translated as stormtroops or stormtroopers) functioned as a paramilitary organization of the NSDAP  the German Nazi party. It played a key role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s.    SA men were often known as brownshirts from the color of their uniform and to distinguish them from the SS who were known as blackshirts. Brown coloured shirts were chosen as the SA uniform because a large batch of them were cheaply available after World War I, having originally been ordered for German troops in Africa.    The SA was also the first Nazi paramilitary group to develop pseudo-military titles for bestowal upon its members. The SA ranks would be adopted by several other Nazi Party groups, chief among them the SS.      History     Hitler addressing SA members in the late 1920sThe term Sturmabteilung originally came from the specialized assault troops used by Germany in 1918 in World War I utilising Hutier tactics. Instead of a large mass assault, the Sturmabteilung were organized into small teams of a few soldiers each. First applied during the Battle of Cambrai, the wider use in March 1918 allowed the Germans to push back British and French lines tens of kilometers.    In Munich in the fall of 1920, Hitler himself created the Ordnertruppen; a body of muscular Nazis, ex-soldiers, and beer hall brawlers in order to protect his speeches and Nazi Party gatherings from Communist disruptions. It originally functioned as a group of bodyguards to enforce order at Nazi gatherings. It was shortly changed to Sportabteilung, a cover name meaning "Sports section," and came to be known by the initials SA. In late 1921, the name was changed to the final version: Sturmabteilung. Under their popular leader Ernst R?hm, the SA grew in importance within the Nazi power structure, eventually claiming thousands of members. In 1922, the NSDAP created a youth section, the Jugendbund, for young men between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Its successor, the Hitler Youth, remained under SA command until May 1932. The SA carried out numerous acts of violence against socialist groups throughout the 1920s, typically in minor street-fights called Zusammenst??e ('collisions'). The SS eventually took over their original role.       A rare, complete set of Nazi S.A. tin soldiers, from the 1940s.After Hitler took power in 1933, the SA became increasingly anxious for power and saw themselves as the replacement for the German army. This angered the regular army (Reichswehr) who already resented the Nazi party, and commonly regarded the SA as 'brown scum'. It also led to tension with other leaders within the party who saw R?hm's increasingly powerful SA as a threat to their own personal ambitions. The SA was also considered a dangerous and radical organization, especially since common SA practice was to swear loyalty to local SA commanders rather than Adolf Hitler or the Nazi Party as a whole.    Senior Nazis including Himmler faked a dossier which suggested that R?hm had received payment from the French to carry out a coup against Hitler. At first Hitler refused to believe it, but he was painfully aware that the SA had the power to remove him if it so wished. R?hm was unpopular in the party because others saw his ambition as threatening their own, and because he was a homosexual. Eventually the pressure mounted and Hitler ordered the execution of the leadership of the SA, which took place on June 30-July 1, 1934, on what is known as the Night of the Long Knives. Victor Lutze became the new leader of the SA, and the organization was soon marginalized in the Nazi power structure.    The SA had its own units during the war, known as Feldherrnhalle. These formations expanded from regimental size in 1940 to a fully-fledged armored corps Panzerkorps Feldherrnhalle in 1945.      Leaders of the SA  The leader of the SA was known as the Oberster SA-Fhrer, translated as Supreme SA Leader. The following men held this position throughout the existence of the SA:    Emil Maurice (19201921)   Hans Ulrich Klintzsche (19211923)   Hermann G?ring (1923)   None (19231925)   Franz Pfeffer von Salomon (19261930)   Adolf Hitler (19301945)   In 1930, to centralize the loyalty of the SA, Adolf Hitler personally assumed command of the entire organization and remained Oberster SA-Fhrer from the duration of the group's existence until 1945. The day to day running of the SA was conducted by the Stabschef SA (SA Chief of Staff). After 1931, it was the Stabschef who was generally accepted as the Commander of the SA, acting in Hitler's name.    The following personnel held the position of Chief of Staff of the SA:    Ernst R?hm (19311934)   Viktor Lutze (19341943)   Wilhelm Scheppmann (19431945)|`|e4169ee206199aa559a7440133705344aa	Sturmabteilung originally came from the specialized assault troops used by Germany in 1918 in World War I utilising Hutier tactics.

AA10229197	Riots based on unjust treatment of Gay and Lesbian people in New York City. I believe this is why Pride is always in June.    The Stonewall riots, which as a whole is often called the Stonewall Rebellion, were a series of violent conflicts between lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, and queer persons and police officers in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 not long after 1:20 a.m., when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. "Stonewall," as the raids are often referred to, is generally considered a turning point for the modern gay rights movement worldwide, as it is one of the first times in modern history a significant body of gay people resisted arrest.      History  Police raids on gay bars and nightclubs were a regular part of gay life in cities across the United States, until the 1960s, when sudden raids on bars in many major cities became markedly less frequent. Most conclude that the decline in raids can be attributed to a series of court challenges and increased resistance from the Homophile Movement.    Prior to 1965, the police would sometimes record the identities of all those present at the raids, which on some occasions was published in the newspaper. At the time, the police used any number of reasons they could think of to justify an arrest on indecency charges including: kissing, holding hands, wearing clothing traditionally of the opposite gender, or even being in the bar during the raid.    It is important to look back to before 1969 and examine the changing attitudes in New York towards gay bars and gay rights. In 1965, two important figures came into prominence. John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, was elected mayor of New York City on a reform platform. Dick Leitsch became president of the Mattachine Society (an early gay rights organization in the United States) in New York at around the same time. Leitsch was considered relatively militant compared to his predecessors and believed in direct action techniques commonly used by other civil rights groups in the 1960s.    In early 1966, administration policies had changed because of complaints made by Mattachine that the police were on the streets entrapping gay men and charging them with indecency. The police commissioner, Howard Leary, instructed the police force not to lure gays into breaking the law and also required that any plainclothesmen must have a civilian witness when a gay person was arrested. This nearly ended entrapment of gay men on such charges in New York (DEmilio 207).    In the same year, in order to challenge the State Liquor Authority (SLA) regarding its policies over gay bars, Dick Leitsch conducted a sip in. Leitsch had called members of the press and planned on meeting at a bar with two other gay mena bar could have its liquor license taken away for knowingly serving a group of three or more homosexualsto test the SLA policy of closing bars. When the bartender at Julius turned them away, they made a complaint to the citys Human Rights Commission. Following the sip in, the chairman of the SLA stated that his department did not prohibit the sale of liquor to homosexuals. In addition, the following year two separate court cases ruled that substantial evidence was needed in order to revoke a liquor license. No longer was kissing between two men considered indecent behavior. The number of gay bars in New York steadily rose after 1966 (DEmilio 208).    So if in 1969 gay bars were legal, why was the Stonewall Inn raided that night? John DEmilio, a prominent historian, points out that the city was in the middle of a mayoral campaign and John Lindsay, who had lost his partys primary, had reason to call for a cleanup of the citys bars. The Stonewall Inn had a number of reasons that the police would target it. It operated without a liquor license, had ties with organized crime, and offering scantily clad go-go boys as entertainment, it brought an unruly element to Sheridan Square (DEmilio 231).    Race is said to have been another factor. The Stonewall bar was heavily frequented by blacks and hispanics. The decision by the police to raid the bar in the manner they did may have been influenced by the fact that most of the "homosexuals" they would encounter were of color, and therefore even more objectionable. A large percentage of the rioters were also men of color.    Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine, who led the raid on the bar that first night, claims that he was ordered to close the Stonewall Inn because it was the central location for gathering information on gay men who worked on Wall Street. A recent increase in the number of thefts from brokerage houses on Wall Street led police to suspect it might be gay men who were being blackmailed who were behind the thefts. (Carter 262)    The patrons of the Stonewall were used to such raids and the management was generally able to reopen for business either that night, or the following day. What may have made the June 1969 raid different was the death a week earlier of Judy Garland, an important cultural icon with whom many in the gay community identified. The palpable grief at her loss culminated with her funeral on Friday, June 27, attended by 22,000 people, including perhaps 12,000 gay men. Many of the Stonewall patrons were still emotionally distraught when the raid occurred that night, and refused to react passively. However, historians still differ on whether her death's proximity to the Stonewall riots was mere coincidence, or if it was a true cause of the riots.      The Stonewall Raid and the Aftermath  A number of factors differentiated the raid that took place on June 28 from other such raids on the Stonewall Inn. In general, the sixth precinct tipped off the management of the Stonewall Inn prior to a raid. In addition, raids were generally carried

If you are considering that to be your place of 'retirement' then you definitely will not have any use for a boat, or a life saver for that matter, and certainly no fun.    Your life saver is now, and His name is Jesus.  After you die it will be too late for anyone to be saved, literally.  Believe me, your eternal future is nothing to joke about.|`|AA10812810	The Grim Reaper gives tours 24/7. He also has the best offers out of all of Inferno.

338c1f57133aac7e019b1f6759a67f90aa	Lets look at it from a scientific perspective.    Cute is an odd one.  Some say it means "ugly, but interesting," but I think that's an oversimplification.  We tend to think that babies and animals are the epitome of cute.  Baby faces tend to have a ratio of physical features that are measurably different from adults, such as larger eyes, chubby cheeks, etc.  This produces an instinctive reaction in adults to care for them.  The typical features are small, roundedness, higher pitched voice, softness and smoothness; and the typical reaction is to cuddle.    Pretty is the catchall term for pulchritude.  It means that you are considered attractive.  Pretty indicates above average pulchritude.  I think it is a measure of equality to some extent, meaning the subject is not out of the beholders league in either direction.  It indicates that the basic aesthetic for beauty is realized in the subject or the subject has the potential for beauty.    Gorgeous is an symbolically elevated form of pretty.  It is not an indicator of equality but involves putting the subject on a pedestal, out of reach of the beholder.  It suggests a level of awe or majesty.  It may also indicate temporary beauty, as in a sunset or a wedding.  This can be a real measurment of increased puchritude or merely a perceived difference.    Hot indicates sexual arousal.  Scientifically, this means that the heart pumps faster, spreading certain hormones and neurotransmitters to the proper locations to prepare the body for coitus.  It indicates the the beholder desires (willingly or unwillingly) to have sex with the subject.  It is similar to sexy, which means the beholder either considers the subject to be demonstrably prepared for sex or the beholder considers the subject to be a possible mate but has not yet reached the internal level of "hot."    Good-looking is a general term that covers the the whole spectrum.  It's often be more than mere pulchritude by including the packaging, such as clothing, makeup, poise, mannerisms, voice, smell, and can include money, car, moral values and other non-beauty related measurements.  Good-looking may also mean a substandard (less than pretty or less than handsome) subject that has been decorated up to a level of appropriateness.  It may also mean that someone is simply well kept.    Beautiful is the epitome of pulchritude.  It means that a person is the in the narrow range of pretty that is near perfection.  This tends to be based on scientific measurements of the face and body proportions, as well as complexion.  Some say that beauty is skin deep, but it is actually deeper than than relying on bone structure and musculature.    However, I define beauty as including personality as well.  When I say pretty I mean to say that someone is physically attractive.  When I say beautiful, that means that someone is also mentally and emotionally attractive as well.  Since it takes longer to get to know someone mentally and emotionally, it must chronologically follow the description of pretty.  Of course, this may not be the common definition, but it works for me.    I hope that helps explain things.  I do not think the terms are interchangeable or hierarchical, but have specific uses.  What can I say, I'm a pedantic SOB. :-)    BTW, I think you are definately very pretty and good-looking with the potential for beautiful and a probability of hot.|`|b985e1bb4dd7c02708ee4d73e11f0946aa	As a rough guide:  Cute: baby animals, small boys or girls, babies.

Being called any of these things is never a 'bad' thing according to the culture that uses these phrases.    The difference is, then, in the INTENSITY of attraction. Are any of these words more or less intense in levels of attraction expressed than others?    We COULD each rank them...but if each of us made our own lists, we may have some specific disagreements over just what order they go into. Why? Because of semantics (in a linguistic sense) and the nature of human language screw us over. Each of us, from our own experiences and personal understandings of each of these words, have a unique viewpoint to how these words really work. Which doesn't help us at all, frankly.    So what IS the difference? In short, its in the person USING the words, rather than the word itself. The context of the message grossly affects the words implication. This doesn't just mean what is actually said, but also body language, the person speaking, and far many other factors that we're usually unaware we process during the day. So good luck with that!    But here's my personal, 1 being least intense and 6 being most, semantical ranking:    1. Good-Looking. 2. Cute. 3. Pretty. 4. Beautiful. 5. Hot. 6. Gorgeous.    Hope that helps.

What Does the Bible Say About God and Jesus?           IF PEOPLE were to read the Bible from cover to cover without any preconceived idea of a Trinity, would they arrive at such a concept on their own? Not at all.     What comes through very clearly to an impartial reader is that God alone is the Almighty, the Creator, separate and distinct from anyone else, and that Jesus, even in his prehuman existence, is also separate and distinct, a created being, subordinate to God.     God Is One, Not Three            THE Bible teaching that God is one is called monotheism. And L. L. Paine, professor of ecclesiastical history, indicates that monotheism in its purest form does not allow for a Trinity: "The Old Testament is strictly monotheistic. God is a single personal being. The idea that a trinity is to be found there . . . is utterly without foundation."     Was there any change from monotheism after Jesus came to the earth? Paine answers: "On this point there is no break between the Old Testament and the New. The monotheistic tradition is continued. Jesus was a Jew, trained by Jewish parents in the Old Testament scriptures. His teaching was Jewish to the core; a new gospel indeed, but not a new theology. . . . And he accepted as his own belief the great text of Jewish monotheism: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God.'"     Those words are found at Deuteronomy 6:4. The Catholic New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) here reads: "Listen, Israel: Yahweh our God is the one, the only Yahweh."* In the grammar of that verse, the word "one" has no plural modifiers to suggest that it means anything but one individual.     The Christian apostle Paul did not indicate any change in the nature of God either, even after Jesus came to the earth. He wrote: "God is only one."Galatians 3:20; see also 1 Corinthians 8:4-6.     Thousands of times throughout the Bible, God is spoken of as one person. When he speaks, it is as one undivided individual. The Bible could not be any clearer on this. As God states: "I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory." (Isaiah 42:8) "I am Yahweh your God . . . You shall have no gods except me." (Italics ours.)Exodus 20:2, 3, JB.     Why would all the God-inspired Bible writers speak of God as one person if he were actually three persons? What purpose would that serve, except to mislead people? Surely, if God were composed of three persons, he would have had his Bible writers make it abundantly clear so that there could be no doubt about it. At least the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures who had personal contact with God's own Son would have done so. But they did not.     Instead, what the Bible writers did make abundantly clear is that God is one Persona unique, unpartitioned Being who has no equal: "I am Jehovah, and there is no one else. With the exception of me there is no God." (Isaiah 45:5) "You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth."Psalm 83:18.     Not a Plural God            JESUS called God "the only true God." (John 17:3) Never did he refer to God as a deity of plural persons. That is why nowhere in the Bible is anyone but Jehovah called Almighty. Otherwise, it voids the meaning of the word "almighty." Neither Jesus nor the holy spirit is ever called that, for Jehovah alone is supreme. At Genesis 17:1 he declares: "I am God Almighty." And Exodus 18:11 says: "Jehovah is greater than all the other gods."     In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word eloh'ah (god) has two plural forms, namely, elohim' (gods) and eloheh' (gods of). These plural forms generally refer to Jehovah, in which case they are translated in the singular as "God." Do these plural forms indicate a Trinity? No, they do not. In A Dictionary of the Bible, William Smith says: "The fanciful idea that [elohim'] referred to the trinity of persons in the Godhead hardly finds now a supporter among scholars. It is either what grammarians call the plural of majesty, or it denotes the fullness of divine strength, the sum of the powers displayed by God."     The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures says of elohim': "It is almost invariably construed with a singular verbal predicate, and takes a singular adjectival attribute." To illustrate this, the title elohim' appears 35 times by itself in the account of creation, and every time the verb describing what God said and did is singular. (Genesis 1:1-2:4) Thus, that publication concludes: "[Elohim'] must rather be explained as an intensive plural, denoting greatness and majesty."     Elohim' means, not "persons," but "gods." So those who argue that this word implies a Trinity make themselves polytheists, worshipers of more than one God. Why? Because it would mean that there were three gods in the Trinity. But nearly all Trinity supporters reject the view that the Trinity is made up of three separate gods.     The Bible also uses the words elohim' and eloheh' when referring to a number of false idol gods. (Exodus 12:12; 20:23) But at other times it may refer to just a single false god, as when the Philistines referred to "Dagon their god [eloheh']." (Judges 16:23, 24) Baal is called "a god [elohim']." (1 Kings 18:27) In addition, the term is used for humans. (Psalm 82:1, 6) Moses was told that he was to serve as "God" [elohim'] to Aaron and to Pharaoh.Exodus 4:16; 7:1.     Obviously, using the titles elohim' and eloheh' for false gods, and even humans, did not imply that each was a plurality of gods; neither does applying elohim' or eloheh' to Jehovah mean that he is more than one person, especially when we consid|`|AA10025366	Jesus, as the book of John tells us in Chapter 1, was God made flesh.

It was added almost 300 years after Jesus life on earth by the church to try to explain what they couldn't explain. The emperor Constantine demanded a resolution from the Council at Nicea to unite all the different Christian sects. (In fact, the Bible contains some quotes from Jesus where He made it very clear He was not exactly God Himself on earth, but was lower than God. This has always been a puzzle for those who accept the Trinity theory.)|`|350ea89e6ce801b460579c7048cf4b15aa	*eyeroll* if they are really the same person, how come in heaven they sit on different thrones?|`|3547a794635509f0c68e727c6076f875aa	Now it still sounds like Father and Son are like soulmates.

Each is distinct from the others but never acts independently. They are one in nature and purpose. This mystery is called the doctrine of the Trinity, though that term is not used in the Bible. The teaching, however, is present in seed form in the Old Testament and is revealed explicitly in the New Testament. Note passages such as Matthew 28:19; John 10:30, 14:26; 2 Corinthians 13:14.    Our finite minds cannot understand or explain this mystery of God, which is nevertheless a fact. We must accept the truths found in the Word of God by faith even though we ourselves cannot comprehend them fully; read Hebrews 11:1,3,6 and 1 Corinthians 2:5-10;14; 13:12. It is really not surprising that the infinite God should be complex in His nature beyond the ability of finite humans to comprehend! This doctrine is absolutely essential to New Testament Christianity. Theologians have pointed out that if it were not true, the Bible would be unreliable, Christ would not be divine, and His death on the cross would not atone for our sins, being merely the death of a martyr.|`|f8728df09ed16c7878ed7d4c91e33d15aa	All I got outta that Jibberish is that God sits at his right side-but which one then has the Holy spirit in them-AHHHHH!

"GOD is the name commonly given to the ultimate source and power of the universe and the subject of religious devotion," says The Encyclopedia Americana. A dictionary defines the term "God" as "the supreme or ultimate reality." What is the nature of such an awesome reality?    Is God an impersonal force or a real person? Does he have a name? Is he a triune entity, a Trinity, as many believe? How can we come to know God? The Bible provides truthful and satisfying answers to these questions. In fact, it encourages us to seek God, saying: "He is not far off from each one of us." Acts 17:27.    An Impersonal Force or a Real Person?  Many who believe in God think of him as a force, not as a person. In certain cultures, for example, gods have been identified with the forces of nature. Some who have examined evidence gathered through scientific research into the structure of the universe and the nature of life on earth have concluded that there has to be a First Cause. Nevertheless, they hesitate to attach a personality to this Cause.    Yet, does not the complexity of creation indicate that the First Cause must have had great intelligence? Intelligence requires a mind. The great mind responsible for all creation belongs to the person of God. Yes, God has a body, not a physical one like ours, but a spiritual body. "If there is a physical body," says the Bible, "there is also a spiritual one." (1 Corinthians 15:44) Explaining the nature of God, the Bible clearly states: "God is a Spirit." (John 4:24) A spirit has a form of life that differs greatly from ours, and it is invisible to human eyes. (John 1:18) There are invisible spirit creatures as well. They are angels "the sons of the true God." Job 1:6; 2:1.    Since God is an uncreated person with a spiritual body, he logically has a place of residence. Referring to the spirit realm, the Bible tells us that the heavens are God's "established place of dwelling." (1 Kings 8:43) Also, the Bible writer Paul states: 'Christ entered into heaven itself to appear before the person of God for us.' Hebrews 9:24.    The word "spirit" is also used in the Bible in another sense. Addressing God in prayer, the psalmist said: "If you send forth your spirit, they are created." (Psalm 104:30) This spirit is not God himself but a force that God sends forth, or uses, to accomplish whatever he wishes. By means of it, God created the physical heavens, the earth, and all living things. (Genesis 1:2; Psalm 33:6) His spirit is called holy spirit. God used his holy spirit to inspire the men who wrote the Bible. (2 Peter 1:20, 21) Hence, the holy spirit is the invisible active force that God uses to fulfill his purposes.      God used his holy spirit to create the earth  and to inspire men to write the Bible    God Has a Unique Name  The Bible writer Agur asked: "Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of both hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in a mantle? Who has made all the ends of the earth to rise? What is his name and what the name of his son?" (Proverbs 30:4) In effect, Agur was asking, 'Do you know the name or family line of any man who has done these things?' Only God has the power to control natural forces. While the creation provides powerful proof that God exists, it is silent about the name of God. In fact, we could never know God's name unless God himself revealed it to us. And he has. "I am Jehovah," says the Creator, "that is my name." Isaiah 42:8.    God's unique name, Jehovah, occurs nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures alone. Jesus Christ made that name known to others and praised it before them. (John 17:6, 26) That name is found in the last book of the Bible as a part of the expression "Hallelujah," meaning "praise Jah." And "Jah" is the shortened form of "Jehovah." (Revelation 19:1-6, footnote) Yet, many modern Bibles seldom use that name. They often use the word "LORD" or "GOD," written in all capital letters to set it apart from the common titles "Lord" and "God." Some scholars suggest that the divine name may have been pronounced Yahweh.      Jesus made God's name  known to others    Why such differing views about the name of the greatest Personage in the universe? The problem began centuries ago when the Jews superstitiously ceased to pronounce the divine name and started to substitute the Hebrew word for "Sovereign Lord" whenever they came to the divine name as they read the Scriptures. Since Biblical Hebrew was written without vowels, there is no way to know precisely how Moses, David, and others of ancient times pronounced the letters that make up the divine name. However, the English pronunciation, Jehovah, has been in use for centuries, and its equivalent in many languages is widely accepted today. Exodus 6:3; Isaiah 26:4, King James Version.    Though there is uncertainty about how God's name was pronounced in ancient Hebrew, its meaning is not a complete mystery. His name means "He Causes to Become." Jehovah God thereby identifies himself as the Great Purposer. He always causes his purposes and promises to become reality. Only the true God, who has the power to do this, can rightfully bear that name. Isaiah 55:11.    Unquestionably, the name Jehovah serves to distinguish Almighty God from all other gods. That is why that name appears so often in the Bible. While many translations fail to use the divine name, Psalm 83:18 clearly states: "You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth." During his ministry, Jesus Christ taught his followers: "You must pray, then, this way: 'Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.'" (Matthew 6:9) We should, then, use God's name when we pray, speak of him, and praise him before others.    Is Jesus God?  Jehovah God himself leaves no doubt about the identity of his Son.

It is hard for us to understand because we have always been taught that something has a beginning. He was by himself for a very long time.  Then he created his son Jesus.  Col 1:15-17 says that Jesus was his first creation.  And then Jesus, with the help of his father, created all other things. It is like a contractor.  The contractor has someone do the work for him but it is his house.  He designed it.  So Jesus was with God from the very beginning as his master worker.  Prov 8:30, 31.  The scriptures show that Jesus' name then was Michael.  And it is to him that the word Archangel was applied.  1 Thess 4:16.  He was mentioned several times in the old testament as a strong angel.  The only angel that could dispute with Satan and win.  Daniel 10:13, 20,?21.Exodus 23:20,?21. He is the one in Revelation that fights the war of Armegeddon for his Father.

When you see evil in the world, murder, rape, robbery, torture, innocent people suffering and selfish people taking advantage of others, what is your reaction?    Aetheists are impatient.  They say, "We have to do something about this.  We must stop these injustices, punish those who don't know how to treat others, pass laws to prohibit these grievous insults to our common humanity and set up institutions to protect the weak, innocent and outcast.  After all, we're all humans and there is only one life."    A Christian would be more patient.  He would say, "Those poor people!  It's a good thing we have imperishable souls.  That way, God will be sure to eventually reward those who suffer and punish the wicked.  We can offer them some comfort by letting them know about God's great plan.  When they understand that their suffering will be more than compensated in the next life, they won't worry so much.  We might even relieve their physical suffering here and now, although it doesn't really matter in this sinful, temporary world.  Remember what Jesus said, 'The poor you will always have with you!'"    Aetheists do hope, to construct a culture as compassionate, just and respectful as can be humanly managed in an imperfect world.  They do not hope in an unseen other world of perfection and ultimate justice promised by people with no demonstrable evidence of its existence.      Survival past death is not a "purpose".  Either everybody does or everybody doesn't.  Suffering is SURELY not a "purpose", it is a disease to be treated and prevented.  One can have compassion without the example of Jesus.  And is it "sharing" to hoard "salvation" only for the "saved"?  Aetheists understand that much of the "bad stuff that happens" is due to ignorance, intolerance and just plain stupidity.  They believe in understanding, in curiosity and in witholding judgment.  And they certainly don't believe in making life worse for other people, either in fantasy or reality.  Yes, they'll die, but they believe it happens to everyone.  (Some even claim there's proof.)  And that doesn't depress them any more than it does anyone else.  They accept what they see and don't imagine that some supernatural power would create a big, messy universe, let it run for eons, then stop it and make it all tidy.  What kind of purpose is that?

That means that I do not believe in the existence of any deities.  I do not pray.  I do hope, of course; to presume I don't is ridiculous.  "Hope" is a fundamental human emotion, and has nothing to do with any god/s.    I think that you are a bit confused.  I don't believe in any deity, but that does not remove purpose from my life.  I have the same purpose as any other human being--to live, to learn, to make things better than I found them.  I do not need some eternal "carrot and stick" reward system in order to feel useful, and important, and to make moral and ethical decisions.    I *am* an atheist.  I have studied nearly every world religion.  I can assure you, I am not merely a "stubborn child"--I am completely and fully adult, and I am an educated and informed one.  If I may, I'd say that of the two of us, the one who maintains belief in the unproven fairy tales of past cultures is the most childlike.    There is no proof for any deity.  I should not have to explain my lack of belief in the unproven; please, please, please understand that my lack of belief is not an uneducated stance.

My life haves meaning, my life is NOT boring nor dull, I am happy, I am NOT lost, I do NOT need help, I DO NOT need to be converted, I do NOT need any ones prayers!|`|fa4c9ae2dff93eeedb6c95e6b56166cdaa	I do hope and wish for things. I wish for a better life for those around me and myself, and I also hope to fulfill my dreams. I don't see how hope and wishes are against Atheism.    I don't believe my mother gave me birth because she didn't have anything better to do. It is part of nature to reproduce and my parents always wanted to have kids. This is again some faulty logic that doesn't have anything against Atheism.    I believe in the purpose that I create in life. I don't need some "god" to give me a "calling" in life. I have my own goals for human good and to help those around me prosper.    I am an Atheist because there is no evidence for your imaginary gods. The gods of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to me seem tyranical, hypocritical, murderous, childish, peevish, counterproductive, illogical and many other things that have negative association. I understand how Jesus was supposedly good and all this stuff, but he also said there was a sin unforgiveable and that people that don't following will burn in hell. I don't see how you can be "peaceful and loving" while advocating eternal torture for acting in a way that you may believe is erroneous. They also happen to contradict things that science has proven by citing something unproven. Other religions I know little of, but the little that I know are based on the same principles of irrationality, fear, and deception. This has nothing to do with "bad things that happened to me." And before you assume, I grew up in a catholic home and I became "born again" when I was about 16 to when I was 18/19, so I fully understand religion. I even consider attending Wheaton College or some other religious college, and I am really glad I didn't.|`|AA11789073	"So that means you dont pray, or hope or wish for anything correct."    Nope, it means that atheists recognize that asking a big guy in a white beard in the sky for...anything won't accomplish anything, because there is no such being there.    Can you name one medical treatment that God has magically provided?  How does that list stack up next to the workable treatments that humans figure out?    "Dont you want more, then just today. Dont you want forever,"    Are you trying to make it look like aplogists have nothing but logical fallacies to argue with?  That's a classic example of an appeal to consequences. ("X must be true, beuase I don't like the consequences if it isn't")    "you really believe that your Mother gave birth to you, just because she had nothing better to do."    No, most people are born because their parents wanted to raise children.    Do you think that making arguments that are trivially easy to refute makes for a stronger case?    "So I dont really believe you are a Atheist, I just think your still a stubborn child, who doesnt want to learn to share."    Right.  That's really persuasive.  You, who almost certainly believes that a loving and merciful God would order and carry out the slaughter of millions of innocents, (and crow about it in the Bible, so the record would last for thousands of years) is telling other people that they are being childish.    "So tell my why you are a Atheist, other then the bad stuff thats happened in your life"    Because there's no evidence that a big guy with a beard sits up high magically helping us.  And there's lots of evidence that the God of the Bible is a bloodthirsty sadist who kills women and children to show off.  That, certainly, is no one to worship, or even give the time of day to.    All our evidence tells us that all the good and all the evil ever done on the earth was done by ordinary human beings.  And that zippo of it was the work of deities.  Therefore, we should spend none of our time worrying about deities that don't make a difference, and 100% of our time worrying about the real world, and real people, who do.    Edit: I see that your lableing people who believe differently from you as "stubborn children" is getting...well, probably exactly the reception you intended.  Don't worry.  Frankly, no one expects differently from your kind of Christian.  (And if you wondered why I conclude you are a Christian, its because of a) probability and b) phrases like "stubborn children".|`|AA10332767	Of course I dont pray because I dont see any evidence that theres anyone to pray to, but I do have hopes and wishes. I dont particularly want forever. I am quite content with my role as a biological creature in the natural world. Im not looking forward to death, but I know I will someday cease to exist. Im fine with that. My mother was fulfilling her biological role by giving birth to me  she was carrying on her species (just like every other creature on the planet). I see great beauty in that. I did not become an atheist through misfortune. I was born into a very religious (Christian) family, but as a teenager started to study the natural world (on my own, I just had an interest in it) and I eventually came to see that there was no evidence of a creator. The process for me involved a great deal of reading, learning and thought, it was not a knee-jerk reaction to something bad. I also feel that almost the opposite of what you say is true about atheists being children. I dont think a person can truly be an adult until they understand that there isnt a daddy in the sky whos going to rescue them and love them and forgive them take care of them. I am completely responsible for myself. If I make a mistake I pay the consequences. If I hurt someone I ask THEM for forgiveness. I am an adult.

Es war vor allem w?hrend des Zweiten Weltkrieges neben dem Wort "Jerry" gebr?uchlich. Das Wort Kraut leitet sich vom Sauerkraut ab, das bis heute als Klischee eng mit der deutschen Kultur in Verbindung gebracht wird.    Interessanterweise gab es jedoch zur Zeit des Zweiten Weltkrieges in den USA einen deutlich h?heren Pro-Kopf-Verzehr von Kraut als in Deutschland. Heutzutage ist der durchschnittliche Pro-Kopf Konsum von Kraut in Deutschland mehr als doppelt so hoch als der in den USA[1], jedoch niedriger als in Frankreich[2].    Der Stereotyp des deutschen Sauerkrautessers entstand jedoch schon vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. So beschreibt beispielsweise Jules Verne in seinem 1879 ver?ffentlichten Roman Die 500 Millionen der Begum einen b?sen deutschen Industriellen mit einer Vorliebe fr Sauerkraut.    Eine weitere Erkl?rung fr die Assoziation von Deutschen zu Sauerkraut kommt aus dem Bereich der Seefahrt. Nachdem im 18. Jahrhundert erkannt worden war, dass Sauerkraut Skorbut verhindern kann, wurde auf deutschen Schiffen als Proviant auch Sauerkraut gereicht. In der englischen Marine wurde der Mangelerkrankung mit Zitronensaft Einhalt geboten.    Unter dem Titel ?Krauts ver?ffentlichte Johann Corinth seine Erlebnisse als Kriegsgefangener in den USA und Einwanderer 1952 nach Kalifornien. (260 illustr. Seiten, ISBN 3-935111-14-2)    In England war als abwertende Bezeichnung fr Deutsche neben ?Kraut auch ?Fritz (Koseform von Friedrich), ?Hun (engl. fr Hunne), ?Heini und ?Jerry (vermutlich von German) in Gebrauch.    Abwandlungen sind Krautland, das als Synonym fr Deutschland Verwendung fand, sowie die Bezeichnung Krautrock fr den deutschen progressiv Rock der sp?ten 1960er und 1970er.

The word covers people who have legitimate claims, and people who have made up claims.  ------  The best known "pretender" to the throne of UK is called the Jacobian claim. James II succeeded to his throne on the death of his brother but he was openly Catholic (unlike his brother who was a closet Catholic). He had so many battles with parliament that he fled the country (to France) fearing for his life. Parliament "declared" that by leaving the country he had abdicated and they gave the throne to his daughter and her husband (also her first cousin). They were the co-monarchs William and Mary. James claimed that he had never abdicated (his right to the throne was vigorously defended by Scotland). His claim was carried on by his son, and his grandson. It was so bad that no monarch visited Scotland for 140 years. The current claim to the throne via the Jacobian line is an old man who lives in Germany. After a few generations, these descendants no longer pursued the claim.  -------  When George I was selected as king, over 50 people with a stronger blood claim were passed over. They were also passed over because they were Catholic. Perhaps this man is a descendant of this line.  ------  Another source of pretenders is a law the Henry the 8th passed that said if all of his children died he wanted the throne to go to the descendants of his younger sister (instead of his older sister). He wanted the throne to stay with the English, instead of the Scottish. His law was never followed, and the line ended up with James I of Scotland. Perhaps this man follows this line.  -------  There are several other claimants that have a lot less credibility. Usually on chargesof illegitimacy. Frequently there are rumours of illegitimacy with every royal. Prince Harry gets it in the present day. In the 1960's it was rumoured that Andrew and Edward were actually not Prince Philip's children.    EDIT: I should add that since the "Act of Settlement" was passed in 1701 there have been no pretenders to the throne. Since the Act of Settlement overides any blood claims from before that date, there are no pretenders recognized by parliament.|`|AA12074269	The guy didnt claim to be king - he wasn't even aware of it until the producers apporached him - so it was all media hype|`|bKjJtSRPaa	There have been many pretenders, but Prince William is by birth the right and legal claimant to the throne in that he is related through all royal lines to the throne. Where Prince Charles lacked direct lines through some royal families, Diana's bloodline made it up.|`|eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Although Yorkist and Jacobite pretenders are the most well known, the question should perhaps read which pretender?    ---The heir to Lancasterian Henry V, the victor of Agincourt, would be Capet-Bourbon,  Louis XX of France  (a.k.a. Luis Alfonso Gonzalo Victor Manuel Marco de Borbon y Martinez-Bordiu), according to French Legitimists. Also, the current pretender to the French throne, Louis Alphonese, Duke of Anjou (b. 1974 in Madrid, Spain), is furthermore the great grandson of Alfonso XIII of Spain and first cousin once removed from King Juan Carlos of Spain--not to mention a "hunk"!  He has lived in Venezula since 2005 and works for Banco Occidental de Descuento.   His only child, Eugenia, was born  March 5, 2007, in Miami, Florida.    ---Heir to the Yorkist succession and a descendant of George Plantagenet, Michael Edward Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun (b. 1942 in Sussex, England), is a retired scientist/rice farmer from an agricultural research institute in New South Wales, Australia, and a republican in sympathies.  Abney-Hastings' claim, which he treats as a joke, depends on the possible illegitimacy of Edward IV.       ---If the terms of Henry VIII's will had been followed, the Tudor Crown should have been passed to the descendants of his youngest sister, Mary Tudor, Queen of France, instead of through the heirs of his oldest sister, Margaret Tudor, who married James V, of Scotland.  Accordingly, George Francis William Villiers, 10th Earl of Jersey (b. 1976), as the the senior recorded heir-general of Mary Tudor is the rightful heir to the Tudor throne; that is, if Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven, had become Queen of England in 1603 in place of James I, who at the time of his succession to the English throne was James VI of Scotland.  Of course, strict legalists consider Villier's aunt, Lady Caroline Ogilvy, as the true heir to the throne.  Villiers, an actor, writer, producer, has adopted the stage name of William Villiers.    ---If Richard III is the rightful heir to the English throne, then Filmer Courtenay William Honeywood, 11th Baronet Honeywood (s.1982), is the rightful heir to the English throne.    ---Dr. Otto von Lorraine-Habsburg (b. 1912) claims to be heir to the Anglo-Saxon House of Wessex.  Then again, until 1961, he had a more recent claim as Emperor of Austro-Hungary.  Also known as Archduke Franz Joseph Otto Robert Maria Anton Karl Max Heinrich Sixtus Xavier Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius of Austria, Otto Habsburg-Lothringen is a former member of the European Parliament for the Christian Socialist Union and the honorary president of the International Paneuropean Union.  Although he lives in Bavaria, Otto is a citizen of Germany, Austria, Croatia and Hungary.  He opposed the Nazi Anschluss of Austria in 1938 and spent from 1940 to 1944 in Washington, D. C.  He is best known for striking an MP from Paisley in the face and proclaiming that the Pope is the Antichrist.  His oldest son, Archduke Karl of Austria (a. k. a. Karl Hapsburg-Lothringer), was elected to the European Parliament in 1996 for the Austria People's Party.  Since 2002, Karl has served as the Director General of the Underpresented Nations and People's Organization within the EU.  He also had a short-lived career as a game-show host on Austrian televison.    ---The heirs of Edgar the Aetheling (r. 1057-1125), who was 13 or 14 when the Normans conquered England, married into the Scottish line of kings, who in turn eventually became the Stuarts.  Francis II (b. 1933), or Franz Bonadventure Adalbert Maria Herzog von Bayern, is head of the House of Wittelsbach and the great grandson of Ludwig III of Bavaria, who was deposed in 1918. "Bonnie Prince Frankie" is current senior-co-general of King Charles I of England and Scotland and considered by most Jacobites to be heir to the House of Stuart, although Franz himself does not claim this title.  Franz's father opposed the Nazi's, so the Wittelsbach family spent from October 1944 to April 1945 in the Oranienburg and Dachau concentration camps.  Franz studied business administration at the University of Munich and in Zurich.  He also collects modern art.  Since he is a life-long bachelor, his title will pass to his brother, Prince Max, who has no sons.  In turn, the Stuart Crown will ultimately descend to Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein (a. k. a. Sophie Elisabeth Maria Gabrielle, b. 1967), who married Prince Alois of Liechtenstein in 1993.

fQqAWGTgaa	I think if you are an alcoholic Boy Scout atheist, you will probably spend far too much time on the party circuit traveling to places like San Francisco, Key West, Provincetown MA... or living in one or more of those places to worry about being doomed.    Of course, if you are on or near that circuit, you will inevitably encounter one of the many fringe religious groups that say that you can be THAT person and still have a full and rewarding life with God.    Or not, and you live it up to the thumpthumpthump 144 beats per minute continual rave that would be your life up into your 40's, selling your art out of your significant other's gallery while complaining about how people don't give your Pomeranian enough respect on the street during parade hour.  And any doom in your future...    Well, honey that can just step A S I D E, uh huh.    And if it doesn't step aside... well, it's all the fault of the straights anyhow... and don't forget to fill it to the rim, honey, it has to mix with the salt a little.  Well, don't just stand there in that big black cloak with that huge pointy... THING on a stick, if you are gonna be all gloom while you're Doom, you might as well as have a drink while I make you wait, nes pas?    So, if you are an alcoholic Boy Scout atheist, do you care if you are doomed?  Or is life going to be one big party?  Do you want to be laid quietly in your grave as a perfectly preserved corpse, or do you want to skid into it sideways, screeching tires to collapse on the verge of total breakdown saying "Wow!  What a ride!"|`|YYbVDcw8aa	Work hard enough for your limitation and sure enough they are yours. Have a nice day.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	A gay? An atheist?  An alcoholic?

Well, a higher power can be the rest of humanity, or better still a group of people who can provide support. Or it could be an aesthetic sense. Or anything to turn the attention outward!    Alcoholism involves spending a lot of time talking bollocks and taking it seriously. That ego trip is the problem. Booze covers it up - and then makes it worse. A link beyond the ego is needed.    It does not have to involve a religious belief.
KTKxrP7naa	Daniel is right. Hardest to easiest    Japanese. Japanese is hardest because word order is most different. Although basic Japanese requires just about 2,000 kanji, higher levels require more. But even though Chinese requires more, Japanese is still harder. Morphology is more complex and syntax is more different. Also, there are many more pronunciations for the same kanji than there are for hanzi in China.    Chinese.     Arabic. The grammar won't be as hard as Japanese, the writing is easy. Diglossia will be a problem. (Look online for what that means).    Russian. This is an Indo-European language, so will be less difficult, but still hard. Complex verb conjugations and VERY complex noun and adjective declensions are hard. And lots of vocab to learn.

29258f3f6c5bf7548bbab17bd203f719aa	Check out http://www.lulu.com/ if you don't want to go the traditional route. Just know that you will have to do a lot of the marketing yourself and POD books are rarely stocked in bookstores unless you make it happen by going to each book chain or store. It usually involves keeping your own stock and sending out free copies. There is some out of pocket expense here.    If you want to go the traditional route, go to google and search for "Publishers" Religion and find publishers that publish religious books. Then you'll want to check out their writer's guidelines and make sure you follow them when submitting your manuscript. You might also want to research how to write a good query letter.    ADDED: Well, making money aside (because there is very little money in writing unless you get lucky with a bestseller or have a name that will sell)  and that's not why most authors (you included as you stated above) write anyway --- what route you take really depends on what you want your distribution to be. Big traditional publishers give your book distribution. Self publishing is the more difficult route because you want people to read it so it's up to you to market it so that they know where they can get it.    Personally - I suggest starting out self-publishing, especially if you have a specific audience you can target yourself. If the book is good enough - you would likely get offers from other publishers at some point anyway.    BTW - Lulu is a FREE publishing service, which means you don't even have to buy copies of your book if you don't want to. It's a great option for authors, especially with specialized non-fiction topics.|`|AA10976828	if it is credible and truly holy it will end up published.|`|AA10263279	Awwww, good luck on that.|`|a347f0883600af6da9f68b52ce3912c8aa	Finish writing it first.

Sadly, underappreciation is something that can seriously mar a person's life.  I'd suggest first talking to her about it and see what she is feeling toward this guy.  Tell her it bothers you that they sleep together and are so touchy.  See if there is a compromise you can come to...maybe she doesn't realize it bothers you, and if she knows it does she will work on that.

The answer to this question decides where you will be and who you will be with for eternity. All the other questions in life have to do with this life only.

For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. (1?Corinthians 15:24,?25) The Millennial Rule of the Kingdom will have fully accomplished its purpose; so no longer will there be a need for this subsidiary government to remain between Jehovah and mankind. And since sin and death will have been completely removed and mankind redeemed, the need for Jesus as a Redeemer ends. The Bible explains: Then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.1?Corinthians 15:28.    14 Following this, perfected mankind will be given the opportunity to demonstrate that their choice is to serve the only true God forever. Hence, before fully adopting them as his children, Jehovah will subject all those perfected humans to a final test. Satan and his demons will be loosed from the abyss. This will result in no lasting harm to those who truly love Jehovah. But any who disloyally allow themselves to be led into disobedience to Jehovah will be destroyed forever, along with the original rebel and his demons.Revelation 20:7-10.    15 Jehovah will then adopt as his children all the perfected humans who upheld Gods sovereignty during that final test. From that time on, they will share to the full the glorious freedom of the children of God as part of Gods universal family. All intelligent creation in heaven and on earth will once again be united in worshiping him as the only true God. Jehovahs purpose will have attained glorious success!
231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	I assume you mean the Deuterocanon/Apocrypha of the Old Testament.  Luther (along with most other Protestant groups) wanted them out because:  1.  The Jews rejected them.  Since the Old Testament is the same thing as the Jewish Tanakh, they didn't think they should be in there.  2.  They were written in Greek.    3.  The concept of Purgatory (rejected by nearly all Protestants) is based on a passage in 2 Maccabees, one of the books that was tossed (sorry, I can't find the passage right now).    The second assumption is wrong, but people at the time didn't know it.  Scholars now have copies of parts of most all of them in Hebrew and they now know that all of the questionable books were written in Hebrew, not Greek.  At the time, they only existed in Greek.  Part of II Esdras (also rejected by the Catholic Church, but accepted by the Russian Orthodox Church), I think exists only in Latin, but it, too, is believed to have been written in Hebrew.    Most Protestant groups, as I mentioned above, reject them, but some of those (including the United Methodist Church), still believe them worthy of being read, and it's a shame more people don't.  I Maccabees and II Maccabees fill in a lot of historical information that is farily accurate. They help fill in the gaps of the period (called the Intertestamental Period) between where the Old Testament and the New Testament timewise.  They discuss the Maccabean Revolt led by Judas Maccabeus, which led to Israel regaining it's independence, briefly (about 70 years) and the rededication to God after it was soiled by the Greeks (who sacrificed pigs to Zeus in the Holy of Holies).  This tale is the basis for the celebration of the Jewish holiday of Hannukah.    It might be worth mentioning that Luther also wanted to cut Revelations out of the New Testament, but decided not to (for reasons that I do not know).|`|9f7e6c706a1238a34a7fc8a9d9ed75cfaa	wanted it to be more to fit his nazi agenda|`|AA11091234	Idk, did you know some council put the bible together ?

AA11971892	I was away from the church for several years and when I first came back I understood the need for community worship.  The Holy Spirit was sending me all these people that were truly enriching my spiritual journey.  People needing help in their own apostolates, some had stories I needed to hear, some providing knowledge I would not have otherwise gleened.  It was a rich and exciting experience.  Back then I knew it was because of my devotion to the Blessed Mother and my devotion to the rosary.  That was several years ago and now it's like pulling teeth to drag myself to Mass each Sunday.  I have a wonderful priest to whom I've confessed several missed Sunday Masses and he said once, "I know God has so many graces in store for you if you will make Sunday Mass a priority."  I love Daily Mass and I love the Eucharist...I don't know.  I'd love to share more and hear more of your journey...E-mail me.

"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins." Rev. 18:4    "What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols." 2 Cor. 6:14-16    Do you really need to bow on graven images just to get you to heaven?    Do you really need a priest just to get your sins be forgiven?    Do you really need to buy RCC indulgence just to get you to heaven?    Do you really need the Vatican Office just to get you to heaven?    Do Iyou really need to pray to mary and dead saints just to get you to heaven?    Do you really need to use beads or pray the rosary to mary just get to Jesus?    Do you really need the pope to interpret the bible instead of the Holy Spirit?     Do you really need the RCC 7 sacraments just to get you to heaven?    While God delights in making things simple, The Roman Catholic Authority works dilligently to make thing complicated.

I was baptised Catholic when I was younger, but never really followed through with religion until when I was around five---when my aunts tried to drag me to Protestant Church...Church is fun when you're a kid and you don't know better; I miss my days of blind faith and my non-questioning soul. As I got older, however, I found that the teachings of the Church (other than in expressing a love for Jesus and what have you) felt as if they were manipulations of the Bible in order to place control over the members of the church. Their prayers were not my prayers; their words only angered me. Jesus would want me to pray and worship him in a way that I know how to best. Not some-- crazy jumping up and down shouting and pretending to faint on the floor NONSENSE.

34f917678352c312dd367a45cec8a80baa	According to Hesiod's Theogony, Prometheus and his brother Epimethius were the sons of the titans Iapetus and Asie (or Clymene). Although there seems to be some inconsistency about who the mother actually was, Asia, Asie, Pronoia, or Clymene. Some say Asie and Clymene were the same person.     ["Asia [was named] after the wife of Prometheus; yet the Lydians claim a share in the latter name, saying that Asia was not named after Prometheus' wife Asia, but after Asies, the son of Kotys, who was the son of Manes, and that from him the Asiad clan at Sardis also takes its name." - Herodotus, Histories]    ["Iapetus took Klymene, the light-stepping daughter of Okeanos, to be his wife ..." - Hesiod, Theogony]    [""The unhappy mother [Asia] of Prometheus." - Lycophron, Alexandra 1282]     ... and so on. In any case, the Clymene who married Iapetus is not the same as the Klymene who loved Helios.    Clymene and Iapetus were the parents of Prometheus (forethought), Epimethius (afterthought), Menoittius (violent Anger), and Atlas (endurance).     The message of Prometheus's character seems to be one of careful planning, and independent thought, and tenacity. When confronted with a problem, he applied his own logic and ideals to solving it -- then made it happen. He was more interested in results than rules. Even though his independence and willingness to stand up to authority brought him punishment in the short run, in the long run his strength of character brought him his redemption.      Prometheus is mainly known for assisting in the creation of manking, and also giving them fire.     The story varies depending on who you roll with: in some stories [Hyginus, Astronomica], Zeus took fire from mankind after a dispute and Prometheus brought it back. But in most, [Hesiod, Diodorus,Aeschylus] it was Prometheus who brought men fire to begin with.     The Hyginus story seems more linear: at first, Prometheus helped men decieve Zeus into taking the worst parts of the animals as the sacrifical share. In anger, Zeus took fire away from mankind. Prometheus stole it back by hiding it in a fennel stalk.     In the other stories, Prometheus and his brother Epimethius were charged with endowing the animals and men. But unwise Epimetheus gave everything to the animals and had nothing left to give to man. So Prometheus stole fire and gave it to him, rather than leave men with nothing.     Either way, Prometheus's punishment for this was to be chained to a rock, where an eagle would tear his liver by day, but he would heal overnight so he could endure the torture again the next day. In addition, Zeus vented his anger on mankind by sending Pandora and loosing evils on the world.     Prometheus eventually gained his release. Later, Zeus wanted to marry Thetis. But Prometheus knew that Thetis would bear him a som who would surpass him, in the same way Zeus himself had overthrown Cronos. In exchange for his release, Prometheus warned Zeus and prevented the marriage.    Other fun facts about Prometheus:   1. The blood that dripped from his body was made by Hecate into a potion that would make a man invincible.   2. After the creation of men, he created Veritas (Truth) to regulate their behavior. But he was called away in the middle of making her, and his apprentice Dolous (Trickery) used the opportunity to fasion a statue exactly like her which he named Mendacium (Lies). But Dolus ran out of clay before he made her feet. Prometheus, impressed, decided to fire both sculptures anyway, which is why Truth stands on its own, but Falsehood is unsteady.   3. Prometheus was the father of Deucalion, the central charater of the one of the first stoes in which the gods used a flood to exterminate man except for a sole survivior who was charged with repopulating the world. The story is similar to the story of Unapashtim in the epic of Gilgamesh, the first story of its type. This is the story that was later assimilated by Christianity to become the story of Noah.|`|0cdefad0930a7dc8967870a189afdcafaa	Prometheus was a Titan.  The Titans were the beings that were around before the Greek Gods...allegedly.  It was Prometheus that stole fire from the Gods and gave it to man.  For his punishment, he was chained to a mountain and every day, an eagle would come, tear open his stomach, and devour his liver.  This of course, caused him to die, but he would be reborn every day to go through the torment again.|`|f813b7d6bc6ff684db72590fc7b555a8aa	It's a spaceship on Stargate SG-1.|`|ba90e31cdcaee90377c1d7568f33c9c3aa	Prometheus was a Titan who stole fire from the Gods and gave it to mortals.

a331130459f807c1e6a9ea1064fdf8c4aa	:Add this to your repertoire:    My wife is a Catholic. When Katrina happened, the Pope told all of his priests to hand out Katrina envelopes for donations to Katrina victims.    Then the Pope collected those envelopes and gave those envelopes and only those to Katrina victims.     The Pope never gave one cent of his money. But, he claimed credit for that huge donation.    It gets worse: Every penny my wife tithes goes straight to the Pope. Then if the church need something they must get the money by running Bingo Parlors, and special carnivals, and cake sales, and building fund donations.    The Pope never gives any money back to our church to help "keep it running".     Yes, Catholic churches can declare bankruptsy. Cause, the Pope will not bail them out.    And, what does the Pope do with all that money?

7aa3a8df9c40d0ee6666c8ae9adf13ccaa	No, Jesus was not a vegetarian. The Bible records Jesus eating fish (Luke 24:42-43) and lamb (Luke 22:8-15). Jesus miraculously fed the crowds fish and bread, a strange thing for Him to do if He was a vegetarian (Matthew 14:17-21). In a vision to the Apostle Peter Jesus declared all foods to be clean, including animals (Acts 10:10-15).    You don't need to continuously re-baptize yourself, one time is enough. Baptism is a sacrament between you and God. Once you have "washed away" your sins and accepted the Holy Spirit into your soul. Did God not do it right the 1st time? it is the same as repenting for a sin, once you have done so, God doesn't want to hear about it again to keep bringing it up would be the same as telling God you don't believe he has forgiven you|`|AA10976828	john the baptizer was not jesus' teacher, he was the voice in the wilderness preparing the way for jesus. jonh baptized with water but jesus baptized with the spirit. some meats were also acceptable to eat within the jewish community and it is absurd to think everyone was vegetarian. besides the dietary laws of the old testament do not apply to us,the children of the new covenant made between god and humanity through jesus who perfected the laws and conquered death for our salvation, go ahead and repent before your meals, if you even want to be vegetarian go for it buit what you are saying isn't tradition lost in church theology.|`|bdfa59d7b07a9f8d87b377a23b2a1873aa	Peace!

He just said not to eat anything unclean, and everything unclean was made clean through Jesus.  All through the bible, people are recorded eating meat.  There were laws about it in Leviticus, people couldn't eat meat with the blood still in it, and things like that, but nowhere is there record of vegitarianism.

For example, a woman would traditionally take a ritual bath every month when her period is over.  Some very traditional Jews still practice this regularly, and I remember reading a couple of years back that the Mikveh was making a comeback within contemporary Jewish circles as well.      There are other groups that use ritual baths, though I can't think of specifics right now, except for the "dunking" after a sauna or sweat lodge.    As far as I know, most Christians view baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event (or twice in a lifetime for anabaptists, such as Mennonites, who baptise children as a precautionary measure and then rebaptise adults when they come to it of their mature free will), but that doesn't mean you can't develop your own bathing ritual if it helps you to get closer to your God, especially as your post seems to suggest that you are already practicing a sort of self-guided spiritual journey.|`|AA10691438	They were not vegitarians, Jesus ate and served fish and they also had a lamb at the last supper.

There is a minor tradition in the Catholic Church where holy water is used upon entering and leaving, but that is not baptism.    http://www.scripturecatholic.com/sacrame...    The cleansing rituals the Jews practiced uses the same word as baptism, but it has a different meaning in the Christian sense of the sacrament of baptism.     Matt. 20:22-23; Mark 10:38-39; Luke 12:50 - Jesus also talks about His baptism (from "baptizo") of blood, which was shed and sprinkled in His passion. But this baptism does not (and cannot) mean immersion.     Mark 7:3 - the Pharisees do not eat unless they wash ("baptizo" ) their hands. This demonstrates that "baptizo" does not always mean immersion. It can mean pouring water over something (in this case, over their hands).     Mark 7:4 - we see that the Jews washed ("bapto" from baptizo) cups, pitchers and vessels, but this does not mean that they actually immersed these items. Also, some manuscripts say the Jews also washed (bapto) couches, yet they did not immerse the couches, they only sprinkled them.     Luke 11:38 - Jesus had not washed ("ebaptisthe") His hands before dinner. Here, the derivative of "baptizo" just means washing up, not immersing.     Acts 2:41 - at Peter's first sermon, 3,000 were baptized. There is archeological proof that immersion would have been impossible in this area. Instead, these 3,000 people had to be sprinkled in water baptism.     Acts 8:38 - because the verse says they "went down into the water," many Protestants say this is proof that baptism must be done by immersion. But the verb to describe Phillip and the eunuch going down into the water is the same verb ("katabaino") used in Acts 8:26 to describe the angel's instruction to Phillip to stop his chariot and go down to Gaza. The word has nothing to do with immersing oneself in water.     http://www.scripturecatholic.com/baptism...    .|`|89f786c0c9b6a75e8b3d5cb53fa0c5c9aa	You have an advantage over the majority of Christians, you have read Jewish texts, AND the Bible.

Seanan was the name of 20 Irish saints, including Saint Senan of Iniscathy. Shannon, Senan, Sinon. The variations stem from that core word, and probably simply come from people who adopted the surname "the Old" as their last names.    Its also possible that its a varient of Sean, meaning "God's gracious gift"; It'd stem from 'John' a derivitive from the Norman-French name Jehan.

Why do you do such things?|`|AA11009744	The History of the Roman Catholic Church covers a period of just under two thousand years, making the Church one of the oldest religious institutions in history. As one of the oldest branches of Christianity (the Eastern Orthodox and some other churches are also "apostolic" in origin -- i.e., they also date their origins back to the founding of the Christian Church at the time of the Apostles), the history of the Roman Catholic Church plays an integral part of the History of Christianity as a whole. For the sake of simplicity, the term "Catholic Church" as it is used in this article refers specifically to the Catholic Church founded in Rome, and presided over by their governing Bishop, commonly known as the Pope.    The history of the Catholic Church is vast and complex, covering many different eras in which the Church was a key influence in the course of European and world civilization. Yet, the Catholic Church is basically unchanged in its substantial teachings and organisation since the dawn of the Christian era in the first century.    Over time, schisms have disrupted the unity of Christianity. The two largest of these involved the separation from the Catholic Church of Orthodox Christianity the (East-West Schism) and Protestantism (the Reformation) respectively. The Catholic Church has been the moving force in some of the major events of world history including the Evangelization of Europe and Latin America, the spreading of literacy and the foundation of the Universities, hospitals, monasticism, the development of Art, Music and Architecture, the Inquisition, the Crusades, an analytical philosophical method, and the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe in the late 20th century.  The Catholic Church's institutional basis is the the person and teachings of Jesus as described in the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These describe Jesus as an observant Jewish carpenter from the region of Galilee, who was both the promised Messiah or anointed one (Christos in Greek, giving rise to the title Jesus Christ) and son of God, in fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy. Catholicism thus considers itself a successor religion to Judaism with the Christian God and the God of the Jews seen as one and the same.  To Simon Peter, Jesus had earlier stated that he would entrust to him the keys to Heaven and that upon the "rock" (Latin Petrus) of Peter he would found his Church. The Catholic Church sees its history as beginning at this point, with the Pope as the successor of Saint Peter.     The office of universal ecclesiastical history is, as its name implies, to exhibit a well-balanced description of all phases of ecclesiastical life. The investigation and treatment of the various phenomena in the life of the Church furnish the material of which universal church history is built. It must first treat of the one true Church which from the time of the Apostles, by its uninterrupted existence and its unique attributes, has proved itself that Christian association which is alone in full possession of revealed truth: the Catholic Church. It must, moreover, deal with those other religious associations which claim to be the Church of Christ, but in reality originated through separation from the true Church. The Catholic historian does not admit that the various forms of the Christian religion may be taken, roughly speaking, as a connected whole, nor does he consider them one and all as so many imperfect attempts to adapt the teachings and institutions of Christ to the changing needs of the times, nor as progressive steps towards a future higher unity wherein alone we must seek the perfect ideal of Christianity. There is but one Divine revelation given us by Christ, but one ecclesiastical tradition based on it; hence one only Church can be the true one, i. e. the Church in which the aforesaid revelation is found in its entirety, and whose institutions have developed on the basis of this revelation and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. To assume equality among the various forms of the Christian religion would be equivalent to a denial of the Divine origin and supernatural character of the Church.     While, however, the Catholic Church is the central subject of universal ecclesiastical history, all other forms of the Christian religion must also be considered by it, for they originated by secession from the true Church, and their founders, in so far as each form can be traced back to a founder, were externally members of the Church. Some of these separated bodies still retain among their institutions certain ecclesiastical forms which were in common use at the time of their separation from the Church, wherefore a knowledge of such institutions is of no little use to students of ecclesiastical conditions previous to the separation. This is true in a special manner of the Oriental Christian communities, their liturgy and discipline. Moreover, such schismatic bodies became, as a rule, the bitterest enemies of the Church; they harassed and persecuted its faithful adherents and endeavoured in every way to induce them also to secede. New doctrinal discussions arose as a result of these secessions, ending usually in fuller and more exact statements of Christian teaching, and new methods had to be adopted to nullify the attacks made by apostates on the Catholic Faith. In this way non-Catholic communities have often indirectly influenced the development of the interior life of the Church and the growth of new institutions.     The vast material which, from these points of view, a universal history of the Church must treat, calls of course for methodical arrangement. Ecclesiastical history has generally been divided into three chief periods, each of which is subdivided into shorter epochs characterized by changes of a less universal nature.

Read the Gospel of John, and while you do, keep your eye on the side of your page where it lists scriptures in the Old Testament.  Then, look up that Scripture and see the similarity, or prophesy fulfilled.  Psalms 22 is a description of Christ's crucifixion, and you will find similar passages in the Gospel of John.      Even John the Baptist.  In the Gospel of John, at the beginning chapters, it talks about John the Baptist, and one thing he told the Pharisees was "I am a voice crying out in the wilderness: Make way for the Lord."  Look to the side of the page, and you will find an Old Testament passage which will say the same thing.    I hope this helps you.

You may note that the New Testament quotes don't exactly match the Old Testament verses because the writers of the New Testament wrote in Greek.  Their Bible would have been the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures.  Most Bibles nowadays translate their Old Testament from the Hebrew.  Sometimes this puts an interpretation in the quote that doesn't seem apparent in the original.      The most notable example is  Isaiah 7:14, which has Isaiah's prophecy to King Ahaz: "A young woman will be with child and bear a son..."  The Hebrew word "almah" indicates a "young woman".  The Greeks translated it "parthenos", which means "virgin".  Matthew 1:23 applies the Greek version to Mary, the mother of Jesus, but many Bible scholars say that was not the original meaning of the verse.  Isaiah was refering to Ahaz's wife, who was not a virgin.    If you have a Bible with cross-references in it.  You might look up some of the Old Testament references and see how they differ from the New Testament versions.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The gospel of Matthew often makes reference to the old testament.|`|616ea6a97bb1635f1f5594ca5497b699aa	The book of Revelation is more an old testament book than a new testament book.

If you get/borrow/buy etc a study Bible it will give occasions where the two coincide [down in the notes, or footnotes]. For example the Christ is prophesied in the OT and comes amongst us in the New. All of the laws are OT [Deut, Levit etc] and then [some of them are] further spoken of in the New.....

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Yes.  The Thessalonian Christians were apparently very concerned about their Christian loved ones who had died.  They expressed their concern to the apostle Paul.  So, in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17, Paul deals with the "dead in Christ" and assures the Thessalonian Christians that there will indeed be a reunion.  And yes, believers will recognize their loved ones in the eternal state.  We are told in 2 Samuel 12:23 that David knew he would be reunited with his deceased son in heaven.  He had no doubt about recognizing him.  As well when Moses and Elijah (who had long passed from earthly life) appeared to Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration (Mat 17:1-8), they were recognized by all who were present.  Furthermore, in Jesus' story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31, the rich man, Lazarus, and Abraham were all recognized by each other in the intermediate state.|`|7ECTZskTaa	Yes!

AA10156073	Being goth has nothing to do with what clothes you wear or music you listen to, it is a way of thinking and seeing the world. The clothes that goths wear and the music that goths listen to is just a reflection of that mindset. Goths see that there is extreme pain and evil in the world, along with the good. Instead of condemning it or ignoring it, goths accept these things as a part of life and try and enjoy the good along with the bad, since they can't stop the bad from happening. They are not obsessed with death, they just accept it as an inevitability. They do not try and cause more pain in their (or anybody else's) lives, since there is plenty to start with.  Goths tend to be kind, intelligent, non-violent, emotional, and artistic.  And yes, goths can be African-American, or any race, for that matter.|`|5Ef9xTbbaa	Gothic is like black black clothes black make up black...black...black.

Goth people dye their hair different colors. Black people can be Goth. Hell anyone can be Goth these days.. Goth shouldn't matter what color you are!I was Goth all through out middle as well as high school! My favorite hair color was Violet so that's how I got the nickname violet! LOL Anywho...

It is not a 'heavenly language' or an 'unknown language'. What we see today in the Pentecostal and Charismatic church is absolutely Satanic and serves no purpose except to mislead potential Christians and drive people away from God.

You have no control over it, let alone know what tongue you are praying in. There are many ways that tongues are uttered. Tongues and interpretations is only one way. The apostles spoke in tongues, and people present from many different regions heard them in their own native language, each one of them, a man from Egypt heard them in Egyptian, a man from Africa in his own language, etc. There are tongues not intended for anyone to understand, but are for God alone to hear. There is what is called stammering lips, that is merely the spirit crying out to God in joy, reverence and thankfulness.

Counterfeit money that is badly printed doesn't stay in circulation very long, but if it is accurately printed it can sometimes cause considerable damage to our economic system  We must take the time to discover the characteristics of the genuine gift of tongues in order that we might compare what we hear, and evaluate it as true or false.  It is the glory of the Spirit to uplift the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. The mark of the Spirit-filled church is not a church that talks about the Spirit, it is a church that talks about Christ. The mark of the Spirit-filled person is not a person who is concerned and talking continually about the Spirit, but it is a person who is concerned and talking continually about the glory of Jesus Christ. This is the work of the Spirit in our lives.  in love. samuel

You can remember it like this: 3 letters in Old, 9 letters in Testament.|`|e8f00e637d3e1e5f68b38c794e7ad823aa	11 We today list 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures; the traditional Jewish canon, while including these same books, counts them as?24. Some authorities, by putting Ruth with Judges and Lamentations with Jeremiah, counted the number of books as 22, though still holding to exactly the same canonical writings. This made the number of inspired books equal the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.

Protestants number the Old Testament books at 39, while the Jews number the same books as 24. This is because the Jews consider Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles to form one book each, group the 12 minor prophets into one book, and also consider Ezra and Nehemiah a single book. The Roman Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox include books removed by Martin Luther, called the deuterocanonical books, which Protestants exclude as apocryphal. The basis for these books is found in the early Koine Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible. This translation was widely used by the Early Christians and is the one most often quoted (300 of 350 quotations including many of Jesus' own words) in the New Testament when it says the same things as in the Old Testament.|`|TLCh2G98aa	There are 39 books in the Old Testament.

I think that's significant.  Evidently, they felt that physical appearance was a totally irrelevant and unimportant issue.  Why, then, does society continue to make such a big thing out of looks?  Probably Jesus looked like a typical middle-eastern man, but whether he was tall or short or muscular or wiry or anything else is beside the point.  As to depictions of him as looking European, that is just the wish to identify more closely with him by making him look familiar.  European artists make him light-skinned, African artists make him dark-skinned, and Latino artists make him medium-brown.  Since we don't know what he looked like, every artist is free to imagine him as looking like his own neighbors.|`|4BhIk9V0aa	You're not a christian are you?

Shem was father of all Jews.|`|9CNrAXHNaa	I believe he was Jewish, because if he wasn't, then why in the bible he was called "The King of Jews".|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	He may have been 'white looking'. None of us know. I have seen on the 'history type channels ' renditions of Jesus appearing as a thought to be stereotypical Jewish person from Israel at that time. I do find a question that arises with that though. We can think that Mary was the typical appearing Jew back then, but what did God bring into play? We don't know!    So since there really isn't anything to guide us to thinking that he looked too different-- like a scripture that says he was really tall, or a smaller than 'normal' man, then I think that it's safe to assume that he looked not too much different than other men; that is, there was no attribute to his physical nature other than he appeared to be without blemishes, since the type of the Passover lamb had to be without blemish-- carrying that physical attribute to the manifestation of Jesus. Yet he had a scar before his crucifixion-- he was circumcised after all.    I think that the main reason why he appears in movies as white is that it sells more movies, and most of the actors are quite good, I think.|`|9ceb8703bde0f3a4c3b8c37576bca3faaa	he was olive middle eastern looking|`|1ab60ac1c1adf647bc72e1512c32b096aa	He was Jewish.

It is a season for reflection and taking stock. Lent originated in the very earliest days of the Church as a preparatory time for Easter, when the faithful rededicated themselves and when converts were instructed in the faith and prepared for baptism. By observing the forty days of Lent, the individual Christian imitates Jesus withdrawal into the wilderness for forty days. All churches that have a continuous history extending before AD 1500 observe Lent. The ancient church that wrote, collected, canonized, and propagated the New Testament also observed Lent, believing it to be a commandment from the apostles. (See The Apostolic Constitutions, Book V, Section III.)

Instead of giving something up for Lent, I try to concentrate on an attitude or an action that needs correcting in my life. This year, I'm going to work on my sarcasm.

During Lent we remember how much Jesus loves us  enough to give His life to save us from our sins.    Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and lasts all the way to Easter, a 46 day period. If all Sundays are excluded, which have never been days of fasting, there are 40 days of Lent. This reminds us of the 40 days that our Lord spent in the wilderness before He began His public ministry. Moses also fasted and prayed for 40 days. Elijah fasted for 40 days and nights.    The date of Lent is determined by the date of Easter. The Council of Nicea determined in 325 A.D. that Easter would be observed on the first Sunday following the 14th day of the Paschal Moon. The earliest that Lent can begin is February 5th. That happened last in 1818 and did not occur again during the 20th Century. The latest that Lent can start is March 10th. It wont be that late until the year 2038.    Lent is not a time of fasting or of giving up certain sins. If a thing is wrong on Labor Day or on the Fourth of July, it is also wrong on Ash Wednesday or Good Friday. If giving up certain foods helps one person to draw closer to the Lord, let him fast. But he should fast in secret, lest he, like the Pharisees, who fasted to be seen of men, fall into the sin of pride and self-righteousness. Not what a person gives up, but what he receives from God will make Lent blessed.|`|yb5fqHWXaa	Lent is the 40 days preceding Easter (excluding Sundays).  It begins on something called Ash Wednesday, this year on Feb 21.  The 40 days corresponds with the 40 days Jesus spent in the wilderness facing fasting and temptation.

For, of a certainty, they did not slay him:       5:110 Lo! [131] God will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember the blessings which I bestowed upon thee and thy mother-how I strengthened thee with holy inspiration, [132] so that thou couldst speak unto men in thy cradle, and as a grown man; and how I imparted unto thee revelation and wisdom, including the Torah and the Gospel; [133] and how by My leave thou didst create out of clay, as it were, the shape of [thy followers'] destiny, and then didst breathe into it, so that it might become, by My leave, [their] destiny ; [134] and how thou didst heal the blind and the leper by My leave, and how thou didst raise the dead by My leave; [135] and how I prevented the children of Israel from harming thee when thou camest unto them with all evidence of the truth, and [when] those of them who were bent on denying the truth were saying, `This is clearly nothing but deception!"'|`|7ECTZskTaa	Jesus (PBUH) is already a Muslim.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Contractarianism, which stems from the Hobbesian line of social contract thought, holds that persons are primarily self-interested, and that a rational assessment of the best strategy for attaining the maximization of their self-interest will lead them to act morally (where the moral norms are determined by the maximization of joint interest) and to consent to governmental authority.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	"Any of various theories that justify moral principles or political arrangements by appealing to a social contract that is voluntarily committed to under ideal conditions for such commitment".      Contractarianism is a moral theory saying that moral rules are a sort of a contract, and therefore only beings who can understand the terms of the contract are bound by it.    So, strictly speaking, moral rules should apply only to behaviour among normal adult human beings, but they could be extended to also cover beings that the people who entered the contract care about, like their children for example, for reasons of indirect duty. Other groups who could be protected by the moral rules of the contract in this indirect way are, shall we say, the groups protected by political correctness, that is whoever the majority of the human population cares enough about or anyway whoever it is considered a duty to care about by what happens to be the current ideological orthodoxy.    One problem with contractarianism is that it betrays the very purpose of philosophy.    Since its beginning in ancient Greece, philosophy has always had the role of challenging the ideas currently held by the majority.    A moral theory that, in principle, simply justifies and accepts whatever the majority happens to believe is more than a philosophical failure: it is a complete redundancy. People do what they like to do and what theyve always found it easy to do anyway, there is no need for philosophers to pat them on the back and say: Well done!.|`|TXqzKFP1aa	wow, that is a big word|`|AA10811456	i agree- it's a big freakin' word|`|AA10529872	The theory of the social contract is based on the assumption that all men live in a state of nature which is not ideal. In order to move away from these conditions men enter into a contract with each other, allowing them to live in peace and unity. The theory of the social contract can be seen as a justification for the formation of the state. All members within a society are assumed to agree to the terms of the social contract by their choice to stay within the society without violating the contract; such a violation would signify a problematic attempt to return to the state of nature. It has been often noted, indeed, that social contract theories relied on a specific anthropological conception of man as either "good" or "evil". Thomas Hobbes (1651), John Locke (1689), and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762) are the most famous philosophers of contractarianism, which is the theoretical groundwork of democracy. It is also one of a few competing theoretical groundworks of liberalism, but Rousseau's social contract is often seen as conflicting with classical liberalism which stresses individualism and rejects subordination of individual liberty to the "general will" of the community.[1] There is also an example of it in Plato's writings of Socrates in Crito when Socrates refuses to escape from jail and remains to fulfill his death sentence.|`|d18a7c1a67198c269bf100c4f1e7500caa	The theory of the social contract is based on the assumption that all men live in a state of nature which is not ideal.

Of course not!    Most of us stay in the Religion of our parents and if someone has believed in a good God and tried hard to be a nice person because of it, then I would not want them punished, just because they picked the wrong God. After all, we cannot KNOW out God is the right one, it is all a matter of faith (literally).    Likewise, if I have chosen the wrong God, I would not like to think I would be condemned for all time, after all, I have no way of telling who is the right God. If I have tried hard to be a good person, then I would like God (whichever one!) to take that into account and judge me for what I tried hard to do and not the "luck" of being born into a family already of that Religion.

jB5cMnGFaa	I just feel that you are still young and the boy isn't all that mature yet and still testing the waters. Just continue to smile and feel good about yourself because it isn;t personal about you--although it hurts to have soemone give you attention and then withdraw it and redirect it to someone else you will get over it quickly as long as you are strong from within. He is just a boy and you have lots and lots of time to socialize and meet lots of boys. But if you allow his behavior to bring you down and allow it to show in front of others then you will be carrying this negative vibe around you that even if not seen will be felt and eventually it could show on your expression too.  My feeling is he isn't worth bringing yourself down over--remain true to you and smile at school...and if you need to get this hurt out of you write it down at home in a personal journal. Read it back once in a while to see how far you have grown and also to remind yourself that his behavior isn't all that much to lose sleep over. :)  I just heard 15 & Kyle if that means anything to you???

h8l1H4N4aa	I didn't see it in the movies either.  Saw it on tv on our old black and white but it didn't scare me until I had a dream later on.  It was coming in through the corner of the wall by my sister's bed.  I remember saying, (in the dream) "Get my sister first!"  and then I woke up.      I watch that everytime it's on now even though it's so corny.  I still feel good, though, at the end when all the teenagers pull together to go with the father/principal to get the CO2s.    --- CO2s, Dave!  Hey, Dave?  CO2s!!

5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Well, I'm not a man, but I think I can comment on your situation.  I too, get pretty sick of straight porn, and I absolutely love gay male porn.  It's highly superior to straight porn in numerous ways, I think (more attractive men, less misogyny, etc.).    Like you, I really love the sounds of men- the grunts, moans, groans, everything.  I don't know if the women in porn are acting it up (usually, they are), or if some of them simply make their aroused noises like that, but they are usually pretty annoying to me; only a handful of female porn stars are pleasant on my ears.  Usually, if I watch straight porn, it's with the mute on, because I can't stand to hear them shrieking.    I don't think you're a sick person- I think you're absolutely in tune with your sexuality.  You know what you like and want, and if gay male porn fits it, then enjoy it!    Hope that helps!|`|e83998d693eca0634488e3a9fd8aa407aa	This is quite common, much like straight men enjoy lesbian porn.

So your real answer is that Mormons claim the same fundamental belief in Jesus as other "Christian" religions, but Christians never agree amongst themselves...|`|uBvgbSMsaa	"Mormonism" is actually a denomination group. There are a number of small denominations that fall under this heading. The common thread being belief in the Book Of Mormon as being divine scripture equal to the Bible. The largest and best known is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons). They identify themselves as christian. If you are talking to any of them investigating the religion see ask what they think of Jesus. If they seem to teach that Jesus is the Savior of the world and their personal Lord then yes they are Christian.|`|ruenEu8Yaa	yes it is... mormons believe everything that christians do... the only difference is that mormons have a book called "The Book of Mormon"  that was translated by Joseph Smith in the 1800s.  Joseph Smith began to have doubts about his faith and went to the woods to pray.  there he had a vision of God and Jesus who told him that there were no "true" churches on the earth and that they were all missing pieces.  after this vision a few years later, Joseph Smith was guided by an angel to recover the golden plates that the book of mormon was written on to be translated...  I have grown up in the mormon faith and have gone to several (and I mean SEVERAL) other church services and worships and everything that I was taught at these churches I had also been taught at my church.    >>> southcal4life... the book of mormon and bible do not contradict each other!  there are references in the bible to the book of mormon and references in the book of mormon to the bible... in the mormon faith, the bible and the book of mormon are used hand in hand, right there with each other...|`|wG825TwBaa	by definition they are not a cult, anymore than any other religion.  Most orthodox Christians will say its a cult(but then so is everything that challenges them).  The beginning of the mormon church is strikingly similar to that of islam.  In the sense that a prophet rose up and challenged the norm in Christianity.   Mormons believe in God, Jesus, and the holy spirit.  However they believe god spoke to joseph smith and told him that all of orthodox christianity was not entirely wrong, just shifted in the wrong direction and had misinterpreted the teachings for to long.   the mormon church is based in the most basic principle of christianity and believe joseph smith was the prophet that lead them back on track to god, even though their afterlife views may be strikingly different.   It is a form a Judaism(so is islam) whether you place it in christianity or not is up to you.   orthodox christianity ends in revelations, Islam and the LDS just pick up where it left off and added to it in a way that made sense to them.   there is no way to prove who is right or who is wrong.  nor can you prove that anyone has a soul,  and for that matter which religion that souls belongs with.|`|Ul17eQDoaa	No. They are not Christian. Ask them more about this "Jesus" they believe in and ask a Christian about the Jesus they believe in - you will soon learn that they believe in a completely DIFFERENT Jesus than Christian's do.    They put Joseph Smith above Jesus. They put the BOM above the Bible. Their D & C completely contradict their BOM - does that make sense!?    They will never admit what they really believe because that would prove what freaks they are.    But hey.. I opened my heart and prayed to God and he told me that Mormonism is a bunch of lies.. now what? Did I pray to the wrong God?|`|mxAraZlsaa	Yes it is and if you actually attend a church service (which I bet none of these anti-mormons have) You can really feel the love and theme of christ all around. Walk in a building on sunday, (sunday dress), and tell any person that you want to sit in and investigate. The lord will bless you in your efforts|`|VPtqM31Paa	Yes.    Here is an answer for you from the Book of Mormon itself:    2Nephi 25:26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.    http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/25/26 ...    I'll give you a 2nd witness here too,  an official website of the Church:  http://jesuschrist.lds.org/SonOfGod/eng/    and a third too:  Articles of Faith of the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints:    1 We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.     3 We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.     4 We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.     http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1    as well as the name of the Church itself The Church of "JESUS CHRIST" of Latter-day Saints...    and my witness also that I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He was crucified for the sins of the world.|`|LcYeN6m5aa	Well they aren't Baptist or Lutheran or Evangelical or Catholic (I used to be catholic before I joined the Latter Day Saint Church) - but that doesn't make them not Christian....there ARE other denominations of Christianity....and the Latter Day Saints (LDS, or Mormons) are one of them....|`|HGadAqG9aa	id say no based on the FACT that the book of mormon and mormon beliefs contradict the bible, and do not believe the traditional christian doctrine, such as the trinity.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Wow.

There is more to being Christian than teaching "something" about Jesus Christ.|`|GPn55rjTaa	The name of the church is:    The church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter day saints.

So yes, we are follows of Christ and His teachings.|`|AA10192697	No, it is a cult started by Joseph Smith who had doubts within Christianity and his church leader.

However, it's not Trinitarian, so I think Trinitarians should call themselves Trinitarians.|`|XpaLyWYOaa	I'm sorry to be so blunt, but you people are so ignorant. Will you do your homework before making such uninformed statements? Take two seconds and go click on the links Alissa has posted in her answer. Christ is THE WHOLE focus of the Mormon church. Mormons are indeed Christian. In fact they'd prefer to be called by their actual name, The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-Day Saints. LDS or LDS church for short instead of Mormon church or Mormons. And the Book of Mormon doesn't contradict the Bible it is another testament of Christ and absolutely does not contradict the Bible at all. But then again you would have to actually read both to know that. Don't make statements unless you actually know what you're talking about.|`|sgZiOvkDaa	Considering that our very first article of our faith states -"We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost," - I'd certainly hope so!|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Absolutely, anyone saying otherwise hasn't studied it.

Check out http://www.equip.org and put in Casey Treat as a search term - I'm sure you will find it enlightening. In the meantime, pray like crazy since your husband is involved in a CULT!

They are not used in common case, for example, D?ng means Strong but "He is strong" must be known as "Anh ?y m?nh m?", neither "Anh ?y D?ng"! (D?ng is an old Chinese word)  2/ These names always have nice senses and do not have any relation with Saints nor Angels like in some Western languages. For male ones there are adjective - words expressing the intelligence - Th?ng, Minh, M?n, Sng, Quang ..., the health - D?ng, C??ng, L?c, ... and even the male beauty - Tu?n, Kh?i, T, B?nh ...  For female names there are Flowers - H?ng, Cc, Mai, Lan, ..., Feminity - D?u, Hi?n, H?nh, Th?m, ... and ofcourse, female Beauty - M?, Dung, Ki?u, Thuy, ??p, ...

Intermarriage & resulting multi-racial kids can promote acceptance. Even tho we have plenty of prejudice today, there is less than in the past. Looking to the future, there will be even less.    Knowing races other than one's own exposes one to diversity & learning experiences which might otherwise not be possible.    Multi-racial kids demonstrate that we are all human beings who have the same needs to physically survive. Kids who are exposed to diverse races/cultures are usually very accepting of others unless they've been prejudiced by persons influential/important to them.    Race is not always discernable by looks, mannerisms, etc. Not everyone should intermarry. If a person wants to intermarry, that's their choice...& they should be able to marry w/out interference or conflict from others. I can see where it would be beneficial to society, but to marry outside of one's race just for the sake of society is taking it a bit far.     We are more diverse/mixed now; I see this as a positive. Further mixing breaks down walls/stereotypes...showing we are the human race. As much as the extremists would like to prove otherwise, European-Americans aren't as 'pure' as they would like to believe.     Marry who you want. Marriage is a legal process after all!

Anyhow if more people would to intermary people of different races we would all have a better appreciation for other peoples colors and cultures, we would all have an appreciation for eachother as people more not as race. Sterotypes would most likley be broken too.
X5gmVvMDaa	u must know nothing about the qur'an becuase      26:224-227 doesn't say anything about Music being permissible!!!        Al-Shuara  As for the poets, the erring ones follow them, (224) See you not that they speak about every subject (praising people - right or wrong) in  their poetry? (225) And that they say what they do not do. (226) Except those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah  Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, and remember Allah much and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged [by replying back in the poetry to the unjust poetry (which the pagan poets utter against the Muslims)]. And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned. (227)      and 2:227 says this     And if they decide upon divorce, then Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower. (227)          The qur'an already forbids Music in surah Luqman aya 6    And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e.music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allah, or the Verses of the Qur'an) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).[] (6)           so do you really read the qur'an our are you trying to change the qur'an to your likings??? FEAR ALLAH You are talking about the Qur'an here|`|IxoBFCpTaa	A Muslim should be able to at least take an hour of spare time a day reading the Qur'aan. I read one juz per day.    The sahaabah would read the Qur'aan and complete it every three days (that's about 10 Juz a day, roughly 200 pages in a standard print.)    During Ramadhaan, they would complete it every 2 days and during the last 10 nights of Ramadhaan, they would complete it every night.    It comes in a narration that Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee used to complete the Qur'aan 60 times in Ramadhaan! That means he completed the Qur'aan twice a day in Ramadhaan.

And one more request is that... Allah has sent the quran as a challenge for the disbelievers who said that muhammed(pbuh) is lying.    And this is a question for the one who asked the question. The quran may tell you to pray 5 times a day... but it does not tell you how..

Good thing is that Allaah will protect his religion. If you choose to put yourself in his path to divert the believers off that path to Allaah, due to your own arrogance or ignorance, then you are putting yourself into a position of great difficulty and regret. Like i said, God will protect his deen so I suggest that yout take advantage of the time he has given for you and repenht and learn this religion and then teach it...    if you are however a non-muslim and only desire to distort the truth, then i suggest looking back in the pages of history and seeing how God dealt with whoever was too arrogant to submit to him and whoever tried to challenge him. And that is in this life. Then he will resurrect you and then you will see that when God promises Hell, then he never breaks his promise.    of course, crying and begging for forgiveness and relief and the chance to return to earth once more to do good deeds and not to speak about God or his religion without knowledge WILL NOT help in the hereafter.    And then you will realise who you are and who GOD is.     I suggest you consider this seriously because this matter is more serious than wagging your tongue. But of course, you have been given a limited free will in this life that God gave you... and you can choose to use that however you wish. But you should know, if you have read the Qur'aan, that actions and beliefs carry consequences with GOD, ie punishment etc.    So i suggest you repent and learn and stop trying to come in between God and his creation and attempting to make permissible what God has made forbidden. because this will only attract the anger of Allaah.     Do not think that just because you are not seeing the effects of his anger that he is not angry.. that would be called self-delusion. And the cure for that is The Fire of Hell.
b3835ed6ecba00bbca3e1188d38ea41caa	I do like him very much. Pope Benedict XVI is a man who is not afraid to proclaim the true teachings of our Faith even if it isn't popular in today's society. He makes no compromises on faith and morals, yet he is willing to reach out to other religious communities (Muslims, the Eastern Orthodox) to achieve mutual understanding.    And as for Marian devotion (which I'm rather sure the current Pope practices), it is not a bad or non-Christian thing. In my opinion, to highly value the vessel through which Christ came into the world only serves to magnify His glory, doesn't it?|`|AA11710782	He looks like a devil!|`|AA11595993	There's a new one?

In fact, there was quite a high profile incident recently where an American Messianic couple visiting Israel had to sign a declaration stating they would not engage in any conversion activities while in Israel.  All I can say is- well done Israel!    Other than that, like everyone else in Israel they have full religious freedom.    Note:  Chadocat "Messianic Jews" are NOT Jewish and every single Jewish denomination agrees on that.    http://marcl1969.wordpress.com/2008/06/2...  http://marcl1969.wordpress.com/2009/01/2... The comments on this one are ongoing and show a "Messianic Jew" doing their normal twisting, out of context quotations and making up of things to try and prove their stance!  http://marcl1969.wordpress.com/2009/01/2...|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Well, since "Messianic Jews" are Baptists in disguise...I doubt it.

Read Zechariah.  They will understand as a people when the blindness is removed, that Yeshua of Nazareth is the truly Yeshua Ha Meshyiach.  Read Romans 11.|`|trd0HmBwaa	As I read the answers to your question, I see most of these people have no clue of what they are talking about.  Messianic Jews (and the gentile Believers) are not Baptist or Catholic or any other traditional Sunday observant Christian denomination.  Those who are Jews  through study of the scriptures have accepted Yeshua as the prophesied Messiah.  We who are Gentile chose to observe, practice and honor our faith and to praise and honor Yeshua through the original practice  (Roman Catholicism was NOT the original practice of our faith).  There are many Jews in our congregation and many have accepted Yeshua at the expense of  being alienated by there families. The first believers in Yeshua were Jewish, and with the exception of Luke whose ethnicity is not known, the B'rit Hadashah (the New Covenant) was written by Jews.  The rift between Jews and Jewish and Gentile Believers did not occur until the Roman siege of Jerusalem, when regrettably the Gentile Believers abandoned the Jews.  Latter day Messianic Judaism is not a Evangelical "conspiracy".  It had it's beginnings in the 1800's (when "Christian" anti-Semitism was rampant) and was founded by Jews - again Jewish scholars who studied the scriptures with an open heart and an open mind and learned that Yeshua was the Messiah.  Now the scoffers here probably have no clue about Judaism in any form.  They just HATE the believers in Yeshua HaMashiach in any shape or form.  It's true that Messianic Jews do not observe the Talmud.  The Talmud is the oral rabbinical commentary concerning the Torah, not the Torah itself.  The Torah is the five written books of Law which are written precisely, in Hebrew without error from generation from generation for over 3000 years.  Messianic Jews are Biblical Torah observant which is a big difference from being rabbinical Talmud observant.  To answer your question:  Messianic Judaism is growing in Israel and at an astounding rate but for the time being it is not politically, socially or religiously accepted.  The time will come though.  Zechariah 12.    To Allonyoav: First I want to commend you on your civil tone in your disagreement.  We can disagree without the venom in our words.  I do understand that Orthodox, Conservative and Reform religious Jews do not accept Messianic Jews as kinsmen or part of the fold.  From my research it appears that Orthodox Judaism does not accept Conservative or Reform Judaism as true Judaism either.  A few Christian sects or denominations also believe they are the only "true Church", so even in the Christian religion there are those opinions.  I guess I need to define what I believe a true Jew is.  To me a Jew is a descendant of Abraham, Issac and Jacob.  I know that the geneological records were destroyed around 70 C.E. when Roman Legions sacked and destroyed Jerusalem but Jews even in the Diaspora have kept their families mostly intact.  I do not believe a Gentile converting into religious Judaism, whatever the sect, is a true Jew.  As for the ethnic Jews, the L-rd G-d know who His people are.  In addition, though Messianic Judaism was not as noticed then, many ethnic Jews who accepted Yeshua as the Messiah were also murdered in the Holocaust.  To anti-Semites around the world a Jew is hated no matter what his or her practice of faith is.  I read your links.  Not all Messianics are part of the Jews4Jesus campaign.  My Rabbi is actually opposed to their tactics.  He said they are too much "in your face" and can be quite abrasive. He wants to bring his kinsmen Jews to know Yeshua but he wants to bring them through example and personal, open, and voluntary interaction.  I say again, Messianic Judaism is not some crocked up conspiracy by Catholics and Evangelicals to "trick" Jews into their religion.  Those misconceived remarks that suggest such are really laughable, I mean actually humorous.  Before the practice of Messianic Judaism became as available as it is today, when a Jewish person wanted to accept Yeshua (Jesus Christ) to honor, praise and worship Him they had to assimilate into one of the various Gentile practices, which truthfully had many pagan aspects, example being Christmas and Easter practices.  This Jewish person wanted to retain his identity and observe the Torah, celebrate the festivals, the feast and high holidays commanded by the Torah to celebrate for ALL TIME.  With Messianic Judaism this person may keep the Biblical Sabbath, acknowledge the G-d of his fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, recite the Sh'ma and liturgy and still honor, thank, praise and worship the Messiah.  He (or she) does so at great sacrifice, becoming alienated by their kinsmen and often their family.  Lastly in regard to the original question.  I find it quite peculiar that in the Law of Return an avowed atheist, one who denies there is a G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob yet they can make Aliyah if they have at the minimum a Jewish mother.  However, a Messianic Jew that acknowledges and worships the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a person such as my Rabbi who can document his Jewish ancestory, from both his mother and father four generations he cannot make Aliyah because he is a known Messianic Rabbi.  Don't get me wrong, I stand behind the State of Israel and the homeland of the Jewish people but I do find this law puzzling.|`|QyzQDyOwaa	Some Jews are strongly against Messianic Jews. I can't speak directly on Israel but we do know that many Jews will accept anything but MJ's. A recent question proves this point. The focus of the question was "...would you PERSONALLY feel comfortable welcoming me not just as a fellow congregant at your Synagogue, but as a member of the Tribe?" So he was clearly asking about converting to Judaism not becoming part time or seeking an associate status as some continually suggest.    The response was "Reform Judaism covers a wide swath of beliefs and practices and I am sure you will be wholly accepted. ... I personally would accept you whole heartily as a fellow Jew."     I cannot post a link to the question you can search for it the head line for the question was "Question about Reform Judaism membership...?". I if you copy & paste it to your search window at the top of the page it should come up quickly.     This would suggest an almost irrational bias by some against MJ's since a Pagan that worships a Fire God is welcomed to "join the tribe".  Yet if you come to believe the Yeshua (Jesus) is the Messiah your goose is cooked! All Jews are not like this but the prejudice against Messianics is substantial.|`|5RmhSDPTaa	i have friends who live in Israel and they are Messianic Jews, formerly Hasidim.  and yes, they are accepted there.  Israel does not have a religious government.    and a note for "kismet";  we are not Christians and Jews at the same time, hon, we are Jews - completely.  we are Torah-observant and while we embrace the Jewish Messiah, His name is not Jesus, His name is Yeshua.  the name "Jesus" is an English translation from the Hellenic Greek translation from the Latin translation!  no wonder it's wrong!    delme|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Define 'accepting'. Israel, like all of Judaism accepts 'Messianics' right to practice as they see fit.    Where we draw the line is their insistence on redefining Judaism to include worship of a human, even if that humanity was momentary.    Messianics consistently refuse to understand that.|`|qEqMRTQkaa	They seem to have become more prevalent in the last few years which may explain the hostility on Yahoo by some.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	There are many Messianic Jews in Israel, including many Rabbi's who  keep it secret as its not readily accepted.

Very very sad indeed.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	Oh yeah, There are many Jewish converts to Catholicism.

XmJZkFuMaa	Big families, lots of kids.  Sometimes very inclusive and supportive and strengthening, other times hiding behind tradition.  HUGE Jello lovers... as in it was like named the "dessert" of Utah, and you can find jello dessert recipes by the boatloads... I mean... I know folks who have put jello in meatloaf.  O_O  And the weird thing is?  It tasted GOOD!    Very women empowering, no matter what people said... I was always being pushed to do my best, to be my best, to learn and study and go to college, to not define myself by a man.  Yes, when I got married it was expected I'd have kids... but being a single woman isn't nearly as hard as it is being a single man.    Let's see... culturally, a lot of family and religious involvement.  As in, 3 hours of church a week, usually as much as an hour or two of meetings.  For teens... there was a mid-weekly girls-meeting for close to 2 hours, every morning there was seminary (an hour long usually), besides church on Sunday.  I remember Saturday as my ONLY day off from church.  :P  Family wise, you have "family time" Sunday afternoon, "Family Night" monday nights, and are encouraged to eat dinner together every night, have scripture studies once a day, and family prayers in the morning and at night at least.  So, as a teen it was VERY busy normally.    Folks generally don't drink, smoke, swear, or do drugs.  They typically avoid caffeine.  What does this mean?  Well... best example I can think of is when I babysat for a family and their kids couldn't watch "A Nightmare Before Christmas" because he said "By God" in it.  That's the extreme, but I never ran into another family that watched their kid's TV swearing to that extreme, you know?    And then people are just plain normal... you run into every problem in the real world, and the people have to deal with it.  Just, their approach may be a bit different compared to some out there.  Marriage difficulties typically get counseling before divorce.  Generally, the people I've been around try to be more loving.  But I've heard some horror stories out there too.  :(  People are people.  They're not perfect.    So that's Mormon culture.  From a historical aspect... it's hard for Mormons on a whole to ignore the fact that they had an extermination put out against their religion, and tend to be very involved in the government partly for fear of it happening again.  At least, that's what I see.    Add:  Wow... no music, pictures, what???  I don't know where you live, but that's not typical mormons.  Mormons sing.  They believe that music is the song of the soul, and we have actual commandments about singing.  Reading good books is also looked at as prophetical counseling, so most Mormons I know read and read and read.  Everything that can be considered "good" (ie, Harlequin isn't going to be read by most Mormons).  And artists... every month I get church publications one for my daughter and one for me.  My daughter's is for little kids and is full of art, both by little kids and professional works.  Mine has 2 main ones that I typically cut out and put into frames since usually they're very pretty.  But sometimes they have pages devoted JUST to art...    Not to mention our fascination with statues.  And then craft type art, like quilts.  We might not have great tastes all of us, but I've never been in a home where there's not art.    Add:  On the note of art, here's an article of faith.  Most Mormons try to follow it, especially the last part, when it comes to art, music, literature, etc.  There's a reason BYU has a very large art and music program.  Shoot, there's a reason I accidentally got the first music minor at my school (ie, they approved it the last year I was there because I had enough credits for one and my music professor submitted my name for it as proof it could be done... I went to non-religious school.)  Art is a huge part of being a Mormon.    "13 We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of PaulWe believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. "|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	We're really focused on the family.   And we make super good funeral potatoes.

There is a widely-practiced tradition of "Family Home Evening" every week in which everyone in the family devotes the evening to playing games, singing, reading the Book of Mormon or Bible, praying, and just getting closer to each other.    Faithful Mormons tend to be very socially conservative, being pro-life and against gay marriage.    There is a constant missionary zeal in the religion, and there is little question that the Mormon child will spend his or her first year or so out of college as a missionary.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Quite frankly, from what I've seen of Mormon homes (and I've been in a LOT of them - very long story), "Mormon" and "culture" are contradictions in terms.  No books; no recordings; no art work (even little stuff); stuffy, conservative thinking all 'round.  Totally afraid of anything that might make them actually THINK.    Of course, how classy can a person who goes to church in a temple with a bad statue of a gold angel named Moroni blowing a trumpet from the top of a steeple be???

It should be noted that the stereotypical view of the past no longer is true -- Mormons typically do not wear beards, women dress as they please, pretty much as most women dress -- hairstyles are all over the place, they are often your neighbors and you'll never notice except when they share their religious convictions. LDS love to socialize, dance, get involved in community affairs and help where they can. They are largely well-educated and treasure family life and being central to their society.    Some well-known Mormons include Gladys Knight (of the Pips fame) and Steve Young, a leading quarterback of the past for the San Francisco 49ers.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	It is the ancient church Christ established, with Prophets and Apostles, and it has been restored in our day.(mormon.org). get your facts from a prime source.

Also no books or pictures or anything to make us think?  Our church has always emphasized education, for the most part our homes are filled with books and artwork.

No one else is even close.   If you are going to or all ready are looking things up on the internet then be very careful about where you get your information. When it comes to information about the church there are basically 3 groups of people.   Those who support the Church, those who hate the Church, and those who know almost or absolutely nothing about the church.   The last group I listed I am sure you can figure out why you would want to be careful about going to them. You want to be careful about going to because they are so frequently peddling nothing but hate filled lies. Frequently these lies are so outlandish that anyone who is willing to take the time and think about what they are being told they will realize just how ridiculous what they are being told is. One extreme example of how ridiculous these stories can get is there are people out there who honestly believe that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have horns. But on a more serious note there are people out there who will make up something and then try to get that passed of as our beliefs. They will even go to the extent of making up a reference that they got the quote from. Others will find an actual quote from an actual member of the church but then take it so far out of context that it looses the meaning that the author meant it to have. Still others will give a quote and then put a ... in the middle of the quote they are giving and then take another section from the same source that is occasionally as far back as 3 or 4 pages later in the document.    I realize why you would want to be cautious about the idea of going to a member of the church to find out information about the church. You would most likely want to get information that is not biased towards the church, but unfortunately there are so few accurate neutral and unbiased sources of information about the church that it is almost not worth the search.   Really the best way I can see for you to get the best and least biased information you can get is to simply come and check us out yourself. If you follow the link in my sources you will get to a page that can tell you where and when the local congregations meet and you can use that to go and do a bit of research your self into what the church is like.    Best of luck on your report.    Edit:  One thing I felt i should add that hasn't been mentioned yet is we love to have fun. If we can find a reason to throw a goo wholesome party you better believe we will take it. One of the first buildings that was put up whenever the early members of our church got to a new place was (I don't remember what it is called) a place meant to hold concerts and plays in. I believe that dances were also held there as well.   There is a joke I have head members tell each other when we feel like making fun of our selves. There have been times when I have gotten the impression that this joke isn't too far from the truth. I have never actually seen or heard of it happening though.     How many Mormons does it take to change a light bulb?  26.   1 to change the light bulb.  5 to come before hand to set up for the dance.   15 to bring the refreshments.   and 5 more to clean everything up after the party is over.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	http://www.exmormon.org/tract2.htm|`|tEn2nnsuaa	their women look like horses.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	As Christians we believe in Jesus Christ and that he is the Savior of the world.

I have also always felt that when one becomes a Mormon you do CHANGE your whole LIFE, lifestyle and being a mormon is a culture in and of itself.  Mormons have different terms and attitude & shared ideals, words, meetings etc.  They are like an Island unto themselves in many ways.   Who else knows what a Ward or Stake is,  PPI, YM/YW, Primary,FHE or Stake Conference is?  We have a shared BOND with other LDS people unlike any other christian group I think. I think that is because although we are also "Christian" the mainstream christian community refuses to openly ACCEPT us in their coalition so we BOND together across the world with all other LDS members who believe as we do.  YOU can go anywhere in the world to a Mormon church and you won't miss a beat - because the same things are taught church/world wide each Sunday in every Sunday School and Priesthood meeting.  We all have a lst Sunday of the Month Fast & Testimony Meeting, we all pay tithing to help build the church & kingdom and provide aide for those in need around the world.  We all develop and seem to share a very strong WORK ETHIC and feeling of UNITY and cooperation.  IF you want something orderly, organized or DONE ask a Mormon church, group or person.  We can set up, decorate, feed, cook and then CLEAN UP faster than any organization known to man I think!   To be a mormon is to be a uniquely singular thing - unlike most other people or churches in the world and yet most Mormons are very much ALIKE in many ways although our church is as diverse as any you will find and we have converts from every walk of life and country in the world now.     Scriptures talk of the followers of Christ as being a "pecular people" and I dare say most Mormons are proud to be among that group!

But I got more like... "convicted" and/or "offended" through that.    Someone asked me how I thought I was going to get into heaven. I told them that it would be through the fact that I was such a good & nice person. They told me I was wrong, indirectly saying that I was going to hell.    That not only helped me to "Examine" myself.. but it was the beginning of a sequence of events that happened to me. It was in God's plan to happen so that I'd be drawn to Him by the Holy Spirit to get saved. It was an amazing experience.     Followed by me getting saved/born-again, September of 2005.     :D|`|OxnyOaxGaa	I have many times.     A love that saves will not be afraid to tell the 'truth' even if it hurts. It is called a rebuke or exhortation.  God himself convicts us by the Holy Spirit and other people He puts in our life. That is part of the saving process.    If you mean a Christian who insults or argues as in condeming another person because they do not know the Lord or because you are being self-righteous yes that is wrong.

I'm gay, and I've been in a *lot* of locker rooms, and seen a *lot* of naked guys. And It wasn't in any way a turn-on for me.    Because I see sexuality in terms of loving, caring human relationships, not just "poles and holes." So seeing other naked guys is not what it's about for me.    My sexuality is a part of my personality, and that includes love and respect and caring.

BhzCW1rYaa	There are many reasons that the governments of the world deny the existence of UFOs and of-course aliens...Let's suppose you had 3 questions you could ask an ET, would not one of them concern "God" and religion in general ??... Well you can bet that question has been asked and they didn't like the answer, so to keep all the "sheeple" grazing in their perspective paddocks they deny everything, cover it all up, and I suspect even murder some poor people who threaten to expose certain government departments, as to their involvement...   I am an abductee and I bring this up at all the seminars I attend...You see religion = control, that's why all the leaders of the world profess to be such devout followers of whatever religion is the most popular in their country...Religion on this planet is only on this planet and exists nowhere else in the Cosmos, it is totally man made and local...  We have been using alien technology for decades and who has what is all very secretive, so that is another point of their denial, they don't want other governments knowing what they have got, but that is a joke really, because they continue to use it so everyone knows, to a point, I do suspect they hold some back...  NASA has air brushed out the images that show structures of buildings which they have found on Mars and the dark side of the moon...The dark side of the moon has many, many structures built on it, some are huge towers... All air brushed out, but now many high ranking military personnel and scientists are blowing the whistle, and it is hard to keep a lid on things when so many people are coming forward....I ask all you skeptics, who would you rather trust, the government, the government bully boys, the government run puppet media; or a credible scientist, a 4star General, various military personnel who have worked on these Top Secret classified agendas and in places like area 51...I know who I trust and it isn't anything to do with anyone's government that's for bloody sure....  They are here now and very soon the carefully constructed house of cards is going to come crashing down around their ears...  Very soon we will have direct contact with our Cosmic brothers and sisters, and the governments of the world and the Church will have a hell of a lot of explaining to do....Look towards 2012....  In Light... )O(|`|stAeoUeSaa	Area 51 is one of many DUMBs (deep underground military bases) connected by high speed underground trains. It is where the antichrist's army and monstrosities are being built for his soon to rise 4th Reich known as THE NEW WORLD ORDER. The final brutal empire seen by the prophet Daniel and John the Revelator.      All the craft are of human origin... just antigravity New World Order military police vehicles like the TR-3B for instance. Their technology appears centuries ahead of that of the civilian population from whom they have suppressed it.

Human trafficking happens across the universe, not just across Earth.  They trade clones of us like cattle for their herds.    We want their trans-dimensional technology, and we also want to be advanced enough to escape them someday.  Spaceships and time machines.

Anyone who does a study of the old testament and compare it to ancient Sumerian writings would have to question many things. Perhaps they still want the minerals on our planet, perhaps they want something else. Maybe they like it here. Maybe think we're hysterical and this place is like Vegas compared to where they're from.    Perhaps they truly have not left. Perhaps they are here still, among us. In our governments and such.

No other species has developed in this fashion beyond our very close ancestral cousins (neanderthals for example) who are now extinct.    You have to understand, though, that language, both written and spoken, is purely invented and not a product of evolution.

There are mammals and birds that orally communicate with one another. The study of Pavlov's dogs revealed that a dog could connect one abstract idea (food) to a sound (a bell).

Your question on language would be great for a linguist.

Different groups developed distinct speech patterns, just as some of those great apes  can develop oral cues specific to a region.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	Each species has its strengths and weaknesses.

Sure, you can sterilize them - boil them in water.  Personally, I wouldn't want anything to do with them.  Lord knows that someone has done to them.

Anglo-Catholics are quite Catholic and are fond of Rome; broad church people are liberal and tollerant, while Evanglicals are as protestant as they come.|`|038469fdf218f94f0750cae7dd18e383aa	http://www.bible.ca/cath-overview-false-...|`|5a8afc0154c33bfb5ffc8b37e07733eeaa	Religion sends more people to hell than all the bartenders in town ,Call upoun the Name of Jesus and you can be saved|`|AA10976828	the website from the first answerer is a joke, if still reading try this challenge  http://www.fisheaters.com/challenge.html    roman catholic is not the same as episcopalion,episcapolian is a protestant sect of christianity and does not have the pope as its leader. www.scripturecatholic.com shows why roman catholics have a pope.

"...for running away..."  2. "the economy IS sluggish"  3. Even though it's technically plural, you say "some food" instead of "some foods".  4. "..and HAD something to drink"  5. The usual phrase is "skipped out on the bill"  6. I would omit "in the act", so it reads "After his arrest, he said..."|`|kdSuwt8paa	I am a student of English living in Japan  There are not many chances to put what I have learned into practice.

The 38 year old man had been laid off because of the slow economy at the time.  He went to an internet cafe with 15 Japanese yen and stayed there for more than ten hours.     He had some food and drink and skipped off without paying the bill which was only 3670 Japanese Yen.  After his arrest he said "I was just so hungry at the time".

I am guessing that he was born with it because you have to remember that this is Greek mythology. Not everything can be true and certainly not accurate. But mythology says that he was born with such powers to later take over his fathers place.|`|0JERmAslaa	Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades were all children of the leader of the titans Kronos. Kronos and all of his children were immortal and they all had their own special gifts. When they were born, Kronos saw that his children were to powerful so he ate them except for Zeus who was hidden by their mother. Eventually Zeus comes back and tricks his father into drinking a mixture of wine and a poisonous substance. When he drinks it, he immediately vomits back up the other gods who are perfectly alive and well. They then chop up Kronos into peices and hurl him into the deepest pits of the underworld.    Now the answer to your question is that after this all took place, the titans were overthrown and the gods now ruled. They each picked which domains they wanted and Zeus chose the sky. Poseidon of coourse chose the water and Hades the underworld. To make his rule oficial, Zeus wanted a symbol of his power. He goes to Poseidon and asks him to have his cyclopses make a lightning bolt that is stronger than any other weapon. Poseidon does this and that is how Zeus got his lightning bolt of power.
1wNsBNmxaa	LEGEND HAS IT: Never change your bed on Friday; it will bring bad dreams. Don't start a trip on Friday or you will have misfortune. If you cut your nails on Friday, you cut them for sorrow. Ships that set sail on a Friday will have bad luck  as in the tale of H.M.S. Friday ... One hundred years ago, the British government sought to quell once and for all the widespread superstition among seamen that setting sail on Fridays was unlucky. A special ship was commissioned, named "H.M.S. Friday." They laid her keel on a Friday, launched her on a Friday, selected her crew on a Friday and hired a man named Jim Friday to be her captain. To top it off, H.M.S. Friday embarked on her maiden voyage on a Friday, and was never seen or heard from again.    Some say Friday's bad reputation goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden. It was on a Friday, supposedly, that Eve tempted Adam with the forbidden fruit. Adam bit, as we all learned in Sunday School, and they were both ejected from Paradise. Tradition also holds that the Great Flood began on a Friday; God tongue-tied the builders of the Tower of Babel on a Friday; the Temple of Solomon was destroyed on a Friday; and, of course, Friday was the day of the week on which Christ was crucified. It is therefore a day of penance for Christians.    In pagan Rome, Friday was execution day (later Hangman's Day in Britain), but in other pre-Christian cultures it was the sabbath, a day of worship, so those who indulged in secular or self-interested activities on that day could not expect to receive blessings from the gods  which may explain the lingering taboo on embarking on journeys or starting important projects on Fridays.    To complicate matters, these pagan associations were not lost on the early Church, which went to great lengths to suppress them. If Friday was a holy day for heathens, the Church fathers felt, it must not be so for Christians  thus it became known in the Middle Ages as the "Witches' Sabbath," and thereby hangs another tale.

vg3ih0foaa	You're going to have to cut a little of your hair at the moment. Its too long. shane's hairstyle is a lot shorter. It will be way too much hair to style like that if you don't cut it. After you cut it, you should wash it, mousse it up, then take a little tiny holding gel to the top. Play around with it until it looks like Shanes. Tuck the rest of your hair, or at least most of it behind your ears. Then hairspray it and give it a quick blowdry. But if you take this pic to a hairdresser to get it cut, have her style it too and she will be able to show you how to do it properly for everyday use.|`|ecywznKRaa	I think it would look amazing on you!

Of course there are standard girl's gifts like stuffed animals and jewelry;however, you stated that you consider her more than a just a friend--i.e. more than just "a girl."   Why not take this opportunity to show this?  I suggest writing a list of questions pertaining to her likes and dislikes, such as favorite color, band, food, animal, etc.  Call her and ask these.  You should be able to ascertain a great and affordable gift from the information gathered, and she'll appreciate your interest in details about herself, and, hopefully, find it romantic.

278e651224c6856edffb748ecc305d59aa	Hi, I was raised protestant until my parents and I converted toghether... the reason we converted was that my parents truly examined the bible and church history, and beliefs of the early christians and were strucked how catholicism reflected all of the above. Most protestants are taught to hate catholicism and that is why they find it false but if you truly examine it you'll know that it is the true church of Christ. The biggest thing was reading about the early christians and actually understanding the theology most protestants dismiss it because they were taught  to do that (note: protestants are probally the most close-minded people ever) that is why most will tell you that purgatory is a place where you can be saved from hell by family members paying for indulgences... or that we believe that a priest is the one who forgives and takes away sin, or that we worship mary, or that kneeling or praying infront of a statue of a holy person means were commiting worship to the statue...the statue is there for mediatation and has nothing to do with our prayer ... unlike the christians in Jesus camp who were actually "praying over" to the cut-out of Bush..) or that we removed the commadment on idolatry or that we worship the pope..(?) or that we believe we are saved by works only ... or that the pope is infalliable in all he does and mannny mannnnnnnny more false assumptions, why they believe this well their pastor or parent teaches them this and whatever the pastor or parent says goes. Praise the Lord for showing us the light to his church! (I believe that the church is what leads us to salvation through christ but I still believe that protestants have a chance to go to heaven aswell as catholics even though they are misguided.)|`|f9d5978875fa5fe524d24fd2891438bdaa	I converted from Catholicism (which was basically a set of dogmas supported by rituals) to a trust/love relationship with God through His son Jesus, the savior of the world, who died for my sins, yet is now alive and chooses his sheep from all walks of life. I would call on all people trapped in something-isms to reevaluate their faith in the light of the bible, and come out of them. Ask yourself the question: Do I really know God? Do I know Jesus personally? Have I, by faith, really received His gift of forgiveness? Am I living for Him?  Notice that God does not desire any ...-isms, but a relationship with you! Focus on Him and all the other questions of which club to belong to will become irrelevant.|`|AA10976828	the best thing to see why people convert is to read their stories.    some places you can find them are  fisheaters.com  catholiceducation.org  freeforcatholics.com    i did not convert to the roman catholic church but as it is the one true holy apostolic church that was instituted by jesus himself would seem grounds enough for conversion.the catholic church when understood properly is very beautiful,sadly there is alot of anti-catholicism that goes around,some even went as far as publishing a false catholic bible. alot of the reasons some are not catholic is because they have a distorted view of it.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	It's the one Jesus said would give us eternal life.

Some Christians do say that the seventh day, saturday, is the Sabbath and God's day of rest, yet they still go to church on Sunday, and they worship GOD on sunday... not the sun.

The word for angels is nephilim which means the fallen ones.      So fallen angels had sexual relations with human women in an attempt to cut off a pure human blood line for Christ.   Like it or not that is what is in the Hebrew.  In your New Testament you will read about angels in a bottomless pit.   These are the nephilim of Genesis.       GOD DESTROYED THE WORLD DUE TO THE NEPHILIM   NOT DUE TO THE EVIL OF MANKIND.       OR GOD WOULD SURELY HAVE DESTROYED THE WORLD AGAIN LONG AGO,  AND ESPECIALLY TODAY WITH GAY MARRIAGE ETC.     Read it,  I challenge you,  don't blindly believe what you are told,   check it out in the Hebrew.

That was going on during the days before the flood.  You also have a lot of fornication and that also went on.  There was murder and incest.  I think the main thing was, they stopped believing in God and Noah still believed and had faith, that's why he found Grace in God's eyes.|`|d9fb1dd645e4f5559a0eee63dd4ba255aa	Genesis 6:11 says:  Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.    Violence is the only sin that is specifically named in the passage about Noah.  Of course you can assume that people did the same 'bad things' as today, of which I think the most important is rejecting or ignoring God.    I don't think of this part as history, though.  I believe it should be read as an allegory.  Remember that the Bible isn't a history handbook.  Parts are history, but not all of it.  I wonder if your teacher would agree!|`|f3d9ddb056b1ec0353818f93389bfc34aa	The main theme of the first 11 chapters of Genesis was murder and how it escalated.    It started with Cain and Abel, and then when one of Cain's ancestors murdered a young man (see chapter 4), he used self-defense as a justification and multiplied the curse on anyone who would avange they young man.    In chapter 6, murder isn't mentioned, but up to that point it was the only sin ever mentioned, except for the one little one in the Garden.    After the flood, murder is the crime that got the most verbage when God gave us permission to use capital punishment to deter the crime (chapter 10).|`|AA10211656	Hi, I know Christianity is a difficult road to take, but it is most certainly the right one.

Gen.8:21 [ evil ruled before the flood and continued to do so after the flood ];  Did those in Genesis Chapter 14 have the right to be land pirates 427 years after the flood?   Who does God say their land will belong to after 400 years from Isaac as heir?  Did the lawless behavior of Sodom and Gomorrah derseve to be allowed to trespass upon earth   when there was not even 10 law abiding persons to be found.  Did fire come down from heaven to consume them?  Did Pharoah have the right to kill the infant sons of family of Abraham captive in Egypt   777 years after the flood, so that infant Moses was afloat in a basket in the nile river to try and save his life?  Did God destroy Pharoah's ecomony and first born to halt his kingdom power for his trespasses AT 857 YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD?  Did the sons of Aaron have the right to take thing into their own hands for God?  Did the thousands and the 250 men in the wilderness have the right to complain against Moses about 859 years after the flood?   Did the ground swollow them and fire consume the 250?  Moses died 897 after flood, Joshua was 14th day in New Year 898th year to destroy seven nations of the land pirates from from the time of Abraham as they knew the Promised Land did not belong to them, they had 470 years to make plans to give it to the rightful owners that did not trespass against God the owner.  Did the rightful owners have to take it?  Did the land pirates left and surrounding the Promised Land cause trouble down to   David 1333 to 1373 years after the flood, while Solomon had some pease 1373 to 1413  years after the flood.  Elijah was in danger, he was taken up in a heavenly chariot and delieverd to a safe place to write, Elisha was in the field, threatened by a mob of 42, but 2 she bears destroyed them as they yelled for him to go up as Elijah had.  The kings were always in trouble with the Empire, until they ended in Babylon  3.

e76e82303953db76ed75096c4e89a446aa	Father-son relationships are far more important than most people give credit to.  There are tests that have been done to study this relationship and the lack of it.  They've found that boys without a solid father figure in their life tend to be distant and negative and have difficulty forming intimate and solid relationships in the future with others.  I've put down a couple of research sites.    From a book "Father-Loss":  "The experience of losing a father -- no matter when or how it occurs -- tests the strength and resilience of a son. In the worst of circumstances, the loss can propel a son toward despondency; in the best, it can inspire in him a new appreciation for his life and loves, and move him with urgency to make the most of his remaining years."|`|AA12295456	My father died when I was 12 years old.

If there has never been a father figure, then there is no loss and the effects will be insignificant. Where there is the traumatic loss of a male, some boys find a father figure in someone from the community, like a teacher, coach, religious leader, etc. This can be beneficial, because they choose their role-model. Some boys with siblings may try to take over and become the father figure. Less the case, others may, strangely enough, become either very protective or resentful of their mothers and go on to womanize other females and abandon their own offspring. Don't ask me why. I've just seen it happen before.There seems to be other issues involved that breed a lot of anger when this happens.|`|e8b38a182f2f393c07f775b35a8019ffaa	Yes, when a youngster doesn't have a male role model they manage to create their own male role model, it is more sharp and intelligent.

d18a7c1a67198c269bf100c4f1e7500caa	The Churches of Christ are non-denominational, autonomous Christian congregations. These churches comprise about 2,000,000 members in over 15,000 individual congregations worldwide.[1]    Churches of Christ generally emphasize their intent to simply be part of the original church established by Jesus Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection, which became evident on the Day of Pentecost as described in the New Testament in Acts 2. Churches of Christ emphasize the use of only the New Testament to find doctrine, ecclesiastical structure, and moral beliefs, while maintaining that the Old Testament is also the inspired Word of God, is historically accurate, and that its principles remain true and beneficial (although its laws are not binding under the new covenant in Christ unless otherwise taught in the New Testament).    Churches of Christ in the United States are historically connected to the Restoration Movement championed by American preachers/theologians of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, most notably Thomas Campbell and his son Alexander Campbell, Walter Scott, and Barton W. Stone. These and other leaders from various denominations were seeking original Christianity as they were independently finding several beliefs, practices, and restrictive dogmas in their respective church traditions to no longer be acceptable or biblical to them.    Members of the Church of Christ point out that throughout church history many have sought a return to the simple original Christianity that is "pre-denominational" and unbound by the decisions of councils or denominational hierarchies. Rather than basing doctrine on the interpretations of post-first century church fathers, ecclesiastical councils, or more modern denominational synods or conventions, they use only the Bible as their official source of doctrine. This also allows for the Bible to be open for continual examination and interpretation from congregation to congregation and from Christian to Christian. They do not believe it necessary to trace an unbroken humanly recorded lineage back to the church of the first century in order to be the timeless and continual church that was established by Christ. This is based on the ideology that the church is a spiritual body, therefore differing from secular or political notions of ecclesiastical lineage. Furthermore, that God demonstrates in the New Testament how a person may become a Christian, thus a part of the church, and how Christians may collectively organize and carry out the purposes of the church which Christ established. Also realized is that Christians can do this without any prior knowledge of other Churches of Christ as different groups practicing this form of Christianity have discovered one another without any prior connection (e.g., different segments of what became known as the Restoration Movement; early, ante-Nicene churches).    Today, Churches of Christ usually have the following distinctive traits: the refusal to hold to any creeds other than the Bible itself (i.e., sola scriptura); the practice of repentance and believer's baptism in Christ's name as the response to receive remission of sins and the Holy Spirit (e.g., Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16); autonomous, non-denominational congregational church organization, with congregations overseen by a plurality of male elders; the weekly observance of communion/eucharist (i.e., the Lord's Supper); and the practice by most congregations of a cappella worship singing (although several related congregations use instruments while keeping these other practices - also known as Christian Churches).|`|AA11973951	The birthday of the Church is Pentecost.

Each congregation is independent, ruled by Christ as the head, with elders and deacons selected by the Biblical criteria. Some congregations don't have musical instruments in their services, but do allow them for weddings and secular music. Their worship includes praying, reading the word, giving, preaching, singing and receiving the Lord's Supper every Sunday.  Some congregations are very legalistic and put more emphasis on doing everything perfectly, becoming, imho, like the Pharisees of the Bible.

b1f15f9e53b33ee2dadd93b3ec1896d6aa	I think you might be talking about Cronos from the Greek origin myth.    If I remember correctly. At first there was nothing. Out of the void emerged Gaia (The Earth), Eros and Tartarus. Gaia gave birth to Ouranos (The Sky).  They had chlidren together (The Titans), but Ouranos wanted to prevent them from overtaking him, so he stuffed them inside Gaia. One of these children was Cronos. Gaia gave Cronos a sickle (I think) and he castrated his father. Cronos then became ruler. He and his sister/wife Rhea, gave birth to several children (the original Olympian gods), but like his father Cronos was jealous, so he ate them. When she gave birth to Zeus, Rhea tricked Cronos into eating a stone instead. When Zeus grew up he overthrew his father, took the position of King of the Gods, and freed his siblings from their father's stomach.|`|40947c53900ba8c2ca9c27de9533b0b8aa	Ah, mythology. Fun stuff!    "Conrus" doesn't ring a bell; It could be you're talking about one of two possible Greek figures: Cronus or Chronos.     In the ancient Greek literature, Chronos is the personification of time. Cronus, the son of Uranus and Gaia and the youngest of the twelve Titans, whom he led. The confusion comes not only due to the close approximation of their names, but also do to their roles in the pantheon of Greek mythology.    My links below should help you along in your search to revisit these myths, and possibly to discover a few more!

Every culture has its own creation story.    The actual origin of Adam and Eve, I guess, could be traced through the ancient records of Sumerian and Hebrew civilizations, or even the Arabs because the story originates from the Near and Middle East.      Cronus is a Greek God and he was nasty because he ate his own children and it was Zeus who slew him and made him threw the children out.      And did you know that some Greeks believe that Aphrodite was born from his testicles, which was cut by Zeus and dropped into the sea?  Well, just a stuff of myth.      But according to them, the first human ever created was Pandora and it was her fault to cause suffering and devastation on earth because she opened the box which she was supposed to safeguard it.

157b173f58bb84abd1e98e2a8bfc1ac1aa	The Eastern Orthodox churches use Bishops and Metropolitans - analogous to the Catholic Cardinals.    The Protestants wanted NOBODY (emphasis) to micromanage their beliefs and they did not become Orthodox because of that desire.  The Protestants wanted local control and sola scriptura - no Pope dictating what to do, etc.|`|juVWLKzXaa	Dear Philosop...    Greetings    I will speak briefly on the Roman Catholic Church and there schismatic departure from Orthodoxy is most clearly seen by realizing that they are anathematized by the Third Ecumenical Council for adding to the Nicene-Constantinoplean Creed. The Roman Catholics recite the Creed as saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, whereas the Creed actually states (as does John 15:26) that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone (this is removed from the Roman Catholic Bible).  This addition to the Creed was spoken against by Pope Leo in 808 A.D., who had the Creed, without the addition, inscribed on silver tablets. But the addition was later reintroduced by other popes and accepted as correct practice and defended by them for almost 1000 years.    As to their doctrine of papal infallibility, if the above example does not raise sufficient questions of that doctrines validity, then there is the fact that the Sixth Ecumenical Council anathematized one of the popes, Pope Honorius. This council is now and always has been accepted as valid by the Roman Catholics. In addition, their doctrine of papal authority over the whole Church is proved false by one of their own popes, who is also a saint, St. Gregory the Great. He wrote in the sixth century that no bishop (which includes the pope) ought to call himself universal (as the popes now call themselves "Universal Pontiffs") because all bishops are equal in authority (parenthetical statements are the authors). This was written at a time when the Church in Rome was still Orthodox. The pope cannot be the head of the Church, as the popes term themselves, for Christ is the Head of the Church. Neither can the pope be Christs vicar, for that would necessitate that Christ was no longer present in the world, since "vicar" means "substitute" or "representative."  The apostles ordered the Church with each bishop equal in authority, a tradition which the Orthodox Church has kept. Indeed, at the council in Jerusalem described in Acts 15, it was the Apostle James who presided, not St. Peter-clear evidence that the apostles did not interpret the words in Matt. 16:18 as later popes have interpreted them. The Holy Fathers from the beginning have always understood the passage, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church (Matt. 16:18), to mean that Christ would build His Church on Peters confession that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. The present day Roman Catholic interpretation of that verse came much later in Church history. St. Peter in his epistles makes no claim to supremacy, and neither did any of the early popes. The supremacy of the pope, the involvement of the popes in world governments, power struggles, wars, with their own armies, and in plots for or against worldly leaders and peoples are all clearly in opposition to the practice delivered to the Church by the holy apostles, and contrary to the example of humility given to us by Christ.    The Roman Catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary (that she was conceived by her parents without "original sin") was spoken against by one of their own, much revered saints, Bernard of Clairvaux, because it was an innovation and not part of the tradition of the Church. This doctrine is an addition to the faith which was delivered to us by the apostles, and an unnecessary doctrine besides. These, together with my other statements, are some of the simplest and most fundamental faults found in the Roman Catholic Church.    In Christ    hox|`|AA10976828	going by the bible the roman catholic church was right. try these 2 sites and see for yourself.    www.scripturecatholic.com  www.catholiceducation.org    nice point with regards to the protestant orthodox observation,there were different issues and whilst orthodox catholics vary from roman catholics they also differ from other protestant churches regarding such things as "the bible alone" and "faith alone".|`|AA11610394	theyre both too legalistic....im not those religions but Martin Luther was following Jesus Our Lord who only commanded two sacraments!!!!!!!!!!!|`|39e478f7414d720b5bfa453f2467ceddaa	I read about this in comparative religions and weren't their differences extremely trivial?

They have that old time religion, or it was good enough for my parents, so its good for me?      Because of this type of thinking people have missed the most important things in life. We all grew up wondering why we are here, or how come we seem to be the only ones so far that we know about?      The History book (Bible) has been used and misused so often that people put no trust in it at all. Its just part of Christianity. So If I were to select a religion? I first would look at the book again and put it to the test?      For example 2 Tim 3:16 says that all scripture is inspired of God, so this means that it should be reliable enough to find the answers? Why is the earth here? see Isa 45:11,12.18,19.      The problem with people seems to be that they take other peoples words as fact or for granite. So when it comes to believing things like immortal soul, or hellfire, or God is a trinity, or some part of man lives on, they don't test it?       So now read for your self what happens to us?   Eccl 9:5,10, Eccl 3:19,         Soul's are either living or they die? Gen 2:7,Ezk 18:4, PS 78:50.        Hell? If you search you find that the English word means grave, But just common sense should tell us God would not torcher people for ever and ever in a fire? Compare PS 16:10 and Act 2:29-31. or see Revelation 20:12-15  The point I make to you or anyone is if you come to a basic understanding of the truths of the bible then you can Identify which Religion is teaching the truth, and that's the one you need to associate with.    gemhandy@hotmail.com|`|pHL7FdzMaa	Larryism    email me for details|`|oH66ZbPpaa	If one (or more) resonates with your soul or the Meaning of YOUR Life, that one(s) is/are valid for you.

Does following this god make me morally better or give me direction according to teachings. Does the guidance of this god relate today in all aspects of life or just the time and situation the info was written in.  When searching and listening ,open minded to something I do not believe in, to people of this religion I am trying to gain knowledge on do they have any positive stories that confirms their seemingly blind , weak  and foolish acceptance of a supreme god.      I have read and studied the bible. I am blown away by the insight of what was written 2000ish years ago. My faith in God grows as I now have FACT in my life due to a personal relationship and not just teachings from a book or from my mommy. As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.

The ones who do care who you worship are most likely extremists and shouldn't be paid attention to anyways.

"Because the life of every creature is its blood  ...the life of every creature is its blood  Leviticus 17:14  Hebrews 2:14 states, "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of [Adam's] flesh  and blood, He also Himself [that is, Christ Jesus] likewise took part of the same." The Greek word which is translated as, "partakers" is KOYNONEHO and means to "share fully."  Therefore, this verse teaches that all mankind "shares fully" in the sinfulness which is imparted to all of Adam's children...all descendants of Adam. However, when this verse states, that Jesus  "took part of the same," the Greek word which is translated as "took part" is METECHO and  means to "take only a part, but not all!" This passage teaches that all of mankind share fully in  the flesh and blood of Adam, but that Jesus shared only in the flesh. Jesus, in the flesh, was of  the seed of Adam, but the blood in His veins came by way of the supernatural conception of the Holy Spirit.

XijZ1sWTaa	Being English I love the English accent and am not as fond of the American accent except that from the Boston area which seems more similar to our English. That is personal preference however. American and British accents are different regionally so I am sure its hard to make a generalisation. I often think I can hear the twang of the Irish in some American accents.  Different American accents are partly due to settlers from different parts of England (yes, and the rest of the world). The British Isles has a huge range of very distinct, very strong accents (even dialects in some parts).     So you have a bit of London mixed in with a bit of East Anglia, mixed in with some West country, etc and scattered across the US.     But, these accents were exported several hundred years ago. So, the sounds on both sides of the ocean have diverged, and the accents are no longer a neat match.

Islam is a call for submission to the five pillars of Islam. When you say the words la illaha ila allah and mohammadon rasul allah (there is no god but allah and mohammed is the prophet of god) you have become a mo'omina (believer) not a muslim, which means you are a believer. There is a distinction: a believer could be someone who believes in Islam but does not practice it. To be a Muslim you have to abide by the five pillars of Islam believe in the Koran and practice it. You cannot believe in a part of the book and leave out some parts. You have to embrace Islam in its fullest. May God help you through your quest for the righteous path. Peace be upon you.

Infront of atleast 2 muslim witnesses you need to proclaim: "I testify that there is no god besides Allah; and Muhammad is Allah's messenger".  You will become a muslim!  The muslim witnesses will then inform you of what you need to start practicing.  2.  No, you don't have to tell your family immediately (if you think they will not be accepting to the idea).  However, you can start practicing Islam secretly, and wait for the right time to tell your family.    Hope this helps.

Second, once the koran is translated into any other religion, it is no longer the koran, which is why you have to recite it in arabic. The translations are there to express to some extend the meanins of the Koran, although believe me it is not possible since it is so poetic in arabic and takes you to a different level of spirituality. I have to also tell you that Islam is a religion of peace and not obsession. In this I mean that you do not need for me or anyone to tell you how to connect to God because God always listens to you. If there is a lot of compassion and forgiveness in this world remember that it is only 1% of the compassion that God is capable of showing. It is all in you intention .. if you pray 24 hours a day just for the intention of showing people you are religion believe me God will not accept it as a prayer but if your intention is pure and you want to pray to connect with God, God will facilitate the process for you, for God is the gracious and the merciful. Subhan Alllah there is so many different things you can do to connect with God you need to pray to connect. You could go study science and you will connect to God by discovering his intricate details in everything he creates. You could think of the way you were born and how you keep growing everyday. There is no limit to how you can connect to God in each religion it is the desire to connect with God that helps you facilitate the process. If you are having a hard time because you do not understand what you are reciting then maybe it would be easier if you learn arabic. That will express your desire to connect with God. Peace be with you my friend and may your journey to connect with God be a journey of bliss. Salam.|`|6e3abcd396d855ae9fe3b104bb7c019faa	I UNDERSTAND EVERY SINGLE THING I READ.

However, I felt that at times, certain things were just forced upon me such as go pray or fast or w.e. and even thoigh I had no problem doing it I sometimes questioned myself Why. My parents would naturally say Allah knows best. Shut up and do it. This happened for the 18 years of my life till I moved away to college as I am there right now:  I logically questioned myself. Sought help from various sources, and Mashallah I have gained so much insight and ironically enough, being away from home has made me a better Muslim as Islam encourages you to questions and seek the truth Thats why I love convert Muslims, cuz they questions and logically understand things before accepting Islam and their faith is probably the strongest I believe that in Muslims countries they are not teaching the Islam the right way, just forcing ppl to do certain things wont help, they ought to explain things to them from every single point of view so they understand what they are doing that way they wont be misguided by extremists and go around blowing themselves up thinking they are Martyrs.|`|Z9yqGbPmaa	salam  I am a muslim revert of just over one year. Alhamdulillah I memorized the surah's you have mentioned in arabic and their english translation. At the start I wouldn't remember all the exact meanings but alhamdulillah by the will of Allah it does not take long. It took me about 6 weeks to learn how to read arabic and now i have started learnining and memorizing juz 'amma. some surahs i understand the general meaning although not word for word but the more i read the more words are repeated and you begin to understand them. For example if i hear a khutba being delivered or a lecture in arabic i can get the jist of what they are saying as i am now so familiar with the islamic terms however, if someone came up and asked me how me what the weather is like in arabic i wouldn't understand. You asked how can you connect with god if you don't know what you are saying, well there are only two times in the prayer where that would happen which is after the fatihah when you recite a surah of your choice in the first two rakat and that is not the majority of the prayer. and i'm sure almost anyone could memorise the meanings of 3 or 4 verses insha'Allah. Alhamdulillah in islam our whole life is aimed at connecting with Allah, we remember him before all actions, when fasting, when visiting someone, when giving charity, when visiting the sick, when going to the mosque, when offering someone a smile as everything a muslim does should be done for the sake of pleasing Allah and this is what worship is.   It should also be noted that muslims have salat and dua. Salat is a physical act of worship comprised of standing, bowing, prostrating and so on - although this is translated as prayer the more accurate meaning of prayer is dua which is a supplication made to Allah at any time and in any state and does not need to be stated in a specific language. Dua is for instance what you would see christians doing when they kneel and "pray" although islam does not require the kneeling or clasping of the hands. It is also possible to understand the meaning of qur'an through reading a good translation.  Insha'Allah i hope this answers your question.  wa salam

Now if you are Christian, your knee-jerk reaction is to argue that there are NO contradictions in the Bible.  But that is simply not true.  Both Holy Books have their share of absurdities, atrocities, and outright contradictions.    Understanding for all groups, (and this includes the Jews, for their Book of Contradiction serves as a basis for the Muslim and Christian Books of Contradiction,) comes is the form of rationalizations.  Religious people must made daily rationalizations for their Holy Books to make sense.    Moses' father-in-law identified as a different person in different stories?  Gee, that's because a long time ago everybody had two names.    Judas hung himself in one story and threw himself off a cliff in another story?  Gee, that's because he hung himself over a cliff and the rope must have broke.    See?    And in response to burka-woman:  A lot of people that learn to read the Quran in Arabic, don't even speak Arabic.  It's like reading the Bible in Latin in a Roman Catholic service.  Everything makes sense when you repeat words you don't understand and then rely on your priest or iman to explain it to you.    Edit: Why are the Christian thumb-downers out in force this morning?

This is quite logical since the messenger is the first to receive the message.  Muhammad is spoken of as the first Muslim/Believer among his people, since the revelation came to him before all others.     When we read the story of Moses in Sura 7, we read how he refered to himself as the first of the believers. Obviously Moses did not mean that he is the first believer of all time, but what he meant is that he was the first to believe from among his own people:       "When Moses came at our appointed time, and his Lord spoke with him, he said, "My Lord, let me look and see You." He said, "You cannot see Me. Look at that mountain; if it stays in its place, then you can see Me." Then, his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, and this caused it to crumble. Moses fell unconscious. When he came to, he said, "Be You glorified.   I repent to You, and I am the first of the believers."  7:143 "    http://www.submission.org/answering-Isla...    Muhammad(Pbuh) was the first muslim in a sense because he followed the complete word. So this is no contradiction    You can also read the commentary to the verse  http://www.qurancommentary.com/comm39_12...|`|07366369c4f1ac3d9431a816ef164e93aa	There are no contradictions in the holy Qur'an.  You're just not understanding it.  And like one sister said, it's only authentic in Arabic, as translations vary and lose the real meaning.      Basically, the believers at the time of Jesus (peace be upon him), and at the time of the other prophets (peace be upon them), were on the right path.  Many so-called Christians today do not practice the real teachings of Jesus (pbuh), as they invented things and elevated Jesus' status to God or son of God.  In reality, Jesus (pbuh) was a prophet of God.      Read the translation of the Qur'an with an open-heart and mind, hopefully you'll start to understand.|`|b600ad076fb3629871be8e7bdd726a5aaa	BINGO!

Jews, Christians and Muslims will be judged by the same God.  Now, in Islam we are not supposed to worship other Gods.  This is true even in Christianity.  However, to Muslims, worshiping the trinity is worshiping other Gods.  To Christians, it is not.  I think that is what the one verse is trying to explain. To Muslims, worshiping the trinity is committing a sin against God.  Ok, about the other verses like the apostles. I think that surah was just pointing out while there was no distinctions between them, yet some were more endowed than others.    Oh yeah, I just remembered about the surah turning away from Islam. Well, Muslims just believe that Islam is the right path to God, even though we could still get to him by Christianity and Judaism.    I know I didn't address your other points, but truthfully, I'm not a Muslim scholar though I do wish I was one. I am taking an introduction class to Islam, which I can't wait to do!!|`|476b226836e04b1b989a6f0e289bdf77aa	Wow - so you mean a religious text is self-contradictory?  What's next, black basketball players in the NBA?    As for the question of languages - yes, the Quran is in Arabic, and translations pale.  If for no other reason, this is because so much of its meaning depends upon its poetry, as is the case with all great religious literature.  There is a sense beyond the meaning of the words themselves.  In English, much of the Quran is the merest ditchwater; just as all the Qabalistic meaning of the Hebrew scriptures is lost in translation.|`|J0bqxozSaa	In the Name of God Most Gracious Most Merciful,    Thank you for asking a good question that many may jump to conclusions in order to arrive to an answer. Once you translate the Holy Koran in English it is no longer the Koran. It is merely a text that is translated to another language and holds no means in itself for justification or comparison basis. Second, The Koran is a science to be studied, the same way any other subject is studied. In order to perfectly understand it, you have to understand the history, the language, the stories behind each sura, the hadith for each sura that is told by the prophet. In addition, Yes it says that all muslims, jews and christians will recieve thier bounty and reward if they abide by their religions but if you have compeletely read the Koran, you would have read the definition is "ahal il kitab" (the people of the book) which is also has its meaning. You could not just derive an aya from a whole sura and read it on its own because that is exactly how terrorists are justifying their actions and trying to get back up from ignorant people trying to find religion in themselves. the ones that are meant to go to heaven and get their reward are the ones that stayed true to moses an jesus before any "tahreef" (changes) were done to either the Bible or the Torah. The Bible for instance has so many different versions and if you have studied the history of the Bible you would have known the fact that there are some chapters added other left out. I will give you an example of what you are doing by extracting an aya from a sura and trying to justify your point:     this is a paragraph: "we went out today for dinner. I had tea and sushi! the food was amazing. I was so happy that we went to the restaurant. There was only TINY thing wrong. I hated the pork roll. It is probably the most disgusting dish in any restaurant I have been to. Not only is it not edible but it is a sorry excuse for a meal. Overall though, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!! IT IS AMAZING!"     Now say I derive this: "I hated the pork roll. It is probably the most disgusting dish in any restaurant I have been to. Not only is it not edible but it is a sorry excuse for a meal. "     This gives you the impression that I hated the restaurant! and somewhere later in the story i would remember how good the restaurant was and you take that sentence and out it here. Now what do you have two thoughts contradicting each other. But they are merely thoughts not facts. You have to take everything into consideration before you come up with a conclusion.     The koran is no different in this aspect to any other text. You have to read everything in order to fully comprehend and not just derive random sentences that do not hold true on their own. It is certainly not any different than what these fake "mulsims" do when they want to terrorize or bomb a place.     The text is very clear if you read it in arabic and read everything that explains it : the a7adeeth for instance. This is why you have only a certain number of peoplethat we would call a shaikh in Islam, a person who studied the book and the other references thoroughly that he could be qualified enough to make a justified fatwa. Bear in mind, not every one who calls themselves a shaikh is an actual one. you have to know Islam very well to know what are the good and the bad sources. Mostly, you could not go wrong with anything published in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is just like researching anything on the internet, you have so many different sources but not all of them are credible. you have to know enough about the subject in order to know their credibility.     I hope this helps. Please do not ruin a religion that is beautiful and peaceful to its core and turn it into a weapon.     Peace be upon you. Salam|`|uBICgcbAaa	The Qur'an doesn't contradict itself.

They committed many sins and killed whom they wished of the prophets. Consequently Allah sent them tyrannous king who ill-treated them and spilled their blood, and set their enemies from outside against them as well.    They used to go war, taking with them The Ark of the Covenant. They did this so that they would be victorious by its blessings, and it became a symbol of calm and a relic left behind by Moses's people. When they went to war with the people of Gaza and Askalon, they were defeated because the Ark of the Covenant was captured from them. When the king of the Israelites heard of this he died on the spot.    The children of Israel remained like sheep without a shepherd until Almighty Allah sent them a prophet named Samuel (Shammil) (pbuh). They asked him to appoint a king over them to lead in a war against their enemies.

J0bqxozSaa	The Piet (14981499) by Michelangelo is a marble sculpture in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, the first of a number of works of the same theme by the artist. The statue was commissioned by the French cardinal Jean de Billheres, who was a representative in Rome. The statue was made for the cardinal's funeral monument, but was moved to its current location, the first chapel on the right as one enters the basilica, in the 18th century.    This famous work of art depicts the body of Jesus in the arms of his mother Mary after the Crucifixion. The theme is of Northern origin, popular in France but not yet in Italy. Michelangelo's interpretation of the Piet is unique to the precedents. It is an important work as it balances the Renaissance ideals of classical beauty with naturalism. The statue is one of the most highly finished works by Michelangelo.  Style    The structure is pyramidal, and the vertex coincides with Mary's head. The statue widens progressively down the drapery of the Virgin's dress, to the base, the rock of Golgotha.    The figures are quite out of proportion, owing to the difficulty of depicting a fully-grown man cradled full-length in a woman's lap. Much of the Virgin's body is concealed by her monumental drapery, and the relationship of the figures appears quite natural.    The marks of the Crucifixion are limited to very small nail marks and an indication of the wound in Jesus's side. The bottoms of Jesus's feet are unmarked.    [edit] Interpretations    The Madonna is represented as being very young, and about this peculiarity there are different interpretations. One is that her youth symbolizes her incorruptible purity, as Michelangelo himself said to his biographer and fellow sculptor Ascanio Condivi:        Do you not know that chaste women stay fresh much more than those who are not chaste? How much more in the case of the Virgin, who had never experienced the least lascivious desire that might change her body?    Another explanation suggests that Michelangelo's treatment of the subject was influenced by his passion for Dante's Divina Commedia: so well-acquainted was he with the work that when he went to Bologna he paid for hospitality by reciting verses from it. In Paradiso (cantica 33 of the poem) Saint Bernard, in a prayer for the Virgin Mary, says "Vergine madre, figlia del tuo figlio" (Virgin mother, daughter of your son). This is said because, being that Christ is one of the three figures of Trinity, Mary should be his daughter, like all of humanity is, but is also his mother.    A third interpretation is that suggested by Condivi shortly after the passage quoted above: simply that "such freshness and flower of youth, besides being maintained in by natural means, were assisted by act of God".    Yet another exposition posits that the viewer is actually looking at an image of Mary holding the baby Jesus. Mary's youthful appearance and apparently serene facial expression, coupled with the position of the arms could suggest that she is seeing her child, while the viewer is seeing an image of the future.    Interpreting the sculpture in terms of its name, one might trace the origin: "The duty children owed their parents, termed pietas, was associated by Romans with the duty humans owed their gods" (James S. Jeffers, The Greco-Roman World of the New Testament Era: Exploring the Background of Early Christianity, Downers Grove, Ill. InterVarsity Press, 1999).    Precedent    While there was a precedent for painted depictions of the Virgin lamenting over the dead Christ in Florentine art, the subject appears to have been novel to Italian sculpture. There was, however, a tradition of sculptured piets in Northern art, particularly in the Cardinal's native France. In addition, the church of San Domenico in Bologna had a German sculpted piet. This has led some to believe that the donor had these statues in mind when the work was commissioned.    History after completion    Michelangelo carved one of the most magnificent sculptures ever created from a single slab of marble in less than two years. His interpretation of the Pieta was far different than those previously created by other artists. Michelangelo decided to create a youthful, serene and celestial Virgin Mary instead of a broken hearted and somewhat older woman.    The Piet's first home was the Chapel of Santa Petronilla, a Roman mausoleum near the south transept of St. Peter's, which the Cardinal chose as his funerary chapel. The chapel was later demolished by Bramante during his rebuilding of the basilica. According to Giorgio Vasari, shortly after the installation of his Piet Michelangelo overheard someone remark that it was the work of another sculptor, Cristoforo Solari. Michelangelo then carved MICHAELA[N]GELUS BONAROTUS FLORENTIN[US] FACIEBA[T] (Michelangelo Buonarroti, Florentine, made it) on the sash running across Mary's breast. It was the only work he ever signed. He later regretted his outburst of pride and swore to never sign another work of his hands.    In subsequent years the Piet sustained much damage. Four fingers on the Virgin's left hand, broken during a move, were restored in 1736 by Giuseppe Lirioni and scholars are divided as to whether the restorer took liberties to make the gesture more 'rhetorical'. The most substantial damage occurred on May 21, 1972 (Pentecost Sunday) when a mentally disturbed geologist named Laszlo Toth walked into the chapel and attacked the Virgin with a hammer while shouting "I am Jesus Christ."    After the attack, the work was painstakingly restored and returned to its place in St. Peter's, just to the right of the entrance, between the Holy door and the altar of Saint Sebastian, and is now protected by a bullet-proof acrylic glass panel.

z5DvcnS8aa	sht happens|`|J0bqxozSaa	first entertain the notion that people may have had children and then found themselves in poverty; ask single mothers about that, or a family where the main breadwinner loses a job. Life is like that sometimes.    Second, not all financially poor environments are bad ones: A family that doesn't have a lot of money but has a good support structure within the family could be a perfectly fine environment to grow up in. Conversely not every well-off child grows up in a good environment. As I've mentioned before, there are a lot of different ways to be poor in the US. In this thread we've heard from people who grew up poor but who also had parents who raised their children conscientiously, and of course I like to think my mom did likewise.    I do think people have to carefully consider their financial situation before having kids. But being poor isn't a disqualifcation from breeding in itself. In my opinion.    Sometimes people need kids to take care of the family by working. Sometimes poor people are forced into such a situation by being raped.    Most women have the dream of being mothers and having the perfect kid. Just because these people dont have money does not mean that they should be robbed form this dream. Maybe that child is the next martin luther king or mother tereasa!|`|69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	How heartless..some of you on here really need to go talk to somebody|`|0d8aad42dc552b92d6a69e402a098d2faa	I wish you hadn't done that, young lady. Starving children is illegal and even more immoral. You know, a poor person struggling doesn't need this drivel. I pray that you are in no way in any profession of the helping fields.

I'm not poor... but I'm guessing it's b/c they can't have anything else, they think that kids will make their life less miserable, but in the end the kids make their lives even more miserable plus they make the kids' lives miserable b/c they have to be brought up in poverty.  Farmers usually have a lot of kids to help them out with the land even if the farmers happen to be poor.. I think if people don't have enough money to support their kids then they shouldn't have any. They shouldn't bring more people to the world who will then suffer b/c their parents are poor. That's just what I think would be the smartest decision (putting aside all emotional aspects of the issue).|`|sB622sTNaa	Because they are poor.. don't have money so they can't buy Condoms!!|`|a1f7af905d28272c96a70bd48afd0d04aa	What just because they are broke their sex drive diminishes?

What is your criteria for "can't afford?"  Does a child need designer toys, designer clothes, and a pampered existence in order to be successful in life?  Is it possible that perhaps a child raised with those things might have a slightly narrow view of the world as a young adult?  Do you thing that maybe a child raised with nothing might be more driven to succeed as an adult?

Yet some of the most ignorant and shallow people are rewarded for not working much or even at all. It makes me sick to think that my hard work and tax dollars pay for America's most ignorant and irresponsible to have children that they then raise to do the same. mothers that work 3 months then quit and draw unemployment for 6 months over and over. they are rewarded with financial aid and assistance. then as if that's not enough they put there bills in there kids names and ruin there credit before they can even talk. All while driving a new $20,000 car to get there hair and nails done. So why do poor people have kids? Because it's a way of life!!

If you actually mean DAIJOBU, then thisis the meaning:    Nihongo. 1990s.  1: no problem. No worries.     OH MY GOD-- THE HOUSE IS BURNING, THE CHILDREN ARE SLEEPING, THE INSURANCE ISN'T PAID...    "Daijobu," said the fireman.    In japanese though,     daijoubu means:         all right, O.K.    If you meant deja vu, then the definition is:    The term "dj vu" (IPA:/de?a vy/) (French for "already seen", also called paramnesia) describes the experience of feeling that one has witnessed or experienced a new situation previously. The term was coined by a French psychic researcher, mile Boirac (18511917) in his book L'Avenir des sciences psychiques (The Future of Psychic Sciences), which expanded upon an essay he wrote while an undergraduate French concentrator at the University of Chicago. The experience of dj vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity, and also a sense of "eeriness", "strangeness", or "weirdness". The "previous" experience is most frequently attributed to a dream, although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience "genuinely happened" in the past. Dj vu has been described as "Remembering the future."    The experience of dj vu seems to be very common; in formal studies 70% or more of the population report having experienced it at least once. References to the experience of dj vu are also found in literature of the past, indicating it is not a new phenomenon. It has been extremely difficult to invoke the dj vu experience in laboratory settings, therefore making it a subject of few empirical studies. Recently, researchers have found ways to recreate this sensation using hypnosis.|`|1gOInwMraa	Hello,    In answer to your question "daijoubu" is Japanese for "are you okay", "safe" and/or "all right".

Vos decs que los homosexuales discriminamos a los heterosexuales tachndolos de mentes cerradas...    El error es que nosotros "tachamos de mentes cerradas" a los HOMOFBICOS, no a los herterosexuales en general.    Homofbico es el heterosexual que tiene fobia a la homosexualidad y la condena, la reduce, la humilla, insulta, degrada, etc. Y creo que, por lo general, el homosexual, as como tambin muchas personas heteorsexuales de mente abierta, tachamos de cerrados a los homofbicos porque de hecho lo son, porque discriminan, degradan y no aceptan algo que no sea igual a ellos. Y as como pienso que son cerrados los homofbicos, tambin pienso lo mismo de los xenfobos, racistas, machistas, feministas, etc. Por el simple hecho de que ellos no slo no aceptan lo diferente, sino que lo degradan y lo insultan.    Por lo tanto opino que esta generalizacin que dice que los homosexuales discriminan a los heterosexuales dista mucho de la realidad.    Acepto que tal vez haya algunas personas homosexuales que "discriminen" al heterosexual en general, porque hay de todo en todos lados, pero creo que el grueso de los homosexuales repudiamos al HOMOFBICO y no al heterosexual.      Ejemplo anlogo: Todos los ****** odian a los blancos y los discriminan? No... solamente odian a los blancos que discriminan a los ******. Odian al Ku Klux Klan.    Otro: Los judos del Holocausto odiaban a todos los arios? No. Slo a los nazis, asesinos y agresores de judos.      Espero que se haya entendido mi respuesta y que te sirva. Besos!      PD: En cuanto a la respuesta de yo_no_me_llamo_pepe...  Digo yo... a vos te parece que todos los gays acosan a los hetero? A m me parece que no... es ms, creo que los hetero en ese caso son peores... nunca vieron a un chico acosando a una chica en un boliche? ALGUNA VEZ vieron algn pibe que, a la primera que la chica les dijo "NO", no haya insistido, e incluso de las peores maneras? Y ESO SIN CONTAR A LOS CHICOS QUE MOLESTAN A LAS LESBIANAS PIDINDOLES UN BESO!!!!    Me parece que estamos generalizando al decir que los gays acosan a los hetero... creo que acosos hay entre todos los distintos tipos de sexualidad, slo que el acoso de un chico hacia una chica en un boliche no est mal visto, aunque a la chica le moleste IGUAL que a vos cuando te "acosa" un gay.|`|ywsSq8CWaa	se discrimina con cultura, con viajes, con estudios, con plata ni?a! porque quieras o no, el "poder rosa" se siente, si no que lo digan: Armani,Bulgari,Mercedes Benz,Chanel,etc etc etc. sal|`|ce11c63f693b13ed383a5d79801a3353aa	Solo a algunos heteros que tienen una mente corta y poca costumbre de analizar las situaciones?A los que prejuzgan!|`|fb10b28ad927dcaea59583f140ccfcc3aa	No creo que se discrimine de la misma forma, y como te comentan por ahi, a muchos los tachamos de tontos porque son homofobicos y muchas veces solo abren la boca para atacar.

J0bqxozSaa	Considering that most Pakistanis are Muslims and most Arabs are Muslims, then that is the only connection between them. The hate towards isrealis is due to their religion background. Let me first define each group and their roots:    Arabs:    An Arab (Arabic: ???? ); is a member of a Semitic group of people whose cultural, linguistic, and in certain cases, ancestral origins trace back to the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabic language and culture began spreading throughout the Middle East as early as the 2nd century with ethnically Arab Christians such as the Ghassanids and even earlier ethnically Arab Jewish tribes. Widespread proliferation throughout the Middle East and North Africa, however, did not start until after the 7th century following the advent of Islam and the ensuing Arab Muslim expansionism resulting in the cultural assimilation of other of the region's indigenous Semitic peoples of non-Arabian origin  most often, though not necessarily, in combination with their Islamization. Islamized but non-Arabized peoples outside of the region are distinguished as forming part of the geographically wider Muslim World, not the traditionally secular Arab World. Many other varying views of the definition of Arab have also been offered.        * Genealogical: someone who can trace his or her ancestry back to the original inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula and the Syrian Desert. This definition covers fewer self-identified Arabs than not.        * Identity: someone who considers him or herself to be an Arab regardless of racial, religious, or ancestral origin.        * Linguistic: someone whose first language is Arabic, including any of its varieties. This definition covers more than 250 million people. Arabic belongs to the Semitic family of languages.        * Political: someone who is a resident or citizen of a country where Arabic is one of the official languages or the national language, or is a member of the Arab League, or is part of the wider Arab world. This definition would cover more than 300 million people, but it is rather simplistic and rigid in that it excludes the entire Arab diaspora but includes non-Arab identified indigenous ethnic minorities in the Arab region.    The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Most people who consider themselves Arabs do so on the basis of the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions. However, some members of groups who meet both criteria reject the identity on the basis of the genealogical and ethno-national definitions; some Lebanese (predominantly Lebanese Maronite Christians may reject the Arab label in favor of a narrower Phoenician-Aramaean-based Lebanese identity. This is particularly true for the peoples of North Africa; the Muslim Berbers of the Maghreb, and many Egyptians (both Coptic and Muslim) would not identify as Arab. (See also Egypt Identity).[5] Groups using a non-Arabic liturgical language are especially likely to consider themselves non-Arab. Not many people consider themselves Arab on the basis of the political definition without the linguistic one, thus, Kurds or Berbers do not usually identify themselves as Arab - but some do. For instance, some Berbers also consider themselves Arabs or, in other words, Berber and Arab identities are not necessarily mutually exclusive (v. e.g. Gellner, Ernest and Micaud, Charles, Eds. Arabs and Berbers: from tribe to nation in North Africa. Lexington: Lexington Books, 1972).    In medieval times, the definition of Arab was restricted. Ibn Khaldun, for example, does not use the word Arab to refer to Arabic-speakings people as defined by most of the above definitions, but only to those who can trace their ancestry to one of the original Arabian tribes.    In the modern nationalist era, according to Habib Hassan Touma,[6] "An 'Arab', in the modern sense of the word, is one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arabian tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture."    On its formation in 1946, the Arab League defined an "Arab" as follows:    "An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic speaking country, who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic speaking peoples"    The Arabs are mainly Muslim with a minority of Christian followers, and some Arab Jews. Arab Muslims are Sunni, Shi'a, Ibadhite, Alawite, or Ismaili. The Druze faith is usually considered as a religion apart. The Arab Christians follow generally one of the following Eastern Churches: Coptic, Maronite, Greek Orthodox or Greek Catholic.    Before the coming of Islam, most Arabs followed a religion featuring the worship of a number of deities, including Hubal, Wadd, Allt, Manat, and Uzza, while some tribes had converted to Christianity or Judaism, and a few individuals, the hanifs, had apparently rejected polytheism in favor of a vague monotheism. The most prominent Arab Christian kingdoms were the Ghassanid and Lakhmid kingdoms. With the conversion of the Himyarite kings to Judaism in the late 4th century the elites of the other prominent Arab kingdom, the Kindites, being Himyirite vassals, appear to have converted (at least partly) to Judaism too. With the expansion of Islam, the majority of Arabs rapidly became Muslims, and the pre-Islamic polytheistic traditions disappeared.    At present, most Arabs are Muslims. Sunni Islam dominates in most areas, overwhelmingly so in North Africa; Shia Islam is prevalent in Bahrain, southern Iraq and adjacent parts of Saudi Arabia, southern Lebanon, parts of Syria, northern Yemen, al-Batinah region in Oman and Iran, although Iranians are Persians and Iran is not an Arab country, it may be closely related to Arab countries through|`|KnuKI5F0aa	Well the primary link between them is Islam. Ethnically speaking they are similar to Anglos and Italians. I must admit the Pakistani women are much more attractive. They get along in some respects, but you must remember that Pakistan was at onetime a colony of England so there is more of European influence whereas if you are not Arab well, you are outsider who deserved to be stoned (the non marijuana way). Pakistanis very easily look at themselves as more modern while Arabs still have people riding Camels. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of poor people in Pakistan, but Arabs are divided by over 30 some odd countries. So the bottom line is go to Pakistan and convert to Islam and then Marry a Pakistani woman..you will thank me.

W8bs2VQSaa	I'm surprised that most of the answers are in the negative. I buy a lot of things on EBay - I've got some great bargains. I'm not a great shopper at the best of times, but if I want something, I often see if I can find it on EBay first. Like, my son and his wife are expecting a baby, and I wanted to get them one of those swinging rockers which are so great for little babies. In the shop they are about $200. I got an "as new" one for $50  last week on EBay, picked it up the next day. Over the last few years I've bought out-of-print books, a television, air conditioners,  various electrical appliances, and many embroidered WW1 postcards (I collect them).  I've never had a dud yet. I'm a fan !!|`|7fHsyHYraa	I use EBay frequently.  I can find toys and games that my grandchildren ask for that are not available in local stores.  Sometimes buy clothing, DVDs, cosmetics.  I have never been cheated or unhappy with the quality of items I purchase.      I do think EBay is a very expensive way to sell your own things.  With all the EBay fees, costs for shipping and the Paypal fees (for handling the payments from buyers) there is very little profit if you are selling things for under $100.  You would probably make better money by having a garage sale if you are needing cash.|`|9RvOhmY1aa	I was there a couple times and could not figure it out.  I have enough junk already and there is nothing I need so never went back.|`|gCAJaFnyaa	I've been making purchases on EBay for several years now, and have been quite satisfied.|`|a3fb758bf3b46f1560bdbc2cd4286acaaa	yes i do|`|1iGnpCukaa	I love E-bay, just won a bedroom set, yesterday.|`|8G42oyydaa	I have thot about it, once in awhile when I google something I end up on there, I lost a pair of pottery quail I had, and really miss them. There were a pair on ebay, bookmarked it, still thinking about it, they arent like mine and not quite what I wanted.    I have never bought anything from ebay, but I have done other shopping on line, mostly computer programs and a ring from the shopping channel once.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	No.  Don't have any use for it.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	I tried to use it but it is not for me. One of my daughters just loves it though.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	No, it does not interest me. I have a friend and a family member that does buy/sell on it.|`|AA11296212	I use eBay quite frequently.  I find many things that I can't find at flea markets or antique shows.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	Good question, I checked out e-bay probably 10 years ago but I really did not want, need, or desire anything.  I should probably check it out again|`|kYYHw7xEaa	I found it.  Went hot and heavy for 2 months.  Got some stuff that was great, but got ripped off twice.  No more, ebay.|`|AA12258992	I don't.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	It would seem many of the younger people do. This caused problems when sorting out my late father in laws tool shed. It has always been the tradition that tools etc go down to the next generation of males, same with fishing tackle to those who use them. FIL would have liked that. I tackled one family member who was taking anything he could lay his hands on to sell on ebay.He had the error of his ways pointed out to him. Thus it was tradition versus greed.Tradition won.
mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, I have a child that was vaccine injured and developed autism from the vaccines.  How we found our doc was through our local autism society's chapter, from word of mouth from other parents.  We have tried a family practice homeopath, but now we are seeing a 'traditional' pediatrician who respects our views on vaccines.  He does give vaccines to most of the practice, but does agree, that had my child been his, he'd thinktwice and wouldn't continue to vaccinate.  Good luck!    the integrative pediatrics council lists a few docs in NYC     Dr. Benjamin Kligler MD, MPH  The continuum Center for Health and Healing  New York, New York  646-935-2257  http://www.healthandhealingny.org    http://www.mothering.com/discussions/arc...    that is why we switched from the homeopath-it was out of network.  We did see a homeopathic detox doc for 1 year, it cost 3000 but our son improved alot.  He stopped getting sick, and he started talking at 4.5-5 yrs.  Now at 8 he talks.  Dr. Ellis.    I found my initial vax friendly doc from this person, April Oakes, president of TAAP-into the truth! (the autism autoimmunity project).  I met her in 2003 at an autism conference, and have corresponded with her through email and phone, she found my doc even though she is based if Fla, and I am in DE.  Her daughter Casi, died from vaccines, she was four years old.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	There are docs willing to work with you..I know one in NJ that is at least proatcive in not giving teh flu shot with thimerosol....    DOcs to have a duty to educate and inform the parent of teh risk and leagl responsibilityof not having the child vaccinated---but thety cross the line when they refuse to accept the parent as the final decision maker    Most docs think they are the unltimate authority and patienst shoudl bow to them--thats not the way its suppsoed to be--their job is to guide the patient and let the patient make their own decision.    I have been harmed by medical treatments that are supposedly medically proven to be safe-severe side effects that could have killed me.      While it does look like it most likely isn;t the thimerasol-since rates have skyrocketed since removing it)-it hasn't been disproven yet----    peopel argue that we should use vaccines until it is proven they aren't safe    it should be the other way around-    they should be proven safe before we use them.    If I have children-I will vaccinate them for most things (not Hep b or chicken pox at least until they are older-Hep B is exchanged by body fluids-which babies should be exposed to, ..chicken pox is not that debilitating-its more concerning to get shingles as an adult--but there is a separate shingles vaccine for adults)    And I will also delay them--and spread them out--I would rather have more needles and less toxins at once...    I don't know if parents from a local autism group could recommend a doc---often when a fmaily has 1 child with autism-they don't want to vaccinate the 2nd....if you haven't--try that|`|6oC80Fpraa	I certainly understand that you don't want to debate the issue, but there is a problem in that there is absolutely no proof of a tie between autism and vaccinations.    The scientific method is a wonderful thing, testing and proof in blind studies.  I'm afraid that some people who became upset when their children were diagnosed with autism were looking for something to blame and vaccines became the answer for them.    So many killer diseases have been nearly eradicated due to vaccinations.  Is it really worth risking your baby's health, and possibly life, for an unproven theory?    I apologize for doing what you asked us not to do, but I feel strongly that rumor and superstition are less than helpful when it comes to the health of our children.    The chances of your finding a doctor who will agree with your theory are not good.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	No. No doctor is going to endorse that myth. I know many parents waht some kind of magical answer that will somehow "cure" autism. Thre isn't one.    It's sad, really. Instead of working with their children and getting them the help they need, these parents view an autistic child as "damaged goods" they are saddled with and keep demanding soeone "fix" the defective product.    I fthey''d try treating their child as a thinking, feeling human being instead of a car with a flat tire, they might get a better response from the poor kids.|`|9a35060b1f035af576ef9d57f250b28aaa	I believe that autistic child is either biologically inherited or has their brain altered during development age.    A rare case where a child can be become savant from other causes.    When it all boil down to this, your child can be too young to get injected with mercury (thermsol). We may reject mercury or any other metalic chemical and denied that food contain it but I read that corn syrup contain some mercury especially tuna.    When your child get older, it is likely that the brain can be more resistant to become autistic. When growing beyound developement, it brain likely to reject tibbit trace of metalic chemical.

1469de7bd315f4ada9d0225c451cdd2aaa	The question is why are you so insecure with yourself that you need a label to define who you are?   If you want to chain yourself with labels, by all means, go for it.  And by the tone of that last paragraph, you know that this is a load of b*llshit and that's why you don't want people to answer that way.   Well, sweet cheeks, I don't follow rules.   You need to work on being yourself and stop trying to fit in.  But if you want a label, I'll give you one.  Misguided, insecure teenager who wants to be labeled so she can finally stop feeling alone.|`|lPPgMKibaa	i would say a mix of goth and emo. you arent fully goth or emo.|`|bEHRh1lgaa	Labels are for tuna cans, not humans...but if you truly will only know your true self with one...I'd say you're Alternitive.

w8uUWK03aa	Without wishing to discourage you from your worthwhile crusade.  You do realize that this speech will label you as "f a g" in school, whether it's true or not.  Are you ready for that stigma?  Kids can be very unkind and packs of them are positively vicious!  Your life could be hell.    Apart from that I think the subject matter is far too big for a speech... how long is to be, 20 minutes?  The subject has been debated academically for centuries and still there's no consensus of opinion.    If you must cover this subject, why not pick a particular instance of intolerance in history such as the prosecution of Oscar Wilde.|`|grYkoDaraa	many people against homosexuality argue with the bible.  i don't know any books but i bet you can find lots of info on both sides on the internet.

lTx8Hoheaa	"In our church we are baptised when we decide to turn our lives to Jesus, realize we are sinners, and be baptised in the manner Jesus was. Not as a baby."    In the Catholic Church, this is called Conformation. Same thing, different names.    However, in my personal opinion, infant baptism is a superstition, as if God would actually send an unbaptized infant to hell! However, my fiancee wants to do it, and it can't hurt, right?|`|RermzbWgaa	It is not just Roman Catholics that practice infant baptism.  The far majority of Christiandom does and has.  Those that practiced adult baptism as the only valid form did not come along until much later in Christiandom and were known as Anabaptists (or rebaptisers).  Today many of the churches of that thinking are known as Baptist (although it also includes Pentecostals, Charismatics, and other off shoots....usually churches that will also forbid smoking, drinking, dancing, and the like).    We all baptize adults as well, but that is conversions to Christianity at adulthood (hence why the quote from websites).    See http://www.amazon.com/Children-Promise-B... for argument as to Biblical foundation (there are other books on the subject as well).    (There are significant difference in the theology from Protestants as to infant baptism, and even baptism in general from the Roman Catholic Church, but the fact of they being infants is not one of them....excepting of course with the anabaptist tree).|`|JoVbT4noaa	Yeah!!  Take that Catholics!!!!      Them sheet-wearing Baptists showed you!!!!!      YEE-HAAAWWWWW!!!!  Stars and Bars forever!!!!!!!    Woooo hooooooo!!!!!!!!|`|fmlwD58iaa	i pray allah will guide you  jihad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XnAq9rd5aa	When there were high infant mortality rates, people were worried their babies would go to hell for their Original Sin (which is what, to Catholics, baptism cleanses us of). Most that are baptized as babies are going to be raised as a Catholic/Christian anyway so their whole life would be turned to God (ideally).  Conformation (preformed after baptism, first communion, and reconciliation, in about 8th grade for a born and raised Catholic, usually, but can be received at ANY time for anyone that wants to be Catholic as long as they have had all 3 other sacraments first, unless there is a special exception) is when we say that we are fully accepting Jesus and becoming an individual member of the Catholic Church to serve God.  As a Catholic you can be baptized at any time, it is merely customary to be baptized as a baby due to tradition (that I spoke of at the beginning of my answer). No Catholic (or, at least, no GOOD Catholic) would look down on someone that was not baptized as an infant. It really doesn't matter, it is just merely customary.    I hope this answered your question!|`|5cd72c27261c5c994c0b5c7e6eed47dfaa	It also doesn't say not to. In all reality though, this was probably done in practicality. For most of the existence of the church, half of the people who were born were lucky enough to see their first birthday. Parents wanted to be assured that their children went to heaven in the possible event that they died young. This is also where Confirmation comes in. It finishes what is started at baptism. It allows for the person to decide whether they want to remain in the church or not.|`|4854FMZjaa	Jesus Versus Churchianity    http://www.hinduism.co.za/jesus.htm|`|nGafpEwoaa	For much the same reasons as you say.  It really doesn't matter how you are baptized, it's the baptism.  In our newly built church you can be baptized either way.  The choice is up to person/parents how they want the baptism to be performed.|`|wNA3EqKcaa	It's a common question.

KBBonf97aa	In the US, the incidents of violence against gays tend to be isolated, so I think it's a pretty safe place to be homosexual.  There are certainly plenty of other violent crimes committed against people who don't belong to a specific minority group, so I think it's just a matter of using good judgment wherever you go.  Thugs are everywhere and they'll prey on anyone, so I don't think it's especially dangerous to be gay in this country.  But my heart breaks for people who live in oppressive societies where people become victims even if they're suspected of being gay.  There but for the grace of God...|`|FqiA5BRraa	Yes, because i don't know why, its quite atrocious and sad that one can't live their life.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	no more dangorous then being Mexican, probably safer because you can hide or not tell someone if your gay.|`|hy3q2iWaaa	It depends where you are. In the former USSR states like Ukraine and Russia being gay is an open secret. People don't really talk about it and people don't wanna see it. You can be beaten there if you show it in public. Even gay people there meet secretly. In the Muslim world like Saudi Arabia, Arabs might rape you and leave you in the desert. In Indonesia the punishment for homosexual acts or even masturbation is death. But there are places like the Netherlands  and Belgium where gay people are free. They even have hotels there specially for gays. In the Philippines, gay people here, I may say are the happiest gays in the world. They can wear anything they want, even ladies' clothes and make-up and nobody will mock them on the street. There are a lot of establishments where gay people hang out and meet. Gay people are accepted by society and are regarded as very creative and artistic individuals. They are everywhere in the Fields of Medicine, Military, Politics, Entertainment, and in every walks of life. Gay people in the Philippines is not discriminated anymore. In some cases mothers are glad that their son is gay-that means he will be helping his mom and the family financially because he will never marry.|`|kfrWN7wQaa	It depends on where you live and who you surround yourself with.|`|uefXAfVbaa	It depends where you are at... one such example is that there is gay communities in New York, USA, where gays sort of roam free. There are also gay communities more predominant in Canada where the entire street is dedicated to gays/lesbian etc. The fact of the matter is to be careful no matter where you are, especially in places where the idea is not that accommodating as it can be very dangerous. People are not accepting either for religious reasons or generally because the human nature is to fear what they do not understand. Hope this helps.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Not everywhere but it's not widely accepted, and in some places, yes it can cost your life. The reason for hatred is just intolerance for others. I've read many stories of gays being killed in South America as well. I think it is because those countries are primarily Catholic, which as a religion is very anti-gay, so naturally the people will be of the same mindset.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Of course, I dont look at it as being dangerous, but more of being Brave to Be Out to everybody.

Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit Gods kingdom.

There is no commandment about obedience, but there is one that says children honor your parents.  I don't think you are going to find basis for your argument in the 10 commandments.  I would use Paul's writings against women having authority over a man, and being silent in church.

HD4dSdSaaa	Volunteer Depts have drills/meetings a couple times per month. Usually twice a month to go over training and so-forth. What I would recommend is finding out when their drills are, go early to one and introduce yourself. Basically shake their hand and ask if they have any room your help on the dept. Volunteer Depts usually always are in need for an extra hand.     So what will happen is either that night or the next drill, you will stand outside and they will take a vote... just to make sure everyone is in good terms with you. They do not want anyone who may cause problems or they cant trust in the dept being as you may be the one watching their back in the next house fire.     No background checks... Maybe blood test for HIV's but thats about it. Voluteer depts do not check in too deep as far as fitness tests and background checks. Reasons being they need all the help they can get. Go for it! It'll be the best choice you've ever made as long as you stick with it and up your training.    Good Luck|`|6JXrlnYsaa	Call your local volunteer fire department and ask them.  You have to join.  You have to be trained.  There are requirements and background checks.    Why would you ask here, and not ask directly?

It was an awesome time of finding out that we all wanted to please God. Having not all of the truth understood is an example of salvation not by education, but by the purpose of the heart to believe and exalt Yeshua Ha Meshyiach. The sheep individuals will be found by the Holy Spirit searching the hearts of men. They will hear and rejoice at the Truth.    I do not endorse the teachings of Mormonism but I realize people start where they are and move forward in understanding if they believe and explore the Holy Scriptures letting Truth enlighten them.    People who are anti anything forget that individuals all process what they are given individually. The joke is funny but ignores that the Mormon doctrine includes misunderstanding of the Word of God, the Holy Bible.|`|fFmbqLf4aa	i would say smile worthy, not funny enough to score a laugh.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Wasn't that a joke on the man show? It was about polish people or something though...|`|AA11992885	the CONCEPT is funny, but the way you told it is just stupid    a MORMON joke would put the mormon at the butt end of the joke, and thus, anti-mormons would love it    the way i heard the joke is SIMILAR, but against rednecks    A guy in line to get lunch leans over to the guy next to him and says, "Wanna hear a redneck joke?"    The guy next to him replies, "Well before you tell that joke, you should know something. I'm 6' tall, 200 lbs., and I am a redneck. The guy sitting next to me is 6'2 tall, weighs 225, and he's a redneck. The fella next to him is 6'5 tall, weighs 250, and he's an a redneck. Now, you still wanna tell that joke?"    The first guy says, "Nah, not if I'm gonna have to explain it 3 times."|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	It woulda been a lot funnier (not to mention more accurate) if the three guys were Mormons, and the joke-teller WASN'T.|`|a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	yeah, i agree ... re-write it so all three guys are mormons.  it's a good joke that way.  you have to poke the fun at the mormons, not anti-mormons for it to be funny.    you could put any kind of person in there.  it would not necessasrily have to be mormons.|`|N7xKowJYaa	if they're anti-mormon then they would appreciate a mormon joke though. plus wouldn't the guy telling the joke be able to accurately size up the physical attributes of his potential audience?  i realize it's a device to explain that the three men are intimidating, but it's a little ham-fisted.  otherwise i can substitute the minority/religious/social group of my choice for mormon and it is a so-so joke.  i liked your one about the guy with the pregnant wife better though.

KBBonf97aa	Well, I wouldn't say all of them do, but there do seem to be a lot of LUGS (lesbians until graduation) on every college campus.  I think a lot of it has to do with the current fashionability of declaring oneself bisexual.  If it weren't considered hip to do so, most girls wouldn't have any interest in messing around with other girls.  But since television and movies have made "dabbling" cool, there's no stigma associated with it.  Girls give themselves license to satisfy their curiosity and test their boundaries, yet they reserve the right to revert to the safety of their true orientation once the novelty wears off.|`|lEignX9Vaa	I wish that was actually true.  I'm in college, and I haven't found any hot bi chicks yet :(    In all seriousness, I think college is just an age when you are old enough for sexual experiences but young enough to experiment. Plus its more "acceptable" at this stage.|`|DCaoyk33aa	even college boys do.|`|oAAYYcSjaa	i have no idea!|`|hy3q2iWaaa	everyone does. people are curious.|`|wfvM6Fhfaa	Don't generalize.not all do.|`|kfrWN7wQaa	If they are not gay they do it because they want attention from boys.|`|WRSNIusaaa	That's what we call a stereotype.    In short, they don't.   The few who do (and are only experimenting) do so because college is generally when people are at the age where they just do things like that. It's an age thing, not a college thing. But you're exaggerating and stereotyping because most straight girls don't experiment with bisexuality in college. ... generally because they're straight.|`|MhfneF0xaa	I'm sure that not all do.    Why are you attempting to create a stereotype?    And how is it that you presume to dictate to women what they "must" or "must not" experience?    And how is it that you limit your question to "college" women?    Are all women who attend college required to oblige your preconceptions? Or do women have minds and wills of their own?    I'll give you a hint: all women have minds of their own, whether they are straight, bi, gay, transgendered, or Martian or Venusian.    So don't be so eager to assign labels or attitudes to your fellow human beings.    Or do you presume to dictate to women what they can/must feel?|`|tZUSVuUvaa	I think a lot of us do it because we are just fed up with the crap guys put us through at that age and we realize that there is another option. Of course, some of us were just gay all along and we either weren't willing to admit it to ourselves or were afraid to come out during our high school days.     Then you have the girls who really aren't bisexual but just make out with other girls in clubs and at parties to attract male attention, which is pathetic but extremely common.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	I never did. I was so heterosexual I couldn't get em in and out of the room fast enough. LOL I even had a thing with a security guard at the school. Man, I was such a tart!

lrqZHi9Jaa	Being Australian I can say I have heard it said before.  I have also heard it said that men are tools, morons and other very descriptive names that are probably deserved.    Being Australian I can also say it isnt unique to us here.    Our men are no different to men anywhere else in the world.    We call some old goats, say they run around like headless chooks and in Britain men loved to call women silly cows.    Animal names are attached in some cases as endearments...again not an exclusively Aussie thing. Ever heard of honey bunny.  Maybe we should just say sweet rabbit and be done with it.    In the USA police were referred to as pigs, why do you think that is?  .....I rest my case.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Because pigs are seen by many to be disgusting, sloppy, lazy and unattractive.    Yes, also being pigheaded has connotations to being ignorant and foolish.|`|snrc1Dmsaa	In developed countries women enjoys degrading men so they'd use any name that would imply characteristics less than flattering. its the same thing as calling women "whoes," when they're not. It's not endearing and it should be avoided. However, since i live in Australia, some men here are despicable pigs that portrays less then human values...assholes!|`|x3g9IlhVaa	Hey my boyfriend is Australian, same as me and he is certainly not an asshole.

swkhohjgaa	I can think of two honest answers.     The first and most obvious is that its impolite and rude. I believe they used to call that having maners.     The second is that the person your calling a retard may not actually be retared and can understand what you are saying.      My brother had a stroke at a very young age. The stroke was in the center of the brain which left him unable to communicatee. He can say things but they don't come out right. His face always looks a little distorted and has braces on both legs and walks funny.     But the doctors say that he can understand perfectly everthing that is said to him and around him.     Im sure there are more reasons as well.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Maybe they have a relative or a friend with a mental or physical disability?  I used to use the word "retard" freely in ignorance that people found it upsetting/offensive.  I stopped using it.  It really didn't hinder my ability to communicate.  It's just in bad taste.|`|HHRrlqhwaa	I've heard this question before, but usually it is phrased: "Why do people get offended when I call them gay. It's not like gay people care if I call someone/something gay. I'm not offending anybody that likes guys/girls. If I say in public somebody or something's gay, somebody always gives me the look, like I offended them or something, even though he/she is not gay. I wonder why?|`|62eb64f00529ec4e271b0beecf4776c0aa	Your retarded.|`|uEBuNRY8aa	And then the response to "you're retarded!" is "don't say that, man, it's gay." Like a slur adopted from the queer community and made to refer to anything Bad or In Poor Taste is any different.    We can use the words "idiot" "imbecile" and "moron" in public with few qualms, and according to the almighty wiki "the term "mental retardation" is a diagnostic term designed to capture and standardize a group of disconnected categories of mental functioning such as "idiot", "imbecile", and "moron" derived from early IQ tests." Those three words blended into the language, but apparently retard just isn't PC. This is like trying to bury the N word - we should embrace our language in its flaws, connotations, and historical values, and then just shut the **** up and say what we mean to say in the context we say it from.    The term "retard" is still applied to humans, which makes it a little iffy in the PC area, despite a recent trend of referring to individuals with mental retardation as developmentally disabled, developmentally delayed, mentally handicapped, or mentally impaired. Whereas apparently people are able to conveniently forget the origins of the term "gay." It didn't always refer to the 190 pages of reading you've been assigned tonight.|`|SsggpxHVaa	well maby they think your a homosexual and dont like yur kinda round hur!!!  8===> suckin fagit  no really though its because your a *** hole and they are tired of yur **** best stop it before pop!!!|`|mHl8OTlWaa	It's sad that this even has to be explained to you.

We are pro-life. If someone chooses to call us "anti-choice" then we should have the right to call them "anti-life". As it is, since we are pro-life, we call our opponents pro-abortion. You can't have it both ways.  By the way, dear, as a nurse, let me remind you that the side effects of RU486 have had deadly effects on the women who have taken it including malignant hypertension and fatal blood clots.|`|366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	I prefer the term pro-life, just because it reflects better the school of thought by many Christians that life begins at conception. So that is how I identify myself.    I can see the term anti-choice, because the baby (fetus, embryo, zygote, living cell mass, etc) is not given a choice whether it's mother aborts it.    To me, (and I know I will hear it from everyone about this, so here goes my flak jacket and steel helmet) ~ Everyone that is "pro-choice" was not given a choice whether to be born. That choice was made for them by someone else. Those people cannot regress and remove that choice and choose not to be born. So they now have a choice because they were NOT given a choice!     ~let the shrapnel fly folks~|`|MV6pc1omaa	I call them Pro-Birth.|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	control freaks.|`|cNniG2L0aa	Obviously it is ANTI-Choice; almost all of us are pro-life.  ~|`|AA11124121	opinionated!    well? really..

I think it is wrong to kill unborn fetuses, but I also think it is wrong to force a woman to take a pregnancy to term. It is not a black and white argument, because there are two lives involved in this situation...not just the fetus, and not just the mother. Both.    Pregnancy can literally destroy a woman's health (that's what it did to me) and everyone knows it can also kill a woman. It is not a situation to be taken lightly and it is NOT something that anyone should have to take to conclusion if they do not choose to.    However, to make sure a woman really understands what she is about to do, I think she should be required to have an ultrasound done of her unborn baby before she can have an abortion, or at least listen to its heartbeat through her belly. If the woman sees here unborn child's little legs and arms and face or hears her little heart beating and still wants to have an abortion, then she should be allowed to have one.    I just think that a mother should meet her child in some manner before she decides if she wants to stop that beating heart forever.|`|geq6iU0Oaa	How about "didactic"?|`|4szonXiRaa	It is anti-choice for the unborn baby.

Both get an unnatural satisfaction by pleasuring themselves while forcing the child to participate. And like a pedophile, fetuphiles encourage the participation of other children in their sick games. For example they encourage children to have the babies of rapist and incestuous relationships. They encourage child sex. They have sex with children and they foster the murder of born children.  Edit: Blue Christian  It is insane for you to be pro life. Of course you support rapist when you reward them with a child when they rape. And you support childern in insestual sex when you reward the acts of "grandpa", "dad" or "my boyfriend" raping the child to produce another child he can rape later. This would not be half as evil except you call the fetus "God's" child when you have no proof that God had anything at all to do with the sex act. You call the fetuses of 11 year old children "children of God" and make them feel guilty for aborting, yet want to reward other pro lifers and encourage irresponsible sex while these poor children you neither feed or support. Some churches encourage the marriage of children to men and tell them that sex is their duty with the man and that abortion is murder. I agree that there is a nut case here, but I don't think it is me.|`|8TW00N9Daa	Clearly the term is Fetus Loving-Woman Haters!  We should really going around to pregnant women and kicking them in the stomach until they choose to abort that baby!    NO MORE BABIES!|`|YQOT68xFaa	I'm not anti-choice. Women have abundant choices. We can use pills, condoms, IUDs, rings, injections, diaphragms or cervical caps, all kinds of birth control methods. Or we can exercise some true bodily autonomy and practice abstinence. I support all of those choices even though I personally wouldn't use most of those forms of birth control. The *only* choice I do not support is abortion, except for cases where the mother will likely die if the pregnancy continues, and that is rare. Women have the right to choose all of these things and should do so before conception. After you're pregnant it's too late. On the flip side, I think that there should be all kinds of social programs in place to provide support and resources for pregnant women and infants, to make it easier for women to keep their babies. Alot of women abort because they feel like they have no help, no support, and no means to provide for a baby. If we could help these women they'd keep their babies.     If you want to call me anti-choice, fine, but then I will call you pro-abortion. After all, if being against abortion makes me anti-choice, then being pro-choice means pro-abortion.    EDIT  "For example they encourage children to have the babies of rapist and incestuous relationships. They encourage child sex. They have sex with children and they foster the murder of born children."    Are you kidding me? You are accusing pro-lifers of being child rapists and of encouraging child sex?

Slaves were bitter about slavery, their children were bitter about voting, and their children were bitter about the colored water fountains. Now, many blacks and hispanics view poverty as the fault of white people instead of bad luck or laziness. It is true that many whites hate other races, but this is not the majority.    White people on the other hand are sick of hearing about slavery, thinking that 150 years is enough to get over it. Civil rights lawsuits and Affirmative Action only increase hostility because then blacks and hispanics get preferential treatment.     Careers are ruined on the topic of racism (Don Imus) just for words, the freedom of speech. Politicians are ruined because of racism charges, but murder is perfectly acceptable (Ted Kennedy).     The hypocrisy of it all angers whites, and blacks and hispanics blame others or each other for their problems, which causes more biased laws, which cause more jealousy from the whites, which causes more hard feelings and actual discrimination.    In short, America has racial problems because everyone won't step outside of their race for a bigger identity. Blacks can use the demeaning term "******", but a white man cannot. Blacks are each others "bros", but whites are not black's bros. Whites are suspicious of wealthy blacks, and unfairly judge them as drug dealers or something.    The more attention paid to the issue the worse it gets. The more legislation, the more infringement on freedom.

Ask the pink people.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	This is a tough question to answer because it's a big question. I think the main roots of racism in America come from the fact that blacks were slaves up until about 150 years ago, and many Americans at the time viewed them as less than a person. This is especially true when you look at the Confederate states from the Civil War.     But the answer is not that simple, because there have been cycles of xenophobia throughout our history. Look at the way we treated Chinese immigrants who came to work on the railroads, look at how Italian immigrants were treated in the late 1800's and early 1900's, look at the way we treated Japanese citizens during World War II. And the cycle is repeating today with Hispanics.     Maybe you even have to go back further to the Puritans and other early settlers and their attitudes toward natives.     What I think has been the major catalyst for change is concentration of minorities - especially blacks - in sports and music. And that's not to minimize the work of Martin Luther King and others during the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's.    EDIT  John John: you need to check your facts. Blacks make up only about 12% of the population of the US.

(ie. the sinner's prayer)|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    Forgiveness isn't for the offender.  It is for you.  When a person forgives, it frees them from the bondage of the offense and the one who offended.  It doesn't get them off the hook with God, it sets "you" free.      If we can't forgive, Christ can't forgive us.  Period.    Which by the way, if the sinners prayer is NOT in the Word of God, man added it.  Dangerous.  It would be like someone putting words into your mouth which you didn't say.    Revelation 22:18, 19 says, "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:   19  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.|`|bKjJtSRPaa	Actually Christ said     John 3: 16     16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.     This is repeated by Paul in Romans 10:9    9 If you confess with your mouth, the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.     Paul was taught directly by Christ in the wilderness for 3 years.    Before his death Christ preached the Jewish Law. All the things Christ taught were to prove to the Pharisees that keeping the law will never be enough, that no one except God is good. So Christ is telling them that by the law if you forgive others, God forgives you, but if you don't he won't forgive. Forgiveness was not in the heart of these men. Christ said this to make the point that even the smallest thing, not forgiving, is breaking the law. Therefore nothing we can do will earn our way to heaven.     You don't need a sinners prayer, all you need to do is believe that God is, that Christ was God, that He died on the cross and your sins are covered by His shed blood, and that He rose again on the third day, making it possible for those who believe in Him to live forever. Nothing else is necessary. However, prayer should be a part of every Christian life.|`|AA11989999	An objective but sympathetic understanding of how and why there is the APPARENCY of sin, leads one to forgive others and oneself simultaneously.

Then you've got forgiveness, whether it came from God or yourself.|`|UmxxBr6uaa	Well first of all, the "sinner's prayer" isn't actually biblical. People have made up that prayer so people will know what to say if they want to get saved. But so often it has become just a cop-out "prayer" that people use to try to get to Heaven. Jesus teaches to follow Him and do His will and then you will be saved. John 3:16 is a verse most people know. I would encourage you to read verses 16 and go through verse 21. I think that's a pretty good description of how to be saved.    Now, as for your question.  Mark 11:25 says, "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in Heaven may forgive you."  Colossians 3:13 says, "Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."  And there's another passage that I can't find right now that says if you go to the temple to worship and you remember a grievance you have against your brother, you should leave right then and make it right, so that you conscience will be right before God. (It says something like that.)    The verse in Mark is like the passage I can't find. Neither of them mean that by forgiving you will automatically be forgiven. You have to repent of your sins yourself.  Colossians says to forgive as Christ forgave you. Because we as sinners are made clean by a holy God, we should also forgive those who sin against us.    I really hope all that made sense.|`|1fb7aea767ff3f9acc21f4f310b2ee94aa	What Christ _said_ was, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your mind, and with all your strength.

Because Jesus sacrificed his life for us, we are free from the eternity of sin and we now have the opportunity to ascend away from this world away from sin.|`|wQSsw8QHaa	its called repent the sinners prayer  Forgive and You Will Be Forgiven  by Mr. Lyle Welty  Something that's no longer a part of our legal system here in the United States, but once was, was known as a debtor's prison. A debtor's prison. It was a jail where people were sent when they owed money to other people, but they couldn't pay it. Here is a short description of the debtor's prison. Actually, they were quite common in this country many years ago. It was not a pleasant environment. The public jail was a place of discomfort. The rooms were unheated, small and cramped and would be generally overcrowded. Jail fever  probably typhus  broke out from time to time. In the year 1736 in Maryland, a committee described the local Annapolis jail where debtors were held as a place of restraint and confinement. It would also have been a place of death and torment to many unfortunate people. In 1766 the same jail was described as so filthy and nasty that it was excessively nauseous. Some prisoners in nearby jails were held under these conditions for debts as small as fifty cents.     Well, the idea of a debtor's prison in mind, let's turn to Matthew 18:23. Peter had asked Jesus how many times he was required to forgive his brother when his brother sinned against him. Peter thought seven times was really plenty. In fact, he probably thought he was being generous in going above and beyond the call of duty by saying, how about seven times. And Jesus must have shocked Peter and the other disciples when He said, Not seven times, but seventy times seven meaning that we should forgive anyone and everyone as often as necessary, that actually it should be a way of life for us. Jesus followed this comment with a parable. In this parable in Mat. 18:23, our sins against God and the sins other people commit against us are compared to financial debts and the spiritual consequences are characterized as a prison.     Mat. 18:23 - "Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. The king represented God, the Father, and the servants, of course, were us human beings.     Verse 24 - "And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. That is a huge some of money.     Verse 25 - "But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made.     Verse 26 - "The servant therefore fell before him... before the king ...saying, 'Master, please, have mercy and patience with me, and I will pay you all.'     Verse 27 - "Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.     Notice why the king which is pictured by God, the Father, notice why He forgave the debt. Was it a tax write-off? Not in this case. He did it because He was moved with compassion toward the man. It continues in verse 28.    Verse 28 - "But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii... a very small amount of money ...he laid hands on him and took him by the throat... got violent with him ...saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'     Verse 29 - "So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.' Notice, the second servant used the identical words of the first servant as spoken to the king. 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.'     As we will see, the first servant made a bad choice here which is a reminder to us, actually, that when we choose to forgive or choose not to forgive, it is always our choice.     The story continues:    Verse 30 - "And he would not... he would not be patient ...but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.     Verse 31 - "So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done.     Verse 32 - "Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.     Verse 33 - 'Should you not also... notice what he said ...have had compassion on your fellow servants, just as I had pity on you?'     Verse 34 - "And his master was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors... most likely the jailers ...until he should pay all that was due to him.     In the next verse, Jesus gave us a very sobering warning about forgiveness. He said,    Verse 35 - "So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from the heart, do not forgive his brother his trespasses."     Our Father, who art in heaven,  hallowed be thy name.  Thy Kingdom come,   thy will be done,   on earth as it is in heaven  Give us this day our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses,  as we forgive those who trespass against us.   And lead us not into temptation,   but deliver us from evil.

The other thngs, like the sunrise and trees, only prove that the universe is big and pretty.  It doesn't mean there's a god, it means that people who can't figure out how the universe works would rather make up something than admit that they cannot fully explain it.

"I like the messages but it takes up too much of time. Shall I ask you not to do that for a while. At least for the next 3 months?"    If he still send you then block him. Or send him a quick reply for the first one or two messages that "Please, I asked you not to. I am receiving these. Can you please stop?

Abaddon - Fallen angel  Beelzebub - Demon worshiped by the Philistines akin to Ba'al  Ba'al - First angel created by God and the first to join Lucifer  Belial - A prince of Hell  Leviathan - The whale of the abyss  Satan - Aramaic for "accuser", not a demon or angel.  Lucifer - The actual angelic name of "the Devil" or "Satan"    To:  Vampir m?rder D?mon~~?  Wow..... What exactly is your problem? You just don't like that I have actually done research.

6NEPcZFfaa	NO!!! you lucky ***! I've always wanted to be Gullah, thats cool. I don't know how to speak Gullah and I don't know anyone but they say they are down in Georgia and South Carolina. You might find more down there, is that where you live? You are lucky though, the Gullah people were some of the only to keep their traditions and some culture from Africa and they actually got away from slavery from running away and never going back a long time before the rest of the blacks did. Isn't that called Geeshee, or is that what they are called?    EDIT: I heard there are a lot of Gullahs down there so you probably have a better chance of finding older people around you that still speak some form of Gullah than anywhere else. I dunno, but I rarely meet people who even know what Gullah is. Unless they think of Nick Jr's Gullah Gullah Island :)
PvgZUzHjaa	Actually, there are not very many truly perfect circles in plant or animal life.  Soap bubbles are the way they are due to physics, and other small circular phenomenon are of a similar nature.  There's a lot of patterns in nature, but they are not perfect as in being drawn by a computer; they are perfect in the sense of the underlying structure.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	Yes, because the probability of that happening just once by accident is 1/infinity.  It could still technically happen without a god, but it would indicate something that is at least god-like.    Actually, in order to observe a perfect circle, you would first need a perfect observer.  Which means that you in fact would have to be god-like to observe one.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	no.|`|deb8a10a1ae5016e6cc75e6eaf5b870faa	Well, perfect circles would be too easy and without further meaning...   But what about the "Golden-ratio"? It is said to be related to something beautiful:  "Beginning in the Renaissance, a body of literature on the aesthetics of the golden ratio has developed. As a result, architects, artists, book designers, and others have been encouraged to use the golden ratio in the dimensional relationships of their works."  Did God put Golden-ratio structures in the nature? Let us see:  quote:  "Adolf Zeising, whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the arrangement of branches along the stems of plants and of veins in leaves. He extended his research to the skeletons of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of crystals, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these phenomena he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law.[38] Zeising wrote in 1854:    [The Golden Ratio is a universal law] in which is contained the ground-principle of all formative striving for beauty and completeness in the realms of both nature and art, and which permeates, as a paramount spiritual ideal, all structures, forms and proportions, whether cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, acoustic or optical; which finds its fullest realization, however, in the human form.  END OF QUOTE    So, this is more evidence for God than perfect circles, don't you think?|`|TrmLJB7Daa	It is a proof of a supernatural forces yes but there are a lot more evidences for God existence if you really want to search or believe.You can search practicing but not like an experiment.

Edit:  I don't know, either.  It could be.  Or, it could not be.  So, I guess we have to archive the phenomenon and look for more evidence to make any conclusions.|`|BABcrdMKaa	I'd be willing to bet $5 that there IS a plant like that somewhere.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Does the golden spiral count? Also, since man is evolved and he created the idea of a perfect circle and the means to draw it, does that mean that nature did eventually come up with a way? Assuming either one of these, what does it say about the possibility of a God? I don't think God wants to be proven that easily. He chooses to remain vague at the moment.|`|Ld16o3kYaa	NO|`|BIl0MOHGaa	No. Hypothetically, there would likely be a rational, mathematical explanation.|`|AA11043457	I would surely think that God would be too busy with more important things than to go about making crop circles.  No, that would not prove the existence of God.

Jesus is not in any way liberal.No where did he ever tell any one to force another to take care of others.He told the folks to give out of their own pockets, not rob others and give to those who would vote them in office.        God told Adam to be fruitful and multiply and have dominion over the earth and al there is in it. Then Jesus took that blessing and calmed the storm, healed the sick, raised the dead, and cast out demons and brought prosperity to the poor.I have yet to see any liberal doing any of those things. All I ever see them is angry and bitter except when they can personnally destroy one of their opponents. And then they clap their hands in glee.

This "uncircumcised Philistine" will be as the lion and the bear that I killed.Circumcisn was the sign of the covenant. David had a covenant with God, Goliath didn't.The moment David walked in that Israelie camp Goliath was a dead man. He just didn't know it yet.A 9 foot man , a warrior, was no match for a covenant 17 year old boy.The next day David ran after Goliath, he didn't sneak up on him.He ran, fired that sling , and Goliath was dead before he hit the ground. Then David climbed on Goliaths chest and cut that dudes head off at the shouder line and raised it in victory.That may not be too pretty, but that is victory hands down.David had taken God's covenant and beat impossible odds.God gave Abraham protection from sin, sickness and disease,demons and fear  in that covenant and passed it down to all his offspring.It is the reason Israel beat the arab nations in all those wars.God promised in the last days that He would bring Israel back to their lands out of war and never to be ousted again forever.Ezekiel 38,39.|`|AA12346187	history of isreal and  God's laws,|`|FLJCEvvXaa	for many years around the time of its writing, it was treated as a historical product, as fact.    so its purpose was to inform i suppose.|`|AA11334327	The Hebrew Scriptures or the old testament is recorded the law covenant that Israel was under, and that was to lead them to Christ and then be replaced by a new covenant with laws written, not on stone tablets this time, but on human hearts.

When confronted with circumstances or questions see for yourself how you react. Is your reaction directed for positive outcome or negative? What are you thinking when someone cuts you off or hurts your feelings? Do you respond with anger or tears? Whoever you are is defined by your inner being. If you find that there needs to be improvement then stop doing what it is that makes you feel bad about yourself and start the process of improving. But, don't let that person inside of you make you feel so bad that you don't think that you can change him/her. We can all stand a good amount of change in our lives. I'm in my mid 50's and still I find room for improvement. Believe me that there is plenty of room left for that. I'll tell you something if it weren't for the help of the Almighty my chances of improvement would have been hindered. The first step is to admit that I needed His help.   Who am I? I'm a child of God and I'm getting to know Him more and more each day.  Thanks and God Bless. :)

On the one hand, you say that religion shouldn't be taught at school; I presume because of the several laws about it in the US. In Britain, religion *is* taught in school, in specific lessons. Personally, I believe that this is correct.    But then on the other, you go on to say that Evolution shouldn't be taught either - I presume in science lessons? Why, given that you say you're not against science, would you feel that evolution should not be taught? It's a valid discipline encompassing an extraordinary range of science - both life science and physical science - and acts as an excellent object lesson in the way in which the process of science is performed: the collection of observations, the creation of a testable hypothesis, the testing of that hypothesis together with falsification tests, the refinement and extension of that hypothesis until it forms a 'theory'.    I would have felt that evolution formed a near-perfect object lesson for the teaching of the process of science to children. Moreover, it has a truly engrossing storyline associated with it.    I know I'm not answering your question (I didn't see the episode, so I can't) but I would genuinely like to know why you would feel that evolution shouldn't be taught? (And, I ask politely and respectfully; no rude comments, truly.)    EDIT    Okay, thank you for responding. If I may in return respond?    First, one aspect of the overall theory (and no, I won't belabour the point regarding what the term means in science) is that our nearest animal relatives - chimpanzees rather than moneys - share a common *ancestor* with us, several million years ago in Africa, rather than a common descendant.    Second, what we have from the sciences - collected over the last couple of centuries - are two observations. The first is that there are a large number of types of organism (fishes, birds, reptiles, etc) which no longer seem to have surviving representatives. Somehow for some reason those species or subspecies seem to have disappeared. The second observation is that there *are* some surviving species that a bear a close but not exact similarity to those disappeared species; and that in some cases, there are two or more species (such as chimpanzee and humans) which have some vague or even close similarities with one another. And a further observation - from deliberate breeding programmes - is that we can, by mixing characteristics from different breeds, produce a new breed with new characteristics.    What Darwin proposed was a mechanism whereby the two main observations could be explained in a single framework, and in which that mixing of characteristics mechanism could be applied by nature automatically rather than by mankind deliberately.    So, the change of species was and is an observed fact. Evolution was proposed as a hypothesis to explain how it could have come about. (In the same way, that things fall down is an observed fact; what Newton proposed was a hypothesis to explain how this comes about.)    At present, science has no alternative explanations for the observations - the only other scientific explanation (due to Lamarck) having been proved wrong by experimentation. As a result, the theory due to Darwin is the only one taught as science in schools. (Interestingly, we *do* however have alternative theories departing from Newton's theory for gravity - a theory due to Einstein which has proved more successful and complete than Newton's.)    So, this is why the Theory of Evolution - as an explanation of why living things change their form - is (and I believe should be until a better explanation is uncovered) taught in science classes.    I believe that your feeling is that the religious explanation should (or perhaps, should also) be taught in schools? Again, I would agree with you: it should. But I don't believe that it should be taught in and as 'science' because there is no 'scientific' aspect to that explanation. It should be taught as being a belief system; perhaps even a belief system which is contradicted by Darwin's explanation. But as I say, in Britain this would be taught in specific classes regarding belief systems.    Finally, do teenagers have a right to an opinion? Yes, you have a right. But I honestly feel that with that right (as with any right) comes a responsibility: in most cases, to ensure that you have the appropriate education from which to exercise that right.    I hope that all of this makes sense? And best of luck in your studies...|`|cr6VohxSaa	Why not let the Free Market decide what gets shown on TV?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Evolution? Controversial? Are you kidding?    Are you against teaching all scientific theories in school? Gravity, plate tectonics, germ theory of disease? Would you like schools to stop teaching science altogether?    If your religion causes you to deny reality, perhaps it's time to reexamine your beliefs.    * Evolution is very much a fact.    * The theory of evolution is a theory - just like atomic theory, gravity theory, and the germ theory of disease. The word "theory" has a very specific meaning in a scientific context: THE THEORY EXPLAINS THE FACTS. See http://www.notjustatheory.com/    * Creationism is not a theory; it's an assertion with zero evidence to support it.    * Over 99.8% of biologists and geologists accept evolution.    * There are no alternative scientific theories.    * There is a huge amount of evidence in support of evolution...    * And zero evidence against it.    * The "debate" is actually educated people trying to educate others.    * The more intelligent a person is, the more likely they are to understand and accept evolution.    * The "debate" only happens in backward places like Turkey and parts of the united states.    * There are two types of creationists: professionals who make money from books, lectures and such, and knowingly make false claims - and followers who accept those claims without understanding them.    * The basics of evolution: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/    * Examples of ridiculous creationist anti-science: http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?us...    * Examples of creationist quote mining (like quoting part of a scientists' sentence to make it sound like he's saying something completely different): http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/quotes/min...    * Scientific American's 15 answers to creationist nonsense: http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=15-a...    * The evolutionary tree: http://www.dhushara.com/book/evol/trevol...    * Hominid species: http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/homs/speci...    * Transitional fossils: http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CC/CC20...    * A comprehensive list of evolution resources: http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopi...    * Or just look at this bonobo: http://neatorama.cachefly.net/images/200...|`|E9chZY74aa	All of Simpsons is rude so I never watch it.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	Sorry, but the theory of evolution is a fact. You can see it in the fossil record, you can see it happening in real life. Religion on the other hand isn't what you think it is, a path to peace with oneself. On the contrary, religion is merely a tool of authoritarianism, designed to make you a slave. That's something to be angry about.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Yes, this episode annoyed me too.  Actually, I think that both (creation and evolution) should be taught at school.  Well, the fact that creation is so wired in with the Christian religion is what makes it tough.  But some schools tried it without getting into the religious aspect too much.|`|AA11992885	i view the purpose of a cartoon to be antagonistic, and there in lays the humor    this is what all humor is based upon, someone being at the butt end    i personally don't remember the episode, though i know i saw it, and probably laughed, as i laughed ROYALLY at the south park concept of evolution, despite the fact that i believe in evolution    technically speaking, a more evolved form of anything looks retarded....there is the MENTALLY retarded forms that we desire to help and protect, and then there is the otherly retarded that we wish to distance ourselves from, and that otherly form is usually the next step in evolution    cartoons take the extremes to show the humor of it, so as to place it in the category of absurdity, and thus, humor

r8rykCkGaa	You can read matthew 10 and 24 and Daniel 7-12 (chapters) and Revelation 4-22.  I recommend the book "Daniel" and the book "Revelation" by Paul Yonggi Cho too.  They are excellent commentaries to these two books of the Bible.  (By the way Paul changed his name to David but he was Paul at the time he wrote the books so I believe you would still ask for the books by his first name, but just in case you can ask for the name David too).      Also, I recommend any books by Michael D. Evans.  He wrote several best sellers such as "American Prophecies" and "Beyond Iraq" and "The Final Move beyond Iraq" and other books.  He is a prophet.  Another well known prophet is David Wilkerson who wrote about Babylon being destroyed and the judgment on America.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Read the book of Revelations.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

That we have an opportunity to be reconciled unto God, whereas the works of the devil which started back in the garden, when his plan was to cause us to fall and be separated from God and bring death to humankind according to God's own words of warning to Adam and Eve.

His cross is our bridge and now death and the grave have no hold on us who believe, because we now have an advocate in the court of the Lord, when our enemy stands there as our accuser, our advocate claims us with His blood and we stand innocent before the Lord and the works of the devil are destroyed.|`|O2QItYAaaa	I prefer to believe that fluffy bunnies failed us thank you|`|NNarvtKjaa	Just a fairy tale.

Satan does not care about those that are drunk in the corner going no where.

This plea for mercy which Jesus cried out to the Father has nothing to do with their Salvation.  This was a plea to the Father not to show His wrath upon these men.  In the soul of Jesus there was no resentment; no anger, no lurking desire for punishment upon them.    I have never seen anywhere in Scripture, "The sinners prayer."  If it isn't in the Word of God, then man has "added" it.  Dangerous!    Revelation is very clear about man adding or taking away from His Word.  It's like someone putting words in your mouth, when you never said such a thing.    Revelation 22:18, 19 says, "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:   19  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."|`|eYs8DpbBaa	It would stand to reason Jesus forgave at that moment.

All those who he forgave had to accept Jesus as Lord over their sin to get rid of the sin nature.Just as men have to do today. God never changes.

I am a christian as well, at my church my minister accepts all relationships,  the bottom line is Do you believe in God, and do you believe Jesus died for our sins?  Our church is a  non denomination. Focus on that instead of getting angry. Talk to a Psychiatrist, you may need some therapy and some depression meds until you overcome this problem of self denial.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Broadly speaking, Reformed theology includes any system of belief which traces its roots back to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th Century.  Of course, the Reformers themselves traced their doctrine to scripture, as indicated by their credo of sola scriptura, so Reformed theology is not a new belief system but one that seeks to continue apostolic doctrine.         Generally, Reformed theology holds to the authority of Scripture, the sovereignty of God, salvation by grace through Christ, and the necessity of evangelism. It is sometimes called Covenant theology because of its emphases on the covenant God made with Adam and the new covenant which came through Jesus Christ (Luke 22:20).         Authority of scripture. Reformed theology teaches that the Bible is the inspired and authoritative Word of God, sufficient in all matters of faith and practice.         Sovereignty of God. Reformed theology teaches that God rules with absolute control over all creation. He has foreordained all events and is therefore never frustrated by circumstances. This does not limit the will of the creature nor does it make God the author of sin.         Salvation by grace. Reformed theology teaches that God in His grace and mercy has chosen to redeem a people to Himself, delivering them from sin and death. The Reformed doctrine of salvation is commonly represented by the acrostic TULIP (also known as the five points of Calvinism):         T - total depravity. Man is completely helpless in his sinful state is under the wrath of God and can in no way please God. Total depravity also means that man will not naturally seek to know God, until God graciously prompts him to do so.         U - unconditional election. God, from eternity past, has chosen to save a great multitude of sinners, which no man can number.          L - limited atonement. Also called a specific redemption. Christ took the judgment for the sin of the elect upon Himself and thereby paid for their lives with His death. In other words, He did not simply make salvation possible, He actually obtained it for those whom He had chosen.         I - irresistible grace. In his fallen state, man resists Gods love, but the grace of God working in his heart makes him desire what he had previously resisted. That is, Gods grace will not fail to accomplish its saving work in the elect.         P - perseverance of the saints. God protects His saints from falling away; thus, salvation is eternal.         The necessity of evangelism. Reformed theology teaches that Christians are in the world to make a difference, spiritually through evangelism and socially through holy living and humanitarianism.         Other distinctives of Reformed theology generally include the observance of two sacraments (baptism and communion), a cessationist view of the spiritual gifts (the gifts are no longer extended to the church), and a non-dispensational view of scripture. Held in high esteem by Reformed churches are the writings of John Calvin, John Knox, Ulrich Zwingli, and Martin Luther. The Westminster Confession embodies the theology of the Reformed tradition. Modern churches in the Reformed tradition include Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and some Baptist.    Recommended Resource:  The Moody Handbook of Theology by Paul Enns.|`|1bcc0a57e83d93747625c74ecb78740aaa	The most common connection is the "once saved always saved doctrine."     At first blush i vehemently disagreed with this doctrine when I first heard it. But once it was fully explained to me, I don't think it is that far out of the mainstream of Christianity, I think we are just expressing it differently.|`|xu31KUJmaa	A Baptist.

His teaching is defined by the Council of Dort into the TULIP doctrine which is as follows:    The five points of Calvinism, which can be remembered by the English mnemonic TULIP are:    Total depravity (or total inability): As a consequence of the fall of man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin. According to the view, people are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term "total" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)     Unconditional election: God's choice from eternity of those whom he will bring to himself is not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people. Rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy.     Limited atonement (or particular redemption or definite atonement): The death of Christ actually takes away the penalty of sins of those on whom God has chosen to have mercy. It is "limited" to taking away the sins of the elect, not of all humanity, and it is "definite" and "particular" because atonement is certain for those particular persons.     Irresistible grace (or efficacious grace): The saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (the elect) and, in God's timing, overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith in Christ.     Perseverance of the saints (or preservation of the saints): Any person who has once been truly saved from damnation must necessarily persevere and cannot later be condemned. The word saints is used in the sense in which it is used in the Bible to refer to all who are set apart by God, not in the technical sense of one who is exceptionally holy, canonized, or in heaven.    Fundamentally the TULIP doctrine is not supported by Scripture and it is one man's speculation on soteriology who was untrained and unskilled in theology and was instead a lawyer intent on creating a theocracy in Switzerland. He murdered His enemies and ruled Geneva with an iron fist destroying all that opposed his rule.    In spite of this history there are those who follow his teaching which in its changing of the gospel of our Lord and Savior becomes heresy and false teaching unreconcilable with the Sacred Traditions of Christ's Church or the Holy Scriptures.    In Christ   Fr. Joseph

Translations of the Bible are open to scholarly review.  The translators and their credentials are known, and their own biases can be researched and understood.  (Although this does not apply to the New World Translation created by the Jehovah's Witnesses.)    In addition, there are many study guides and commentaries that help with translation and also show when a word might be translated differently.  The act of translating is a pretty well defined science, though there certainly is an art to it.    We can accept knowledge on the authority of others, and we all do it every day.  You don't personally witness what happens in the White House, but you believe the news reports of it.  In the case of Biblical translation, because the source copies of the manuscripts are available for examination by scholars, we know that we can trust the translations a lot more than we can the daily news.|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	I'd say "NO"  The people I know (whom I try to avoid) who bash me with their bible, don't like to hear anything about the differences between the original Canaanite, or Aramean, or even Greek, and the KJV, especially on important points concerning "life after death" and "miracles" and "resurrection", where the differences could destroy the whole construction of the Church.

Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)    Kill Witches   You should not let a sorceress live.  (Exodus 22:17 NAB)    Kill Homosexuals  "If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives."  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)    Kill Fortunetellers  A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)    Death to Followers of Other Religions   Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)    Kill Nonbelievers  They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

B) Governmental policies would supposedly endorse a particular set of morals and perspectives. C) Give the believer a sense of winning the race of ideologies, thus reducing their sense of despair. D) Make the believer think that being an "American" inplies having a particular set of morals, ideas, and perspectives, and if the believers are part of the people with those particular set of beliefs, as represented by our leaders, that therefore the believer is somehow "more american".

But really, in the instances you mentioned, it's almost all thanks to having human to human support, but I'm sure there is a tiny bit that could be attributed to a belief in God and that God wants you to be better or help you.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	If the christian contemplating suicide came to a group like you  what then?|`|2MfMyh4Maa	It's odd that you used suicide in your example.  I've just suddenly heard a lot about suicide.    Both the Moslem group and the Christian affirm that there is a God who created us and who cares for us and who gave us a real purpose in living and we ought to carry it out though love for our Creator.    Take that away and all you have left is some gas from a bunch of people who want to give their opinions on something.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	Yes, I agree, there's just 50 million different labels on this planet for the same thing, plain and simple.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	All 3 Seebob.  Allah is God.  God is God it don't matter what language you use.  Love Kent.|`|deb8a10a1ae5016e6cc75e6eaf5b870faa	Well, some muslims are encouraged to SUICIDE, as suicide bombers, so, there is a difference...|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	No, that's not it at all.  God does everything.    That's why we don't send doctors to medical school.  We just teach them how to pray really really hard.    Wait, now that I think of it.. we don't do that... oh crap!|`|E9chZY74aa	When I do as God commands, He has obligated Himself to honor that with my salvation.  All I have to do is what the first century Christians did, Believe, Repent, Be Baptized for the removal of past sins, and live faithful unto death.   Then when judgment day comes, I am saved from the wrath of God against those who refuse to accept Him as Lord.|`|bnPPrJY1aa	Myself|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Oh, good grief! You atheists don't give up, do you. God put the people there and gave them the means to help. I don't think a muslim contemplating suicide is going to get help from her fellow muslims anyway. If you don't want to believe in God, fine. It's your loss, not mine.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	If it is me, I'd say it is God acting through these people.  Fact is, most people don't care if someone else commits suicide.  They're disturbed by it, but won't intervene because they simply don't care enough.    Next time you see someone threatening to jump from the top of a building, count how many people are waiting at the bottom and how many went upstairs to save the person.    God bless you.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Sometimes the devout from both groups succeed, then what?    Has either "god" failed miserably? Or did free will and human emotion trump their level of faith? Did the desire to die outweigh the desire to live? Did god kill them, then? IS He criminally negligant?  Is he culpable for their actions, or is it their responsibility only? Did He turn a blind eye to their pain? Maybe they didn't have enough "faith" to see them through, or perhaps God's just a miserable bast@rd and remains apathetic to the suffering of others? If He does care, why wouldn't he stop them?    These kind of questions could continue on ad infinitum.     I would think that in each situation she would assume "God" worked through the individuals of whom helped; I would also think however, that each person would credit her own god for the saving.   A Christian wouldn't thank Allah, and Muslim wouldn't thank God (or Christ) so it's subjective really. They are not one in the same, but both could be right in the sense of attributing divine intervention to the situation.     I think each would see The Eternal working through others. His hand at work through them; though they should also be credited for their part in the "saving."  I don't know about Muslims, but Christians tend to thank God for everything ... even down to the ridiculous... like the Holy Spirit hasn't anything better to do with his time than to find people parking spots at the Mall, or a table for dinner, or miraculously clearing the way through line at the supermarket, right? While it is not wrong to give God praise in everything, even the little things, i would think that saving the "Thanks God" for a time when it is necessary would give it more merit.    Anyways, One would hope she (either/or) would thank those individuals of whom took the time to help her. But with religious people, you never know. *sighs*    I don't know why everyone is so mad, I think this is a valid question.     xoxo  ?  PS: IF it were ME though ... i'd wonder why i had to get to the point of being suicidal ... and why "God" allowed my life to be so terribly bad ... which, would leave an entirely seperate angry exchange of words between myself and the Almighty.  BUT the truth is, it isn't just the religious that feel that way sometimes; I've known plenty of non-religious folks (men and women) who became suicidal ... who saves them, then?    *EDIT* ... I am going to have to agree with Issac, and Winters.   Most times people don't give a crap as to how others are feeling, and will mistreat the person before they'd ever help them; BUT the times when help is provided ... surprisingly there is always a plethora of people, some not even religious at all.|`|4YXiG0jWaa	And if my team wins the Superbowl, the players and coaches will thank and praise God for helping them win.  But can we honestly say that God is a Steeler's fan?  Might it be that talent, hard work, preparation, and luck helped them win?  I.E. God helps those that help themselves?|`|EFdNYdNhaa	On a superficial level: this is true.   On a much deeper level: THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUE GOD, and ONE ABSOLUTE TRUTH regarding the nature of The Creator.     He has revealed Himself perfectly in His Son.    Seek Him.    Psalm 2.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	"Saved me"??? Where did YOU ever get the idea that anybody was lost to begin with?      God doesn't lose people.  If you think you need to be "found," that's your problem; as far as I can tell, God has always known where I am.|`|fFmbqLf4aa	i would say it was the support given to them by caring people regardless of their faith.|`|AA10503170	But they are right, from both a Muslim and Christian view.  Since they both worship the same god, why can't they be?  They disagree on the little things, but they still believe in the same deity.    Of course, the real answer is this girl you speak of was saved by the people around her who have faith in a deity that doesn't really exist.
2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	"Rapt in worship" would mean that the person is so involved in the worship experience he or she may not be aware of anything else. Morally uplifted would have more to do with one's moral standards and how high those standards are.|`|AA11690436	Is it anything like the difference between being wrapped in a sarong and uplifted by a wonder bra?    (sorry, I don't know anything about Mr. Otto, but I just couldn't resist the pun.)|`|c0KKHMsAaa	eh, they're both placebo effects.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Morally uplifted, in my opinion, does not require religious belief.  I am morally uplifted every time someone thanks me for having helped them.  In fact, I am uplifted every time I do the right thing, whether or not anyone else knows or thanks me.

Your boyfriend is talking to your ex friend that is troubling you and is a Jerk..It sounds like your boyfriend has no ideal what is going on. You need to fill him in on what is going on with you and the jerk.I'm sure if your boyfriend knew he has be bugging you, he would have a talk with him and hopefully the jerk will let you alone.

Love is supposed to feel good, does it? If a guy friend of mine was flipping my gal crap, I'd be having a talk with that boy and making my point clear. LEAVE HER ALONE OR ELSE!!!

In other countries its about what one can reap off temporarily but the future is not taken into account as much. Plus corruption doesnt make things easier for the rest of the hispanic countries.

They will need to do some serious research on the topic and learn how it is not their fault and how it is something that is present from birth if not a very young age. They will also need therapy to get past all the social ideas that they had put in their head long before the child was born. They will need to alter their image of who their child would marry when they get older.     A study on the Bible and how it relates to homosexuality would also be helpful. One needs to be careful because many sites want to give the popular view instead of the correct understanding of the 5 passages in the Bible that mention anything close to homosexual behavior.     Once the family has recovered from their ignorance, they will be better prepared to love and accept their child exactly the way God made him/her. This will enable the homosexual to avoid drinking to suppress feelings of guilt. It will also reduce the tendency to cut or otherwise abuse ones self. It will also enable the homosexual to find love and acceptance the way that God wants. In turn, this would also enable the homosexual to look for true love from a partner rather than just sexual gratification because the homosexual will feel worthy of the Love that is given to them.|`|c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	Going to the day spa, getting your nails done, and a pedicure.

ixFbNr4taa	"Plato wrote in his Symposium that humans have been looking for their soul mate ever since Zeus cut them in half. In his mythic story, Plato describes a world where there were men, women and people who were both men and women. Apparently, humans began discussing how they could climb up to heaven and replace the gods. The gods were upset by this and discussed what should be done. The simplest solution would be to destroy mankind, but Zeus came up with a better idea. He suggested cutting all human beings in half. This would serve two purposes. First, it would immediately double the number of people making offerings to the gods. Second, it would weaken the humans, so they would not be able to carry out their plan. Zeus' idea was accepted, and the humans were all divided into two. Naturally, the humans were upset at this, and Zeus decided to enable each half to have intercourse with their opposite, symbolically creating a whole. Consequently, the males sought their female half, and the females sought their male half, allowing them to reproduce.    Plator's speaker for this section was Aristophanes, the greatest comic poet of Athens.  His speech is an explanation of why people in love say they feel "whole" when they have found their love partner. It is, he says, because in primal times people were globular spheres who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels. There were three sexes: the all male, the all female, and the "androgynous," who was half man, half woman. The creatures tried to scale the heights of heaven and planned to set upon the gods. Zeus thought about just blasting them to death with thunderbolts, but did not want to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them by chopping them in half.    After chopping the people in half, Zeus turned half their faces around and pulled the skin tight and stitched it up to form the belly button. Ever since that time, people run around saying they are looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. He says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but he thinks they are the bravest, most manly of all, and that heterosexuals are mostly adulterous men and unfaithful wives.    Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about with our noses split apart.    EDIT -- here's an even nicer explanation for one of the university  sites....    The Speech of Aristophanes (189c 189d).     Aristophanes, the comic poet, approaches his speech in a manner different from the other speeches. As a poet, he is going to tell a tale. The speech is essentially a mythological story about the original state of man and of how he evolved into his present condition vis a vis the phenomenon of love (189d).    There were originally three sexes begotten by the Sun (male), Earth (female) and Moon (hermaphrodite). Each of these sexes was doubled and united as a whole (189e 190b). For example, a man was rounded with two sides, each one anatomically complete. Now this entire race had become hubristic and sought to assault heaven. In response to this, Zeus punished them by slicing each one in half (190c  191a). This resulted in the three-fold forms of heterosexuality (from the hermaphrodite) and homosexuality (both male and female)(191d  e).    As a consequence of this split, each part began to crave for its "other half." It is this craving which we call love (192e). Ideally, true love is the recognition of ones proper half and this is the greatest blessing that love can bestow (193c d). In this manner, Aristophanes explains the effects of love viz., by explaining our original state.    One should note how the speech of Aristophanes provides a transition from the first sequence of speeches (concerned with the effects of Eros) to the second sequence of speeches(concerned with the nature of Eros). In the speech of Socrates, the nature of love will be seen to involve the notion of craving or desiring. Now the effects of the gods punishment of morals, for Aristophanes, leads to the nature of love as involving a desiring for ones other half. Thus the speech is anticipatory and provides and indication of the upcoming discourse of Socrates (cf 205e).|`|32la4VGEaa	at first i thought you was talking about a scylla... 6 heads 3 rows of teeth in each head, and beneath the women's torso she has a dogs body with 12 legs.  but i read a bit more of your question and realised that's not what you was talking about, i've had a look in my books but cant even find the myth. sorry.

5db661aa7c4e9f42fa8139651a98c24caa	Several weeks ago you responded to a question about children afraid of the dark or men afraid of the light: "which of the two is more foolish"?    You responded they were equally wise.  You said "Wisdom comes in many forms...young and old...light and dark."    Well, there are many forms of wisdom, but they are not all sound or profitable.  Some wisdom has been described as devillish, earthly, sensual...all destructive to the one foolish enough to follow it.      It has also been said (rightly so) that there is a way which seems right unto a man, but that way leads unto death.      The wisdom of mere men dies with them....every thought, hope, or ambition ceases to be expressed in this realm when a man returns to the dust.  There is no such thing as an ascended man, and beware of anyone claiming "enlightenment" or exclusive rights to the "light".  This is New Age, middle eastern philosophy that is essentially crap, to coin a phrase.    The only question I would ask anyone who would make such a claim to fame (not that I would ever make the mistake of perceiving any human to be "ascended" or "enlightened") would be this:  "How did you get to be so foolish?"    "...no flesh should glory in His presence, but of Him [those who believe] are in Christ Jesus, who became for us Wisdom from God---and Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption---that as it is written, "He who glories, let him glory in the Lord."   1 Cor 1:29-31    THERE is your true enlightenment, and there is your true wisdom.

I used to think it was a "no brainer" that this symbolized club-over-the-head oppression and subjugation, until I learned that for some Islamic women -- particularly today in places like America -- the hijab/veil and loose fitting clothing can provide a temporary escape from predatory males (of many backgrounds) who want to obsess on their looks and  "check them out" in response to "the booty call" etc.    It may sound corny but one of the most humbling experiences is when a woman's proclamation that she loves you is not a denial of her independence but a MANIFESTATION of it.

Having all of these resources available gives a woman the false impression that she is independent when in truth she depends on everything named above.

I guess it depends on the individual.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	I've met some pretty lamed brains. and they smoked all the time.|`|9CEW093maa	From some studies and articles I've read (from countless debate threads about marijuana) that it is a high possibility it PROMOTES the regeneration of brain cells; however, even if this was proven, I would never try it. 100% natural sanity for me, thanks. xD|`|7XyIyNSnaa	Nope. :)|`|AwAw0uiKaa	If you smoke it heavily over a long period of time it can do a lot of damage in many areas, as it does harm brain cells. So, I guess? Just smoke in moderation if you have to smoke at all. Not that hard.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	It's "dumb" not "dum".  The word "dumb" means unable to speak.  I don't think smoking weed affects your ability to speak.|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	only very very very high|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Marijuana kills brain cells. You do the math.|`|koXcq0l1aa	You may become dumb*.  Not sure about dum.    Evan, that was so so rude.  I'm reporting you.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	No S-H-I-T|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	too late|`|wCZ3T5QLaa	loss of braincells at the most but thats only if you smoke weed on a regular basis. loss of short term memory is usually a common effect. Smoking weed period is a bad decision, ive been there, you begin a mental addiction over time that can be hard to break.|`|AA10950898	No, only stoned. And the correct spelling is dumb.  Smoked.  Too.  Are you dumb already?|`|vPYcoJ0yaa	You may not get any smarter, since your motivation to learn will be eroded, but permanently "dumb"... well I guess it depends on how "dumb" you were to start with. I know people with 140 IQ at 17yo who smoked weed every day for 20 years, and still had 140 IQ at 40yo.    And some say you have to be pretty dumb to smoke weed every day for 20 years.    I don't suggest you do an IQ test when you are stoned though. lol|`|5ph71VMvaa	Yes.  You're brain needs oxygen.  Not weed.|`|sxKrb98Caa	WARNING: Marijuana affects the brain.    It is possible, but one thing i know for sure is that marijuana affects your short term memory. The more you smoke the more often you forget.|`|bEGrmfJhaa	you are dumb if you smoke it in the first place|`|uxkDrhyKaa	Marijuana will not harm you enough to make you "dumb".  It is essentially a little worse than cigarettes.|`|WF6uHskUaa	..i wouldnt say dumb but it kills ur brain cells son...it kills ur brain cells!!!|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	yes you can....keep your limit|`|qI9VCuhZaa	The government wants you to believe that it does. PROPAGANDA.|`|L3WVbS5haa	well if thats in ur case ur dumb 4 smoking it in the 1st place and also ur dumb 4 not being able 2 spell dumb|`|NkHU8tEJaa	The dude who said marijuana kills brain cells is obviously confusing it with alcohol.    It won't necessarily make you dumb, but you could become psychologically addicted to it. (In other words, you feel like you can't have fun without weed).    It's also been known to give people panic attacks.    On the other hand, some people are able to smoke/eat it all their lives and are still functioning normally.|`|j1IEm0gWaa	im a smoker... and yes you do get more forgetful.... currently on a round the world trip, which is also my detox from the stuff. im actually quite enjoying not feeling sluggish all the time    love it tho|`|znJJLSG1aa	I think YOU could become dumb not ME since your the one smoking the weed and it's "TOO MUCH" NOT "TO MUCH" MAYBE YOU SHOULD CUT DOWN ALOT SINCE YOU CAN'T SPELL AND YOU HAVE BECOME THE PERFECT EXAMPLE THAT "YES" WEED DOES AFFECT THE BRAIN MY FRIEND... :)|`|3bBv23BNaa	Yes, and you will start to leave the "silent" letters off the end of words|`|672b5656d0344c959a7f6892a55f88ecaa	you only get slowly when ur high
UT2tv5N3aa	No I havent but here are some bits you may like to read about it...........  .........................................    DMT is a powerful hallucinogen, originally sourced from Amazonian plants but now produced synthetically. It is one of a number of drugs known as short-acting tryptamines. Its sister, 5-Meo-DMT is up to 10 times more powerful. Either drug has quick and very intense hallucinogenic effects. DMT comes in crystalline form and is usually smoked from a pipe or bong in very small doses.    People who smoke DMT have described feeling rapidly propelled into an intense alternate reality;  The primary effects last between 15 and 20 minutes, with a cooling off period of a couple of hours before returning to normal;  Users have described seeing the face of god to various experiences from visiting other worlds to having conversations with aliens;  There is an abrupt return to reality and most users will experience disorientation when they come round.   It's not uncommon for those who take large amounts of DMT to suffer psychological and emotional difficulties for weeks afterwards;  The smoke of DMT can cause throat and lung irritation;  Integration of the trip into daily life can cause anxiety, difficulty focusing on daily tasks, preoccupation with the experience, and insomnia.   If you haven't tripped before, or even if you have, it is best to be in the presence of people you know, and in a safe environment like your living room rather than at a festival;  If you are in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval it is advisable not to take DMT as you risk a bad trip in which you may experience overwhelming hallucinations, anxiety, and fear;  Those with a family history of psychological problems are at risk of triggering such conditions in themselves;  Most individuals taking DMT do so with a partner, to take hold of the pipe once the experience begins. It is impossible to stand up, talk, move or do anything once the trip starts, until you come down;  DMT can cause your heart rate and blood pressure to increase suddenly, so those with heart problems or high blood pressure should give this drug a wide berth;  Mixing DMT with other drugs is NOT advised. It is an overwhelmingly powerful drug, and most users report that one or two trips is enough for them. Mixing stimulants with this drug should also be avoided, because of the additional (potentially lethal) strain it puts on your heart.    DMT is Class A under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. This means it is illegal to produce, supply or possess in any form. Maximum penalty for possession is seven years in jail.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Not I, I won't touch that stuff, it makes you get really sick, but try www.erowid.org if you're looking for info about reactions on drugs.
49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I would not take a person off to put another person on.  There would be no point in that, and no "net gain."  Destroying one life to save another (which is not at all certain, in your example) is pointless.    What would *I* do?  I'd build another machine, of course.|`|WX1b747Iaa	I really would need to know whether the man on the machine is conscious or not, it makes all the difference and I can't answer otherwise. This is a serious question and I would like very much to answer it.|`|MbCFe1odaa	So right before you make this decision God comes down and tells you what to do and........ .where exactly is he the rest of the time when people are being murdered, raped, enslaved and the list can go on on.......|`|37LKDbtsaa	Here's the problem: There is no god to help you.    Even if there was then Gawd would probably want him dead, knowing what kind of person he is.  (hint: Old testament).|`|h3gMzNS3aa	But Islam has no divine guidance in some fundamental areas either: eg. there's no punishment for rape in quran, and there's no mention of jails as a punishment even though jail is the most common form of punishment. These matters are more important than the hospital machine. Plus hadiths create about uncertainty by their guidance about things as simple & important as music (some won't listen to music because it's haram, others consider it a gift of allah which should be appreciated), so religion still results in uncertainty anwyay. There are divine-guided imams who decide what allah wants. By your logic I think you should become a shia if you aren't one already as they think for you.    I think the need for 'divine guidance' is more about the need to have an answer to cling on to. (I'd do what Trish said- acquire another machine).|`|0d88ab7c3e5ace15a916d7103b2561abaa	you would never know if God wanted you to take him off or not|`|pNww5UC0aa	God is the giver of life. He will sends His followers a signal/hint about the right decision when we come to Him in prayer and patience. :)|`|NUGIIND8aa	There is no need for any divine intervention in your straw man scenario.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	You don't need God to make a logical decision based on facts. I'd let the person who was the most likely to recover use it.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	I'd call the manufacturer of the machine and get more produced.  God isn't going to do anything.  He won't heal amputees so why would he tell me what to do?|`|RrVr9Bwfaa	Sure it would be nice if there were divine guidance.  It would also be nice if I could fly instead of having to drive, but wishing it were so doesn't make it true.    Peace to you also.|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	If the man or his fmily is paying for that machine, then he is entitled to use it as long as he wishes or until the family says no more.  Sounds like the family may be of god and are trusting in god to recover him......MIRACLES DO HAPPEN IN GODS TIME....and there is a reason why after 10 years he is still on that machine.    I WILL KEEP HIM IN MY PRAYERS|`|mC4mnvGFaa	Of course not.No divine guidance, just empathy and compassion.  Something you apparently think comes from your sky fairy. He still has quality of life. Its first come, first served, there are other machines.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	If it is certain that someone else is more likely to recover, I would switch out the patient, but assuming that the others have an equal probability of recovery, I wouldn't switch him out.  It is much more harmful to the people involved to act in a way that causes someone's death(removing the 1st patient), than to passively let the others die.    In most instances, as a human who is an imperfect judge, I would take the course of action that least interfered with the course that the world is presently on, thus bearing a minimal amount of responsibility for the outcome.  I wouldn't take the life of one person to save the life of someone else whose life was equally viable.    EDIT*  Even if the others were more viable, the act of choosing one life over another is so immoral that only in the case of an extreme difference in viability would it be right to switch out the patients.      By actively causing someone's death, rather than passively allowing the others to die, I would become associated with the first person's death and it would blur the lines of morality, unless there was a clear difference in viability/recovery probability where it is clear that switching out the patients will cause more good than harm.|`|bF7yUXy5aa	You don't need divine guidance, you need to make more than 1 machine.     I'm assuming since it's a breathing problem, he's conscious and aware and so it would be cruel to take him off the machine against his will.|`|tZVoPeVxaa	There are many outstanding factors you have not taken into consideration. One factor would be how the patent feels/ family members of the patent. Even if one such as yourself would like to turn to god for guidance, he would not respond. God has never responded to anyone because he is not real. You could also turn to your own family for help with this dilemma and you could also consult with other doctors.|`|HlFzl1piaa	If I don't get help of a divine nature when having to make such a decision I would be unable to make a it. Unless I knew the guy thats been on the machine for Ten years is never going to breath on his own again.|`|oMMnfGXIaa	By my God it is not right to take some one else's life. If he cant speak then the family should make the decision. and if he can speak he has the right to choose life or death. You shouldn't make any decisions about someone else's life because then the blood will be on your hands. And as for the 10000 people waiting, I am a true believer of letting God's will be done. I pray for his will of the world to be done every night and that he gives clarity for the ones who don't understand.    God bless..|`|Pa7hOhLyaa	Well the problem here is that the choice of removing this man from the machine means to " indirectly" take his  life away.. So you are choosing about the life or death of this person. Well this man has become totally dependent on this machine(since he has been on it for ten years and doctors can do nothing about it).. So what is there so frightening about his death? The man is not living a life anyway. In this case I believe death would be a sort of freedom for him. I believe that the soul of a person never dies, and with death, the soul will reincarnate and this process goes on until it shall attain enlightenment.. In this case the soul of the man will be freed and shall live again in another life.. This surely is a difficult situation but one does not need "divine guidance" but only simple reasoning to make the decision= Take the man off the machine..n dont be sad about his death because the soul is eternal and can never "die".|`|KVd8aKDoaa	If the man needs a machine to live, he's not alive.  The man should be allowed to pass on naturally.  Then the machine should be destroyed because it is disturbing the natural order of things.|`|LOYeeweAaa	Assalmo alaikum. Remember one week ago I asked a question about my right eyelid, well I addressed u personally later on asked u 2 give me a special prayer but it seems that after u have answered a Q. u never go back to look at it for feedback. I am still waiting and checking everyday for your ans. Please go back to that question and read it.The bag with passports is still not found.    Ans. 2 this Q. is remove this guy who is using the machine for 10 yrs as if he were 2 recover he would have by now.
BABcrdMKaa	Nope, something is either true or it isnt.    Its not a compromise, something can be true to someone individually but that solely will never make it a fact.|`|NJpihlsHaa	I'm not quite sure I totally understand where you are asking your question from, so I'm going to answer it from a Christian's standpoint. I believe that there are truths that aren't particular to an individual; universal truths. On the other hand, there are very individual ways that each person connects with those truths. There is no one way to go about faith that is right for everyone, for as one person gets closer to God through fasting another may get closer by eating and blessing their food, for example. So as there should be certain truths that are realized and need to be recognized as the base for Christianity (Jesus' life, death, resurrection, ascension, among others) there are individual ways to connect to those truths.|`|yqUgRG2raa	You have to realize that we can determine that a certain rock is made up of certain minerals. This is fact. With living life, it gets a little harder for life is flexible. Certain things can be said to be certain such as we must have bones to be alive. Still, we are in the realm of the material. Now, if a war is fought and one side is defeated but the defeated ends up with a better life for it after wards, were they truly defeated. No, they were just forced to change. Here we have a word definition problem. Think about beauty, some say a diamond is beautiful, another may say it is too showy. Here we have a perception problem. The best you can say is that truth has to do with survival. No one is going to say that clear, pure water is ugly for it is needed for survival. So, yes, truth may be different for people, we may have different needs for survival.|`|AA11935435	Yes there certainly is a difference unless they are in agreement  There is no such thing as an individual truth, something is either true or it isn't.To illustrate let's say you were at a doctor and had a debilitating illness, the doctor's office, and he tells you that there is a true medication which will cure your illness, but that you can choose your individual true medication which will cure it, if you did pick any medication  would that medication be the right one? would that mean that all the medications would work for your  illness? There is one truth, and many non-truths even if someone may say they are all truth, you cannot have individual truths especially when one individual truth, disagrees with another, either one is true, and the other isn't, or they are both untrue, and another totally different one is true, you cannot have it both ways! It is impossible to have many differing ideas and for them all  to be truth.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No, the truth is the truth. However, the individual's perception and interpretation of that truth may differ from the reality of it.

Practicing or Not Muslim Men & Women are not allowed to get married to Atheists, still regardless children are not illegitimate & can't and shouldn't say that.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Yes they are muslims are not allowed to marry atheists or heretics.

However Islam calls  Atheists a great sinners for their refusal to accept God almighty who gives them life,  death, protects them through Angeles assigned to each human, feeds them by causing rain, provide them oxygen to live etc. etc. According to Quran, all Atheism who die an unbelievers, God will punish them severely in hell fire for their refusal to thank God and accept Him as their sustainer and provider.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	When do you think your going to shut the hell up and do something worth typing you retard? :)|`|287ae5682476df003fc4d95ff463997aaa	A Muslim is not permitted to marry an Atheist according to Qur'an and Sunnah.

Thats the Bottomline..so i think you can answer it yourself.|`|lGqWWSZ6aa	A Muslim woman marrying someone, who's not a Muslim, is prohibited in Islam.  If she does, she committed a major sin, but the children are still legitimate because they got married.  They'll be protected by the law of the country where they got married.  I don't think they got married in an Islamic court because the man would have been asked to present a certification of conversion to Islam before they were married.|`|AA11379158	i guess so since the marriage was null from the start.    ask an alim anyway.|`|ozpB4ADVaa	What a horrible question.

She participated in the robbery, but not in the killing of the clerk.  And that appears to not be premeditated.    She should for sure do jail time though.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	Yes to both.  A woman who beat a child that badly should die before she can do it again. She's obviously a 'bad seed.    The second woman was a willing participant in a crime involving a firearm that resulted in death.  Had she refused, chances are the robbery wouldn't have taken place.|`|l2A2kCIPaa	ppl still get hung??|`|K5UStEuoaa	Neither of them should be hanged.

This question reminds me of the Life story of St. Paul who was the greatest Bible contributor.  Though he was beaten, rejected and put to jail for preaching and believing in God's word, He was one soul who was filled with great joy even he was imprisoned.  His conversion on his road to Damascus was a miracle in itself.

This is the greatest news in the world and should be the goal of all of God's children. It just saddens me that Satan, the father of lies and the Master of Deceit has so many of our brothers and sisters fooled and lost in the world. They seek after riches and power, but cannot figure out why that temporary happiness only lasts for a short amount of time.

Ok to the question now-  The prize IS the upward call of God in Jesus Christ.  The continued revelation of the love of the Father with and through the Son.  As we stop looking back at the "old creature" and allow the Holy Spirit to train the "new creation" he reveals more of our loving Father's character to us.  The importance in doing this is letting go of our past selves (killing the flesh- the rebellious heart) and making room for the Glory of God.|`|2WnbP80Taa	My grandmother had this verse in her Bible:  Jesus saddest words spoken are found in John 5:40  "and ye will not come to me, that ye might have life"|`|r8rykCkGaa	It's not easy because our past failures keep reminding us that we will fail again so why even try, but we are told to walk by faith and leave the past behind.

No they cast off as much as possible wearing very little so not to be held back. I try to cast off all the things of the world and all the works of the enemy that weigh me down.

That once we ask Jesus into our lives, we begin the race toward the Finish line to obtain the Prize of our Salvation.    Paul is saying that we are to put the things of our past behind us and not to consider them as important as striving to become more like Christ as we run this race.  After all, Jesus is the Bride Groom, and He is looking for a Bride without spot or wrinkle.  We must strive for holiness until we enter glory.

Matthew 26:52|`|hR7OsqtRaa	You need to protect and defend yourself, if attacked.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

Jesus was endorsing self sufficiency on the road and self protection from wild animals...  In his days, Israel still had lions and bears in the wild.  These were wiped out by the later Roman practice of capturing live wild animals for their arenas [ circuses]    (Luke 11:21) When a strong man, well armed, guards his palace, his belongings continue in peace.

I think at the Supper Jesus knew Peter would slice off Malchus' ear and Jesus would heal it.  So there had to be a sword there, for the glory of God to be shown in the healing.  Undoubtedly Jesus knew in the Room that Peter had a sword, before He asked.  Maybe He just wanted to call attention to this miracle.    Yes, I believe Jesus expects us to use weapons in self-defense.

aWHvHIr1aa	If you have a red letter Bible, this is the black text before the sea of red ending 17:10.  Any Christian not wanting to read the Bible differently than the cults need to investigate how much if not all of this text (15:1-17:10) is Jesus actual response.  One should assume that if the text doesnt change topics, then the topic hasnt changed.regardless if there is a change in chapters, sub-headings and verse numbers.  Chapters, sub-headings and verse numbers were not part of the original text but added to ease our ability to find a passage.      The text is clear about why the parable was given:    Lk 15:  1Now the tax collectors and "sinners" were all gathering around to hear him. 2But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."  3Then Jesus told them this parable: 4"Suppose(parable of the lost coin)    The Parable of the lost sheep, coin, son, and the shrewd manager all are a responding to the Pharisees/Teacher muttering, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."     In the parable of the lost sheep, God is the shepherd and the sinners were the lost sheep.  In the parable of the lost coin, God is the woman and the sinners are the lost coin.    Jesus is pointing out to the Pharisees/Teachers that a person retains their value to God whether they are lost or found and that it is Gods desire that none be lost.    The parable of the lost son continues this theme.  The son/sinner is valuable to the father/God whether they are lost or found and it is Gods desire that His children arent lost.      However, this parable is different than the other two because the father/God does not go and seek the son/sinner as the shepherd and woman sought their lost sheep/coin/sinner.  Instead, the pivotal moment was when the son came to his senses.  The son/sinner realized that his father/God was generous.  He, (as a servant someone besides God), was driven to this conclusion because he longed to fill his stomach with the food the pigs ate while his fathers/God's servants had more than enough.     He/sinner hoped that his father/God would be generous enough to make him a servant but the father was more generous than he could imaginethe father restored the son to being his son.  And then, the father did what was beyond imagination, he threw this huge party that was so big, his brother/Pharisees/Teachers got jealous.      The older brother/Pharisees refused to join the party and said that the father wasnt generous.  He accused the father of treating him like a slave and that he hadnt given him a goat.  The father/God rightly said that everything the father had was his/Pharisees.  This is true since the father/God had divided his possessions and given them to his 2 sons.  So the older brother owned the goat, calf, and the farmbut had not received the free gift.  Jesus continues to talk about the Pharisees in the parable of the shrewd manager.      Since the parable of the lost son builds off of the lost sheep and coin and is the lead in to the shrewd manager, and since all the parables are a response the Pharisees/Teachers grumbling, one can conclude Luke gives an orderly account.|`|c61bf05c11575801063cc3be9957813caa	Hello 1Graftedin,    I think that you are talking about the prodigal son.  Jesus was teaching that you may wander away and get wrapped up in doing what you want to do, but he still loves you.  No matter how far you may you get way, you will always have a home to come home to.  Jesus and His father love you, and they wait patiently with open arms for you to come home.  The prodigal son realized that he had sinned, not only against his father, but also against God.  He quickly decided to go home and ask his father to take him back as a servant instead of as a son.  However, when his father saw him, he ran and embraced him, and threw a big party for him, putting a ring on his finger and the finest clothes on him.  In the same way, when we repent of our sins, God celebrates welcoming us as his children, and not as his servants.  When we accept Jesus into our hearts, we become joint heirs with Christ, and are entitled to the same things that Christ is entitled to.  Christ has not called us his servants, but his brothers and sisters, and he has also called us his friends.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The picture of the father receiving the son back into relationship is a picture of how we should respond to repentant sinners as well (1 John 4:20-21, Luke 17:3, Galatians 6:1, James 5:19-20). All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23). We are included in that all and we must remember that all our righteous acts are like filthy rags apart from Christ (Isaiah 64:6, John 15:1-6). It is only by Gods grace that we are saved, not by works that we may boast of some goodness that we perceive to be our own (Ephesians 2:9, Romans 9:16, Psalm 51:5). That is the core message of the Parable of the Prodigal Son.|`|3c657a5434f59237e54a985206d43bb4aa	That if you are doing good things you should be doing them because you are truly a good person, not just to please God. Therefore you would NOT be jealous when you're brother (who was lost to God) found him and was praised. You would be just as happy as everyone else. That's my interpretation and I believe it to be the TRUE meaning. I've heard pple say I am wrong, but to me that is universal.|`|AA10744085	You mean The Prodigal Son?  If you are, then think about this...  The word "prodigal" can be interpreted to mean "lavish". The parable is not so much about the sons' lavish waste as it is about the Fathers' lavish love.  The son didn't EARN his fathers' love. In fact, by Jewish law the son should have been stoned. But the father overrode the law & instead he lavished love upon an undeserving son.|`|81a030f090ac5dab56f018a405e8ee8baa	The Prodigal Son? It was a parable to demonstrate forgiveness: God, as the father, forgave the son, or repentant mankind, for their sins, just as in the story.    It also shows us that if God can forgive us our innumerable sins, then we should be able to forgive each other for personal slights and differences as well :0)    Except those "reportardians . . . ."  :D|`|14db13b3027c0c84f23c82914a9d27f9aa	All stories or parables Jesus told had many different consciousnesses. They always apply to soul development. The prodigal son represents one who decides he wants to live in his flesh desires only and do what he wants (self will) So he left his Father and went to do what he wanted. He ended up learning a lesson and decided to return to his Father where there is another wonderful lesson on forgiveness. We must always forgive. We must not always do our will but God's Will more often, or try to attain to do so.   All Jesus Parables have higher meanings, and Jesus gave all of us a chance to learn them in our consciousness.

Classical arabic (the form that is used mostly for newspapers nowadays and is more reffered to as modern arabic, it is also the most understood):     bil tab'i inaho modaris jayid; inaho arabiy.   or  bo; tab'i inaho mo'alim jayid; inaho arabiy.    for dialects:     if you are talking to a khaleeji (this is an arab that is from the GCC countries, and gulf area):     tab'an ohwa modaris zain; ohwa arabi.    if you are talking to an egyptian (which is what the two people before wrote and should have told you that it is Egyptian dialect considering she/he is a teacher and not formal arabic):     tab'an howa modaris gayid gidan; howa arabiy.       for more dialects or help on anything else jhust message me :)|`|AA12211772	well,  Beltab' howa modaress gayed ,enahu Arabeyy.  *Beltab' = ofcourse ( ' ) stand for a stop,becuase this sound doesn'e exist in English  *howa= he is "o" as in Oh ,"w" as in window.  *modaress = teacher "e" as in bed,"a" as in cat  *gayed =good "y"as in year,"a"as in cat,"e"as in bed  *enahu =another way of saying "he is" but with confermation  * Arabeyy = Arab "yy" as in year but more tense "doubled sound"  Hope it helps.

J0bqxozSaa	wa'alaikom il salam,    Yes i do indulge myself with sports, which is totally against my moms wishes since I seem to scare her a lot. I have played Varsity volleyball (captain), Varsity Basketball, Water Skiing, Snow Skiing (recently busted my knee because of it), Ski Diving, Snow boarding, horse riding, tennis, and badminton!     I especially love swimming and anything to do with the sea!     I have simply chosen these sports because of my love for extreme sports and challenges in general. I have indulged myself maybe too much since i could not do anymore sports after my knee got busted!     By the way, just for the sake of your survey! I have two friends who are both Arab muslim women as well, who actively participate in the same sports!     Hope that helps :)     If you need anything else tell me!     oh and my sister only plays volleyball, her reason would be because we have a volleyball court and during the weekends we all play at our beach house.     my younger sister plays volleyball and basket ball for the same reasons.     My mother wind surfs, water ski's, does fencing, and running as a means of staying fit!     :)     Salam and good luck :)

It is only faith by lack of evidence.  You can't prove a negative, you can prove another answer or a positive, but not a negative.

If it does, then sure, I'd believe that there is a higher being. If it doesn't, then I will continue disbelieving. If it does now but is soon given an explanation that does not involve a supernatural being in the future, then I'd start believing but then stop once it is proved incorrect. (Of course, this evidence also depends on whether or not it can be attributed to any outside living being. For all I know, this evidence could just show the existence of highly-advanced extraterrestrials.)    But that doesn't mean that I'd become Christian. I'd most likely just head toward deism, since that is the most likely faith (it explains why nature is rather indifferent to human suffering, at least). Of course, this all depends upon the evidence and how it correlates to religious texts and science in general.

We also accept that Christ is the Son of God but not the way of many fanatical Christians. Krishna Consciousness also known as Bhakti Yoga or Sanatan Dharma or Vaisnavism is the oldest teaching of God (over 5,000 years).  My family was shocked at first but in time as they began to understand the tracings my parents say they respect my beliefs very much but they are to conditioned to their own ways to follow though they think what I do is correct. Such as I am vegetarian and chant on beads 2 and a half hours a day on beads the Names of God and offer all my food to God and do everything for God also known as Krishna, Allah,Jehovah, Vishnu,etc.) I love what I do it is my life my soul.

Anyone can beat their kids...a TRUE Christian would not, but these days anyone can call themselves a Christian.    edit: I have to respond to LetsTorque's statement...I can honestly say that I do not condone the murder of any doctor who performs abortions. Two wrongs do not make a right. I want to make my views public on that matter. Any so-called Christian who thinks it's okay to murder someone who performs abortions is not really a Christian, plain and simple. Those are the people who give Christians a bad name and it's a shame that non-Christians can't tell the difference...maybe that means the 'real' believers need to step it up a little and prove themselves in this doubting world.

46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	As a young minister, I was asked by a funeral director   to hold a graveside service for  a homeless man, with no family or friends.  The funeral was to be held  at a new cemetery way back in the country, and this man would be the first to be laid to rest there.  As I was not familiar with the backwoods area, I became lost; and being a typical man did not stop  for directions.  I finally arrived an hour late.  I saw the backhoe and the crew,  who were eating lunch, but  the hearse was nowhere in sight.     I apologized to the workers for my tardiness, and stepped   to the side of the open grave, where I saw the vault lid   already in place.  I assured the workers I would not hold   them up for long, but this was  the proper thing to do.  The workers gathered around, still eating their lunch.     I poured out my heart and soul.  As I preached the workers  began to say, "Amen!"  "Praise the Lord!"  and "Glory!"  I preached, and I preached, like I'd never preached before:   from Genesis all the way to Revelations.     I closed the lengthy service with a prayer and walked to my car. As I was opening the door and taking off my coat,   I overheard one of the workers saying to another,   "I ain't never seen anything like that before   and I've  been putting in septic tanks for twenty years!"|`|jdcdUhWgaa	I dont know...but I would love to throw them both in a pit and see what happens.

Like many young men, the boy didn't really know what he wanted to do, and he didn't seem too concerned about it.    One day, while the boy was away at school, his father decided to try an experiment. He went into the boy's room and placed on his study table four objects:     - a Bible,     - a silver dollar,     - a bottle of whisky and     - a Playboy magazine    "I'll just hide behind the door," the old preacher said to himself, "when he comes home from school this afternoon, I'll see which object he picks up.    If it's the Bible, he's going to be a preacher like me, and what a blessing that would be!    If he picks up the dollar, he's going to be a businessman, and that would be okay, too.    But if he picks up the bottle, he's going to be a no-good, low down drunkard, and, Lord, help me.... what a shame that would be.    And worst of all..... if he picks up that magazine he's gonna be a skirt-chasin', no good bum."    The old man waited anxiously, and soon heard his son's footsteps as he entered the house whistling and headed for his room. The boy tossed his books on the bed, and as he turned to leave the room he spotted the objects on the table. With curiosity in his eye, he walked over to inspect them.     Finally, he picked up the Bible and placed it under his arm. He picked up the silver dollar and dropped it into his pocket. He uncorked the bottle and took a big drink while he admired this month's Centerfold.

So the man leaves the dog with them and comes back a week later. The owner of the school brings the dog out and says, "Watch this. Rover, sit!"

kRku82jraa	Generalmente, para leer un kanji se hace de la siguiente manera:  - si el kanji va acompa?ado de okurigana, su lectura ser en kun-yomi ().  - si el kanji va acompa?ado de uno o ms kanjis para formar una palabra su lectura ser en on-yomi ().  Lo que estipulo aqu no es un reglamento, solo son generalidades, porque podemos encontrar palabras que teniendo kanjis en composicin, combinan lecturas on-yomi y kun-yomi.   As mismo hay kanjis que pueden tener una o varias pronunciaciones on-yomi y kun-yomi o a veces ninguna.  Ejem: kanji (estudio, aprendizaje, ciencia)   (estudiar)  la kanji se lee como mana y va acompa?ado de okurigana bu para poder usar como verbo.  (estudiante)   la  primera kanji se lee como gaku y la segunda como sei  Para aprender ambas lecturas de los kanji te recomiendo leer textos en donde las kanjis tengan su furigana, es una manera de aprender las pronunciaciones gradualmente y sin confundirte demasiado.

(perdon por la referencia historica)       Pues la respuesta a tu pregunta es muy facil y a la vez es muy dificil, por que cada "kanji" se escribe con un numero determinado de "strokes" o sea para que se entienda "palitos" es como diriamos la "ortografia" del idioma Japones, si te falta un "palito" ya no se puede leer correctamente, o si te sobra uno o dos, es lo mismo, a esto se le anade  lo que alguna personas te han escrito, se les anade el "okurigana" y cambia totalmente su significado, el "okurigana" es para darle la lectura japonesa, ya que si no lo tubiera, seria la lectura un poco mas cercana al Chino, de ahi que se le diga a la lectura "onyomi" y "Kunyomi" como referencia   "yomi" quiere decir Leer,  asi es que tu pregunta es de 2 a 3 escrituras, por lo tanto es un poco dificil pero sabiendo esto es un poco facil, pues bien, espero que tengas suerte.

Consecuentemente, las normas derivadas de tales textos y de la tradicin oral constituyen la gua de vida de los judos, aunque la observancia de las mismas vara mucho de unos grupos a otros.    Otra de las caractersticas del judasmo, que lo diferencia de las otras religiones monotestas, radica en que el judasmo se considera no slo como una religin sino tambin como una tradicin y una cultura. Las otras religiones trascienden varias naciones y culturas, mientras que el judasmo se considera la religin y la cultura de un pueblo especfico. La religin, la cultura y el pueblo judo pueden ser considerados como conceptos separados pero estn estrechamente interrelacionados. La tradicin y la cultura juda son muy diversas y heterogneas ya que fueron desarrolladas de maneras distintas por las diferentes comunidades, y cada comunidad local incorpor elementos culturales de los distintos pases en los que vivieron los judos a partir de la dispersin|`|73d71f3aff080f7d07613a2f6dc2bb80aa	Creo que no todos los principios parten de una "doctrina religiosa"..Las personas no estrictamente religiosas, tambin tienen principios..

Si te refieres a en qu casos hay que dar la vida por algo, el Judaismo plantea 3 casos    Cualquier mitzva (precepto) que ponga en peligro la vida queda anulada para preservar la vida.  Hay 3 excepciones en las cuales uno debe dar la vida:    1. Contra Di-s: Cometer idolatra.  2. Contra el prjimo: Asesinato.  3. Contra uno mismo: Inmoralidad (adulterio).    Osea, si a mi me ponen una pistola y me dicen: asesina a fulano, debo dar mi vida antes que asesinar a otro.  En el caso de idolatria, solo es valido si estas ante mas de 9 personas, por lo que podrias influir a un gran grupo de gente a ir por la idolatria.    Ahora, si te referias en general valores morales o religiosos a cumplir, pues todos tienen igual valor, no a la idolatria, caridad, no asesinar, no robar, no adulterio, no ser cruel con los animales, no profanar el Santo nombre de DIOS, benevolencia, visitar enfermos, ayudar al huerfano y a la viuda, etc, etc, etc.    Suerte!|`|vMHOVz9Faa	no tengo doctrina religiosa, amo la vida y eso es lo que interesa, vivir en sana armonia con mis semejantes y con la naturaleza y tratar de no hacer mal a nadie. saludos|`|cEIQgBydaa	Cultivarte fsica e intelecutalmente, no lastimar ni?os peque?os, no matar animales si no es para defenderse o para comer, no rodearse de gente poco inteligente, respetar a quin te ofrece respeto, mostrar respeto en casa ajena o no acudir ah, el objetivo de tu vida deber ser aportar algo de enorme magnitud a la raza humana.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The Council of Nicea took place in 325 A.D. by the order of the Roman Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantine. Nicea was located in Asia Minor, east of Constantinople. At the Council of Nicea, Emperor Constantine presided over a group of Church bishops and leaders with the purpose of defining the true God for all of Christianity and to eliminate all the confusion, controversy, and contention within Christs church. The Council of Nicea affirmed the deity of Jesus Christ and established an official definition of the Trinity - the deity of The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit under one Godhead, having three co-equal and co-eternal Persona.         Constantine, a converted Christian (debatably), called for a council meeting to be held in Nicea with the bishops of the Christian church to resolve escalating quarrels and controversy mounting to a bitter degree of disunity amongst the church leadership and congregates concerning theological issues. The failing Roman Empire, now under Constantines rule, could not withstand the division caused by years of hard-fought, out of hand arguing over doctrinal differences. He saw it not only as a threat to Christianity but as a threat to society as well. Therefore, at the Council of Nicea, Constantine demanded that the Christians settle their internal disagreements and become Christ-like agents who could bring new life into a troubled, beaten-down empire. Constantine felt called to use his authority to help bring about the unity, peace, and love, all for which Christ stands. He and the bishops had reason to worry about the future survival of Christianity within the Roman world empire, let alone the survival of his world empire. The Council of Nicea, led by Emperor Constantine, was the meeting to settle differences, to become like-minded, all to the glory of Christ.         The main theological issue and focus had always been about Christ. Since the ending of the Apostolic Age and beginning of the Church Age, saints began questioning, debating, fighting, and separating over, Who is the Christ? Is He more divine than human or more human than divine? Was Jesus created / made or begotten? Being the Son of God, is He co-equal and co-eternal with Father God, or less and lower in status than He? Is the Father the One and only True God, or is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit the One true God? True God of True God, One Being, Three Persons, a tri-unity called Trinity? Jesus said, Who do you say that I am? (Matthew 16:15).         Constantine demanded once the Nicea Council meeting was underway that the 300 bishops make a decision by majority vote defining who Jesus Christ is. Constantine commanded them to create a creed doctrine that all of Christianity would follow and obey, a doctrine that would be called the Nicene Creed, upheld by the Church and enforced by the Emperor. The bishops voted to make the full deity of Christ the accepted position for the church. The Council of Nicea voted to make the Trinity the official doctrine of the church. However, the Council of Nicea did not invent these doctrines. Rather, it only recognized what the Bible taught, and systematized the doctrines.         The New Testament taught that Jesus the Messiah should be worshipped and trusted, which was/is to say He is co-equally God and man. The New Testament forbids the worship of angels (Colossians 2.18; Revelation 22.8,9) but commands worship of Jesus. Apostle Paul says about Jesus that in Him the fullness of Deity dwells bodily (Colossians 2.9; cf. 1.19). Paul declares Jesus as Lord and the One to whom a person must pray for salvation just as one calls on Jehovah, Yahweh (Joel 2.32; Romans 10.9-13). Jesus is God overall (Romans 9.5). Our God and Savior (Titus 2.13). Faith in Jesus Deity is basic to Pauls testimony and theology.         Apostle Johns Gospel declares Jesus being the Divine eternal Logos, agent of creation and source of life and light (John 1. 1-5, 9). That Jesus is "the Way, the Truth, and the Life" (John 14.6), an advocate with heavenly Father (1 John 2.1-2), that He is sovereign (Revelation 1.5), the Rider on a white horse (Revelation 19.11-16), and the totality of the Son of God from the beginning to the end (Revelation 22.13). The author of Hebrews reveals the full deity of Jesus thru His perfection as the most high priest, Melchizedek (Hebrews 1; Hebrews 7:1-3), and the full humanity (Hebrews chapter 2). The Divine-human Savior is the Christian's object of faith, hope, and love.         The Council of Nicea did not invent the doctrine of the deity of Christ. Rather, the Council of Nicea affirmed the Apostles' teaching of who Christ is as the One true God in Deity and Trinity with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

The idea was to consolidate church belief into one coherent orthodoxy (up until this point it wasn't even universally accepted that Jesus was the son of God).  Some important strides were made that bound Christianity together, thought wise. But it also established the idea that there was a clear line between what good, true Christians believed and what they didn't. Over the years Councils would meet again and choose the proper holy books and orthodoxies and form the Christin dogma we know today.|`|sQEMFUcgaa	This was the group brought together to write the bible.

My sister and mom railroaded the entire session and a couple months later the subject was buried and I went through the worst 7 1/2 years of my life. The next time I just sat everyone down a couple people at a time and told them. I was stronger that time. They couldn't stop me. I was on my own. A few months later when I was ready I started to transition.    I really suggest finding some other transpeople in your are to connect with and use as a support group. You'll maybe need to borrow some of their strength to get through this. Good luck.

Jess nunca minti mientras que Pinocho lo hizo varias veces para obtener lo que quera y por miedo al castigo del Hada.     Es posible que se haya inspirado en pasajes bblicos para escribir la historia pero no creo que haya sido una comparacin con Jess sino con una persona cualquiera, pecadora, amorosa y finalmente arrepentida y correcta.     Muchas historias infantiles llevan mensajes de ese estilo si el escritor es creyente. Fjate en los cuentos de Narnia, sobre todo el que sali al cine hace poco. El escritor era catlico e imprimi el mensaje bblico en sus historias.     Aslan representa a Jess que se sacrifico por amor a los dems, resucit despus y los acompa?a siempre protegindolos (adems que fue el creador de la tierra de Narnia).

Todos somos llamados a ser santos, es decir, que cuando tu te mueras puedan decir las dems personas que puedes ser santo por tu vida que hayas tenido o por una accin en grado ejemplar antes de morir.  El Papa no nombra a los santos, la santificacin se realiza cuando se demuestren milagros y para ello hay un juicio muy difcil que debe de realizarse y un estudio histrico formal.  El Papa no hace santos a los lugares que va, mas bien va a donde haya que canonizar a un santo, y adems viaja mucho y no hace santos en todos los lugares.  Todo el que va al Cielo, de acuerdo a la ideologa cristiana, es un santo haya sido canonizado o no, es decir que tu puedes tener familiares santos aunque tu o el Papa no lo sepan.  Y por ltimo, sera bueno que todos furamos santos aunque no nos pongan en el santoral.  saludos
298821f9c8682ed8b187614eea7f6289aa	Know  I have neighbors who are Muslim.  They are kind people who are very good neighbors.  I have no reason to believe that all Muslims are terrorists.  I also know that all terrorists are not Muslims  I have had some very interesting conversations with the local Imam and I believe that we learned from one another in them.      I am a fundamentalist Christian.  Some other Christians think that I am just as bad as the most inflammatory Muslim Clerics because I am a fundamentalist believer. To many people a fundamentalist is a wild eyed, saliva spraying, raving lunatic.    You see people often will not take time to learn about something before opening their mouth and making a fool of them self.  It might be a Jihadist operation but the Jihadists are followers of Islam and for that reason it becomes, to the Press, an Islamic operation.  Just why I don't know maybe it is because they can't spell or pronounce Jihadist.  It could also be because they just plain don't care that they are slandering good peace loving Muslims and causing divisive feelings among Americans.|`|818e64536ceb1146e4fd46922a40c299aa	I like points..|`|QUwkeeyAaa	The word islm is derived from the Arabic root, sn-lm-mm, and is formed from the verb aslama, which means to accept, surrender, or submit.

QSOjU0BBaa	NO, part of being a true christian is live a peaceful, honorable and honest life, help others and not be a form of dictator!|`|AA10976828	yes,as a christian you should spread the gospel to the best of your ability and talents. for example some people are musicly gifted and can use this media,some people are great talkers and when given the opportunity can show others the gospel others can show the gospel by their lives,in how they act etc. the gospel can be rejected by people we are not to force it on anyone but by and large spreading the gospel in whatever area you can is part of being christian. god bless.|`|Z5TuccoIaa	Mar 16:15  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.   16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned|`|25ff3871078732b22945836ac848d623aa	it's an essential part|`|075ec03d92a566d2e72d6060c0eddc80aa	Jesus said right before he ascended to go into all the world make disciples, etc., so yea, but not everyone has to be a "missionary" on foreign soil...ur mission field might be the person next to you at work, or school or ur neighbor|`|057ef5b82bd3cc9ecd0d230d48dde4b0aa	Yes and no, I share how God and spirituality are working in me.  I think a lot of people get intimidated and defensive with bible thumpers.|`|af8c31673b27aed06fb07d7641b9b88eaa	Of course it is.  It's part of the Great Commission that Jesus gave us before He assended into Heaven.  Sharing the gospel, however, does not mean to beat people over the head with it, to scare people with the threat of eternal pusnishment (although we can't omit that), or try to force a set of rules and regulations on people.  To share the gospel is to offer others the salvation that God offers to us, to live in His love, mercy and grace.  We are just the messengers, and it is up to the people we offer it to to make their decision.  Too many see Christians not acting in love and judge our Lord by how we act.|`|TtQvaE5Maa	of course. we are to be messengers and witnesses. look at missionaries. they dont go to play euchre. they go to preach the Word to the world|`|AA12153652	Yes. Paul's Gospels, not Jesus.    Jesus founded the Nazarenes.  http://one-faith-of-god.org/new_testamen...    Paul of Tarsus founded christianity to counter the message of Jesus by being a parasite that consumed the gnostic message of Jesus.  See:  http://one-faith-of-god.org/new_testamen...    So being christian is about spreading the word of Paul, worshipping the words of Paul as equal to, in some cases greater than Jesus and above all, worship ignorance- never asking questions and considering all counter arguments as evil.|`|456d0c8786fde9147b8a195cd1dee26daa	Yes,     but its not just by speaking about the gospel its by living the gospel, so people will see and believe.|`|koOVQSpUaa	Definitely. According to the Catholic Catechism,    "848.......  Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men."|`|8c9c7f3d489487ceb31579734c8a5e4eaa	Yes it is the christian duty to spread the gospel. Like Jesus told the disciple in the Bible in Matthew 28:19-20 vs. 19 Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost: vs. 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world A-men. Hope this helps suzie|`|iOS2gVp3aa	yes it is 2 Timothy 4:5, Christ Himself commanded us in Matthew 28:19-20 we should teach all nations.....what HE taught us.|`|hcFgqo99aa	"Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,  teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded YOU.

Rx6NblCRaa	no limits  GE 9:22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness.   GE 19:4-8 A group of sexually depraved men demands that Lot turn over to them his two male visitors. Lot offers his two virgin daughters instead.   GE 19:30-38 Lot's daughters have sexual intercourse with him while he is drunk and both become pregnant by their father.   GE 24:2-9, 47:29 "... put your hand under my thigh, and I will make you swear by the Lord ...." (Note: This means "put your hand under my testicles," which is the manner in which oaths were taken at the time; "testament," "testify," and "testicle" have the same root.)   GE 29:16-30 Jacob marries both Leah and her sister Rachel. He has children by both Leah and Rachel's maid Bilhah, but Rachel remains barren. Due apparently to Rachel's generosity to her husband, the Lord eventually allows Rachel to conceive.   GE 34:1-2 Shechem defiles Dinah.   GE 34:13-29 Hamor, his son, and the men of their village agree to be circumcised so as to be allowed to marry the daughters of the Israelites. On the third day, "when they were sore," the Israelites kill Hamor, his son, and all the men of the village, and plunder their wealth, taking their wives and children, thus getting revenge for the defiling of Dinah.   GE 35:22 (KJV) "Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his fathers concubine."   GE 38:9 Onan "spills his seed" on the ground rather than fulfill his obligation to his widowed sister-in-law to father a child by her.   GE 38:13-19 Tamar plays the role of a harlot in order to have sexual intercourse with her father-in-law. She conceives and twins are born.   GE 39:7-23 The wife of Joseph's master tries to get Joseph to go to bed with her. He refuses, and flees leaving his "garment in her hand." She claims that Joseph tried to rape her, and Joseph ends up imprisoned.   EX 20:26 "Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."   LE 15:16-19 (KJV) "And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean ...."   LE 21:20, 22:24 (References to testicles, or "stones" in the KJV.)   NU 31:17-18 "... all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." (Note: How did they determine which girls were virgins, and what did they do with them after they kept them alive for themselves? This is not a pretty picture.)   NU 31:31-40 32,000 virgins are taken by the Israelites as booty of which thirty-two are set aside as a tribute for the Lord.   DT 21:10-14 With the Lord's approval, the Israelites are allowed to kidnap "beautiful women" from the enemy camp to be their trial wives. If, after having sexual relations, a man has "no delight" in his wife, he can simply let her go.   DT 23:1 (KJV) "He that is wounded in the stones [testicles], or hath his privy member [penis] cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord."   DT 28:15, 30 If you do not obey the voice of the Lord, the Lord will cause another man to "lie with" your wife-to-be.   JS 5:3 "... the Hill of Foreskins."   JG 8:30-31 Gideon had many wives as well as a concubine.   JG 19:22-29 A group of sexual depraved men beat on the door of an old man's house demanding that he turn over to them a male house guest. Instead, the old man offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine (or wife): "Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what seems good to you; but against this man do not do so vile a thing." The man's concubine is ravished and dies. The man then cuts her body into twelve pieces and sends one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.   JG 21:11-12 "This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with man you shall utterly destroy. And they found ... four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp ...." (Again, how did they determine which girls were virgins? This is not a pretty picture.)   JG 21:14-23 The 400 virgins captured above prove to be insufficient, so the Benjaminites hide in the vineyards and kidnap "the daughters of Shiloh" as they come out to dance and celebrate.   SA 5:6-9 The Lord afflicts Philistines with tumors in their "secret parts."   SA 18:27 So that David might be allowed to marry the king's daughter, the king asks David to bring him 100 Philistine foreskins. David does the job right and brings the king not 100, but 200, foreskins of murdered Philistines.   SA 25:22, 25:34, 1KI 14:10, 16:10-11, 21:21, 2KI 9:8 (KJV) "... him that pisseth ...."   SA 19:24 "And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night."   SA 3:7 (KJV) "Wherefore hast thou gone in unto [a euphemism for sexual intercourse] my fathers concubine?"   SA 5:13, 20:3 David had many concubines.   SA 6:14, 16, 20-23 David dances and exposes himself to his maids. (His wife, Michal rebukes him for having done so, and as a consequence she is made barren.)   SA 12:11-12 The Lord is going to punish David for his sin by taking his wives and causing his neighbor to have sexual relations with them in public.   SA 13:1-14 King David's son, Amnon, rapes his half-sister, Tamar.   SA 16:22 Absalom "went into his father's concubines" in the sight of all Israel.   KI 1:1-4 David was old, and although cov|`|43f7de5bfb8024d1b1a1e14bafcba3afaa	No.  There is no limit to absurdity.  It should be embraced by all.

BUT MAN, times have changed, homosexuality is so much more acceptable even then it was 20+ years ago, marijuana has a possibility of being legalised, PREMARITAL SEX IS ALMOST A GIMME, the absurdity comes from the fact that this world is changing, with the prices of gas, taxes, taking care of your family, I couldn't imagine giving 10% of my paycheck to the church, I barely survive off what I get, and I don't waste very much money!

39f01dbc71bf6980e6a93946cb4ee907aa	Tertullian, the inventor of the concept of "the Trinity," was also an ascetic heretic, in the same manner as Luther and Wesley. Christianity is not only a religion of the heart, but also of the intellect; for "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us," in the Person of Jesus. This was codified at the Council of Chalcedon, in 451 AD, which formulated a Definition (based on Pope Leo's suggestion of "two natures," both divine and human, "which exist without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"), which was eventually accepted by all the mainstream Christian churches. Protestantism was not a new religion, but it took certain things from the Catholic Church that are fundamental to Christianity. Take away the Trinity and you either get a form of gnosticism (positive, pure immanence), such as is found in the crackpot "Christian" cults; or you get a form of neologistic mysticism (negative, pure transcendence), such as is found in the most successful heresy, Islam. Christianity as a coherent religion cannot exist without the Trinity; it's not Catholic dogma, but a necessary part of accepting the dual nature of Jesus Christ.|`|AA12275506	When the Protestants split with the Church, they took that belief with them along with the hellfire doctrine and infant baptisms. But none of those doctrine can be supported by Scripture.|`|AA10976828	not every protestant denomination agrees with the trinity but you are right. protestants owe more to the catholic church than what they think, without catholicism they have no roots.|`|051eabad1c6d3e376a8ca366c08f0c60aa	The catholic church may have put a name on it but I think it's clearly shown in bible without the name|`|AA10375065	Why don't Catholics and Protestants look into the Holy Bible to find "Trinity" therein - and then decide - Yes / No !    Trinity is found no where in the bible! but it is found in the last and final word of God - The Quran!  Why don't you trust your God in the Holy matter of "Word of God"???  Read Quran and learn the facts.    Why you twist & turn in Divine matters! and rely on power hungry religious leaders appointed by Roman Emporers and Kings like Contantine and Henry VII.    These religious leaders will never solve problems because they live like Kings - having no problem in their status - They don't mind whether you go to paradise or hellfire.    Now you don't live in the Darkages. See arround you and find the Truth!Think about your own salvation!
8uClq8nlaa	Its fallible|`|AA10976828	the religious truths such as those of the truth of god etc are infallible. god gave the fallible authors the ability to provide infallible truth.|`|bdfa59d7b07a9f8d87b377a23b2a1873aa	The "Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation" (Vat. 11, Ch. 3.11) of the Catholic Church says that "all that the inspired, or sacred writers, affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, and without error, teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to be confided to the sacred Scriptures." This is the Church's teaching on the matter after twenty centuries of Christian discernment.    Biblical inerrancy, then, is the Bible's privilege of never teaching error. Does this mean that every statement in the Bible is divine teaching? Of course not. The Bible does not always teach. There are many statements in its various books that are there for historical, geographical, poetic or other reasons. However, whenever a biblical author intends to teach us something, then the Holy Spirit intends that too. Everything that the Bible teaches is without error, but everything in the Bible is not meant as teaching. Each author was left free by the Lord to express himself according to the ideas of his own day. It is the revelation contained in the Scriptures that is important.      There are also many accounts in the Bible, which employ a literary device used by Jewish Old and New Testament writers called Midrash. Midrash is the substantive of the Hebrew word darash which means to search, to investigate, to study and, also, to expound on the fruits of the research. The aim of Midrash is to draw from Scripture a lesson for the present.     Midrash could also be defined as a "reflection on Scripture in the light of the actual situation of God's people and of the developments of God's action on its history. It proposes to explain the meaning of Scripture in the light of the later historical experience of God's people. This kind of interpretation often opened the door to embellishments of the sacred accounts, anachronisms, and a freedom in handling and maneuvering the data of tradition that were at times a little too candid and certainly very imaginative."    A good example is the Midrashic story of Noah and the flood. It is the divine message, which is important, (God saves his children from evil) not the literal account of the story.    Peace and every blessing!|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	The Bible is God's written Word to us.  It was written by human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit.    Above all you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. 2 Peter 1:20-21. (New International Version)    Breakdown of the Bible  36 human authors inspired entirely by God over 1600 years.  66 separate books    39 Old Testament  Genesis- The creation of the world, sin, flood and birth of Israel  Exodus to Esther- History of the nation of Israel  Job to Proverbs- the books of poetry and wisdom  Isaiah to Malachi- Prophecy or foretelling of the future events to come.    27 New Testament  Matthew to John - Four Gospels representing the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ now with all authority in Heaven and earth.  Acts- Birth of the Church (The Bride of Christ)   Romans to Jude - Letters to the Churches  Revelations - The ultimate future plans for: The Church, Heaven, Hell, a New Heaven and a New Earth.

What is placed before us in written form can only be analyzed  through "Wisdom".

Seek and acquire "Wisdom" and all the questions of life will be placed at mans feet...............|`|2470e11cdccd6582bd1f23939373e5caaa	It helps to understand what Christians mean by the Word of God. The Word contains the words of saints and sinners, of men and devils. Although it quotes sinners and devils, it is the Word of God simply because God wanted those words preserved for us to read.    The words in the Bible are words God had men read. He chose the words, but let the writers' personalities show through. Here is one way to see God's hand in the Bible. Imagine giving a quiz to forty students in one university class. Have them write down what they think about the meaning of life, about death and the afterlife, heaven and hell, punishment, spirituality, God, and love. You would get a wide range of opinions, just like you do on this board.     But the Bible is consistent in its view of these very contentious subjects. It was written by about forty men over a period of over a thousand years, in several languages and countries and cultures. Yet they are united in their views of God, life and death, heaven and hell, and other biblical doctrines. This is one of the most important aspects that point to the Bible's authorship of God.|`|o1mXNNStaa	Its not infallible,  have you seen the discrepancy's??|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	Tom Browning among others, threw a "perfect" game in baseball, but was a "fallible human".  I agree that even those who wrote what we know as the Bible were fallible, that is why God inspired them with His words and not their words.|`|SOULvta1aa	It could be, if the evidence showed it to be infallible - but it doesn't. Or it could be, if one accepted the idea of the papacy - that some people when speaking or writing on behalf of the church can make infallible pronouncements - but most proponents of Biblical infallibility are Protestants who find such an idea ridiculous. And presumably if it is infallible then the manuscripts will have been preserved infallibly, since what is the point of inspiring an infallible Bible and then having it copied by errant humans. But there are copying errors...    I think your question implies its own answer, doesn't it? :-)|`|AA11805224	Because it was written under the unction of the Holy Spirit.|`|Buoj4gU6aa	the bible is the inspired word of God, although it was literally written by men, the words and thoughts were inspired to them by God's active force, or holy spirit.    (2 Timothy 3:16-17) .?.?.All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, 17?that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.      p.s. that ? you asked the other day about religions being done away with. The book of Revelation discusses that and discusses how Babylon the Great (the world empire of false religion) will be destoryed.  At some point in the future, and prob not too far off, God will put it into the hearts of the governments on earth to put an end to (destroy) all religion.  I didnt see that answer anywhere in the comments for that one but wanted to comment on what I've learned from my Bible Studies.

However, it seems to be a play on a scene from John 21 in which Jesus, Peter and John were conversing. Peter asked what would happen to John in death, since Christ signified how Peter should die. Christ said, basically, if he lives forever, what is that to thee? The Bible in the next verse explains that some people took this the wrong way and thought that John would live forever. But of course, this is wrong|`|AA12218914	what gospel of Thomas?  the gospels are matthew mark luke and john|`|AA11382995	First of all, The life of Jesus is in Genesis. Second, he said "I am the Alpha and the Omega." Third, when you know Jesus you will know G-- for if we walk the path that Jesus walked, we will find G--. Fourth, the commandments of Jesus uphold the commandments of Moses. Last, Revelations is also in Genesis. Interpret as you will. I have willed.    By the way, he is not G-- but the Son of G--    Sharing is Caring...Jesus is Alive!?  I would like to share my story with any Christian or non-Christian who is still struggling and faith is not all together there.     I hold G-- to the highest, and to lie would be not only against what I believe, but against G--'s laws. Nothing here is a lie, although it might seem like it. This is the reason I type this. G-- bless you all.    I am 30 years old. I am a mathematics teacher. Since the day I was born I was Catholic. I never practiced it, and Catholic was simply a family label. I considered myself Atheist for 30 years until that day in March, I believe. I was painting my Mom's house. The face of Jesus appeared before my Mom and I. She asked me, "what does this look like to you?" But, before she finished the question I KNEW IT WAS HIM. The long hair, the beard, mustash, garments. Similar to the "Jesus" from "passion of the christ," except the eyes. Those eyes cannot be described. They translated into love, love, and love. If I had to describe them, I would say that the closest to that has been Mother Teresa's eyes. Not to take anything from her, but still, only close.  I thought that had changed me, but it didn't. It did start me off though. But, now as I researched and spent countless hours learning more about him, I started hating Jews and easily angered at anyone who spoke against Jesus. It had actually made me a worse person.  As I stuggled one morning with Currency Trading, he appeared again on the cabinet drawers of my room. He faded and came back over and over until He appeared very clear and said to me: WHY DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THINGS FROM THIS WORLD?" I think he said it two or three times. I started crying, as am right now. This was the first time that Faith came into my heart.   My life started changing, slowly. Same struggles, but different attitude and determination. I prayed day and night and went to Church. But, the real test, is the acts. "YOU WILL BE JUDGED ACCORDING TO YOUR WORKS" is one of my favorites.   In one of the Churches he said to me: "YOU ARE MARKED WITH MY BLOOD." I told my Mom and tried to make sense of it.   The last thing that he told me was: "I AM NOT YOUR FATHER. I AM YOUR BROTHER. THE SON DOES NOT EXIST WITHOUT THE FATHER, BUT WITHOUT THE SON THE FATHER IS ALWAYS."  At moments I wonder if it was all just in my imagination. This is the mistake that I keep making for this is where my Faith is tested.   No matter what, I am a better person for it. I love G-- with all my heart now, and I could never go back. Nothing in this world could ever shake or disturb my Faith. Finding G-- will always be a win-win situation. Now, I live everyday to make G-- proud of me and in the process I fulfill my obligations as human and husband.  I know that I should be doing more for G--'s glory. I am shy, but will soon find the strength and power to glorify him more and more. I am still in my learning stages, but live everyday to follow Jesus Christ's footsteps.  "pourdawg" could not be altogether wrong. But, what I know for certain is that if we are all lost souls, then we need to find G-- so that we can find ourselves in H--  "marty" tells you not to rely on feelings for that is wrong. I say to you, the problem I always made was that I thought too much and searched for contradictions here and there so that I could justify myself. But, if you think with your heart the truth will always ccome to you.     ~ADIOS~     I am not here to tell you to quit your religion for they all share the great love that Jesus proclaimed. Be just, compassionate, humble and love G-- with all your heart. Share his glory by doing and not saying. ~ADIOS~    My goal now is simply to share this over and over again. I know G-- will guide me to my next step. I will keep anyone who want posted. I feel so Alive!!! Yes, even in the worst of times.     "The LORD said onto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foootstool."  If David called him Lord, how is he his son?|`|AA11365342	Sorry, my memory failed me on my previous answer, and I have edited it accordingly.  I thought your quote was from another work that purported to be from the hand of Thomas.  The current copy of the "Gospel of Thomas" dates to around 200 AD.  Although it was known to the early church Fathers, it was never considered as a canonical work (worthy of inclusion into the Bible).  The authorship was uncertain (most all deemed it inauthentic), and the content was inconsistent with the accepted Gospel message.|`|AA12326124	A very brief explanation: The Father is the Beginning and the End. When we're fully detached from the human ego system and have our hearts and minds set on Christ, we become ONE with the Father in every level of our being. Our mind thinks His thoughts; our heart feels His Love; our soul becomes conscious in us...as the Bride of Christ; and even our body's every cell is glorified and One with Him. By being One with the Father who is Alpha and Omega, we see through His 'eyes' and understand Creation past, present and future. He holds nothing back from those who are Enlightened with Him on all levels. So not only do we KNOW the Beginning, we also KNOW the end of the Divine Play.....and being embodied with HIM we become directors (His Sons) who bring the Divine Play to righteous End (144,000 saints), so that every human being on the planet can see His Glory and know His Truth. This is human evolution -- the kosmic leap of humanity into full conscious Oneness with the Father, Who is the Kosmic Pattern of Creation. A 'Christened' Humanity, One with the Alpha and the Omega....where all darkness and evil are thrown into the bottomless pit and Peace prevails forever and ever.     This has begun in our generation. The Divine Play is at its End!    Glory be to the Father!! Amen :-)
f864ce3b01c34b0de619a6b6a4d013e5aa	In 10 years the markets will likely start to crash.  No kidding.   This is due to the 1974 ERISA act which transferred the onus of retirement from companies through defined benefit programs such as pensions to defined contribution programs such as 401(k).   The issue though is that while distributions can be taken from a 401(k) at age 59.5, distributions are REQUIRED to be taken from age 70.5.   The first of the baby boomer generation will be turning 70.5 around 2016 meaning they will be required to start selling holdings in their 401(k) plans to meet this requirement.   As more baby boomers hit that age, more will have to sell.  All of this selling without buying stepping in will cause the market to flop.    But wait...it gets worse.    Most baby boomers are not properly prepared for retirement anyway.   Some think they will be because of the money they have in their 401(k) plan except as the stock market drops, the value of their holdings in the plan drops and may no longer be enough to sustain them in retirement.   As a result, they will find they have to cut back on many of the things they were used to for their lives like new cars, dining out, vacations and designer clothes.   Cutting back on all these things will cut into all of those businesses resulting in slowing sales and profit growth causing their stocks to go down even more.       Now if all of that sounds fun (and unfortunately very likely), then lets factor in what happens when the US government runs up the deficit to try and maintain entitlement spending programs like Medicare and Social Security which are trillion dollar liabilities.   Medicare makes Social Security look like a small problem.   The point is that nearly all of the tax collected by the IRS goes to pay the debt on the deficit, that's just sad.   So as our debt runs up, interest rates have to rise in order to continue to attract foreign capital to our debt to finance our spending.   Rising interest rates again will slow the economy making it harder for business to expand and borrow for capital spending and as such again the stock markets will plumet.    Still having fun?  How about this...    Paper money used to be certificates that represented the equivalent value of gold.   This was called the gold standard.  Basically it meant that paper money had value, the value of gold that backed it up.   Under Nixon the US went off the gold standard and paper money became basically worthless.  Now it doesn't represent anything.   Inflation eats away at a dollar to the extent that between that and taxes, people who put their money in the bank and save are actually losing money.  Don't believe me?  Check this out.   If you're getting 4.5% in your savings account and inflation is currently coming in at about 4.0% for 2006.   So you're making .5% right?  Wrong.  Don't forget that you have to pay taxes on interest income of the 4.5% which will amount to roughly 1.5% (about 30% tax rate).   So between inflation and taxes, you're actually losing 1% per year.   Of course this goes on assumptions of inflation rate (which could go higher or a little lower) and savings rate (which current is running around 4.5%) but the point is that all the people saving will in the next 10-15 years find that their money is worth a lot less than when they put it in the bank.   This again will cause hardship for people.    I hate to have the bad attitude here, I hope this stuff doesn't come to pass but we're on the train and this is where the track is headed.   Hopefully we'll have the sense to stop the train before we get to that point, but its unlikely.|`|AA11462986	More technology for sure. People will be dependant on...technology! People will become less into nature and such and more into the digital world.   There will be a greater diversity in music and arts alhough there will be less painters that have a natural born talent for arts & stuff and more people who take lessons.   Nuclear wars & just wars galore. Kids will learn things younger and younger....they will probably be more in-tune with TV, but maybe not in the best way.  Perhaps another version of music for a new age of rebellious teens? ;) Money will make the world go 'round more so than love (as if it doesn't already).   Kids will get smarter younger. Reality TV shows will get less and less reality based to entertain people.   Ozone layer will die.....eventually. Then someday we'll live on some other planet that's doomed to be swalled and/or destroyed by something else.  And of course crime will grow or lessen, depending on what is going on in the world with money for certain countries.   But don't trust me (completely), the world wil go insane with or without reminders of the impending doom -- I mean future. (I think I just gave a description on how the world will end, not considering Revelations)    Boy, that was depressing.|`|AA12372328	there will probably be nuclear weapons destroying lots of people   :(
AA10874134	Hmmmm, atheism...    Any one can 'say' I do not believe in a certain God, but it is impossible that anyone can 'believe' in no God. What one esteems the highest value at any given time is their God at that time. To say that one believes in no God is saying that everything including themselves is equal to 0 or nothing. If they are nothing then they could not say there is nothing since they don't exist. So, maybe the question is not if one believes in a God, but which God is their God - what does one esteem as the highest value? That is their God. This goes for all people religious or not. One might go to a church that teaches belief in a certain God or value but personally they believe or value something is higher than the God that church teaches to believe in.    It may be that one esteems themselves to be the highest value and thus making themselves their God.     And if ones absolute highest belief or value is in disorganization then that belief is in the god of disorganization or anti-progression.    Very good observation on the non-believers / believers comparison!|`|AA10807212	Welcome!   Sounds like you're a Humanist. We define ourselves outside of religion.    Humanism is optimistic regarding human nature and confident in human reason and science as the best means of reaching the goal of human fulfillment in this world. Humanists affirm that humans are a product of the same evolutionary process that produced all other living organisms and that all ideas, knowledge, values, and social systems are based upon human experience. Humanists conclude that creative ability and personal responsibility are strongest when the mind is free from supernatural belief and operates in an atmosphere of freedom and democracy. - published in Free Mind, American Humanist Association.|`|AA12132197	I am sorry but you are an athiest, because you are what athiests are.|`|AA11776112	Do you not think that just because you don't like to call yourself a certain name, that it's any less valid as a description of you?  If I don't want to call my dog a dog, that doesn't mean he isn't one, whatsoever I might say.  Words mean certain things, and if that word applies to you, then you're going to get slapped with it whether you like it or agree with it or not.  Whether or not you choose to associate yourself with others within the same group is another matter, but you can't avoid the label.

If you think about it, it's the Arabs who developed modern medicine and advanced mathematics--and they did all of this when Europe was in the Dark Ages...and it's helpful to remember that much of the reason that Europe WAS in the Dark Ages back then was because of a mis-interpretation of Christian scripture by the people who were in charge back then.    My point is that ANY religion can be cynically and deliberately mis-interpreted by those in power in order to dupe people and keep them down.  Religion is a powerful political weapon.    I feel very sorry for today's' Muslims, actually, because if they don't watch out, then history is doomed to repeat itself:  The Hundred Years' War in Europe was all about sectarian violence (between Catholics and Protestants).  I've noticed that some fundamentalist Protestants, even nowadays, will refer to themselves as "Christians," and they don't think of Catholics as even BEING Christians.  If the Sunnis and the Shiites don't watch out, they'll find themselves embroiled in this same sort of stupidity.  Both Christianity and Islam claim to be religions of peace...and they CAN be.  It's all in how the religions are interpreted and applied.  People really need to THINK FOR THEMSELVES, instead of listening to politico-religioninsts, such as some of those wacky televangelists and radicalized imams.|`|AA11670365	Stupid is as stupid does.|`|d435c95735ddd17a647856b5c469e1cdaa	your the stupid one.

8b12ce760de5b67898f8a4ec98876de5aa	Well first of all, make sure that you get the best tripe you can  find.  A local market got me some tripe from Harris Ranch,  it was the best honeycomb I have ever seen.  It came frozen  in a  square block and the meat dept. ran it thru the slices so  I got 1" think pieces,  made preparing the tripe a lot easier.      Get a pig foot or 2 to throw in for flavor, then boil the tripe  till its done.        The way my Dad made it, for about 5 lbs tripe, add 3 or 4 28oz.cans of Las Palmas red chili sauce (medium)  and 3  cans (again, (28 oz.)  of hominy.  Let simmer for a while so the  flavors meld.         If you really have to, you can make your own red chili sauce,  it takes a lot longer.  You need to find dried New Mexico red chili,  clean out the seeds and  simmer in water till they soften, then   run thru a blender, add equal amounts of tomato sauce, salt  and garlic to taste.    But the canned stuff saves a lot of time.       While the menudo is simmering, chop a yellow onion,  slice some lemons,   chop some cilantro  and find the oregano   Put all these in separate bowls so each person can dose their  soup to their liking.             Menudo is definitely an aquired taste   but  nothing beats it  on a cold day, or as my grandfather used to say, the best thing  the morning after a night of partying.|`|AA11405368	http://recipesource.com/cgi-bin/search.c...    i don't which one it is but there's a whole bunch on there

30b45758f582da911f9c1dc237cf2c69aa	While abortion and a forced miscarriage aren't precisely the same thing, the verse clearly shows how ancient Jews viewed the value of the baby vs. the value of the mother. Both were property of the male. Clearly the life of an unborn child was less valued than a prized wife. So, yes, this is directly telling on the issue of abortion. Most Christians either don't know of the verse or choose to ignore it.|`|AA10706544	It is murder.|`|AA11333633	I still can't figure out why some people think this verse has to do with abortion.|`|AA11570293	Where do you get from this that it is a misdemeanor to have an abortion?  It is murder plain and simple.  You can hurt a child in the womb and not kill it and it does not say that the husband here cannot call for death of the individual that hurt the baby and caused the abortion.  In fact, if you read other parts of the bible you will find that death was the normal result of harming an unborn child.  So abortion a misdemeanor?  Not in my bible it isn't. It is out and out murder.|`|682d46575134d0b618bc8362f162e910aa	Because they don't think it's that big a deal, like most rational people.

As you should know a miscarriage is not an abortion.|`|AA10442850	It doesn't, it's saying if a pregnant woman gets hurt "so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow" meaning if she gives birth to her child and the baby is with out harm then the man who struck her would have fines layed upon him by the husband. But if "any harm follows" if the baby dies or has any infirmities then "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth". Hope that was helpful.|`|ea320b1133e5cae39613585f075913feaa	It is all interpretation. The first time I read that verse I didn't think it had anything to do with abortion. Now, I see your point.    You need to keep in mind that there are many different translations of the Bible. The Greek-to-English translation alone lost a lot of ideas and words that were in the original text. So many things in Greek are more complex than the English language. Thus, the Bible was "simplified" as it was written into English.|`|AA12086869	That verse writes life for life.  That isn't a misdemeanor.  That is found to be murder.  Miscarriage actually means a premature birth according to my translation.  Premature birth when baby dies is harm.  Premature birth when baby survives is no harm.      King James  writes:  If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life...    I believe the man hit the woman in the belly to hurt the other guys wife & child.  Also, the verse writes woman with child meaning that it is a child in her.|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	My bible states that if her fruit depart from her, yet no mischief (death of the fruit) follow.  However, if mischief follow (death of the fruit), life for life.    So , if a woman is attacked and her child is born early as a result, it it dies, the attackers must die. If the child lives, they pay a monetary price to the husband.    If the woman dies, they pay life for life, lives, a monetary punishment paid to the husband.    Fruit depart from her is simply premature labor and birth.  The punishments are meted out as to if the mother and child live or die.|`|86f01b7199a751642da50fd260cdd3ceaa	There is no passage in the Bible that definitively comments on "abortion".  The passage you have quoted is discussing miscarriage due to physical harm and not to a woman's right to choose.  Because of the ambiguity of this verse, it is often cited by both pro-life and pro-choice advocats.  Jeremiah 1:5 and Psalm 139:13-16 both refer to the planning of a life before it is in the womb which creates the belief that life begins at conception.  Therefore, the sixth commandment comes into play.|`|a6ce596155aa57dea3dda35221bc57c3aa	It's interpretation.|`|AA12328811	Could it be that the baby survives?

AA10764194	None, but shows Jesus deity,    It is no secrect that the Holy Bible states that the Lord Jesus created the cosmos and was called upon in worship by the first Christians:    "Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made... He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him." John 1:3, 10    "In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, 'Ananias!' 'Yes, Lord,' he answered. The Lord told him, 'Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.' 'Lord,' Ananias answered, 'I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem. And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.' But the Lord said to Ananias, 'Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel. I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.' Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, 'Brother Saul, the Lord-Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit'... All those who heard him were astonished and asked, 'Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?'" Acts 9:10-17, 21    "To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ-their Lord and ours:" 1 Corinthians 1:2    "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For BY HIM all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created BY HIM and FOR HIM. He is before all things, and IN HIM all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy." Colossians 1:15-18    "but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven... And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, 'Let all God's angels worship him'... But about the Son he says... 'In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end.'" Hebrews 1:2-3, 6, 8a, 10-12    According to the same Holy Bible, the Lord Jesus is alive forever and ever, having conquered death and ushering in glorious immortality:    "So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God, who has saved us and called us to a holy life-not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel." 2 Timothy 1:8-10    "When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: 'Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.'" Revelation 1:17-18    "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again." Revelation 2:8    By conquering death, Christ demonstrated that he is truly the source of life for all:    "In him was life, and that life was the light of men." John 1:4    "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it... I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear THE VOICE OF THE SON OF GOD and those who hear will live... Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear HIS VOICE and come out-those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned." John 5:21, 25, 28-29    "Jesus said to her, 'I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?' 'Yes, Lord,' she told him, 'I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.'" John 11:25-27    "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and THE LIFE. No one comes to the Father except through me.'" John 14:6    "But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body." Philippians 3:20-21    "For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."

Jesus laughed with joy:  Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all. Those, then, who know these things have been freed from the principalities who formed the world; so that it is not incumbent on us to confess him who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was thought to be crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the Father.     (The Church Father Iranaeus, Against Heresies, Chapter XXIV.-Doctrines of Saturninus and Basilides)     Notice how Iranaeus says through ignorance and error the Jews misapprehended, and crucified the wrong person. Amazingly, the Holy Quran harmonizes this account, stating that they follow error, conjecture, and ignorance:  That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not: (Al-Quran 4:157)    The 1945 discovery of Gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi, Egypt unearthed a book called The Second Treatise of the Great Seth, where Jesus states:  I did not succumb to them as they had planned. But I was not afflicted at all. Those who were there punished me. And I did not die in reality but in appearance, lest I be put to shame by them because these are my kinsfolk. I removed the shame from me and I did not become fainthearted in the face of what happened to me at their hands. I was about to succumb to fear, and I suffered according to their sight and thought, in order that they may never find any word to speak about them. For my death, which they think happened, (happened) to them in their error and blindness, since they nailed their man unto their death. For their Ennoias did not see me, for they were deaf and blind. But in doing these things, they condemn themselves. Yes, they saw me; they punished me. It was another, their father, who drank the gall and the vinegar; it was not I. They struck me with the reed; it was another, Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon Whom they placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height over all the wealth of the archons and the offspring of their error, of their empty glory. And I was laughing at their ignorance. (The Treatise of the Great Seth)     There are also several historical sources other than the Bible and the Qur'an which confirm that many of the early Christians did not believe that Jesus died on the cross...The Cerinthians and later the Basilidians, for example, who were among the first of the early Christian communities, denied that Jesus was crucified...The Carpocratians, another early Christian sect, believed that it was not Jesus who was crucified, but another in his place.   (Jesus Prophet of Islam, Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Ahmed Thompson, 1996 (revised edition. p47)   Plotinus, who lived in the fourth century, tells us that he had read a book called The Journies of the Apostles which related the acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas and Paul. Among other things, it stated that Jesus was not crucified, but another in his place, and therefore, he laughed at those who believed that they had crucified him.     (ibid, Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1991 edition. P. 37)|`|d33c1adb39ee8f8691c22f993863e7e0aa	It depends on who is interpreting the Quran.

VUK77SrXaa	Altering and/or terminating gay fetus' is EUGENICS. This is what Hitler did in Germany (they sterilized anyone who had any perceived defect of mind and/or body... sometimes, they just slaughtered the person). The people who did this in Germany before and during World War II, were declared war criminals, and the people who were caught were sentenced to death or long prison terms.  I wonder how the religious fanatics would react, as they are against abortion and are also against Homosexuality...??  My personal answer: I would never change/abort ANY fetus.  BTW, the most current science seems to indicate being gay has a complex genetic component (more than one gene) and intrauterine hormonal component... so determining who will be gay might be close to impossible.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Strictly speaking it is likely not a single gene but an interaction of several, but, leaving that aside, people who put religion over science would either continue to ignore the evidence-don't forget that the Flat Earth Society is still going strong-or else decide it's a test for people to overcome, as many already claim.  Either way it wouldn't make much of a difference among people living today, although the next generation would probably be more tolerant, just as the current one is more so than the last.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	If they found the gay gene I would blow up their research facilities. LOL|`|sgRJRuvgaa	I think it would make the world a lot more accepting and who knows there may be a new scholership for people with the gay gene|`|4Te5gVvDaa	It would backfire.

The gas thing here is that despite what has been discovered about genetic engineering, despite what has been discovered, there is in every scientist a 'reason' and an 'ethic'. Beyond that yes genetic engineering has already been tried.....but who really knows what or who they want their children to look like or be like? Look at the Christians, who would have all people like them for the most part....you cannot MAKE your child believe in God. The can engineer to their hearts content but if a generation is appx 30 years I have to say here that there is NO way this is going to happen to the fullest degree. Your points are really good in that the people finally accepting that we are all made by God....if there is a God. You are brave, intelligent and courage's to even implement this question in a public format for braving the waters of peoples' questions that have always been. Now.....is there a God? Kudos!

Why can't they leave gays alone and stop trying to "fix" them. I am opposed to the Christian faith and whoever is an obsesser of God.|`|AA11589320	Altering babies.   I suspect some would, exactly the same as some would turn their child blond, etc if they could.        I love the Christian question. It gets them both ways.      On one hand they say altering people is playing God, that is evil as it is against God will.      Yet they also say Gay is against Gods will.      So which would they follow?  Very interesting question..  Maybe post it in the religion section and see how they bite.|`|0JmTIcy0aa	What is there to fix?  What would you do if they found the "liking hamburger gene"?|`|hy3q2iWaaa	Nah, they can't do anything about it. And that's a fact.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	Well I am a Christian and I believe God makes gay people gay. I know there are not a lot of us that believe that but then I researched and have come to terms with how the Bible has been mistranslated.       If the majority of the Christian world knows that Babies are born gay and they find a gene, I imagine they would try to tamper with it by getting rid of that gene. What they should do though is to realize that God made them this way and not to tamper with it. Then after understanding that God made them this way, they would have to go back and look at scripture and figure out where the translation glitches happened. (This involves them understanding that human translation is not always the best and that it might not have been perfectly translated from the original manuscripts.- this is a difficult concept for many Christians) It would also force them to look at the context of the references and to what audience they were written. Once they do that, they would realize that a monogamous relationship between two people of the same sex is not shown to be wrong according to the Bible.|`|nQEiNGkeaa	Some research shows that they have found it. About time!    http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/745658...|`|nT0w6VIKaa	The Catholic Church would, with all of the disgust they could muster, finally accept that being gay is 'natural'.  Other churches, I'm sure, would do their best to 'do away with' the gay gene...  But, by the grace of God, there would still be people who 'gladly accept' children au naturel...and gay people would continue to exist...no matter what any church did...|`|80JBvRdFaa	It wouldn't do anything to make the extremists more accepting. They would just blame secular science for lying and trying to subvert society because obviously faith always triumphs over reason in their minds. Even in the face of overwhelming reason.|`|eA8ytUsbaa	i think that if they found a gay gene then definitely some extremely religious people would try to "fix" gays. but then i think that their are other people who would come to except it as something that is natural for some people and not a mutation.|`|EBt6Wbqpaa	i think they'd find it in the man-in-the-moon, who also doesn't exist.

Z4cZJvMSaa	En ao?t dernier, j'ai fait un voyage en Irlande et en Angleterre. Je suis alle avec mon copain, ma mre, mon pre, mon frre, mon ami, son ami, sa mre, et le petit ami de sa mre. J'ai quitt Tampa en ao?t en premier lieu, et a atterri en Irlande en ao?t seconde. Alors que j'tais l, j'ai rencontr les parents de mon copain, a vu des chateaux, et est all  cheval sur la plage. J'ai eu un temps. Aprs avoir pass 7 jours en Irlande du sud, nous avons  Dublin afin que nous puissions obtenir un avion pour Londres. Il y avait des crues clair  Dublin, et nous nous sommes enliss dans le trafic pendant environ 4 heures. Nous sommes finalement arrivs  l'aroport, et nous tions sur le chemin de Londres. Quand nous sommes arrivs  Londres, nous avons vrifi dans un h?tel d'un ami de notre l'est propritaire. Nous avons vu beaucoup de batiments historiques, a visit le muse, et est all au zoo. J'ai roul sur un train pour la premire fois de ma vie. Londres a beaucoup de plaisir, mais j'ai mieux aim l'Irlande.

tI1NHwfBaa	If you don't feel close to God ... guess who moved!    Many Christians spend their lives worried about feelings, and ignoring truth.  I saw a speaker a couple of weeks ago talk about the reality of the Gospel, and he compared it to a time when he went mountain climbing.      As he hung out over a great chasm, he was scared to death.  But the reality is that he was anchored by two ropes, both of which were able to hold several times his weight.      The fact is that he was not in danger, but the feeling he had was that he was in peril.  I think that's a good lesson for us all.    Rely on the reality.  God loves you.  He wants a relationship with you.  Prayer and Bible-reading and fellowship with other Christians are the ways to improve that relationship.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	are you always on your cell phone well get off it i dont like them that much and texting just IM what happened to that       PRAY TO GOD AND YHOU WILL  FEEL MORE CONNECTECD|`|eDqGuGOeaa	aahh. that might be because during new year people usually starts praying asking god to help them out with their goals and all that things... that's why you might be having interference when communicating with him. Try later or during midnight.  You can also consider the possibility of his non-existence. It's free and without compromise.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Make sure that you believe that salvation is only by faith alone in Jesus alone, without adding any of your own works.     If you're trying to work to please God, then that's the problem.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|tManvxfQaa	Sometimes God is silent...and He watches to see if we are going to follow Him no matter what or are we going to fold up when things seem distant ?    I know i been there way to many times...  WE have to walk by Faith and NOt by sight....    WE just have to be fully persuaded that what God said He will also do....    even in these times it seems its never going to happen....take Him at His Word...and keep moving foreward !!|`|2oc6TDiGaa	thats cuz ur religion is crap|`|nGGDddyUaa	i feel the same way so i can't really give any advice :( sorry|`|V0oc22ryaa	Truth is feelings are good but not always trustworthy, we walk by sight not by feelings, just continue to do as you have stated and put your trust in God, "He will not let him down whose heart trust's in Him".|`|IJZZkDUvaa	This is what is known in Theology and Mysticism as a "desert experience" or a "dark night of the soul".    I would recommend reading up on either/both of those experiences and seeing if it speaks to what you are feeling.    As with any relationship, there are ups and downs in personal relationships with God... this is just a temporary phase and can actually be a period of growth for you.    Just trust in yourself and in God, and it will be ok.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	It just happens sometimes. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, or with Him. Try something new! I mean, keep praying, reading, and going to church, but try connecting to Him in a different way. Worship through dance, or painting something, or through spending time in His creation. Try reading something other than the Bible, too - Through Painted Deserts, by Donald Miller, is my current favourite.|`|lzZDTM9saa	try to get closer to him.  pray more, and just talk to him.  a while ago, i barely prayed.  i was a "christian" but i felt empty too.  then i read this article in a christian magazine "brio" about talking to God.  it broke me down to tears cuz i realized that i had been ignoring God.  it basically said that he wants to hear from you and talk to you just like your friends do.  even though he knows everything that's going on in your life, he wants you to specifically tell him about it.  spend your entire day in prayer.  when youre at school, talk to him and tell him how you feel.  never stop talking to him.    also, you should ask your youth pastor to pray for you, or talk about how you feel to him/her.    God bless! i'll be praying for you!  (:|`|bT3mzootaa	Don't let this bring you down sis.Every believer goes through the valley at some point.Try to remember that we don't walk by feelings ,we walk by faith.Im 32 now and I've been serving HIM since I was 18 and I feel like that sometimes, but that's when you dig deep inside and show satan that you are a firm believer and no matter what you will serve THE CHRIST.As soon as he sees that those discouraging spirits cant bring you down they will have to flee.Press on sis, fight the good fight.Walk by faith remember GOD is good...all the time.Put some praise and worship songs on and saturate your mind and soul with the HOLY  SPIRIT.GOD BLESS!!!|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	pray that you will disconnect even ruther.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	God does not share a heart with anyone else. If you developed hate, greed, jealousy or lust or committed a sin or felt proud on the service you are offering, you may have disconnected with God.    Or it may be a periodic gap to enhance your want and devotion to God.    Or if you have not done any of the above, He must be expecting you to develop your faith further. Because you know, Christianity is not the last Word, but Islam is. Quran is a continuation of Bible. Read it to know new facts and progress at the road towards Almighty.    May God bless and help you.                                                     Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|yegDdZfRaa	I'm glad to know I'm not the only one. Are you just reading the Bible? Or are you really thinking about what you're reading?    It sounds like He wants you to follow your heart for the homeless. I feel the same way in many cases about the country...my heart is leading me/tugging at me to get more involved...just don't know how to start.    If I were you I would just jump into what your heart is leading you to do. You might be out some time & money, but what of it when you're investing eternally in the kingdom AND that market's NEVER gonna crash! :) Besides that - you're only helping others, not hurting them so it will never be a waste of your time.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	There are times that we seem like we are in tunnels and it's dark. The only thing I can say based on what you say is that going to church doesn't necessarily connect you to God. It's more personal than that. I think you know that. Keep in touch with Christians like myself on the internet, and start talking about Jesus to Christians you know. Sometimes just the entusiasm for Jesus will get you back on fire. I wish I could find more Christians that were into talking about Jesus instead of small talk.|`|uGtbqLhWaa	I am the same, it just feels bad|`|0wUZbRguaa	That is because you need to be happy.No more long faces.Look inside you and find it,also ask God in your prayers.If not go to these page and read iteslj.org/c/jokes-long.html -|`|VqR8PoCmaa	Honey, it's like that for everyone at some point.     Keep reading His word and seeking after Him. He will not let ya down.|`|aPS4o65Daa	dont try so hard. try helping someone out.|`|kmAMgkiraa	Stop thinking about how you're doing all the church and religous things. Being a Christian is not about the religous things you do or routines you have. It's about a relationship with God. Maybe there are things in your life that are blocking your relationship. I know plenty of people who do the same things you say you do but they go off and drink, party, smoke, do drugs, have sex, hurt others purposely, steal, and swear a ridiculous amount. Are any of those things standing in your way? If you still don't understand ask God himself! In church this Sunday we had a special speaker, and she told us to stop asking everyone around us for answers and go straight to God. Spend more time with him. Worship and lose control. lay down and be still and ask him. He won't leave you or forget you if you ask him to stay. Head up my dear! Watch this video maybe it will help.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyheJ480L...
BQ6WmoHiaa	I would go check it out on Tuesday.  I'd give it a couple of Tuesdays and if you're made to feel unwelcome then I'd withdraw.  I think it could be a fun experience and you could wind up making some neat new relationships along with rekindling an old one - but you won't know unless you give it a fair shot.    I can also tell you that camping has always been one of my best memories of my teens and early twenties.  Never pass up an opportunity to camp, it's a special thing that not everyone gets to do anymore...    God bless you.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	You should be.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	take her up on going to a meeting them you will see if the girls act open or like you are infringing on there territory  If they seem inviting them have fun|`|1cGlucXyaa	The mom is obviously inviting you. Plus this could be an opportunity to get closer to your friend. I felt the same way when i started attending the Church I go to now. Of course I was saved and some of my best friends are in the youth group at my Church. But go, it sounds like a lot of fun.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Go! It'll be a chance to have fun, try new things, and get to know some people!   As a member of such a close-knit women's ministry, we always loved when new people came along, whether or not they shared our faith - each person brings a story and something special to add to the group!|`|0iGPAUBCaa	I would go. I mean, if there's like 6 girls that are not members and they're going, sure. Why not? You'll like it!|`|3kKlGfy7aa	don't be but just go and have fun im shure they'll enjoy you!!!|`|ZrgaKxNRaa	i could understand why you would think that you are invading...but..some things that you have to consider is the fact is most of the time, when one enters into a "Group" the group was already there and most of the people that are in it were also, at one point, thinking the same thing as you are..so in turn i do think that you will find that the people will be alot more excepting than you are expecting. Plus church activities are all about love family and friends so, just keep a smile on your face and just keep a positive attitude about the situation.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	Check it out and see what they are about. Don't over analyze it until you have to.....Don't rush into any assumptions or other decisions until you have had a chance to investigate this Church for yourself. Then decide. Make decisions on sound information and not on assumptions.|`|EQydFhzmaa	I know what religion you are talking about because I am a part of it. I wouldn't worry about it because if they like you (and I'm sure they will) you will fit in. They will eventually make you a member of their church. Then you, being a woman, will be treated with less respect than the dirt at the campsite. Now, I do like some things they teach and I have met some very wonderful people, but when you get down to the bottom of things - THEY DO NOT TREAT WOMEN AS EQUALS TO MEN!!! I would still go because I think it would be a lot of fun for you, and if you do like what they're offering for a religion, then feel free to join. I was young and naive and pushed into making the decision. I'm not happy with my ward or the people who run it.|`|AA12070800	I'm sure you would be welcome and would have a good time. It sounds like you know some people, even if you aren't as close to your friend.  Most church groups are glad to have folks join them, the more the merrier!

Growing up in a small town the am station would come in from Buffalo and at night New York. Listened to Cousin Brucie. Tommy Shannon Show(trying to replay his jingle in my head for his name, not sure if that's right). I still like to search for the am stations. Philadelphia had good DJ's too.|`|AA11089846	I used to listen to WLS on a little black transistor radio. They played the best music. I lived 35 miles east of Pittsburgh, Pa. and picked up the station very clear. Rock 'n roll was taboo and if I would have been caught, I would have lost the radio, so I had to keep it on low.  I cannot recall any of the DJ's though.|`|ok6EGPnpaa	Bob Serratt and Larry Lujack - also known as "Uncle" Larry.     I spent many many hours (and batteries!) kistening to them. Also, our     community pool broadcast WLS when it was open. Since I only lived     3 blocks from the pool, I was there day in and day out. I loved those     two and was thrilled to find Bob Serratt on " Fox Thing in the Morning"     and was very disappointed when he left. Never did hear if it was his     choice or theirs.     Best station there was - hands down|`|oKjcTZypaa	Might want to post this question/topic on http://www.chitownradio.com
kZW8xXoKaa	Oh my I'm so happy you posted that, I cant believe I've never come across it on my own...    It was Great! I couldn't describe my feelings about how atheism has changed my life any more eloquently than that.    This video explains: Atheism is not a crutch, No excuse to hate, no excuse to do anything but enjoy this life you have...Make the most of Life guilt and god-delusion free!    |`|EoPRTJr4aa	good video and it sums up how I feel for the most part.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	To be honest. It only makes Christians feel good, it doesn't really help Atheists that much. Remember Paul's speach on Mars Hill? You need to respect people's beliefs, and understand them before you can preach them sometimes.|`|nZdq2GmTaa	i thought it was a good video. alot of the reasons why atheists wont come to church is because they think they are too good for a god. that they need to look smarter and come up with all these reasons why god doesnt exist. i just feel bad for them when they are looking like idiots down in hell :( and for them im sorry|`|Ld16o3kYaa	you think God comforts you. you do not realize you are comforting your self by believing he is watching over you..|`|aNycRVC9aa	I loved it.|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	This video pretty much sums it up for me.  All that I don't want or need from religion.  Thanks for sharing.  A star for you.|`|qVaaaT7Gaa	clearly its misguided. Atheism doesn't try to do these things, thats not the point. Just because religion may do these things doesn't make it any more true. Christianity may bring you comfort but does that mean JC is the son of god? Of course not - pointless video    You could make a far more relevant video by saying religion wastes time, money, resources, etc etc    EDIT: I got bored about half way through    EDIT: ok watched it all now. yeah its good, makes some good points|`|JoVbT4noaa	I'm just gonna assume its crap and not even take the bait.|`|a8kAassWaa	that will not excuse you from REALITY    GOD loves you, and he is REALity        The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.   Psalm14:1      But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.   Hebrews 11:6    Does God exist? If you want to know, investigate Jesus Christ. We're told that "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  God does not force us to believe in him, though he could. Instead, he has provided sufficient proof of his existence for us to willingly respond to him. The earth's perfect distance from the sun, the unique chemical properties of water, the human brain, DNA, the number of people who attest to knowing God, the gnawing in our hearts and minds to determine if God is there, the willingness for God to be known through Jesus Christ.     .*** WRITTEN BY AN EX ATHEISTS NOT BY MYSELF     atheists are only fooling themselves about the existence of God and this is exactly why.     Does God exist?    We know God exists because he pursues us. He is constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him.    ***I was an atheist at one time. And like most atheists, the issue of people believing in God bothered me greatly. What is it about atheists that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting something that we don't believe even exists?! What causes us to do that? When I was an atheist, I attributed my intentions as caring for those poor, delusional people...to help them realize their hope was completely ill-founded. To be honest, I also had another motive. As I challenged those who believed in God, I was deeply curious to see if they could convince me otherwise. Part of my quest was to become free from the question of God. If I could conclusively prove to believers that they were wrong, then the issue is off the table, and I would be free to go about my life.    I didn't realize that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on my mind, was because God was pressing the issue. I have come to find out that God wants to be known. He created us with the intention that we would know him. He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he keeps the question of his existence squarely before us. It was as if I couldn't escape thinking about the possibility of God. In fact, the day I chose to acknowledge God's existence, my prayer began with, "Ok, you win..." It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by people believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them.

The answer is that Christians (and most other religions) don't just go off and believe what they want in a vacuum.  Their beliefs AFFECT people.  Big time.  Gay marriage, stem cell research, condom education in AIDS-stricken countries to name a few simple instances.  And since those positions are rooted in religious teaching, challenging the religious teachings is a legitimate strategy of argument.  It's not that complicated.    No one ever bothers the Amish.  The reason is their beliefs don't affect other people.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	You should talk to the Christians who are threatened by the very existence of people who don't agree with them, who think that any teaching that runs contrary to their dogma is an attack on Christianity.  I respect people of all faiths.  The only thing I require in return is that my views also be respected.  That's not a subject that's open for debate,|`|xfmMeJx0aa	Because Christians try so hard to convert people to believe as they do. Just look at how your question is worded. You ask the question in an attempt to disprove atheists ideals with statements like "show you how God can change your life". You have already made your first mistake. You condescended to atheists by stating, in so many words, that they need God to change their lives. You have assumed they are what? Unhappy? Without morality? What? Who says they need your God? You? Your Bible? Your church? Your God?

I don't care what anyone believes, as long as they don't try to have it made into laws or have it taught as science in my publicly-funded schools.    As long as they keep their screwball faith and biblical fantasies to themselves and in their meeting houses, they get no grief from me.|`|IJZZkDUvaa	I don't try to disprove or prove anyone else's beliefs.    I do however defend my own faith and I detest prosyletization.      Many Christians in the US seem to think that this is a "Christian nation" and that everyone else already does or should share their beliefs. This is not true. There is freedom of religion in this country  -  which means that people of ALL different faiths and religions have the opportunity to live here and practice their religion. This means that people of ALL faiths (including none!) should be able to be treated equally and with respect.    I do not care what others believe as long as they don't push their beliefs onto me or try to make their beliefs law.    People who are out to "prove" their faith and "disprove" others' faiths are usually insecure and not really sure of what they believe - those kinds of people think that if all the non-Christians and gays or whoever else all went away then they could finally be secure in what they believe, but that isn't true.  If you want to be sure of what you do or don't believe, that is entirely up to you.    Christians - especially literalists - need to understand that you believe the Bible because it is YOUR holy book. You believe that God gave it to your people and your religion. I don't believe that. I believe in my own holy texts and prophecies. Quoting at me from your book isn't going to change that, and it isn't going to convince me of anything, except that you don't get it and don't really respect me and my faith. *I'm saying "you" here in a general sense - I don't know if you do that or not, but I'm just trying to say that some people do that and I don't appreciate it.*    Peace!|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	Me personal, I believe that people just don't want there to be a god( experience and speaches in the passed).|`|nCjkx8qPaa	I must say that the negative answers do not surprise me.

I came to turn mother against daughter........a man's enemies will be members of his own household. Jesus came to bring peace between man and God not necessarily between all men. Christianity by it proclaiming that Jesus is the unique Son Of God brings contention from every other religion. Christianity declares all other religions as false. The N.T. addresses three groups of people. The church, the nations (gentiles) and Israel. Most people in the world are in the nations group. This would be atheists as well as everyone else who is not Jewish or Christian. Lumping everyone together can bring much anger out of people. You must speak the truth in love. Jesus did this but didn't always get a positive reaction. Remember, the devil uses people. The only group he is afraid of are Christians.|`|tDmemV5yaa	Actually, Christians don't have anything to prove.  How can someone prove what is essentially a personal experience?  The only way that this can be proved or disproved is by seeking and having a personal relationship with God.  Of course, this takes time, energy and an open mind, which a lot of haters wouldn't give or spend because of the risk that they might be wrong.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Theists, especially christians, try to control and restrict us based on their views.

How could I live a life believing that death was the absolute end? My faith is my comfort, and I will not let anyone take that away from me.     Sometimes, though, I can see non-believer's point of view. Some Christians can be very pushy and try to convert everyone they meet. I dislike these people. I feel like everyone already knows that Christians exist and they have made a choice in what they believe in. I prefer to keep my faith personal, so I don't offend anyone. I also dislike that some atheists feel that all Christians are wackos, conformists, and stuck in old ways. On the other hand, some Christians feel that atheists are evil or need to have an intervention. If only we could stay out of each others' business.     It is truly upsetting that Christians and atheists mock each other and try to belittle each others' beliefs. I think it comes down to the level of respect that we all have for each other. Something's gotta give.     I also wonder why most atheists only bug Christians? Why don't they pester Hindus, Jews, Muslims, or Buddhists? Are the people who believe in those religions less devoted?

The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at http://www.thewahhabimyth.com/ , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful. And anyone who has studied the biography of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, will not find any evidence of "extremism."    ----  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"    What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?    The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com. Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.    Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)    When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)    Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)    As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:    "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)    All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)    Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)    The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.    When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.    "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]  --------    ADDITIONAL NOTE:  For anyone interested in learning more, I encourage you to actually read the treatises of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab. Many of them are relatively short and amazingly beneficial. One would be hard-pressed to find anything from his essays calling to extremism. Rather, much of his work is simply about educating the common Muslim in the basics of Islamic Monotheism.    Translated Works (English Language):    "The Four Rules (of Islamic Monotheism)"  http://www.spubs.com/sps/downloads/pdf/T...  *Clarifies the difference between genuine Islamic monotheism (tawheed) and polytheism (shirk).

Maybe other than reading believes why don't you try to spend a day or two with them, believe me have a long acquaintance with them. There is a reason some times the term Wahabi is used derogatorily.     Wahabis are literally the most fundamentalistic aspect of Islam, and in literal terms devoid of reasoning and logic. Everything to them is Haram. Shirk or Bidah. Completely devoid of spiritualism.     The biggest problem is there delusions apparently they're right and everyone else is wrong, well that would've been ok as no one gives a ****, but the problem occurs when they try to impose their believes on others. Wahabis are extremely intolerant of others views and others.     Sunnis don't consider Wahabis Sunni & die hard Wahabis don't want to be. There are many Sunnis who don't go to a Wahabi mosque to pray and vice verse that'll give you an idea. I suggest reading more of their crap other than some sugar coated and see how at every step apparently they're right and others will burn in hell. If they had there way virtually everything would've been Haram and Bidah by now.     Anyone who does not respect others views can not expect others to respect them!!|`|XCTUmHPLaa	Oh,scholars from all over the world having party here .    @ habibi--the BA should go to the person who said wahabi ,do not fast --lol    wahabis and nasabi is the term which shias and other deviated sects had invented to defame real Islam based on Quran     and they strongly oppose SHIRK AND BIDAH ,So its obvious that shias whoes religion is based on Shirk ( YA ALI ,YA HUSAIN)  and bidah like self fllagelation,bcame enemy|`|0yTM98Odaa	aren't they very extreme?

AA12006309	What she doesn't realize is it's not up to her to determine your sexual orientation.  It's up to you and only you.    Go to the GSA.  Be with your friend.  If your mother continues to state that she doesn't want life to be harder on you, let her know whether it's hard or not, it's still YOUR life to live, not hers.|`|HP0a2HeZaa	She can't hold you back from being what you think you are. If it feels right to date your same gender, then tell her. If she doesnt agree, do it anyways since it is RIGHT for you to do it.|`|gpQm5ZPpaa	Um, no offense or anything... but... screw your mom, she's keeping you from being who you really are.  That's not a very "mom" thing to do, although there are plenty of similar stories.    Do it.  Its your life and it will make you happy.  Does she really even have to know?|`|grYkoDaraa	live your life she can't "let" yo be bi.  if you are bi then you are bi they can't change that.|`|PyAgEejnaa	Don't let your mother run your life (well, to a certain extent since you still live under her roof).  I would say sneak around and date your friend anyway, but that's stressful and lying isn't fun PLUS she won't trust you anymore. I will say that if you want to join GSA, then go for it, you're the one at school and she can't tell you what groups/clubs to join. As far as letting you be bisexual...you don't need a permission slip from mommy to be who you are. You're growing up and becoming your own person, respectfully deny her the ability to stifle that.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Your sexual orientation is your business and is genetic.

"Messianic Jews" are usually ethnic Jews who have accepted Christ, but still observe the yearly sabbaths and new moons, which were a shadow of Christ's first coming 2,000 years ago. This is NOT to be confused with the weekly Sabbath, which is an inseparable part of God's Law, the 10 Commandments.   We (Adventists) do not observe the yearly feasts, sacrifices and sabbaths because those were intended to point the Jews living before Christ forward to the Messiah's first coming and His sacrifice on the cross. Now that has been fulfilled, so they are no longer necessary.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	What happened to the 6th and 8th days?  did they skip over 12345?|`|AA10405801	Because Messianic Jews are Christians NOT Jews!

We follow the ten commandments, but the sabbath seems to be a technical exception. It says in the Bible not to get into disputes about observing certain days, as different poeple have different convictions, so as long as they don't trust on the law for thier salvation and trust in Jesus, they should follow thier convictions and do what their convictions tell them what to do, so that they do not stumble.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Maybe because Seventh Day Adventists realize that "Messianic Jews" are not Jews at all, but are Baptists, in disguise, trying to convince people that they are Jewish, by putting a bit of Jewish trappings upon their exteriors, while hiding the fact that their entire mission is to convert Jews through deception.      At least the Seventh Day Adventists are a bit more honest.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: because they're honest in their religion and admit they're a Christian sect

"And of mankind he who purchases idle talks to mislead (people) from the Path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allaah) by way of mockery, For such there will be a humiliating torment." [31:6].     Abu Amir and Abu Malik al-Ash'ari(RA) reported that the Prophet(SAW) said:   "Among my ummah will be people who will make permissable al-herra, al-hareer, al-khamr, and al-ma'zif-liberalism, silk, alcohol, and musical instruments..."[Bukhari; see Fath al-Bari, 10/51]    Anas(RA) reported that the Prophet(SAW) said:   "In this ummah there will be punishments of earth-quakes, showers of stones and deformity (transformation into animals); when the people will be involved in drinking khamr (intoxicants), listen to female singers and play musical instruments."[Silsilat al-ahadeeth as-Saheehah, hadith no. 2203; attributed to Ibn Abi Dunya, concerning Dhamm al-Malahi (condemnation of musical instruments); the hadith is narrated by At-Tirmidhi, hadith no. 2212]  _____    Planting Nifaq  'Abdullah b. Mas'?d  Allah be pleased with him  said:   Singing sprouts hypocrisy (nifaq) in the heart as water sprouts greens and herbs.     Ibn Battah, Al-Ibanah Al-Kubra Vol.2 p469, and Al-Bayhaq?, Al-Sunan Al-Kubra Vol. 52 p231.     And also...    Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawz?yah  Allah have mercy on him  said in Madarij Al-Salik?n, Vol.1 p487:     These are the words of someone who fully understood singing and its effects, for no one regularly sings or listens to song except that his heart falls into nifaq without him realizing. If such a person understood the reality of nifaq and its end he would see it in his own heart. Never do the love of song and the love of Qur`an come together in a person's heart except that one expels the other. I and others have witnessed how heavy the Qur`an feels to singers and song-listeners; how they coil when it is recited and how they get angry with a reciter when he recites too long for them (in prayer etc); and how their hearts do not benefit from what he recites: they are not moved to do anything by it. But when the Qur`an of Shaytan comes, la ilaha illallah! How they lower their voices and settle down! How their hearts feel at peace and how the crying and emotions start, how moved they are inwardly and outwardly and spend on clothing and perfume and staying up hoping for a long night ahead. If this is not nifaq then it is certainly the way to it and its foundation.    _____    @sara:  how are you saying that without evidence?|`|74fe5c642d059f46a34e9d235a375172aa	i do|`|CQz8dMzFaa	I do.

I gave in to temptation on Eid but my husband told me it was ok. I later found out that it's haraam to listen to music on Eid as well so Alhamdulillah Insha Allah I'm forgiven for not knowing about that.  My husband grew up thinking it was hala to listen to music on Eid.    See www.2ids.com for evidence that music on Eid is haraam.|`|X5gmVvMDaa	I don't listen to music its haram!    Music intoxicates you and pulls you away from Allah.    This is the reason why Music is haram. Ok you have your sad music that makes you sad, You have your up beat music that makes you feel happy and crazy, you have your rap music that states anger and tells you to go fight, and your hard rock goth music that makes you sad depressed and makes you do crazy things to yourself and makes u depressed at the world and then you get the urge ohh I want to fight Music intoxicates you, people can't say that the music don't put them in certain moods this is what it means by intoxicating and it pulls you away from Allah.     Only Allah should be able to make you feel better you should not get that from Music it only messes with your emotions and how you feel. Where qur'an makes you feel relaxed, and you benefit from qur'an you don't benefit from Music.     Music wont get you to Jannah following and listening to qur'an will.      And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e.music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allah, or the Verses of the Qur'an) by way of mockery.

AA11440601	Greed for money and/or power.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.    For more information, about what Catholics believe about the end of the world, see: http://www.americancatholic.org/Newslett...    Here is also what NASA thinks about the 2012 End of the World scenario: http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/StarFA...    With love in Christ.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

There's also some internet-bot that is supposedly collecting data from all over the web that causes it to predict 2012 to be the 'end times'.     I think that some of these topics haven't been researched in depth and people are jumping to conclusions because of the sensationalized ideas around 2012.

TWO - "Nibiru" was their word for JUPITER, and "shar" didn't mean "3,600" in Sumerian (the original myth claimed 3,600). Both of these flaws came from a man named Stichin (man who went from Marvel Comics to a proclaimed "archeoligist". Didn't get much right.)    THREE - A planet cannot stop and then rotate again. Physics forbid it.    FOUR - If aliens DID come, then there would be a record everywhere about the event. Not only that, but if the aliens had told them about every planet in our solar systems, then why did they include the sun as a planet? LIE.    FIVE - This tale is different everytime I hear it, wasn't the story supposed to say "they made us in clay pots"?    SIX - EGYPTIANS MADE THE PYRAMIDS BUDDY. There is evidence, there are scriptures of the event. They would have written of said "aliens" had it occured.    SEVEN - Places like China were more advanced than Sumeria in astronomy, and they never told of "planet X".    EIGHT - At the speed it was coming for us, it would be moving 10.3 times the speed of light. It would actually fly right through a time hole in the universe.    NINE - If it didn't fly into a time hole, we would be able to see it with a basic telescope.    TEN - The government is NOT covering this up, they would know that they couldn't, and come out and say "ITS HERE BUT ITS GANNA GO AWAY LOL!", not (in the words of NASA and every science with a bit of reason) "It is false." Which it is.    ELEVEN - In 1984, NASA didn't spot "Nibiru" , they spotted dark energy, which they thought led to another galaxy. For a lack of anything better, some media people said they found new planets!    TWELVE - Actually, looking at the signs, the "pole shift" won't happen for 30 million years; if you don't believe me, talk to astronomers (real ones, not these YouTube addicts with no lives, which you seem to be listening to.)    THIRTEEN - YouTube is not a valuable source of info. I have gotten five "NIBIRU IS HERE KIDS, RUN FAR" fanatics to cut the cbobbaven the account "Nibiruishere" has come out and said his line was bull. And if you google "Nibiru" all you will get is slick websites, most wanting you to buy something.    FOURTEEN - If your prophecy was true, we would be gone by now. The human race couldn't have made that quick of a recovery as it did. And why would there be ancient ruins from 5,000 years ago? They would have been destroyed.    FIFTEEN - Nibiru didn't crash into the earth and make the moon, there werent bacteria then, let alone Sumerians to write about it.    SIXTEEN - The alien tale was invented during the early stages of religion formation.    SEVENTEEN - The only one who says your fallacy "Nibiru" is coming is a loony woman by the name of "Zeta", she claims to be in telepathic contact with the aliens. But she predicted the "2003" happening too, didn't happen.     EIGHTEEN - Back to the "governments covering it up" loonacy: If they were covering this up, then any YouTube account proclaiming anything about it would be deleted. Any shred of evidence of it would dissapear. If there was a "leak" than the Government would have stopped it by now, either by force or bribery, not let it continue as long as it has.    NINETEEN - What a**hole actually believes in this internet hoax (Nibiru)?|`|1wNsBNmxaa	i agree with your question all the mayan calender is doing is ending there is no proof that the world is ending at all just a new beginning in i say this all so when nothing happens all the christians that are running around with there heads cut off like chickens are the ones that are the fools in then what are you going to do be a shamed of your self's in go hide in a cave a matter of fact there was a couple of people saying that the world was going to end in 2025 and all so they said it was going to end in 2060 with the earth catching on fire      Relic66~~~?|`|bmoCpcdraa	its against the law for brother and sister to love sorry|`|0NQL7yRPaa	no we cant cause nobodys perfect|`|DwI2MV53aa	Yes, this is pretty much another Y2K thing.

Allah(swt) knows best|`|FhXzlnDOaa	There is compulsion in islam.  That verse has been abrogated.  Actually, most things concerning islam involve compulsion, from the ablution, forced praying, fasting and that's just some of the things that Muslims do.  islam has been forced on people right from the start.  It was not spread peacefully.  Later revelations from allah proved that compulsion was actually the way to go.    003.151   YUSUFALI: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority: their abode will be the Fire: And evil is the home of the wrong-doers!     005.033   YUSUFALI: The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;     009.005   YUSUFALI: But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.     009.029   YUSUFALI: Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	Dude, that verse was abrogated.  Allah replaced it with a btter one (Kill the infidels wherever you find them).    Being number 2 in the quran means nothing.  That just means it was longer than the surahs after them.  You need to know what the order of revelation was, which is entirely a different thing.    If there is no compulsion in religion, then why is the penalty for leaving Islam death?  That sure sounds compulsory to me. . . .
aO4iCwtoaa	It depends what you mean by contradictions.    The most famous contradiction is the fact that there are two separate Creation stories, which each tell the story a different way.  There are also two versions of the story of the spies who went into Canaan, and two different descriptions of how manna tasted.  As far as Judaism is concerned, however, contradictions in the narrative are two sides of the same coin, and the differences are open to many interpretations - in other words, having the contradiction enhances the analysis of the text, rather than negates it.  We don't hide from them or pretend they're really saying the same thing, but instead try to figure out what they can teach us.    There are also commandments that seem to say two different things, such as the law against marrying one's sister-in-law, which is counteracted by the laws of yibum (in which a man is required to marry his sister-in-law if his brother dies without any children) - but these are seen as legal exceptions rather than contradictions (i.e., if the brother is alive there is no scenario where his brother can marry his ex-wife, but his dying without issue creates a scenario where the commandment to promote offspring is weighted as more important than the laws of interpersonal relations).    So there are contradictions, but nothing as profound to our faith as the NT contradictions such as the faith vs. works argument, or the differing accounts of Jesus's ascension... or the many ways the NT contradicts the Torah itself.|`|AA10057370	Atheists that misquote the bible and probably never read the bible are not authorities on the bible.(they are the ones that post bible verses and give inaccurate meanings of them).|`|X9rXRNUxaa	N O !

Numbers 23:19 God is not a man (eesh), that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?     though it should be noted, in Exodus, that was said by Israel, and in Numbers, that was said by Bilam, a false prophet................in both cases, they were said by human beings, not God........though to Bilam's benefit, it is said that he said ONLY what God told him to say.....despite the fact that he was a false prophet, he DID infact speak with God      Exodus 20:4  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:     Exodus 25:19  And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.     though it could be that "grave" means SPECIFICALLY "carved" and these cherubim are to be beaten out of a single piece of gold, not carved out of gold        Deuteronomy 22:11  Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together.    however, the priestly garments were made from wool and linen twisted together, as is commanded    the commandment against such could be because such a garment is reserved ONLY for the high priests    these are the only types of contradictions that i am aware of...........contradictions that are due to not thinking something all the way through|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	if there wasn't then why do we have all these whiches and crap still........|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	Two different accounts of the Flood, albeit woven together; two different accounts of the wandering-in-the-desert after the Exodus (Numbers does not always agree with Exodus); two versions of how David met Saul; two versions of who killed Goliath (the KJV translators, out of piety, deliberately concealed one of these); two versions of how Saul died; Chronicles does not always agree with Kings; Judges does not agree with Joshua; and so on.      Look up the Documentary Hypothesis.     "Contradictions" is a bit strong.  Those who point out the differences in the four gospel accounts, and the variations in doctrine in the letters of the New Testament, apologize by calling them "different perspectives" and this is just as true of the Old Testament.  Probably there was a Northern Kingdom perspective and a Southern Kingdom perspective on the common history and heroic stories of both.  In fact that ought to be expected, since the two kingdoms had each their own priesthood and temples.  But the differences tend to be no more than the variations-in-witness typical of any set of ancient documents recounting the same subject -- or modern documents, for that matter.  How often do Republican and Democratic versions of the same event agree?  Never, of course.      Look, the bible isn't the word of God Himself no matter how much presumptuous (and possibly blasphemous) folk want to put its words into His mouth.  Since it is the work of well-meaning prophets and apostles who wanted to convey what they thought God said, it should be respected, but because they were all human, it's entirely normal that minor differences, with political and cultural slant, occur in their accounts.  Fools like to say these differences are just mistranslations; they have made themselves deliberately blind, and anchored their faith in a collection of printed text, a really poor kind of idol when one thinks about it, instead of the living Holy Spirit.  It's really too bad.

The URLs you post only prove one thing - that marriage is, indeed, universal, and ALL religions, whether they are monotheistic, or polytheistic, believes that marriage came from God or gods.    If so be that marriage came from God (or even gods), then who are YOU to say it should be changed to include same-sex marriage?  Who died and elected YOU to be God (or gods)?    It's rather arrogant and presumptuous to say that you know more than God (or gods)!    You said it yourself - with examples - that other religions (in fact I would go so far as to say EVERY religion) has marriages, ordained by their religion (i.e. by God - or gods, if you prefer)!    Marriage is from God, and man has no right to change it!  Period!    And if you don't believe marriage came from God, then why bother talking about other religions?  YOU'RE the one who brought it up, and you can't object to someone using your own statements, otherwise you shouldn't have made them in the first place!

Yes, the bible refers to it as a sin, but there are far worse sins listed than that.     Seriously, that level of homophobia can only be explained as a case of the J Edgar Hoovers.     The bible did not invent marriage. The separation of church and state means that religion has no place in whether or not gay marriage should be allowed. That's the same separation of church and state that allows Christians to practice their religion without fear of persecution.     If I could hear a valid argument on why gay marriage should not be allowed WITHOUT religion being brought into it, I'd be more than happy to listen. But I haven't heard one yet.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	@paki24 "If they didn't take the Bible Literally they'd be Hypocrites and if they didn't take it Literally there'd be no point to it, because everything it said could be twisted if it wasn't literal"    You must be new around these parts, grasshopper.

Christians aren't stupid, we know there are other marriages. It doesn't mean we have to agree with them. (For that matter, I'd wager that lots of other religions have issues with gay marriages.)    3) Unlike lying, which can't always be proven and happens a million times a day, gay marriage is, in fact, bannable.

God performed the first marriage, and He did not created two guys or two girls and marry them. He married a MAN and a WOMAN.

Learn how to live your life first before telling others how to live theirs.

Once you start meeting "real" people who do not automatically judge people on things that they do not understand themselves you start to treasure them. I would suggest having a few really good friends who understand where you are coming from and can support you in what you are doing in life. Once you have that then you stop caring what the other people think and how they judge you.|`|cxjLLtE1aa	I definitely agree.

6fLxNyVpaa	i vote no since your just hooking up
nZdq2GmTaa	im not sure if that was a vent or a question. however, i will answer it as if it was the question u originally asked.    Your marriage is not bound together in "holy matrimony" or in other words, you guys arent being held together through christ. god is love, if you dont know god, you dont know love. so without god very active in your marriage (church, prayer, bible, discussions) then your love is much less strong than it could be. So i think that God is trying to make you realize that you need to pray more, read more, and base this marriage (or possibly the next one) with him in charge, not you.    i hope everything works out, and i hope that your kids arent strongly and deeply affected by these events later on.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I don't even think that god is.

Sorry to have to be the one to break this to you.  But what more can I do?

God is not punishing you- maybe he's trying to teach you something. Since this is happening, maybe God is waiting for you to step out in faith.  God loves you so much, and he is dying for you to come to him. First off, if your not saved- just give it up to God. Sin destroys the world, as you can see- this is very true. But God provided a way, through Jesus, to be set free from that- and to get to heaven. It's believing that God sent his son to save you from hell. Believing that his sacrifice was beyond compare. It's also confessing sin in your life- stuff that is eating you alive, and you KNOW is wrong. Just confess those things...believe what Jesus did for you...and beg God to forgive you. He will, and he will turn your life around. Just come to him broken, ask for help, and ask for a savior. If you are saved, then you know what I'm talking about. If you don't- it will change your life forever. It will change your perspective on life, and you are able to be led by God's spirit. It's an amazing life- full of joy, and closeness to God. Your life can be turned around, it's just believing that it can be.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No God does not hate you or punishing you.|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Why do you even want this person back?

PaOVTFwDaa	I have known young teenagers who had more sense then some adults and many adults who are nothing but children that never grew up.    The age of consent in most places is 16 - supposedly this is the age by which most people have formulated their philosophies in life and move forward into the future based on those philosophical morals.    Since we are a "law abiding" nation - the law says it is 18 now - it used to be 21 - but when people complained that they could die for their country yet could not vote  - they changed the law     "Legally" 18 would be correct however, I am not sure the LAW is the correct measure since it can be changed arbitrarily.|`|Oo1FI3Mkaa	Right now the adult age for signing contracts, etc. is 18.  But the minimum age for buying alcoholic beverages is 21.  Looking back on my life and those that I grew up with, I agree with the age 21 for buying beverages but I think that 18 is too young to be signing a contract.  Most 18 year olds are not stable enough to be making contractual decisions.  I also think that you should not be allowed to vote until you are age 21.|`|HkIatVdiaa	I think everybody is different.   I think when one feels so distant from childhood;  so displaced and has learned from past experiences-  one is mature  also when one can make smart decisions and conteplate the future;  in realistic terms- they are an ADULT  this can happen at 18, 21, older or younger...

24H5tznkaa	Here, you can read this book online:    http://books.google.com/books?id=U3un43f...    This was the first book I ever read. The first section really helped me to see things from a Pagan perspective and I was able to embrace a part of me that has always been there. :)    It sounds to me that you haven't yet had interaction with the Divine or nature. Living in the middle of nowhere could definitely be a good thing in this case, you are surrounded by nature right? Spend some time gently touching a leaf with your fingertip, feel the energy transference. Sit on the ground beneath a tree and make yourself still...see if you can feel the energy of the Earth beneath you.     There are also a couple of good chants in that book for the God and Goddess that are pretty powerful too.    I understand what you mean though, right now you have the information but not the hands on experience. You need to have some Divine moments...otherwise, it's just words and theory right?    Good luck to you on your path. :)    *edit*    BTW, the book is called "Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner" by Scott Cunningham.

If you're younger (18 and under), I'd check out "Teen Witch" or "To Ride a Silver Broomstick" by Silver Ravenwolf.

Ignore the people on here, and get used to it, if you become a Pagan, Druid, Wiccan or NeoPagan you will be faced by judgments such as theirs an awful lot.  I would say firstly, read some books, learn about our ideas of everything having a soul, and how the earth should be cherished and respected.  Find a local group, and celebrate the festivals with them, or on your own even.  When I was younger and unsure of my religion, because both my parents are Pagan, they told me to just lie among the grass in the garden, and see what I could feel.  You'll see after a while the soul in things, and will learn more about it as you come to understand it more.  Whilst in a wood or your garden, even the park, become one with Nature, sit still, and calm, and clear your head of any trifling thoughts or worries, just meditate, and become calm.    I think you'll find it easier to join a group, as this is as much information as I can really give you, you need to experience the feelings you have with Nature yourself, rather than read from someone else's experiences.|`|Bd5My74Aaa	Scott Cunningham's : Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (ISBN 0-87542-184-9) Is a good, non-threatening, basic primer for beginners.     Cunningham practiced a fairly basic interpretation of Wicca, often worshiping alone, though his book series for solitaries describes several instances in which he worshiped with friends and teachers.    As far as expressing your beliefs, prayer is always a first step. Then when you feel a connection celebrating important dates and observing holy days is good.     Start small and keep it simple, too many people dive into the deep end and try to do too much.     When European explorers first discovered that pygmies hunted elephants they asked; "how do YOU eat an elephant?!"    The pygmies answer was: "One bite at a time...."    This would be an excellent place to start. Good luck!|`|IwlE0oFbaa	Sounds like you would have loved Ireland before Patrick went there.  He was powerful before God and still loved today.    When the druids came out against him, he revealed such power the entire surroundings shook and they yielded.  In one place he directed that two graves big dug up and he raised the occupants to life.  They described the afterlife they had seen and asked for baptism before returning to the grave.  Near today's Dublin he raised from the dead the king's daughter and son and the entire region was baptized to Jesus.  Patrick had prophesied Dublin would be famous one day.    Patrick said that he was unworthy that God had worked such miracles through him greater than the early Christians and Apostles who had conquered Rome through their signs and sufferings.    Remember the wise saying, "those who don't know history are bound to repeat it."    Believe me, I want to have as little as possible to do with evil spirits.  I'm not being judgemental on you are anyone else here.  It has been revealed that their are demons consigned to hell and those who follow them will end there with them.

FjiRPKp2aa	Forgiveness is not just for them. Forgiveness is part of Gods healing plan for you. Forgiveness does not mean forgetting the deed. Our mission is to live a life of love of Jesus and forgiveness. Jesus forgave the folks who beat him,lied about him, stole his clothes and gambled over them, and finally killed him. Nothing has happened to man that did not happen to Jesus.I am a survivor of this type of thing. I never have failed to help my abuser but I never trusted him again. God allows you to forgive so that you will be able to move beyond a bad moment in time. You cannot keep hating someone who is dead. If you do they still have control over your life.You have to live your life beyond them. God will deal with them in His own way.I have seen it happen.|`|jcZnIR1Zaa	I forgive because God asked me to.       It does nothing for the one who hurt me.  He has not asked forgiveness, and until he honestly wants to be forgiven, then forgiveness will not be his.  Not my rule, God's.       If he were truly repentant, God will forgive.  If I am true to God's word, I can do no less.       Lastly, harboring hatred, even for such sin, does nothing but hurt me more.   My hatred does not hurt the perpetrator, it just eats away at me.    Releasing that anger and hate lets me heal more quickly and surely.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	Where was god when that person were abused? Abused people don't need to forgive their abuser,its their own choice.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	My Pastor did the most amazing sermon on Forgiveness a couple of months ago, and I think that it may help you understand.  He said that forgiveness is not truly for the other person. That said, forgiveness is not something that we can just toss out there.  Before forgiveness happens we must work through the issues that caused the pain in the first place. Some people say that "oh don't worry, it was not really anything at all" and think that this is forgiveness. No it isn't. Forgiveness involves working through the issues, not over looking them. That said.  Just because the abuser does not recognize the fact that they did something wrong that would acquire forgiveness, we have to remember that eventually not forgiving only hurts us. Forgiveness does not mean that we have to be friends with the abuser. It just means that we have to forgive, because if we live in un-forgiveness then we are living in a prison of our own making.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	For their own sake...Why should they be condemned to walk in anger all their lives?

Only God can forgive and forget.    As humans we can not forgive and forget and we should not.If we did, how many of us would stay in abusive situations?    God commands us to forgive if we want to be forgiven. That is enough for me to forgive.     When we forgive it benefits us the most as we can then go on with our lives and leave the bitterness behind. Forgiveness does not mean that you are saying that no wrong was done to you. It just means that you are freeing yourself and not allowing the perpetrator to have power over you any more.    When my best friend was murdered by his wife, I did not want to forgive her. I though an elephant had came to live on my chest. I dreamed in living color of torturing her to death. After that dream, I really got in touch with God and came to realize that in order for me to be able to live a Christian life I must forgive her.     I would still travel half way around the world to be at her parole hearings  to see that she stays in prison. I would do that simple because she is very sick and I believe she would kill again. I have forgiven her.    Sexually abused children have enough to go through for the rest of their lives without caring the burden of unforgiveness.  They should be told  that forgiveness does not  ever mean that what happened was alright. They were the victum of a crime. Don't make the crime worse by making them into a bitter victim for ever. Let them be free again as they should have been|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	they should forgive for their personal sake. holding on to hate and anger will only put that person into an early grave. you can forgive..but no one is telling that person to forget.|`|0PvpGjSqaa	personally i don't think they should have to, they were already forced to do things they didn't want to do, forgiving their abuser should be optional.|`|pakIAYWoaa	the act of forgiving is for your own healing and in no way exonerates or diminishes the consequences and the responsibility to bare the guilt of the offender.  By forgiving you leave the matter in Gods hands and remove a root of bitterness that can keep you as a victim.  In other areas of life we need grace ourselves and by not forgiving we imply that God wont forgive them either.  When you have mercy God says the same manner you judge it will be measured back to you.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	It depends on the definition of 'forgive.'    I agree they should forgive, but forgiveness does not mean:  -I now trust you  -It was ok  -I do not mind  -I have forgotten about the experience  -You do not need help  -I will not sue you or report you to the police.  -I want a friendly or loving relationship with you  - I feel safe hanging around you.  etc.    I would say the lowest level of having forgiven some would be that we hope for the best in their future (heaven) at some point, which may still require their reform.|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well in some situations I do not feel a person should be forgiven. Murder? Well, it all depends on what exactly happened. I mean if someone was mistreated and constantly abused and they murdered another person or snapped because people were mistreating them then I could see forgiveness. But if someone raped someone? I don't believe a person like that deserves to be forgiven. There are no two ways around it rape is cold blooded and evil. If you rape someone you deserve to be guilty for the rest of eternity. When you rape someone you accept the responsibility of that guilt. I personally feel a person deserves to be eternally scarred for raping another. I honestly don't believe God forgives everything, it wouldn't be fair. Yes we all sin but not all of us to that degree! I can see God forgiving you for taking some candy or robbing a bank, but rape? No. When a person rapes another they are fully aware of what they are doing and deserve punishment. If a person who raped someone was real with themselves they would even admit they do not deserve forgiveness. I don't feel you should have to forgive someone in that kind of situation until you felt like you wanted to. All I know is that the only reason I would forgive them is if they were in real agonizing psychological pain due to the fact that they raped me, life falling apart due to guilt, losing their house and becoming homeless over it, and extreme guilt for about around half of their life.    ** Not forgiving them doesn't mean you hold onto the anger like someone above said. You can not forgive someone and move on with your life and be happy. Of course I would say forgive people over petty stuff though.
oVeGMNsLaa	If you like butch girls, you SOOO must watch "If These Walls Could Talk 2"!  Chloe Sevigny plays the cutest, most realistic butch I've ever seen, and the story is heart-wrenchingly good.    If you like historical, you can't get any better than "Tipping The Velvet".  So good, and plus, girls in suits and man drag!  Yummy.    If you're in the mood for silly and funny but romantic, "D.E.B.S." is pretty cute.  Tacky, but totally adorable at the same time.    "Imagine Me and You" is a nice movie- a very well-told story.    Skip "Lost & Delirious" unless you really love teen angst and melodrama.  I found it far too over the top for me.    "Gia" is good, but I always thought the "lesbian quotient" was pretty low on this.  It's got a little bit, but mostly it's about the famous model Gia, not about a lesbian storyline.  It's worth seeing for Angelina's kicka** portrayal, but it's pretty sad and meh, not great.    I haven't seen any of the others.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	You should watch Better Than Chocolate, I don't know if you've ever seen it, but it's very good.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Why is this is the straight,lesbian,gay section|`|55h0RaYKaa	Imagine Me and You is quite good, and Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith are absolutely brilliant (read the books too!).

2k2ZeUwkaa	Why not make up a beautiful picnic basket and take him for a divine picnic, if its too cold, or you dont want to go out-set up your room and have the picnic up there, or if you dont like that, do it in your back yard. another idea is to make up a journal with all the wonderful, funny and silly memories the two of you have had throughout your years together, maybe write him a poem, or a letter explaining to him how important he is to you and how much you love him. You dont have to buy him the most expensive gift or the newest thing on the market, sometimes its just a gift from the heart that is enough-usually it means more than going out and buying something. you could also make him love coupons-one for a back massage, dinner together etc etc. good luck...ive done all these things, and im totally lost for valentines day this year....|`|k0ez34Yyaa	A cute titanium ring  http://www.discounttitaniumjewelry.com/T...|`|a7f817fe79ea01f148e3fe4060b6a54baa	Here's something creative that will be appreciated and you will have fun doing:    Make up a crossword puzzle and have all the hints be personal inside moments and jokes that only you two would know about.

You can either make him little gifts or buy some little gifts for the scavenger hunt.  They could be his favorite candy, a movie, a cd,   boxers, etc.  Hope this helps.
YPAHeUucaa	It's what America sees it as. Unfortunately, there will always be people who "act black" or say others are "acting black" because of what they're exposed to and the patterns they see. It's all stereotypes. I'm sure a lot of white people are assumed to be blonde, rich, and snobby, is this not true? I know people are ignorant, but you have to stay strong and overcome it.

I have faith and I feel strongly that God exists from within    2.  I feel that science is unlimited in its knowledge, yet is limited since it can never reach the end of an infinite road.  Any new discovery merely adds new questions, ad infinitum, therefore there will be a gaping hole in our knowledge which only God can fit into since all else can be eliminated    3.  I don't think we can be scientifically reduced to mere particles and really gain any true and real meaning out of it.  Yes, we can deduce that emotional attributes such as love, empathy, perception of beauty affect chemicals in the brain, but that gives us scientific meaning, not a meaning or hint at what the true essence of these unknowns are.  Infinite reductionism has no meaningful end, can never be reached, and doesnt gain any true meaning    4.  Science is the greatest human achievement indeed, but I think it is clear that some things just lie beyond it's scope.  The imagination, true understanding of consciousness, meaning of the abstract.

He does not hate His creation, only those things which destroy and tear down.

oHrqbdydaa	I never saw any "evidence" of ghosts. At best, some vague occurrences remain unexplained, and at worst we've caught all the hucksters putting on these shows for the gullible.    The human mind can certainly create its own reality, visions, etc. This is no proof of a ghost.     It's always interesting how 'personal' these visions are---we don't have mass sightings of a ghost.    I never say "never" but basically I believe that all things in the universe must adhere to natural laws.     If the bat in the cave sees things we don't, that doesn't mean he's seeing a ghost.     |`|6909fd473bdfafef7715fa2afb4f1c32aa	You say "There is quite a bit of evidence..." I don't know of any evidence honestly. I've seen TV shows and I've heard others tell of their personal experiences. I think it's all bunk.     My grandmother was supposed to have had some sort of ESP, but I don't believe it. My father tells of the stories and instances where he claims he was present to see her "know things that she couldn't have."|`|AA10192420	I believe it's all possible, being that there's so much about the universe we don't understand...same as the existence of God. However, there are rational explanations for most of what is claimed as "evidence" for all of these things. For example, it's been said, even by people who believe in curses, that a person can only truly be cursed by themself. This isn't evidence for curses, it's evidence of the power of suggestion. As for ghosts, most claims are the result of wild exaggerations of ordinary events. In short, all the evidence I have come across so far, for the paranormal, came about by the ignorance of the people who found it. It's mostly misinterpretted/misunderstood chemistry, psychology, etc. But if you want evidence for something, you'll find it. Even if you have to create it yourself.|`|E426naffaa	Well, I used to, then I guess I asked myself this very question. Ever since then, I kind of stopped believing...    You could call it tragic. xD|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	I used to find reports of the paranormal interesting, intriguing.  Then I read further, developed more critical thinking.  I am an atheist and think that only material things exist; I disbelieve the paranormal.    Look into the books by Michael Shermer.    We apparently have a default position of explaining little understood phenomena as being of supernatural origin.  It was useful for the vast majority of humanity's existence as a self aware species in a world he understood very incompletely.  We can do better now.    I do enjoy the hell out of a show like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.|`|9d5ebdddeefc6a77bdd9da09ca8367e7aa	I do not "believe" but I can easily accept that the frame of reference for my assumptions about what is "normal" vs "para-normal" is always going to be limited by my personal capacity for understanding and the knowledge that I possess at this time. To quote Arthur C Clark;   "Any sufficiently advanced Technology is indistinguishable from magic."  In that context there is a continuum of possible worldviews between "nothing is paranormal" and "everything is magic" we are probably always going to be somewhere in the middle... because there is always more to learn.   |`|AA11525891	I no longer believe in "God" as Christians portray "him" but that doesn't mean that there are not other life forms out there or other "planes of existence". My beliefs tend toward a combination of Star Wars, Star Trek and Jonathan Livingston Seagull. As for the paranormal, I personally know people who have seen things  and I have heard things that normal science can't explain.|`|4YTNJYQDaa	No, the evidence for most supernatural/paranormal events are all pretty poor when you actually look at the evidence.   The James Randi Foundation has a $1 million prize for anyone who can show evidence of any paranormal claim under laboratory conditions. After 30 years it's still unclaimed.  Personal/anecdotal claims can never be counted as evidence as there's no way to judge the truth of those claims or wether the observer really saw what they claimed to have seen.  Coincidences are just coincidences. Even if you think they might be very improbable they often aren't. We tend to have a poor understanding of probability to start off with.  These links will give you some idea about how we often make mistakes in our thinking and come to the wrong conclusion about the supernatural:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=OKdG7yGi0K...  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=8T_jwq9ph8...  http://skeptically.org/logicalthreads/id...    Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and like religion, the supernatural/paranormal community regularly falls short in supplying it.    |`|p18BmlIxaa	No, I don't.    Some I can debunk, others I can't.  But why would I assume supernatural explanations for those I can't?  That would just be an argument from ignorance.  Just because I can't explain something doesn't mean it's magic.  Especially when natural explanations have a far better track record for being correct.    "There is quite a bit of evidence..."  Where?  And how low is your threshold as far as convincing evidence goes?  Do you just believe anyone who says "I saw a ghost", or does it need to be able to be tested, and repeated, and verified?    "There are also sequences of events that couldn't be coincidental..."  Oh?  Why couldn't they be?  Are you basing that simply off of your own incredulity, or is it literally scientifically impossible for these things to be coincidental?    Use some common sense here.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	I don't.

I do believe that people can have odd experiences that are not easily explained.  But, I don't jump to conclusions based on stories, "sensational" television and journalism or so-called eye witness accounts.  I'd need empirical evidence.  I haven't seen anything convincing.    I have had a couple of strange experiences myself with what some might call premonition. Since, I've also had strong feelings about things to come that didn't happen, I've chalked this up to coincidence.     I have a very close friend who says that she's seen apparitions of her deceased daughter.  They comfort her.  When she asked me if I thought she was crazy or whether or not those experiences were real. I suggested that she accept and enjoy the sense of peace these visions brought her.  About four months after the death of her daughter they stopped.  Maybe she finally accepted that her daughter was gone.  I don't know.    Curses, bad luck and that sort of thing is pure nonsense.Why worry about such things?  I'd rather assume that I'll have some good luck in this life.  Sometimes I do.        |`|TnquzeM5aa	Nope.

fN3dsHERaa	I totally understand your question, but I'm not sure if my answer will make sense to you.     First off, I can only speak for my views-not all atheists...   Okay, so I believe once I'm dead- I'm dead (and life after death belief can vary on atheist). That is significant because it empowers me to love life, and not take it for granted. I want to make this life all that it can be for me and others. I am a humanitarian, and just want to make this world better for everyone.   I'm sure you don't mean to do this, but just because one doesn't believe that something happens to them when they die-doesn't mean they don't value life.     *I reread your question and think this will help answer directly*:   I'm only one person in this world, so... life goes on after I'm gone..    I'm not sure if that will make sense... but I hope it does :)|`|fmlwD58iaa	I wont commit suicide  you dont either    What if the afterlife is sooooooooo  great  why dont you shorten the wait and commit suicide  but wait  please dont|`|TLLklriUaa	Well yesterday I lived to give $20 to a lady who desperately needed it and next week I will be living to donate some of my blood so that someone else can live.

Why don't they just die and go to this supposed heaven?|`|X8LNbaKQaa	You know something that is wrong.  Some atheists believe in life after death,  They just don't think gods have anything to do with it.  What you "know" is a common belief among atheists, though, so enough said.    I'm atheist, just to be clear.  I think life is a very special process and not only do I make a lot of my present reality by my choices, I alter the entire future of life on this planet by my choices (by answering your question, for instance).  But your question seems to imply that you think only of yourself and that everyone must also think only of themselves.      I can see how this mode of thought might get fixed in your mind, if you think that all you have to do is follow certain rules and you get a perfect and infinite reward and somehow you are supposed to not let the infinite suffering of other people who did not get this reward upset your perfect happiness.  This requires that you become perfectly selfish.      My lack of faith does not do that to me.  I see my life as part of an unbroken chain of life that began about 4 billion years ago, and that chain links me to every other life on this planet by a huge family tree.  How I use my life alters the entire future of that entire chain.  That view  helps me see things in a less selfish way.  I try to remind myself that I am not really a single individual, but a huge colony of asexually cloned cells.  We, all together, produce the illusion of a me, and make a mind that sees and understands more of the universe than any of my individual twin brother cells can do, alone and a body that has advantages at getting things done.  When we cease to function as an effective one, my relative cells all over the world will continue the process I have been taking part in.    I hope our little chat has helped you understand how we see these things somewhat differently.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Why do you Christians devalue life so badly?

Thats why people need to make a name for themselves, to be remembered throughout history as someone who made life better for the comming generations, as a scientist, as a war hero, as a doctor, as whatever it takes to be remembered.    How is that not a purpose? You leave your personal mark on the world, thats the goal. Thats the ancient greek philosophy, and thats the meaning you can find in an otherwise "pointless" existance.

Nothing at all matters because you're dead. Then what do you live for?"    Perhaps nothing. But that's not a reason to believe in God.    To say this:  "I believe in God because without God, life would have no meaning and that would be terrible"    ...makes as much sense as saying this:  "I believe that our present economy is OK, because if it weren't, then a lot of people would be out of work and that would be terrible."

If there is an afterlife, surely it cannot just be to extend these temporary games for ever? At some level - maybe a very, very deep level, Judas was cooperating with Jesus.

Although Judas felt distraught for his betrayal to Messiah, he committed suicide instead of asking Yeshua for forgiveness.      When we have done something sinful, we shouldn't commit suicide, but ask the LORD for His forgiveness.    EDIT: Yes, Messiah did ask for Judas to become one of His disciples, but remember the Scripture "For many are called, but few are chosen" (Matthew 22:14).   We all may get called, but that doesn't mean that we will have what it takes to be chosen.

This is supposedly the one unforgivable sin since you have no time to repent or ask forgivness once you have committed this sin because if you are successful, you are dead.    On the other hand you might think that he was instantly forgiven because of all the people in the world he was chosen to perform this heinous but most necessary task and forgiveness is his reward for doing the unthinkable that simply had to be done for the good of us all.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	As I understand this verse Judas went to his own place which is Hell as the Devil was in him.

Because we belong to the Almighty God and He does have a place for us to go.    Now, that place could be heavenly or a lake filled with fire, the choice is up to us.    Be Blessed:-)|`|AA10191817	You could probably write an award winning PhD thesis along these lines.      Quantum physicists tell us there are more dimensions than the ones we can observe.  They exist, but we can never experience them because our faculties cannot observe them.  Something rowing in those other dimensions could never be perceived by us.     Or how about bats?  If they sing Row, Row, Row your boat you will never hear it--because they emit frequencies beyond our ability to hear  But the song is nonetheless real in the existential sense.  It is just beyond your senses, so it is not real to you.    When we realize that what we know and experience is less than a drop in the sea upon which we dip our oar, we are humbled.  And when we stop trying to prove or understand God and existence but instead seek to listen to God, we draw as near to ultimate truth as we can on this earth.

"The lyrics have often been used as a metaphor for life's difficult choices, and many see the boat as referring to one's self or a group with which one identifies.[1] Rowing is a skillful, if tedious, practice that takes perfection but also directs the vessel.[2] When sung as a group, the act of rowing becomes a unifier, as oars must be in sync in a rowboat. The idea that man travels along a certain stream, suggests boundaries in the path of choices and in free will.[3] The third line recommends that challenges should be greeted in stride while open to joy with a smile.[4] The final line, life is but a dream, is perhaps the most meaningful. With a religious point of view, life and the physical plane may be regarded as having equivalent value as that of a dream, such that troubles are seen in the context of a lesser reality once one has awakened.[5] Conversely, the line can just as equally convey nihilist sentiments on the meaninglessness of man's actions. The line is also commonly sung as "life is like a dream" rather than "life is but a dream", possibly to sound happier, less meaningful, and more appropriate for its audience of young children"

It is not biblical and is a man made scare doctrine.    Did Almighty God create such a place of torment? Well, what was Gods view when the Israelites, following the example of peoples who lived nearby, began to burn their children in fire? He explains in his Word: They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.Jeremiah 7:31.    Think about this. If the idea of roasting people in fire had never come into Gods heart, does it seem reasonable that he created a fiery hell for those who do not serve him? The Bible says, God is love. (1?John 4:8) Would a loving God really torment people forever?  No!    ***If the rich man were in a literal fire, surely Lazarus could not benefit him with just a drop of water.  Besides, it would evaporate before it even hit his tongue if there was so much fire.  It was a parable, a story, to learn a lesson from.    The rich man pictured the self-important religious leaders who failed to feed the people spiritually, and Lazarus pictured the common people who accepted Jesus Christ. Their deaths represented a change in their condition.    This change, or death to the former condition of the rich man and of Lazarus, occurred when Jesus fed the neglected Lazaruslike people spiritually. Thus, they came into the favor of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God. At the same time, the self-important Jewish religious leaders died with respect to having Gods favor and came to be tormented by the teachings of Christ and his followers. For example, when Stephen publicly exposed them, they felt cut to their hearts and began to gnash their teeth .?.?. and put their hands over their ears. They felt torment.Acts 7:51-57.    So rather than teaching a fiery-hell torment after death, Jesus story describes the change of condition that his teachings accomplished among two classes of people.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Yes the Christian God does do that....

Similarly for the women in these hetero relationships. It would seem normal that there is a difference in personalities, and perhaps this is what is looked for in a partner, not someone who is the same, but who has different characteristics to yourself, with whom you can make one complete, wider personality.   The same is true homosexual relationships, perhaps. So you see a difference in characteristics, as the individuals seek out traits that they lack, in order to complete themselves, as it were.
AA11634352	Hmm, funny.  I've never hear that one.  I've heard it's best to learn arabic to get the full meaning, but not that it's wrong to translate.

The Qur'an is the most translated book ever written, Islam has spread all over the world, I have heard that many Spanish speaking reverts now have the Noble Qur'an in Spanish.  The Qur'an was revealed in Arabic for a reason; it is one of the most advanced languages known to man. Also when you hear the Qur'an being recited in Arabic it is most beautiful and you will feel humbled.  To not know the meaning of what is in the Qur'an is pointless, it is not the Bible where you will here ppl say "if you dont understand it then you are not meant to". Islam is a Faith of Knowledge.

c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	While I *do* have friends "in real life", I do find it jarring that a bunch of people I haven't seen in 15 years are adding me to Facebook.    Just remember, adding someone to Facebook doesn't mean you're obligated to spend time with them in person and entertain them.  Use Facebook as a way to ease back into socializing again.  Socialize via email/Facebook chat, and when you're ready, meet up in person.  Maybe have a group get-together at a place where everyone will feel more social.  Just because 30 people reconnected with you doesn't mean you have to spend time with them right away.    It's not healthy to go without any friends.  You may do yourself more harm than good doing that.
d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Hmm I'm not a doctor but coming out can be difficult and create some anxiety and panic. My wife who's a mtf had severe anxiety/panic disorder for about 1 year before she came out to family and still had it on and off until she was comfortable with herself, about 9 months after coming out to us.    Therapy will really help you discover the inner working of why you have panic disorder. It could be the stress of coming out and the worries of coming out both piling onto you. You also are going to need to learn to relax. It sounds like you might have a touch of anxiety as well which can fuel a panic disorder, but that's for therapy to decide. Either way, you do need to learn not to stress so much. Life will be stressful and I understand therapy is a great way to get the help to be less stressed and worried.|`|y4uoDjV0aa	I have no idea... are you in a relationship? Maybe that would help? You sound kinda like your life feels purposeless. A person can do good at fixing that.|`|a3OCK2iraa	First off calm down. I know that life can be hard. I went to a psychiatrist for 5 years. You need to Relax. Being gay isn't a problem. It is who you are and you are the same wonderful person, as you were before everyone knew. You are so lucky also, to have told your family adn for them to be okay with it. You sound like a nice person so be yourself. Oh and about having crushes on straight girls. Join the club. I have like 3 crushes and they are all uber straight. They are just so damn attractive. Anyway, life sounds good, Think about that and how there is always an alternative to suicide. SUICIDE IS NEVER THE RIGHT CHOICE. There is so much more for you to live for, to accomplish. There are people in your life that love you more than anything. Someone out there is the love of your life, I don't know when you will find that person, but you will. The same goes for almost everyone. You wait all of your life to find that one person. I believe in that and that is what helps me. You are in college, you have SO much more. You will do well, those people who are concerned with how the present effects the future do well.

XEbrGfZuaa	There are services for this sort of thing as I have a helper come in  twice a week, to help with whatever I need. She's only here for a   few hours each time, but she's paid to drive me anywhere in town,  and as long as she's done within her time frame, that's fine. She also  does housework, and can help with other things she'd like to help  with. Mostly they leave it up to the helper. Some are willing to go the  extra mile and some go straight by the rules. I got my help through  the aging/services division of Social Services. And I had to qualify  by being under their income allotment. Essentially, if you are low  income, you qualify. It makes no sense to me, why the free service  is based on your income. It should be placed on need. Especially  where Senior Citizens are concerned and are lower incomes. But  that's the rule now. She is indespensible. I couldn't do without her help. So she pitch hits with whatever I need her to do. Like laundry,  washing dishes, vacuuming or mopping and heavier things than that.  I've got her for the rest of the year, and I plan to enjoy her help while  I can 'still afford to'.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes.  It frees up your friend, and gives Mom someone to rely on.

You get so caught up in caring for them and running them around, and doing things that you just arent motivated and too darn tired to spend any quality time with them. Not that I would have expected any quality time with my mother, but who knows?     I could use a buddy too, one who can hold their liquor and go out to a pub without getting drunk and making a spectacle of themselves, the friend I used to go out with has decided to become a real lush, and has actually fallen on her face in the middle of the pub.     Someone to go to the art gallery with, a coffee shop, for a walk, someone to help and motivate me to get the kitchen cabinets painted seeing as I will probably be forced to live with them for long time.      Maybe a buddy who could build some bottom cabinets and move a sink?  Heck I'll do all the painting !    Still its sad to think you have to pay someone to spend time with you, not the mother,  ME !      I used to tease my son that I had to pay his friends to play with him, lol.

6kvKi6Sfaa	Right, lets find a behaviour pattern from the early years. In high school, with the weight problem and not having friends, youve had low self-esteem.     In getting hooked to wrestling you were then noticed for the right reasons. Your self-esteem raised and you were motivated to continue especially because it got you popularity that you missed having before. The arm accident was a setback but you managed to recover behaving maturely, and as you say using your time wisely.     Then you got overconfident, and decided to relax. But that doesnt work with sportspersons, does it? Training is crucial. Every time you stopped working out, your body lost condition. You get back to it, and you start winning again.     But theres another aspect you needed to be aware of.  All wins belong in the past; every new bout brings new challenges you have to face. You need to work harder than before to improve skills and stay a step ahead.     The public attention may have contributed to the arrogance. Because you were winning consistently, perhaps you felt you just couldnt lose, though your skill-set remained at the same predictable level. Your opponents however, have been studying your winning moves and devising steps to counter them and you were defeated.      That shouldnt have been a surprise, but you were killed. Your self-esteem hit nosedive when you couldnt go to state, and you were back to square one - where you started from, with the weight problem, no friends and low self-esteem.     Lets now go to the next part

And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.    A lot of the Greek is like that. You have to go by the context in most cases. An angel is not an "it" because an angel is a divine being. Since the Bible never has any female angels the translators choose to identiry the angel as a male since the Greek words allow for that and the context doesn't contraidict or indicate otherwise.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Rev 10:9  And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.

I'm taking things easy I don't know what to believe so just chill and live it up, If is real then you at least had a good run :)     That's what I think|`|e6KiyrFSaa	Well, here's a little background that I heard: There's guy who claimed to be a psychic and have predicted numerous predictions that came true, or so he claimed. I don't remember his name. And he predicted that the world will come to an end in the year 2012. Based on his previous predictions that he said came true (can't think of one right now), many believed that this one will come true also!    I found this funny because the world will ends sooner or later. There are so many things out there that can destroy the whole planet by this weekend, why wait until 2012 ? Like a worldwide tsunami, nuclear weapons, oh..so many other things just can't think of one on top of my head.

JXH8SDqOaa	There are about as many kinds of love as there are people or animals you love. I'm not including here any feeling people may have for inanimate objects, because that's not true love.     I think you can only love something or someone who can express some kind of feeling back, even if it's only friendship. If you love someone who feels nothing for you (like a celebrity) that's more like a crush, or admiration, not true love.|`|srIv25b9aa	there are different ways to love someone.    but love is love.|`|N26qrTd3aa	There are different types of love. There is the love that comes with lust, there is the love the way 'I love that shirt' and there is the love you have for family. but personally I think there is only one true kind of love.    Real love ha nothing to do with who the person is. Real love is knowing that you would protect the person.. or animal even, with your life. Knowing that whatever penalty would come from doing something to protect the one you love would be worth it; it or be killed. That is the deepest and truest form of love.|`|TF6Tk3vHaa	There are many types of love...  1. Puppy love  2. Crush  3. Mutual love  4. Love for God   5. Love for your family  6. Love for a friend  7.

a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	he was the chosen one ...    Christ even TOLD him he would do it.    John 13:26 -- "Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped [it]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon."    AND -- Luke 22:3 says -- "Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve."    all of you who say Judas Iscariot made his own choice, and that he did it out of "free will," are simply wrong.    do you believe everything your preachers tell you???|`|2Hot9EJiaa	If he had come to God and asked for forgiveness he would not have been damned.

If the Bible is true, then God has predestined who is going to hell. He already knows, when a child is born, that he's not going to let them into heaven, just because they haven't been brought up in Christianity, or they simply don't believe in him.    More than a little unfair, actually.|`|VqA8HDbCaa	We all have free will,besides he betrayed Jesus.I bet he felt like the lowest scum of the earth,yet he didn't tell the devil he was a liar the time satan entered in to him.He knew better he was a disciple.So was it unfair?No!   if it wasn't him someone else would have.It had to happen.Jesus died for our sins,if it wasn't for him most of us wouldn't stand a chance.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Jesus said to Peter  concerning Judas (If i will that he remain till i come what is that to you? You follow me) we do not know his fate and Jesus dose not want us to be concerned about it.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	Your question is based upon a faulty premise. You would first have to demonstrate that Judas as destined to damnation from the very beginning, before expecting anyone to debate the fairness of it.    Judas was not destined to damnation.    Suppose you were in a helicopter flying over a dangerous mountain road. You see a sports car driving recklessly around the bends in the road as it went around the mountain, passing cars when it was  unsafe to pass.    Then, as the driver darts into the lane of opposing traffic to pass a long string of cars, you notice a big semi truck coming the other way. The driver of the sports car cannot see the truck because it is just around the corner. It is too late for this car to get in behind the cars he passed before the truck hits him.    You KNOW a very ugly accident is about to happen. You have a very unique vantage point. You see the big picture, where everyone else on the road sees only a part of the picture.    You KNOW without any doubt an accident WILL HAPPEN.     Now, did YOU CAUSE the accident to happen because you foreknew it would happen? Did your foreknowledge remove the driver's choice as to how to drive?    No?! Well, neither did the prophecy about Judas betraying Jesus cause him to betray Jesus.    Judas betrayed Jesus because of his free choice, and foreknowledge (not coercion) was why it was prophesied. Judas did not betray Jesus because of the prophecy, but rather because of his personal free choice in the matter.

We kissed once and then, she disappeared. I thought of letting go of my feelings(I actually did) but when she showed up again, I exposed  them to her but she didn't say a thing and I haven't seen her since last Sunday when we both were at a common friend's b-day party.

AA11910766	Quoted from Wikipedia:  The Five Pillars of Islam    In summary, the practices are (in order of priority):        * The Testimony of Faith (Shahadah) - the declaration that there is none worthy of worship except Allah (Arabic:God) and that Muhammad is His last messenger.      * Ritual Prayer (Salat) - establishing of the five daily Prayers.      * Obligatory (religious) almsgiving (Zakat) - which is generally 2.5% of the total savings for a rich man working in trade or industry, and 10% or 20% of the annual produce for agriculturists. This money or produce is distributed among the poor.      * Siyam, Fasting      * The Pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) - this is done during the month of Zul Hijjah, and is compulsory once in a lifetime for one who has the ability to do it. If the Muslim is in ill health or in debt, he or she is not required to perform Hajj. They do this to show moral importance to Allah, and to join the Ummah (family of Islam)    Note that the Shi'a branch Amr Bil Maruf and Nahi Anil Munkar (Enjoining the Good and Forbidding the Evil) is also commanded in Sunni Islam but not at the level of The Five Pillars of Islam.  END QUOTE    Hope this helps.|`|8030d9741d95825e828f94b2efa331a2aa	the only one that is missing in your list is the first one  which is the Shahada which is testifying that "There is no God but God and Muhammad is his messenger"    God bless
34hKn54iaa	To my personal belief, there are many. But most will beg to differ. But I will give you one example. If you have ever heard of vishnu, he has one last avatar coming. He will be in the form of kalki. Destroyer of filth. Or he is filth himself. Meaning, for all people know he is already here but few dare to recognise. Like a homeless man laying on the street. What most would consider a bum or filth, I consider to be kalki. It is said he will decend on the earth when the last devotee is/was no more. To me, that was the prophet muhammad(pbuh) because he is the last of the prophets. It is said that kalki will come and destroy with the wrath of nature at the end of this era of kali yoga we are in now. His avatar has him riding a white horse brandishing a comet like sword. There are many similarites, but is considered blasphemous. But vey much relevant. The only reason I even care to learn about this is because I am half chinese and am islamic. Convert. So no man can tell me what is and what is not. ONLY ALLAH. Minus his intecessors.    Anyways, that is just one similarity. But you really don't want to know what I really believe. And btw, to the misconception of most, hindus do have ONE GOD that is sovereign. Even though they are polytheistic, they essentially have one true GOD. He is called brahman. Beyond gender is just one of the characteristics. Impermeable. But from that comes many gods. Even original man that is defined as purushna(I think I spelled that incorrectly).    Just like any other GOD, brahman later got added on and is no longer seen sovereign by most. Just like jehova(is now a trinity). There are many similarities, but is considered blasphemous. But I still take no lord but allah. La ilaha ilallah.    *another bonus one:)  On the day of resurection allah will adress mankind, "I AM TRUE KING. Who are the kings of earth?". I for one can not stand for that one. But people like Rama are. I accept they sit amongst each others as great kings. From nimrod(pbuh) to david(pbuh) to solomon(pbuh) to Rama. Just a thought. Rama is one of the most beloved avatars of vishnu in hinduism. The difference is I stand for what I believe in and that is what makes me a martyre. The very essence that makes me a martyre is my heart. But I still take no lord but allah. PEACE!

If you had you would know that Mexicans are very aware of their mixed culture and also aware that they have not really figured out what being a Mexican really means.     You want to classify Mexicans strictly on the basis of the language ability and some physical characteristics. That's OK if you are not ever going to learn the real truth. Just go along in ignorance. Never go to Mexico and see both the great influence of the Spanish on their culture and the similar influence of the indigenous people of Mexico, who were there long before a Spaniard ever set foot on the continent     I do wonder what is your beef?  I am a gringo and don't have your attitude even if I do not want large numbers of Mexican citizens crossing our borders illegally.

First of all every Latin person is not Mexican. Secondly my wonderful boyfriend is Salvadoran and most of my friends are Latin and they DO NOT consider themselves Spanish or European. In fact they find it very insulting to be classified as European, Spanish, White, or Caucasian because they take great PRIDE in their Native American heritage. Furthermore if they are not Mexican and are, for instance, Honduran  or Guatemalan, they take offense to being called Mexican. Therefore you should practice saying Latin or Hispanic.|`|ULnmLYqraa	GOOD GRIEF!!!!|`|d6862c29fc47975db4517680a8763707aa	I am 6'2", 195 lbs, and have light tan.

I have been to Spain there is some short dark-skinned Spaniards. Learn your English, before you judge formats.

This doesn't mean that everyone who tells you that you are following Satan also thinks you wear black robes and dances naked in the middle of pentagrams while drinking sacrificial blood... but it simply means that to deny Christ is to follow something other than Christ which is, once again,  Anti-Christ, which in the end = Satan.    Though I will admit that some Christ-ians may not even analyze it to that extent and may simply misunderstand atheism as it is defined by atheists themselves.|`|AA11479750	I had a low opinion of atheists, even though I also disliked fundies, until last August.

Add to that is the fact that  most of us never meet or actually converse with an atheist.  I believe that most people would be pleasantly surprised at your intelligence, common sense, and compassion.  It does not take a belief in God to make a kind and decent human being.

There is no discrepancy here.  Since all people are descended from Noah's family, and all of Noah's family is descended from Adam and Eve, then all people are descended from Adam and Eve.    "u mean millions of innocent childs back then are super malevolent too!?"  Maybe they weren't when they died, but perhaps God knew what they were likely to become when they grew up.  If Noah and his family were truly the only people that God felt were worth saving, then it would appear that none of the other parents were bringing up their children right.

Prsenter le fait de la prfrence sexuelle en termes de "choix" ou d' "inn" est pathtique.  tout cela rsulte d'une ducation, et comme dans toute ducation, il y a des ratages... La culture dominante voudrait que nous soyons tous de bons htros, dommage pour elle.    Les deux (inn ou choix) exonrent la culture occidentale judo-chrtienne et homophobe de ce qu'elle ne veut pas voir: que c'est bien en son sein que grandissent les futurs "homosexuels" comme les htros. Autrement dit, que la prfrence sexuelle est un "acquis" culturel.  Ceci dit, qu'il se trouve des gays aussi cons que la culture dominante n'a donc rien de surprenant non plus.    ajout    eh bien j'ajouterai  cela que les identits sexuelles, les catgories masculin/fminin sont aussi des constructions sociales et non des "donnes de dpart". Autrement dit, le genre masculin est un concept, le genre fminin aussi, et ils n'ont qu'un rapport trs grossier avec la ralit des tres humains, qui ne se rsume pas  deux cases simples  dfinir. Seulement, nous sommes tous assigns  appartenir  l'un ou l'autre genre. Et  nous dbrouiller ensuite avec.     Et que deux enfants levs dans le mme contexte/milieu ne vivent pas pour autant les mmes expriences au mme moment, ne se confrontent pas de manire identique  la culture dominante. Bref, dans l'ducation, il y a au moins trois termes: le contexte, celui qui re?oit cette ducation, et la relation entre les deux. (je parle bien entendu d'ducation au sens large)  Ils ne sont en effet pas non plus identiques  la naissance, mais pour en conclure qu'il y a peut-tre un "gne de l'homosexualit" il faut tre un gnticien trs peu regardant - et c'est peu dire - sur le genre de "recherche" qui va lui assurer du boulot.|`|AA11452268	S'il n'est pas question d'un gne de l'homosexualit, il y a quand mme des diffrences physiques entres les htrosexuels et les homosexuels, et plusieurs de ces diffrences sont le rsultat des niveaux des hormones  dans l'utrus avant la naissance. Par exemple, la direction de croissance des cheveux des homosexuals est l'envers de celle des htrosexuels, et la longueur des doigts est diffrente aussi. Donc, l'homosexualit est ine, sinon gntique.

J has the blade of the tonge behind the alveolar ridge, and the body of the tongue raised toward the roof of the mouth. Zh has the blade of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth.  To me (an English speaker), they both sound like English j.
PVMsr2Faaa	When I drive down the street, can you back off a little so I can watch the front and not my rear view mirror. Especially on snowy, rainy and icy roads. Thanks, I needed that too.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	When someone behind me gets waited on first I ALWAYS speak up and say "Excuse me; I believe I was here first..." That usually does the trick; why should you wait when it's your turn? Makes no sense.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	can i vent too!       1) When I stop to let someone cross the street it would be NICE to get a 'thank you' wave back.    for real!  or holding a door for someone i mean respect courtousy what ever it's due!     2) People need to stop walking in the MIDDLE of the road after a snow storm and expect "me" to move! -- really don't get it!     3) People need to scrape the snow off the tops of their cars as well! -- i think people need to give enought space between other cars infront of them there for if some one didn't fully clean of the car it wouldn't matter because there is enought space for it to fall off with out hitting another car!     4) When you shake my hand for the first time it would be NICE for women to put some MUSCLE into it. (Im a woman too).  I concur don't be all danty about i won't call you a man!  but be into it geesh1     5) Look at me in the eye when you meet me for the first time and shake my hand. How about just look me in the eye for everything at all times within our relationship!  there is no point to not look me in the eye and i deserve that respect! so you do dang it!     6) When I'm next in line (i.e. at a CVS) the workers should learn to wait on me next and not skip me to wait on the person next to me (who should be behind me) so FRUSTRATING. What that's BS      7) When people cross the street in front of me they CAN WALK A LITTLE FASTER, rather than SLOW and STARE.    aww that's sort of selfish i would  just walk around!|`|255e885933edd3eb652c81efdcf5a1daaa	I totally agree!    LOL, I drive a truck...I can't reach the snow on top of my truck.  But it usually flies into the bed anywhoo.    Vent away!|`|WVo49wn3aa	Preach it!|`|DgIQFPxiaa	Learn to cope with stress.

It doesn't snow here but if it did I could vent, however here we have dumb people who don't know how to drive in the rain. When it rains they all start freaking out and going SUPER SUPER slow. Geez it's just rain ya know?!? And I hate jerks who stand next to you at a line, I always kinda nugde in to them and then when I touch them I turn around and say oh excuse you. Sorry about that. MUAH AHAHAHA Stupid people!|`|w5qssNpaaa	People are ignorant. Things started going to hell at least 35 years ago.|`|e4a70e2e864a55d7cf74bfe7c41c8264aa	I totally agree! Especially with  4! My boyfriend and I were talking about that the other day. I told him I cannot STAND it when someone reaches out to shake my hand and they just lightly grip it as if I'm a delicate little doll or something. Come on! Grip my hand like you mean it! Act like you're actually pleased to meet me! He says a gentleman should always shake a lady's hand like that. I'm all for lady/gentleman rules (gotta love opening doors and such!) and etiquette, but this is just one of those rules I'm not into. As for the snow stuff, I live in Georgia so I don't know what that's like, LOL!|`|jsxphZJEaa	1) Pedestrians have the right of way, so you legally have to stop to let them cross.....and yes a thank you wave would be nice, but it is not necessary.....    2) SO people are in the middle of the road, come on ....move...why are you so angry ......maybe you should not be driving    3) Who says you need to wipe snow off top of car...many people don't - while I agree it would be concentious, it is not necessary or required, it will blow off.....    4) Yes, learn to shake hands properly, not be limp fish handshaker.  5) and yes, look the person in the eye when you shake their hand not only the first time meet but always, it is polite and respect (things far too many people know little about and care less about)    6) Workers generally take the next in line, not to the side, most people would wave you ahead. If you have an issue next time ask to speak to the manager and try to be polite when you explain situation....you seem ready to explode over nothing.....    7) People can walk any speed that is comfortable to them....they do not have to rush because you are there.  Leave in bit more time if you get so frustrated......maybe they stare because of the look you are providing to them...    Ok you vented and so did I......However, I urge you to stop and smell the roses, take a good hard look at yourself and turn your frowns upside down. Too many people waste time being angry and frustrated over things that have minimal effect in society.....like your rants......Take up yoga or meditation to release your anger or get professional assistance.|`|yXi3M5A3aa	Actually pedestrians (people) have the right of way when they are crossing the street, vehicles must stop or slow down to let people cross. How would you like it if you were walking across a street and you had the right of way and some person in a car decided that they didn't want to wait for you to cross the street all the way and they just kept driving because they were impatient and hit you with their vehicle?    I was ran over by a car when I was crossing the street and yes I had the right of way at the time, the traffic light camera taped everything so I had proof that I was crossing when I had the right of way. I sued her for running me over and I won. She had to pay all of my medical bills.    Thankfully she didn't kill me.|`|lhQXEf1maa	nice, i like it. i have experienced everything on that list haha
9kcRkFt7aa	I am amazed at the degree of censure that some people are practising in this question.    Surely all views are welcome. Free speech and all. Precisely what each of us is enjoying.    However, to the heart of the question.  If we are sticking to the christian position:  1. The child's future and the complexities arising from its birth, may or may not be seen as a blessing, the issue is subjective.  2. The morality of the 'pre-marital' coupling has been judged differently at different times in terms of biblical chronology.  So, for sake of the Christian context let's consider:    Adam and Eve. Married?  Cain, his brother Abel; married? (not forgetting the tricky question of who exactly mothered their children)  Moving on:Isaac takes Rebecca as his 'wife', an exchange of gifts or goods are traded..ceremony? (interesting definition of marriage?)  Further, Jesus' views, as far as recorded transcripts can tell. When questioned about divorce he is quoted as saying that "..a man will leave his father and mother and join with his 'wife' and the two will become on... A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman, commits adultery against his 'wife'" Thus implying that it was the 'joining' that made them 'man and wife' not the multiple ceremonies.  3. Marriage may have legal advantages and/or financial ones too, for some; but it was always a pragmatic legal arrangement and shouldn't be confused with who is or isn't 'joined' 'before God,' which, it seems, is more complex than might superficially be suggested by any number of ceremonies.    So, 'sinners' or not, perhaps Jesus' other judgement on marital fidelity might be applied here, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."    We're non of us so very 'righteous' after all; and christians aren't supposed to judge others according to the law without accepting similar judgement from God.    A little humility and compassion seems more helpful.|`|AA11272456	Children result naturally from sexual intimacy.  If we were to follow this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion - that God blesses the sexual behavior of two sinners with a child - we should have to conclude that God blesses the rape of a woman with a child.  Women who are raped oftentimes end up pregnant.  We do not believe that God blessed the rapist - the sinner, do we?      God is also the giver of the gift of sexual intimacy and it is He who determines how humans should use it.      Hannah J Paul|`|cIPziIdnaa	A rape victim, an incest victim - can have a perfectly healthy baby - would that be a blessing?  A devout Christian couple could have an autistic child, a still-born child; a child that dies from SIDS.  "It rains on the just and the unjust" and this life isn't fair.  Some times good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people.  Why, why, why?  We would drive ourselves mad trying to justify all the injustices of this life.    But that is fine with me.  This world is not my home and I am not looking for justice in this world but in the world to come.  I know He has prepared a place for me in a world with no tears, no pain, no suffering; a world where bad things never happen to good people and where all things will finally be made right.    I hope to see you there!!|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Children are a blessing from God...........this is true.  The Lord allows it to rain on the just & on the unjust so..........unmarried people have children too.    It doesn't mean they're saved.    Whether or not they have children is not the issue..........getting saved is the real issue. God is more concerned with a person's eternal soul.|`|AA11769363	premarital sex is not a sin|`|AA10301962	It is the two peoples choice to have sex before marriage, the woman gets pregnant, God gives us all a mind to think with and if the woman gets pregnant, it is not Gods fault. What do you think He gave us choices for? So in other words, every couple who has premarital sex and the woman ends up pregnant, you want to blame this on God?The couple know full well, that having sex can lead to disease or pregnancy! And that premarital sex is wrong! Stop blaming God for the sins of man!|`|AA12346961	God doesn't care.  He just doesn't care.    :Signed Eris, the Goddess of chaos    God's on vacation.

I do however don't agree with it for the simple fact that I (my opinion) don't think sleeping with many different people is right due to diseases and pregnancy without a family unit/value.    I have old fashioned views on this topic, but not due to religion.|`|LQokjIAhaa	Because of Natural Law.  S*x makes babies.  That's the way God set it up.

It's a bodily function and it will happen with any fertile person.     God has nothing to do with it.|`|qzCpCQbYaa	Sinners begat sinners.  Be fruitful and multiply|`|ARUinuP7aa	First of all premarital sex is not a sin if both agreed to get married soon.     I believe sex is a gift of God to us. It is the highest physical expression of our love to our sweetheart.    It become a sin only if not used in a right way.    Now  you  may ask if the two have really no intention to get married but just to play around. Of course it is a sin.     Then why did God still bless them with a child? It is God's law of reproduction.

YPfokQkmaa	Oh sweety, even at your age I had these feelings for a male teacher.  I think at some point in our lives, we start having affections for our teachers because they are friendly and helpful, and we often make mistakes, and they correct us...that respect flourishes and creates feelings which we never expected to have.  Since I experienced it, I can say it s very difficult...even I tried to get his attention, but I was a hard worker in his subjects, was punctual and respectful....he noticed me, but at the same time, I did something really stupid and then he started to dislike me.  However, he was kind during the last days...and so, still I had those feelings for him.  But the fact I later realized in my life is that I spent too much of my precious time thinking about him, while I could have accomplished a lot of better things.  I think having feelings for a teacher is somewhat helpful if you make the right use of it, like I did...I was a jerk in math, and after I had these feelings for this teacher, whoops! I was the top student in math!    So, what I am saying is, this teacher of yours is probably straight just like mine is...and you are 15, so I doubt she'd be interested in you (not that you're bad but there's an age difference) and even if your teacher wanted to have an affair with you, she'd end up in jail and she won't be able to teach...it'd ruin her career, and I'm sure you wouldn't want that if you love her.    I was told to move on and forget him, and that time it seemed impossible, but yes..I did get over him. But since he was my first, he'll always have a soft corner in my heart, but that's all about it.  I'm sure there is someone out there for you.    I don't want to be discouraging, but it will  take time till you get over her fully.    Just treat her with respect and don't try to get her attention, because she probably thinks you are an attention seeker.  She might not hate you, perhaps she's just avoiding you because she knows that you behave kinda strange...and most teachers know that students might have crushes on them, because they were students too!    So, cheer up and try to do something else instead of thinking about her.  I'm sure you'll be alright.    And don't skip classes or exams...or you'd be ruining your career.    Email me at i_luv_mdsl@y7mail.com if you want to talk.    Good Luck and     XxPenguin HugsxX|`|6mEtaO0eaa	i think u need to move on...|`|AA10045246	well since you are a 15yr old girl she might not suspect you fancy her .. if you were male then maybe that might cross her mind  stop worrying and DONT act on impulse to get with her. it would be embaressing for you n her plus she might lose her job|`|oTCRxcCSaa	wow  this is quite tricky  you shouldn't skip exams  these are there to make you suceed in life  and you shouldn't skip class  these are what make the exams easy  the only thing you can do is forget about this teacher  get back on track with your school work  if your missing classes you'll gave alot of work to catch up on so you wont even think about this teacher.    good luck|`|TF0FUqlEaa	i think you were pretty disrespectful to her as a teacher.  she is a teacher and you are a student so you need to let this one go and move on.     you should also apologize for the way you acted in her class too.  it's her job to motivate students and to teach them. you made her job very difficult.|`|ET4kKLJSaa	just be yourself and don't try to do dumb things. she doesn't hate you but she might not like you as much as other kids.... but if you act normal and start helping her then that maybe a great improvement to being able to tell her your feelings. don't try just be yourself.  (so i sort of fell in love with this teacher?)  idk if your dream will ever come to a good ending because of the gap of age .... sorry hoped i helped|`|Fkb2ofrTaa	You need to try not to become attached to her. She's probably not gay and anyway she would get in sooo much trouble if she started a relationship with you.    Hard though it is you need to stay away.|`|YFOpZ0haaa	It will never work...she doesn't like you how you like her. And she is embarrassed that she doesn't, that's why she is avoiding you.|`|G59YE87Haa	this is wrong you should try to go for someone else your own age|`|AA10660273	Honestly, even if she is gay (which chances are, she's not)  At this point in your life you need to try to get over these feelings you're having.  You're too young for her right now and if anything was to happen between you while you're still at school she would be professionally crucified, putting her career, reputation and livlihood in tatters. Would you really want that to happen?  How do you think she would feel towards you if that did happen?  You have had a crush on this woman for 4 years now, you were still just a kid when you started having these feelings, But you're 15 now, you're becoming an adult and you need to start behaving like one. Only then can you earn her respect.    I doubt she hates you, you've been behaving like a stroppy and immature teenager by turning up late for class/skipping exams/saying OMGOMGOMG when she speaks to you etc etc   I would imagine that she sees you as a troublesome student and she may well be aware of the crush you have for her, so for her sake and yours she does her best to steer clear of you, which is exactly what she should be doing.    I'm sure you're not the only student that has a crush on her and she has to do everything she can to protect her integrity.  So please stop behaving like a child around her, earn her respect by showing you can behave like an adult. And if you can't control yourself in her presence, then stay away from her.  I suggest that when you leave school, if you still have feelings for her then, you write her a letter/email apologising for the way you behaved over the years, explain that you were having feelings for her you didn't know how to handle properly and that was why you behaved that way. End the letter/email by telling her that you still have the feelings for her, and that IF she's interested in meeting with you now that you are no longer a student at the school you would love for that to happen, but you MUST say that you understand if she doesn't want to meet with you.  Remember, she's an adult with her own life, she probably already has a partner of some kind. You must respect her choices.  Good luck dealing with your emotions.|`|6vsSSXvfaa	Im kinda in the same situation as you....    But im 24 and a manager at work, she  is 36, and i  fanci her soo soo much and i do the whod omgomgomg and i turn red when she talkes to me...  but recently she has been what feels like ignoring me...    My advice would be just leave it as a fantasy as nothing will ever probably happen...  just let it live wildly in your head and your dreams...   dont worry what she thinks cos unless your are really lucky and by small small chance and i mean small...  nothing will come of it..|`|p42fvSx4aa	Try to get over her, shes most likely not gay and there is a big age difference between you two. If she did go out with you she would get in lodes of trouble and you need to go to your lessons and exams and do well in school!|`|1TT9oiO0aa	I had a crush on a teacher too and the best thing you can do is focus your attention on someone else.     I know right now it feels like you will never get over her, but you WILL. You're 15 - the chances of her fancying you back are VERY slim. You could become really good friends with this teacher if you just do your work and behave well at school - you'll soon earn and gain her respect even if she's not teaching you. Word gets around about good pupils - nobody likes annoying students who skip exams, turn up lessons late. Push all that under the carpet and concentrate on starting afresh.     Your crush on this woman won't last forever. She might be gorgeous, funny, lovely...but so are millions of other women! I always think as well that the person you end up loving for the rest of your life is the one where BOTH of you feel a connection. Then you'll know they're "The One"!     Go out with your friends, find a crush on another girl, work really hard at school and these feelings will become weaker and weaker until they're literally no longer there.  Good luck.|`|dZuU8AuOaa	if you see her into the corridor ask her if theres a chance you could take exams again and just make it like you respect her more. maybe shes avoidin you coz she likes you and can't afford to loose her job oveer going out with a student.|`|iSNtznE3aa	First of all, a word of advice for the future: these might make her pay attention to you, but it's negative attention. Is that what you want? And not going to exams will make you fail.    She might not know you like her, but more likely than not she feels uncomfortable around you and/or dislikes you. I think it is in your best interest to stay away from her. You would both get in a lot of trouble over the 10 year age difference even if she did like you. Also, I don't think you're in love, I think you're just crushing on her, which means your feelings should fade when you don't see her for a little while.    Hope this helps!|`|m9LNP93jaa	Well, I suspect that she does not see you as a person on equal standing but as a slacker student. To her, missing class and exams shows her that you are not invested in the class so she will treat you like wise and spend less time on you. If you want a teachers attention, show them that you are invested in their class.   As for making you attraction less obvious, umm, try composure excersizes. Think of other women that you find attractive and try to not physically see her. That might help. At the very least, you should get over your attraction once you leave that school.|`|Cy3V2Tmaaa	i actually have done the same  thing as u, so when i read it, it was like a flashback of a part of my life.im not in love with my teacher anymore...anyway, she moved away, so it wouldnt have mattered...i was really depressed, but there is nothing u can do, as i learned, u can never have them until ur 18 anyway, and 95% chance she isnt gay either (although my teacher was bisexual) i moved on too...im not in love with her, i never will b again, i never think about her...my method is: move on and fall in love with someone you can have. i have a wonderful gf and im so in love with her! she  got me out of depression, she makes me happy and feel loved...she is just soooo wonderful with everything she does...

AA10819547	Hi, thanks for e-mailing me.     I don't think my answer is one that will fit your wants.    A lot of adolescents get randy or bi-curious as their bits develop. They don't have to act on it though.     My advice is: wait until you're old enough to figure out for yourself how to go about enticing someone and  until you're emotionally strong enough to suffer the consequences|`|AA11015890	I think you are being extremely disrespectful to your friend.  You should never try and manipulate someone into doing anything - especially if it's sexual or related to that.  You need to understand that anything you share with another person should be mutually consensual and no-one has been tricked or misled.      You sound too immature to be experimenting in this way.  There's plenty of time for you to discover your sexuality and, when you do, it should be with someone who is a part of it for the RIGHT REASONS.  If you cannot understand the importance of this, then perhaps you should wait until you have a better perspective on sexual activity.|`|W9GFv2VMaa	i heard watching porn together helps.. ones with womne so it doesnt seem to gay.

Never get an abortion though!! |`|9g8spRvPaa	It is because they aren't men, they are still boys.|`|WAEWC3wQaa	There's a flaw in the question.... They are not men, they are cowards...they tell women to have an abortion I think a lot because it's not their body, therefore they don't feel the guilt, shame and sense of wrongdoing as much as a woman would. What these cowards don't see or realize is that they are killing their own flesh and blood......Unfortunately it seems in most cases they would rather pass that wrongdoing, guilt and shame of going through with the abortion onto the woman.    Abortion is wrong...it takes life from a human being and most women carry a great deal of guilt and shame, some fall into depression and for many it never goes away....Once such a decision is made, you can't go back and fix it, so DO NOT have an abortion. It's better to have the baby and then decide for example for financial inadequacies to give the baby up for adoption, but ABORTION IS WRONG. Don't listen to this person telling you to do something so horrific and wrong and God is watching. He has given you this human being and ABORTION IS MURDER. The procedure itself is so so horrific, it's more inhumane, it's just UNBELIEVABLY horrible, it's a human being!.     ok....I just realized you are a guy....anyway....my answer  is that these cowards don't feel the guilt or shame because it's not their body and they are not man enough to take on the responsibility of raising a child mostly due to the fact that they are still like children themselves, they are not men.|`|I6Cw8Msnaa	They key is not getting pregnant in the first place.|`|AA10633259	They are total losers.

A man will stay by you, not ask you to get an abortion and ask you want YOU want to do. If you say you don't believe in abortion, that MAN will stay by you no matter what and help you out. A BOY will tell you to f*ck off, start spreading rumors, perhaps try to hurt you so you loose the baby, completely stay away from you or move, ect. Boys don't grow up sometimes. A man is there through thick and thin. Young ladies, you ALL need to find men before you open your legs. Boys want the kitty right then and there. Men are willing to work for it. Which makes it better in the end for all parties. Not to mention, men know how to work it better.  -Later Gator-|`|I6G3cfG4aa	They get scared...

The Amityville Horror is a movie based on a house in long Island I think, that is supposed to be haunted, nut not necessarily the most haunted house in America.    The reason why the above cities are the mst haunted in America is because they have the most reports of paranormal and ghost activity in places.As for the reason, why they have the most, I can't say.

AA10350404	It depends on how fast the costumer drops their load.
AA10052130	The examples you cited show that you have missed the spiritual dimension of these commands.  God commands that the wicked be put to death so that wickedness did not spread.  He commanded the corners of the hair not be cut FOR THE DEAD -- because the custom of cutting one's hair FOR THE DEAD propagated wrong ideas about death and God's plan for mankind (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14).    If you look deeper into the REASON behind these seemingly harsh commands, you may notice that they had a wise and righteous purpose and were not done as a "social taboo" or humanly vengeful act.    As for WHY I believe the Bible was fully INSPIRED by God, I'd have to go back to why I believe there is a God who gave us the Bible, and why the Bible is the Word of God.  If the Word of God is not reliably and fully inspired by God, then none of it is reliable.  Yet, I have proven (to my self -- a skeptic can never find such proof) that it is reliable.    Basically, the Bible has to be all one (fully inspired) or all the other (fully fictitious), it CANNOT be mixed.    You said, "Since the words in the Bible were told by men," -- OK  "...eventually put to paper by men," -- OK  "...edited by men," -- OK  "...voted upon by men" -- Woops!  Nope, not true!  Or if it was, their vote is meaningless.  It did/does not establish or change the Word of God one bit.  The first three are correct with one added element -- the spirit of God; the men who did these things were guided by God's spirit (No, not like puppets, like pupils).  .|`|o3Jpfflgaa	With respect, here's my take:    I look at creation, with all of its incredible complexity of detail down to the sub-atomic level and understand that God is so powerful that He can bring this all into being by just a thought, then I have no difficulty at all understanding how God can influence man's mind and hand to write His Word exactly as He would have it done.    What I do have a problem with are translations of the Bible that add to the original translation or changes its meaning.  This is why I use the King James (Authorized) Version.  I do use other versions such as the Holman Christian Study Bible, but I also refer to Strong's Concordance and Thayer's Bible Lexicon to really get into the earliest possible meanings.    Thank you for asking.    EDIT: Pardon, but I'm puzzled by your last edit.  If we can assume that God is powerful enough to create the whole universe and all that is in it, why wouldn't He be powerful enough to ensure that EVERY WORD of His reaches us AS HE WANTED in a single, given instance?    If a person LIMITS God by saying that maybe not every word of the Bible is not His, then who are we to say WHICH part isn't divinely inspired?  How would we, the CREATIONS, know what the CREATOR meant?   Really!  If God can create all things, then SURELY He is powerful enough to ensure His Word is transcribed and translated accurately at LEAST once!  That's why I depend upon the King James Version.    The KJV was translated from the most reliable and consistent and earliest known orginal documents, unlike other versions like the Vulgate or Douay which have apocryphal books added.    2nd Edit: The reasons for not trimming beards and the other seeming "social" laws was for a purpose: God told the Israelites they would be a "peculiar" nation.  That's not "peculiar" in the sense of "strange" but it means to be "apart" and "distinctive."  If those saved by God's Grace looked like and acted like everyone else, how could anyone be drawn to ask about our God?  God's people are SUPPOSED to be distinctive in our way of life.|`|100f3b822d2aae0d4998a7e0134e4d7eaa	According to 2nd Timothy 3:16 it is God inspired.God  did write some things from man's prospective though.

Let's say, a thunder came down from sky and wrote some book  and it says Satan's bible. would you believe it ?    very interesting isn't it ?     Even according to bible this could happen and similar thing will take place at the end of time, and that's why people will bow to the Anti-Christ.    What I am trying to say is that, no matter how bible is written, people will only listen to what they want to hear.     And for the copy rights of bible. "WE" christians believe it is true not because we believe in the people who wrote them, but rather we experienced 'reborn' phenomenon.     It is very or near impossible to explain what it is like, but let me put it to you this way :   I can take a bite on an apple and feel the taste, but can I explain it just as I taste it to other people ? no, I can describe it to some degree, but it is nothing like letting them taste it themselves.      All I can say is that you have to experience God to believe bible, and it does not come easy, because God hates lazy people.  You have to work at it to have this reborn experience, and only  then you will be able to fully understand what bible actually is.      [Luke 11 : 10]    10. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.      Sadly there is nothing much I can offer except to tell you I believe in the word of bible, not because of history nor scientific proof but I met the God personally and I wish you could do the same.

The manuscripts of the Old Testament are not as crucial to Christian apologetics as are those of the New Testament. However, their reliability in general is important, and the manuscripts play a crucial role in establishing the Old Testaments reliability. They also help establish the date of Old Testament prophecies which play a supporting role in defending Christianity. Like the New Testament, the original manuscripts (autographs) of the Old Testament are not available, but the Hebrew text is amply represented by both pre- and post-Christian manuscripts. As a result, the reliability of the Hebrew text can be determined from available manuscript evidence. But over 2000 years of copying the text (500 b.c. to a.d. 1500) Jewish scholars performed an unbelievable preservation of the textual traditions.    Exodus, Book of   Exodus is the name given in the LXX. to the second book of the Pentateuch (q.v.). It means departure or outgoing. This name was adopted in the Latin translation, and thence passed into other languages. The Hebrews called it by the first words, according to their custom, Ve-eleh shemoth (i.e., and these are the names).      It contains, (1.) An account of the increase and growth of the Israelites in Egypt (ch. 1) (2.) Preparations for their departure out of Egypt (2-12:36). (3.) Their journeyings from Egypt to Sinai (12:37-19:2). (4.) The giving of the law and the establishment of the institutions by which the organization of the people was completed, the theocracy, a kingdom of priest and an holy nation (19:3-ch. 40).      The time comprised in this book, from the death of Joseph to the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, is about one hundred and forty-five years, on the supposition that the four hundred and thirty years (12:40) are to be computed from the time of the promises made to Abraham (Gal. 3:17).      The authorship of this book, as well as of that of the other books of the Pentateuch, is to be ascribed to Moses. The unanimous voice of tradition and all internal evidences abundantly support this opinion.       The levitical code regulated national life until the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of actual sacrifices (a.d. 70). But the view in Leviticus of sin, guilt, and sacrifice lived on as the mould in which the nt writers, especially the author of the Letter to the Hebrews, understood the death of Christ as the one all sufficient, atoning sacrifice. In later Judaism, attention focused primarily on the laws of cleanliness and uncleanliness, which were much developed in rabbinic literature, as the key to the life of purity.      The word Deuteronomy means a second law, and here we find an amplification and interpretation of earlier law codes, showing how they could apply to the changing circumstances of Israels national life. As such, this book is obviously based on ancient materials, and some believe that it found its present form as a liturgy for a covenant renewal festival at which the worshippers in ancient Israel would regularly relive the events of their national past, and commit themselves afresh to their God Yahweh. Chapters 511 certainly read like sermons, preached as a prelude to the presentation of the actual Law itself in chapters 1226, and followed by the peoples commitment to it in chapters 2728. The book of Deuteronomy was a major influence in the reform of Temple worship carried out by King Josiah of Judah, though its actual origins were certainly earlier than his day (2 Kings 22:320).  |`|oVHFz52Laa	What makes it easier for me to accept the Old Testament is that Jesus confirmed it. The Old Testament is the same now as it was in the time of Jesus.    Jesus also promised the New Testament. God can protect His Word. Jesus was the Living Word    In 2 Tim 3: 16 and 17 Paul emphasizes the preeminence of ALL SCRIPTURE. Given by inspiration is literally " God-breathed ". God was involved in the revelation of His truth to the apostles and prophets, who wrote it down. The Bible is written down by selected people, not just random people at the time.     However, the author of the Bible is God Himself. Thus Scripture is true in all that it affirms and authoritative ( see 1 Pet 1:20,21 )     Paul highlights correct teaching first. Many groups claim to have Biblical teaching, and even ONLY TRUE Biblical teaching, but they had to change the Bible message first to be able to say that!    Knowledge that does not change a person's life is useless. On the other hand, living without any understanding of who God is and what He expects from us is dangerous. God holds higher bar on all the teachers so even if the angel from heaven comes and starts to teach something other than Jesus ' gospel, they are accursed    God let us to use our personalities when we serve Him. So was God letting the writers to bring their own personality to the message that God breathed .|`|yDVlTUYTaa	Interesting question. Thank you for the respectful tone.  Well there seems to be way more than one question here.    First is the question about all scripture being God inspired? I see from your question that many of your concerns stem from the old testament so here are 2 verses from the new testement that support the old:   "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness." II Timothy 3:16  "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself." Luke 24:27 This second is Jesus validating the Torah by opening up the scriptures and making explaination about the prophesies He would fulfill.    Secondly, what is the purpose of the Levitical law?  So Exodus, Leviticus, etc. is the historical accounting of God's people Israel.  Those chosen to be the ones from where Christ would come.   Much of the Levitical Law (beard trimming, wearing headcoverings, body piercing, etc.) were given as instructions by God to keep Israel from copying their pagan neighbors and intermingling with them.  Many of the events that we read about were evidence of God setting His people apart that they would not become like the pagans, worshipping other gods, taking part in vile religeous practices like child sacrifices, sexual rituals in worship, etc., etc.  I'm not sure which executions you refer to, and certainly if Jesus explained them then go with Him. There are however, passages where God has his people wipe out an entire people group because if their vileness, even down to their children and livestock.  This is hard for us to take because it doesn't really mesh with our picture of a loving God. The truth is, we don't get to be in charge of God's actions or decisions and God, though patient, is neither tolerent of sin, nor overlooks it.  He also was fighting to keep the line of Christ pure. Had his people taken on the pagan ways and intermarried with them, then there would have been no one watching for the messiah, Christ, even if miraculously born to parents who had kept themselves pure and set apart to God,  would have been born into a society much like ours where people are so taken up with their own lusts, that God's plan of salvation would have been thwarted. (I would like to add as an aside that there is a wonderful group called Bible Study Fellowship which studies to Old and New testament, not affiliated with any church, and probably could give a much better answer to these questions than I. They are all over the country and you can look for them on line.)    Lastly, Did God protect His word from false teaching's/books creaping in? There are manuscripts dating from within 50 years of Christs death. In otherwords, first hand accounts. Those manuscripts agree with our modern manuscripts (and think how many times they had to be rewritten and rewritten) 99.9%  That's phenomenal accuracy.  As far as the books included in the Bible, the criteria for deciding what was included was something like this: (please bear with my sketchy memory, it's been a long time since I studied this)    First, are their any other historically significant documents which support the events that are recounted in this book as being true.    Secondly, was this book writen by someone who's tesimony the early church trusted. In otherwords, those who gave first hand accounts of what they knew of Christ because they'd actually known Christ.    Third, was this book validated by Christ or one of his apostles quoting from it or expounding on it.     And lastly, does this book contain anything which directly violates Christ's teachings?    For more on the validity of scripture, I totally want to recommend the book "Evidence That Demands a Verdict".  It started as a college research paper trying to disprove the validity of scripture and the claims of christ, and the young man who did the research (a self proclaimed atheist at the time) was forced to draw the opposite conclusions.|`|24507d459775ede5fdae932098289feeaa	the bible was written through the help of the holy spirit. therefore, it has to be interpreted through the help of the holy spirit. you cant judge everything in it on your own. only God will reveal to you what each part of the bible means.|`|q6KmVWS1aa	If you read what Paul wrote in one place "I write by permission not as a commandment".

It was written by human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit.    Above all you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.

The bible is the literal truth!|`|ed1645aa82e0d1160bf75fe75030f871aa	its a matter of faith really, true it was written, edited and voted by men, men who are regarded as the fortress of the christian church with that they are given the task to decide which is which most likely through divine intervention|`|QztSOUFXaa	I do not know what exactly you mean by "literally", since it is obvious that some parts of the Bible are symbolic.    2 Tim. 3:16,17 confirms that every single word in the Bible is approved to be there by God.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	Don't count on any rational answers.  It all boils down to "God-magic".      "God can do anything!"      Except write a collection of books that don't contradict themselves, get history and science wrong, and can be interpreted in so many ways that there are more than 30,000 sects and sub-sects...most of whom regard at lest most of the others as dead wrong or even "satanic".  |`|f1358173f4960baff4946d812a3dff99aa	I agree with you. It was written by man. Then again is the person who wrote it really important when all they do is write down the thoughts of someone else. The bible is a guide for all of us and it says if you follow of it you will be successful in life. I agree that the bible is something to be followed. that's my opinion though. There are a lot more things that prove that bible is inspired but search it up.|`|4jOi2KETaa	 We believe that the words written in the Bible were inspired by God and written as He directed. You spoke about the laws of the Old Testament. They were given to show nobody would keep them all and the lesson is that men cannot save themselves. The sacrifice system in that time was set up to provide forgiveness. Jesus became that sacrifice once and for all and replaced the Old Testament System. |`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	Men wrote down the Bible, inspired by God.  1st Peter 1:20-21  "For you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by mans will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit."    The bible was written down from the start. It wasn't orally transmitted. It was not edited or voted upon. Sure, it was voted upon by Catholic officials a couple hundred years after the bible had been completed and sealed, but it didn't change anything. Every scrap of every biblical manuscript attests to the fact that it hasn't been edited, and has been amazingly preserved.

72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	I have to disagree with you. I don't think it's just white women that get discriminated against. This sounds like a pity party to me! Women of all colors have been discriminated against and your acting like white women have been the only ones to be treated terribly. Nobody is going to hate you for saying this but we will tell you it's not the truth. You really need to go back and look over your history. Especially when it comes to American history. What about the native american women that had their homeland taken over by force? This country belonged to the native americans and it's sad they don't even have a say so in much of anything now. What about the black slave women back then that were forced to do things against their will and had no rights of their own? Don't get me wrong I think every race has endured some bad things but don't act like white women have it so bad. President Obama just signed a law making equal rights and pay for women in this country so I don't think there is a need to complain. If you really care so much then why don't you just start your own sexism movement. And, by the way I'm a black woman that loves all races. I don't see color, just the person on the inside.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Have you heard of the feminist movement?  Someone cares, trust me.|`|1e517d457abe5a99863a757df71245e3aa	it's not just white women, it's women in general. But women have come a long way and the discrimmination is not as bad as it used to be.

I actually worked with the man who did the acoustic analysis that suggested the second shooter. He testified before the comittee as a young engineer. You can find his name on the websites.  - However, your argument that the damage is inconsistent with the crash is confusing. Obviously the wall wasn't blown by explosives and somebody put the plane there after the fact. There is no alternate explanation.|`|DapNp1Kxaa	Just my opinion, but it hasn't changed since I saw the first pictures-a missile would make the hole I saw, but not a plane. I think that when this all came down that terrible day, there was a lot of scrambling to protect, and in the chaos that ensued, the plane that was headed for the pentagon had a missile trained on it, and part of what we see is the impact of that missile gone awry. No fault finding on my part, I think they were trying to mitigate the chaos. I find it interesting that you ask this-I was discussing it with my son, yesterday. He is a giant 'theory' guy, and he disagrees with me.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	Sigh.  Islamic terrorists flew a plane into the Pentagon.

Its the same concept of the movies V for Vendetta (rated R) or if you like Princess Bride (rated pg) Check out Michael Moores documetaries on 911 or the health care and then dont worry about it since:     thankfully I trust its all in Jehovah Gods hands and he sees all the dirty little things that go on behind closed doors in homes and in our 'goverment'.

But that's academic, they're pretty similar.    Neither have wings and tailplanes made of gas, that don't show signs of impact on the outside wall    Neither are invisible to CCTV.    Let's face a simple truth, there must be many CCTV videos that definitely show what hit the pentagon.    There are none released so,    for whatever reason, the government didn't want to show anybody what hit the pentagon.
PtoieF7Caa	In a way Emily is right.  Throughout history the continents have shaped and formed into various "super continents" at one point all the continents were joined and people could cross the lands freely. It is believed that the human ancestor originated in what is now known as the continent of Africa. When the different groups spread out and were broken apart by the shifting continents, genetic variations began to occur.  Italy is part of the european continent, thus there is often a mix of different people in the modern day Italian.  Caucasian & Hispanic are probably the prevailing genetic contributions.    You should take a look at these two wikipedia articles for more info. But like any group these days, it is more common to find someone of mixed origin than someone from a "pure" racial group.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy Popul...|`|5f69hQT2aa	Africa    Edit: people are thumbs-downing me, but I'm right.

uuQrhnJ4aa	Many disabled ppl are not able to get out of the house as much as they would like. There are lots of functions I would like to attend, friends I would like to visit, etc...until I got online, my 'world' existed of ppl who visited me. Getting out once a wk didn't enable me to meet new ppl.     Facebook has reconnected me with friends I'd lost touch with. Not only that, there are several groups on FB for many health issues..so one can connect w/ppl living w/similar circumstances.     A person can create a group for absolutely anything. It helps to share experiences. As w/any group you can learn about doctors, treatments, support groups...so many benefits! Sometimes it simply helps to know you are not alone.     Although most groups are joined by ppl who have the specific condition, anyone can join & that helps to promote awareness/acceptance because they can see what difficulties we have to deal w/on a daily basis.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	Disabled folks can connect and communicate with others alike and different from themselves on-line.

It allows families to create groups to share information and gain support.     It allows resource centers to post events and groups.     Though the events pages people are more aware of protests, campaigns, and awareness activities to help people with disabilities.     There are groups made to combat injustice towards an individual or group of people with a disability.     But this is a double edged sword.  Ive had devotees and down right strange people send me messages and friend requests because they found out about my disability though support groups I joined. When I start getting floods of messages I post a quick note on the wall reminding lurkers that this group is intended for support and if anyone is looking for relationships or devotee related chat they should do so elsewhere.     I know to ignore people I don't know. But for a younger amputee or someone dealing with body issues might be caught up with people who act nice to them but may exploit them or who knows what.|`|BevylvVSaa	I can't think of a single one - why would it?|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	Facebook is a networking tool, it makes it easy for anyone to network, same goes for the disabled.

Mamas here are raising their boys to be sissy boys and girls who are  too "strong". It needs to be the opposite because In my community, its a HUGE problem because we've got 70%+  who are single mothers. Our men and women just cant stick together and get along. Pretty sad. Both are to blame
MS30Fi3Jaa	The confusion is probably because the Cherokee Nation is actually made up of more than one band of Cherokee. These bands have different requirements. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Tahlequah, has no blood quantum requirement. You simply must prove that you are a direct descendant of a person who was enrolled on the Dawes Rolls. This roll lists people accepted between 1898 and 1914 by the Dawes Commission as eligible for tribal membership.     If your your friend had ancestors in Oklahoma, they would most likely have been with this tribe. However, if they were from the east, such as Tennessee, Georgia, or North Carolina, she is more likely to be eligible for enrollment with the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation. In this case, she would need to locate an ancestor on the 1924 Baker roll. To become a member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians, located in Cherokee, North Carolina, she would also need to have 1/16th Cherokee blood.     There are also other Cherokee bands and tribes that are not typically referred to as part of the "Cherokee Nation". However, they may be federally or state recognized. Others have no official recognition and some are outright frauds.     The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma are a federally recognized Band of Indians whose office is in also in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Enrollment in this band requires a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood showing at least 1/4 degree Keetoowah Cherokee blood.    The Georgia Tribe of Eastern Cherokee is officially recognized by the state of Georgia. They have no blood quantum requirement, and enrollment is based on being a Georgia Cherokee, and having an ancestor on any of several rolls.     The first step in becoming a member of the Cherokee Nation is to complete a family tree. This will help you in establishing the information needed and is actually a part of the application. You can find much more information about Cherokee tribes and tribal enrollment at the link below.

The only requirement is that a person MUST have a direct ancestor on the Dawes Rolls.  That's it.  There are CNO citizens with 1/1024 Cherokee blood and less who are enrolled.  Your friend (or her parents) need to contact CNO directly to see if their ancestor is listed on the Dawes Rolls and to find out if they're eligible for enrollment    BTW: 1/12 is not a valid blood quantum.

fU3FQ6Biaa	1. It's just a part of their ceremony, not necessary for worshiping God.  2.You don't need anything to pray to God. As a matter of fact, we are supposed to pray only to God.  3. If God wants to bless you with a child, He will. Trojan Man can't stop it.  4. Ecclesiastes says there is a time for all things. A time to heal, and a time to kill. A time for peace and a time for war.  5. Saul, he met Jesus on the road and was stricken blind. Later he was healed and became Paul, He wrote most of the New Testament. I suggest you read it. Start with Romans, it's great.  6. Jesus never went to China. That's our job. To make sure they hear the Word.  7. God created all animals. In the beginning, all animals were vegetarians, only after Adam and Eve sinned did animals start killing.|`|QluBTwCvaa	You ask for a book of answers. I suggest read the book of Acts to find out what Paul and others did.  Read Job 40 and 41 for a description of dinosaurs.  Apparently those huge ones did not bother you unless you bothered them. The sailors of history have spoken of huge sea creatures.  At least two modern day dinosaurs have been found washed ashore, partially decaying bitten by other animals and the other almost all decayed. These are since photography was developed. T-Rex remains have now been found with vegetation in its teeth supporting the idea that he was a herbivore, ate plants only.    Wars come from the lusts of man.  Sometimes evil men like Saddam Hussein need to be stopped by force. Sometimes the LORD will let an evil nation attack one that should trust in Him and turned elsewhere to trust for protection.  The United States abortion laws reflect a lack of understanding that our protection is from the LORD, Yahweh.  Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.    I do not know if Jesus went to China after His resurrection before He went on to heaven. He appeared to those who recorded it in the word of God during a span of 40 days.  That does not preclude Him showing Himself elsewhere.  During his pre crucifixion ministry it is not feasible that he went to China.  I have never explored Chinese claims that you are referring to.    Baptism is for believers in Jesus Christ only.  First you must be willing to live for Him by His power and become His servant. See John 3.  See Romans 6.  A baptism is by definition an immersion into water.  You are under only momentarily.  It represents the death, burial, and resurrection of you to a new way of life.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	>    It's called a "censer". It contains incense. It is a pagan tradition that the Catholic church kept.    >    Another pagan tradition of the Catholic church.    >    Baptism is a public confession of your acceptance of Christ as your Lord and Savior. It represents death to sin and rebirth into Christ. If you're afraid of it, you're probably not ready. Go to some Bible studies.    >    Even if you use contraception within marriage, that's kind of pointless. the whole purpose of marriage is to create an environment in which to bring up any children that are conceived. If you become pregnant, God has given you the great opportunity to put someone else's welfare above your own. He wants you to raise the child up in Christ. By using contraception, you are basically telling God that you know better what is good for your life than He does. God knows your future. You don't. You should leave yourselves open  to the transmission of life.    >    A Christian should take conscientious objector status. There is a difference between defending your family, or defending an invasion of your own country, and going to someone else's country to kill for oil.    >    You are probably talking about Paul. His name used to be Saul, and he was a member of the Jewish Sanhedrin, and was instrumental in imprisoning and killing many early Christians, until Christ Himself confronted him on the road to Damascus and struck him temporarily blind. He changed his name to Paul, and became a Christian, and did a complete 180 from what he was like before. He helped to establish the early Christian church and spread it into Europe and Asia.     >    No.    >    Evolutionists assume that T-Rex was a meat-eater just because it had sharp teeth, but they don't know that. There are a lot of vegetarian animals that have sharp teeth, such as the giant panda, the gorilla, the fruit bat, the iguana, etc. Studies of T-Rex's teeth show that he may have been a melon-eater. Other clues are T-Rex's size - historically, the largest animals, both living and extinct, have always been herbivores, and T-Rex's size, and lack of speed and stealth would make him a poor hunter. Even evolutionists are starting to agree with this.|`|EM0kiImHaa	Smoke: I don't know. I didn't even know they did that.    Bowing to statues: These people are obviously confused. The Bible clearly states that you don't need any graven image.    Baptism: You don't have to be baptized to be saved. This is something we should do after accepting Jesus but it isn't required for salvation or anything.    Safe sx: This is not a sin. If you don't want kids or aren't ready for them, using a        is fine (assuming you are with your wife).    War: War is ok if there is a reason. Going to war for selfish reasons is wrong but liberating Iraq, for instance, is good.    The christian-ha+er turned missionary: Yes, this is a true story. Saul, later Paul, persecuted christians until he was blinded on the road to Damascus and God spoke to him.     China: No, Jesus never went to China.    Dinosaurs: When God created the world, everything was perfect and there was no      . Nothing was vicious until sin entered the world. Everything and everyone was vegetarian.|`|AA10034051	That is incense    Psalm 140:1-2 "I have cried to Thee, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when I cry to Thee. Let my prayer be directed as incense in Thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice."          The "sweet savour" of incense was used in Old Testament liturgy as far back as the time of Moses as an offering to God:     Exodus 30:34-37  And the Lord said to Moses: Take unto thee spices, stacte, and onycha, galbanum of sweet savour, and the clearest frankincense, all shall be of equal weight. And thou shalt make incense compounded by the work of the perfumer, well tempered together, and pure, and most worthy of sanctification. And when thou hast beaten all into very small powder, thou shalt set of it before the tabernacle of the testimony, in the place where I will appear to thee. Most holy shall this incense be unto you. You shall not make such a composition for your own uses, because it is holy to the Lord.   ... and its continued use was predicted, along with the Eucharistic offering, by Malachias:     Malachias 1:11   For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.   Frankincense as a sign of His Divinity, and myrrh to portend His Passion and Death, were two of the three gifts the Magi brought to Baby Jesus --     Matthew 2:11  And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him: and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.   -- and as portended, myrrh, with its analgesic properties, was offered to Him on the Cross and was used, mixed with aloes, to annoint Him after death:     Mark 15:22-23   And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.     John 19:39-40   And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the first came to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.   Even the very angels in Heaven use incense, the smoke of which comes with the prayers of the Saints.     Apocalypse 8:3-4  And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden censer: and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer of the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which is before the throne of God. And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel.   The Catholic Church still uses incense, of course, in accordance with prophecy of Malachias, the fragrant smoke symbolizing our prayers rising to Heaven and purifying what it touches. The incense is kept in a covered, often boat-shaped liturgical vessel called, unsurprisingly, a "boat," which symbolizes the barque of Peter. The boat, made of bronze or brass and often silver or gold-plated, comes with a spoon for scattering the incense in the bowl-shaped matching burner, called a "thurible" or "censer." The thurible holds burning charcoal (or wood) to ignite the incense and hangs on chains (see angel picture below) so that it may be swung by the priest when censing things (or people) and so it may be easily carried by the thurifer -- the "Altar server" who assists the priest by carrying the incense.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	Catholics are wrong.

Crazy stuff.|`|PGcJROA1aa	Same reason your parents punish you when you do wrong. A mom or dad that lets their kid do whatever they want, without punishment or boundaries, does not love them. A parent wants the best for their children, and punishes them when they do wrong so they learn to do what's right. However, when a child becomes of age, and is able to make his own choices, he comes under the authority of the law. If he commits murder, our society punishes him for life- sometimes even with the death penalty. God is no different. In order for God to be fair to those of us who do right, He must punish evil. Otherwise, He would be lawless like a lot of unjust judges and seedy lawyers and dishonest politicians. We all hate people like that, because they are not to be trusted. God is righteous and JUST, and He MUST punish those who do wrong.        Besides, God does not 'torture' His children for eternity. All God's children go to heaven. The only ones who go to hell are those who choose NOT to be God's child by rejecting His authority as their Father. They pay the same price as anyone who commits murder here- they are punished for life. Justice is served.|`|deUc99Whaa	if a son leaves home and chooses not to live in his fathers house how would the son feel if his father made him by force live in his house? and if the son lived in his fathers house wouldn't the son have to follow his fathers rules?

For instance "God is love" is one aspect of God's character. All of God's attributes from His love to His mercy to His holiness to His righteousness all work together in perfect unity with none of them contradicting each other.    Jesus agreed with His Father's plan of redemption before the earth was even made. Jesus laid down his life and took it back up again so that God's love could work in unity with His righteousness.    John 3:14  And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15  that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  17  For God did not send His Son into the world so that He might condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.    John 10:17  Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it up again.  18  No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This command I have received from My Father."    Romans 3:23  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,  24  being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,  25  whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, for a demonstration of His righteousness through the passing over of the sins having previously occurred, in the forbearance of God,  26  for a demonstration of His righteousness in the present time, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Because it was written by many people over hundreds if not thousands of years.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Better question: Why do we have to answer this question every 45 minutes?

Only a perfect sacrifice (Jesus Christ) would suffice to pay for the sin of the entire world.  It is God's will that all people come to know and believe in Him, but God created man with free will. Thus, man can refuse God.  Going back to what I said earlier, God must punish sin. He offered the payment for it, but there are millions of people who refuse that gift. He must punish them, thus the eternal punishment in Hell.    And technically, He isn't punishing His 'children.'

According to the Bible, the only religion that God approves of, the only TRUE religion, is to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the homeless, bring comfort to those who mourn, forgive those who hurt us, and treat others the way you want to be treated.    Understand, however, that this doesn't get us to heaven (only Jesus can do THAT), but rather, this kind of religion makes life a whole lot easier on all of us when we share the load and burden of each other's needs.    With THAT definition, the BIBLICAL definition, do you really need reasons why people need religion in their lives?    The next time you're down and out, or if you ever need to go through a "soup line", or receive financial aid, or you become a victim as those in Georgia did over Hurricane Katrina, when you need food, clothing and shelter, then you'll know just how important religion (the BIBLICAL religion) really is.    I don't know where you stand on religion, but if you DO denounce religion, then you're saying that the people who went out of their way to rebuild many houses for the Katrina victims were wrong in doing so!  (A couple from our church has gone down to Georgia and Mississippi every year for at least a month at a time, at their own expense, to help rebuild houses).

Fyz94ApAaa	Baptism is a greek word that means "immersion". The ancient Jews used baptism "mikvah" as a cleansing ritual in the old testament to sanctify and cleanse objects used for cooking and other ceremonies. Blood was also spattered across the ancient Jewish priests in the temple to purify. Today, if one was to join into the Jewish faith you would need to be immersed in a mikvah to purify and sanctify yourself.   Later in the New testament, Jesus is seen in a new movement where the body of the follower is submerged into water to be purified as a vessel to God. Today it is seen in all Christian sects whether it is sprinkling of blessed water or complete immersion in a river.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	In Awe of Jesus is right.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism|`|TfWIcohcaa	In Mithraism (prior to Christianity) men used to bathe in a sacrificed bull's blood.

The mikvah was a cleansing pool that they would wash themselves in to wash away the dirt of the day, to purify themselves when presenting themselves before God, and other such customs. When John the Baptist began baptizing those who wanted to repent, the Jews were already familiar with the tradition of washings. Thus, many came to him as part of a sincere desire to show God their desire to live holy lives.       The Christian custom of baptism was initiated by Christ, who did it as an example that all who follow Him should do as He did. The difference in Christian baptism, is that it is no longer a ritual washing, but actually a supernatural work that goes along with the confession of faith in Christ. It is during the baptismal process that a person receives the holy spirit, and his sins are literally 'washed away'- something that could not be done before Christ's resurrection. Before Jesus died, baptism was merely a symbol. Now it is part of the salvation process.
5ydqCVE2aa	Aphrodite was the Goddess of Love, but Eros did all the work. He was similar to Cupid in that he shot people with arrows to make them fall in love.|`|m3f0Pa5oaa	And, more literally, you don't have the type of love Aphrodite was most known for dispensing unless you have sexual attraction between two people.|`|0JERmAslaa	Aphrodite is the Greek god of love and Eros was the lower Greek god of love. He was the one that did all of Aphrodite's work because he was in love with her even though she did not love him back. It was kind of a love and work relationship.
EaQxwjVfaa	Haha I actually feel the same way too. Im more sexually attracted to girls. With guys...its really really rare that i find them attractive but when i do, i did give it a try.. On the Kinsey scale...i would fall somewhere between 4-5. Cant say im a full lesbian but close. Where would u place urself on the scale?|`|HP0a2HeZaa	I wouldn't be the one to tell you, since you have to answer that yourself.   But yes, being bisexual means you are attracted to both men and women sexually.|`|Uxs2wy7Haa	well if u are confused just coz u think girls are "fun" then i would say no probably not. but only u can say if ur bi or whateva.     *if u want help on deciding whether or not ur bi than i would say this:  1. do u find girls attractive(do u like looking at them/do they make u smile alot)?  2. have u ever been jealous of a friend when she talks about her boyfriend?  3. have u ever admired or looked up to a girl...ALOT?(sometimes lez's or bi's think they look up to a girl, but really they have a crush)     *if u answered yes to any of these than theres a possibility, if u answered yes to 2 or more, than i would say yea! u probably are. congratz!|`|m0lxBmPqaa	well what I can say.. you are bi.. you sound bi to me.. I think you should to make a balance in your life..|`|a3OCK2iraa	I don't think that I can help you with that short description you gave. You can't really know that you are bisexual until you have been with both sexes.|`|Gb1bVKBCaa	If you're sexually attracted to females and males then that would fit the definition of bisexuality.    Personally I don't believe anything is wrong with it, as I myself am a teenage bisexual male.    Many people often find that due to gender groupings at a younger age, they find they will often feel more comfortable with the same gender.    It's been proven to be completely natural, you should not worry, and should just see what feelings you continue to get.      (Also, age would be a useful guide as sometimes at certain younger ages similar feelings are arisen, and it could well be the age and condition you are at.)

I don't think people can know here unless you go into the details. Its just the way it is here.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	wow that was real rude of them to say your english is bad. then again it depends on their tone. if they said it in a rude way then you'd have reason to not feel at ease. but if they said it playfully then i wouldn't worry about it. but your writing seems ok on here. trust me i've seen americans who can hardly spell their own names let alone a sentence lol. so don't feel bad man.

Males can be impulsive when it comes to handling the chemical reactions in their body.  But testosterone and upbringing are only excuses.  When you are old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, you shouldn't cheat.

The neolithic shaman (both men and women) who communicated with the nature spirits, healed the sick, performed ceremonies for the clan/tribe, employed sympathetic magic for the success of the hunt, and managed a thousand other things were the forerunners of modern day witches. Then as now, the witch/wicce/ wise were the people studying and searching for the means to stretch the envelope for the good of all.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

People think the US economy is aready trashed, but it is not going to get better soon: US and Mexico oil wells will run dry in nine years and the US is in no position to recover from a 50% decrease in oil supply.       The US does not understand the impact of their ecological footprint on the nations they depend on for imported goods. As of 09/30/2008, the US owes 13,627,459 million dollars to other nations. How can one nation so in debt be allowed to continue living as comfortably as it does while there is so much poverty in nations it owes money to?

GNQ70MEFaa	Yes it is still wrong because you still allow yourself to be aroused be this depiction of actual occurrences. You can't allow yourself to be taken over by your flesh in your arousal from seeing those images. Even thinking about sleeping with a woman or man is considered adultery, so you have to be careful to block such images and thoughts. If you download this material into your soul, then you will eventually lose control and you may end up in a place that you will wish you had never gone to. You will find that the more you see them, the harder it is to block them, and it won't be hard to discuss even insignificant subjects only to see those images running through your mind. And you actually are objectifying it because it has a place in your life that is unnecessary and should otherwise be filled by God. So, you need to repent, remove those images from your computer and avoid those animations.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	you look at it as art...but ur sexually aroused? uh...i guess it's not immoral...but would you agree there's still lust involved?|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Yes, pornography is immoral.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	You get a hard-on from cartoon animals.

You are still objectifying the subjects of the pictures.        Is this a sin?   Depends.      The Bible describes several things that are definitely considered sin, but the broad definition of sin is anything that takes you away from God.   The New Testament releases us from the strict Mosaic Laws, and offers us guidelines to follow.        One of the guidelines is that with the knowledge of good and evil we have by understanding the words and teachings of Jesus, we can determine for ourselves what things are sinful.   If you get the feeling that the things you are viewing are wrong, but you continue to view them, then you are in a state of sin.

ILc1XIPraa	Salamu Alaikom sister. Sadly i just recently attended my first muslim funeral since my reversion to islam. Women are allowed in all aspects of the mourning except it's recommended not for the burial. We sisters stood off to the side and made du'as for our dead brother , while the men took on the task of physically burying him. We were all very upset and trying hard to hold back the emotion we had , but we couldn't do it. We as muslims aren't supposed to bawl on someone's grave and this is why women are asked respectfully not to be near it. When we were done crying for the moment we all silently visited the grave and said our last good byes. It's a sad thing to lose someone we all need to be a part of the closure. I hope we did the right thing insha'Allah... wa salam|`|88fHI3xDaa	if u are muslim i hope u will follow prophet(saw)'s way if u are hanfi malik shia or shafai or hambali u are free to do any thing  but u tell me   when Khdiza(rz) was die any woman went to grave and u tell me at the  time of Uhad any woman was persent in grave oh no u tell me when prophet(saw)'s son and daughter(rz) were die any woman was persent in grave yard so i say if u are muslim u will follow only prophet(saw) if u are hanfi maliki hambali shafai or murtid shia u are free because they are not muslim|`|dAcNaajsaa	Assalaamu alaykum    Must be a tough question. Second posting and not many answers.     I think that to get a more structured answer, I would need more info on what exactly you mean. But going from just what you written so far in your original question, I would say there seems to be 2 main issues here.    1 - feeling sorry for yourself    2 - not acting upon help that is offered to you    3 - Does misery love company? (as for this issue, it is perhaps as a result of the first 2 issues. So there is no need from my point to answer this separately)    So why would someone feel sorry for themself ? It could be perhaps because they feel they deserve something more than they have, because they feel they are suffering when others are not or that they don't deserve it, or so on.    What does the Qur'aan say about this and the ahadeeth ?     If you go throughout the Qur'aan and the ahadeeth, you will find some basic information about reality that has come from God as his final message to mankind.    These basic pirces of info are :    a) that God has created us and he is ONE  b)that he is always in control and nothing happens except that he wills it      c) that this life is only a test and that whatever happens in it is a test from God to see which of us is the best in deed and which of us trully believe in him and will remain patient upon that belief regardless of the situations they go through       Consider :    18:7. Verily! We have made that which is on earth as an adornment for it, in order that We may test them (mankind) as to which of them are best in deeds. [i.e.those who do good deeds in the most perfect manner, that means to do them (deeds) totally for Allah's sake and in accordance to the legal ways of the Prophet  ].    18:8. And verily! We shall make all that is on it (the earth) a bare dry soil (without any vegetation or trees, etc.).      19:60. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad ), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught.      d) that God is just and does not wrong anyone  e)that part of the test in life is that God gives riches and health and so forth to some and not to others... so its test for both the rich and the poor... to be patient and to be thankful and still uphold worship of the One true God    22:11. And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were, upon the very edge (i.e. in doubt); if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts back to disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss.      e) that status is determined by taqwa which can roughly be translated as god-consciousness, piety, fear of God, etc.... and this is what God uses to measure people, not their wealth or looks and children or spouse or material gains or degrees or jobs or health or family and so on    67:1. Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things.    67:2. Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;        So once someone understands all this, then it becomes clear that to feel sorry for your own self is actually not in keeping with the Qur'aan and sunnah because there is nothing to feel sorry for in this life if it involves things of this life, like material gains etc. Everything that happens is God's decree and part of the divine test of humanity. However, if we have missed out on some good due to our sins etc, then we should feel regret and repent but not to feel sorry in the way that leads us to stagnation - so this is a harmful response and it will only increase and feed your sense of alienation or whatever is leading you to feel sorry for yourself.    In islam, we have belief which is translated into action.         To worry without acting is a faliure in understanding that this life is all a test and that our response is what God is looking for. Do we still worship him ? do we still hope in him and fear him ? do we still realise that he is our provider ? do we still know that he forgives and do we then repent sincerely ? do we realise that the greatest loss is to leave this life being unsatisfied and disbelieving in God etc ?     so it comes back down to how great you have realised who this Being is ! God most great. Allaah Subhanahu wa ta'ala.    15:23. And certainly We! We (God alone) it is Who give life, and cause death , and We are the Inheritors.    If you feel sins are overwhelming you or there is no hope for you due to your difficulties etc, then remember     15:56. [Ibrahim (Abraham)] said: "And who despairs of the Mercy of his Lord except those who are astray?"    Why i say this is that feeling sorry for oneself is a problem that has causes and from the causes that can lead to it is perhaps feeling there is no hope for you etc etc....    The other part of your|`|SCkhQc2Caa	it is disliked for a woman to go to the funerals.     Um Atiya Al Ansaria (may Allaah be pleased with her0 narrated that :    "We were forbidden to follow the funerals, but it was not an absolute prohibition." [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]   _________________________    Al Hafidh Ibn Hajar explained this Hadeeth by saying:     "This means, it was not emphasized on us to avoid this as it was emphasized on us to avoid other things. It is as if she had said:   "It was made dislikable to us to follow coffins while being carried to the graveyard. But it was not made unlawful to us to do so".     Al Qurtibi said: 'this restraint does not mean unlawfulness it means that it is only dislikable' Al Qurtibi's opinion is the same as that of the majority of the scholars.     Imaam Maalik believes that this is lawful to women. This is also the opinion of Ahl Al Medina (inhabitants of Al Medina in the era of Maalik). The evidence for the lawfulness is the Hadeeth narrated by Ibn Abushaibah from Abu Huraira that "the Prophet was attending a funeral when `Umar saw a woman. `Umar shouted at the woman. The Prophet told him to leave her ." [Ibn Majah and Al Nasai].  _________________________________    So, it is not recommendable for the woman to follow the coffin when carried to the graveyard if her intention is to pray the funeral prayer.     The Prophet ordered her to pray the prescribed prayer in her home and he told her that praying in her home has greater reward than "praying in with him in his mosque". So, if this is the rule about the prescribed prayers, it is more recommendable as well in other prayers.     Ahmad narrated from Um Hameed that she came to the Prophet and said:     "O! Prophet of Allaah I like praying with you".     He said, "I had known that you like praying with me. But your prayer in your private room is better than your prayer in other rooms of your house, and your prayer in other rooms of your house is better than your prayer in the halls of your house, and your prayer in the halls of your house is better than your prayer in your community's mosque, and your prayer in your community's mosque is better than your prayer in my mosque."    So, if this is the rule for women regarding the obligatory prayers then the same rule applies to their following coffins being carried to graveyards.  __________________________|`|rM9QdK75aa	As far as I know-    Women can attend funeral prayers at the mosque- but can't go to the burial.    There's a difference of opinion on whether they can visit graves. I have read a hadith (Authentic, haven't got ref) where Rasul'Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) specifically recommended both males and females to visit the graves of the dead, and make Du'aa for them, which will in turn remind us (the living) about our imminent death. And there are some who suggest that females are not allowed to visit the graves- haven't seen proof of that as yet.    And Allah knows best  peace|`|UpIjgNV5aa	Seriously 'Brigette' you had to ask that? Lets assume for a second they aren't then the reason would be . . . ??     Of course they can and should!!|`|zgL6vMCiaa	i only found about graves:    Ruling on women visiting graves   My aunts father died and she visited his grave once. She wants to visit it again, but she has heard a hadeeth which means that women are forbidden to visit graves. Is this hadeeth saheeh, and if it is saheeh, is she guilty of a sin for which kafaarah (expiation) is required?     Praise be to Allaah.   The correct view is that it is not allowed for women to visit graves, because of the hadeeth mentioned. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. Women should stop visiting graves. The woman who visited a grave out of ignorance (of this ruling) is not to blame, but she should not do it again. If she does so, she has to repent and seek forgiveness, and repentance cancels out whatever came before. Visiting graves is only for men. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Visit graves, for they will remind you of the Hereafter. At the beginning of Islam, visiting graves was not allowed for men and women alike, because the Muslims were new in Islam and came from a background where grave-worship and attachment to the dead were widespread. So they were forbidden to visit graves as a preventative measure, to avoid evil and prevent shirk. But once Islam was well-established and they understood Islam, Allaah prescribed visiting the graves because of the lessons and reminders of death and the Hereafter involved in that, and so that they could make duaa for the deceased and pray for mercy for them. Then Allaah forbade woman to do that  according to the most correct of the two scholarly opinions  because they may present a temptation to men and even to themselves, and because they have little patience and they get too upset. So by His mercy and kindness towards them, Allaah forbade them to visit graves. This is also a form of kindness towards the men, because if they were all to gather at the grave, this might cause fitnah. So by His mercy, Allaah forbade women to visit graves.   But with regard to the prayer (women praying the funeral prayer), there is nothing wrong with that. Women may join the funeral prayer. The prohibition applies only to visiting the graves. Women should not visit graves according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of the ahaadeeth which indicate that that is forbidden. She does not have to offer any kafaarah, all she has to do is repent.

This is based on the following hadith from 'Aishah, "What should I say to them, O Messenger of Allah when visiting graves?" As mentioned above Abdallah ibn Abi Mulaikah is also reported to have said, "Once 'Aishah returned after visiting the graveyard. I asked, 'O Mother of the Believers, where have you been?' She said: 'I went out to visit the grave of my brother Abd ar-Rahman.' I asked her: 'Didn't the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prohibit visiting graves?' She said, 'Yes, he did forbid visiting graves during the early days, but later on he ordered us to visit them'." This is reported by Al-Hakim and Al-Baihaqi, who also remarked that this hadith was narrated only by Bistam bin Muslim al-Basri. Adh-Dhahabi said that it is a sound hadith.    Permit Women to Accompany a Funeral Procession  Umm 'Atiyah reported: "We were forbidden to accompany funeral processions, but this prohibition was not mandatory for us." (Reported by Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim & Ibn Majah) Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported: "Once while we were with the Prophet, peace be upon him, he saw a woman - whom we thought he did not recognize - so he waited until she reached him. It was Fatimah, his daughter. He asked her: 'What caused you to leave your house?' She said: 'I came to visit the family living in this house in order to offer my condolences and to comfort them in their grief.' He said: 'Did you accompany them to the graveyard?' She said: 'God forbid! How could I do that, when I know what you have said in this respect.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'Had you accompanied the funeral procession to the graveyard, you would never have seen Paradise, not until your grandfather's father had seen it! (Reported by Ahmad, Al-Hakim, Nasa'i, and Baihaqi. The scholars, however, question the validity of this hadith, claiming it is not a sound hadith, because among its narrators is Rabi'ah ibn Saif, who is not trustworthy)  Muhammad ibn Al-Hanafiyyah reported that 'Ali said: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, went out and saw a group of women sitting outside. When he asked them why they were sitting there, they told him that they were waiting for the funeral procession. He asked them: 'Are you going to wash the body?' They said: 'No.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, asked them: 'Are you going to carry the coffin?' They said: 'No.' He asked them: 'Will you place the body in the grave?'

WnOgbOmiaa	Quran is most important....    Hadith needs to be checked for authencity..Quran doesn't|`|0BHiaVZ9aa	In the name of Allah most gracious most merciful    All Muslims would agree that the Qur'an is more important and that sunnah or Hadith is the second source from which the teachings of Islam are drawn. Hadith literally means a saying conveyed to man, but in Muhaditheen's terminology Hadith means sayings of the Prophet, his action or practice of his silent approval of the action or practice. Hadith and Sunnah are used interchangeably, but sometimes these are used for different meanings.    To deal with the topic it is necessary to know the position of the Prophet in Islam, because the indispensibility of Hadith depends upon the position of the Prophet.    Analyzing the problem we can visualize three possibilities:    1. The duty of the Prophet was only to convey the message and nothing more was required from him.    2. He had not only to convey the message but also to act upon it and to explain it. But all that was for the specified period and after his death Qur'an is sufficient to guide humanity.    3. No doubt he had to convey the Divine Message but it was also his duty to act upon it and to explain it to the people. His actions and explanations are a source of guidance forever. His sayings, actions, practices and explanations are a source of light for every Muslim in every age.    The learned men of the Muslim Millat are of the unanimous view that only the third point is the correct assessment of the Prophet's position in Islam. The Qur'an contains dozens of reminders of the important position of the Prophet. For instance the Qur'an says:    "And verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good example for him who looketh unto Allah and the last day and remembereth Allah much." [Al-Ahzab 31]    According to this verse, every Muslim is bound to have the good example of the Prophet as an ideal in life. In another verse he has been made a 'Hakam' for the Muslims by Allah Almighty. No one remains Muslim if he does not accept the Prophet's decisions and judgements:    "But no, by thy Lord, they can have no real faith until they make thee judge in all disputes between them and find in their souls no resistance against thy decisions but accept them with the fullest conviction."[An-Nisa: 65]    While explaining the qualities of Muslims the Qur'an says:    "The answer of the believers, when summoned to Allah and His apostle, in order that He may judge between them, is no other than this: They say: we hear and we obey." [An-Nur: 51]    In many places the Qur'an has given its verdict on this issue. The Qur'an says:    "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger." [An-Nisa 59]    and    "Whatever the Messenger giveth you take it and whatever he forbiddeth abstain from it." [Al-Hashr: 7]    Qur'an is very clear in expressing its view on the position of the Prophet. According to the Qur'an the Prophet has four capacities and he must be obeyed in every capacity. He is Mu`allim wa Murabbee he is Shaari` one who explains the Book, he is a law-giver and judge, and he is a ruler. In all these capacities he is an ideal example for the Muslims. I am quoting a few verses of the Holy Book just to give a hint of this topic.    "Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sentamong them an apostle from among themselves rehearsing untothem the signs of Allah, sanctifying them in scripture andwisdom while, before that, they had been in manifest error." [Al-Imran: 164]    "And We have sent down unto thee the Message that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them."[An-Nahl: 44]    "For he commands them what is just and forbids them what isevil; he allows them as lawful what is good and pure andprohibits them from what is bad and impure. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them." [Al-Araf: 157]    "O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the apostle, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything amonst yourselves refer it to Allah and His Apostle, if you believe in Allah and the last day." [An-Nisa: 59]    "It is not fitting for a believer, man or woman when a matterhas been decided by Allah and His apostle to have any optionabout their decision. If any one disobeys Allah and His apostle, he is indeed on a clearly wrong path." [Al-Ahzab: 36]    In all these verses, the Qur'an has explained various aspects of the Prophets personality. One can judge the importance of the Prophet from these verses. I am reminded of another important verse of the Qur'an, which is actually a verdict against those who do not believe in Hadith as an authentic source of law:    "If any one contends with the Prophet even after guidance hasbeen plainly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that becoming to men of faith, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil refuge." [An-Nisa: 110]  ......  http://islam.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsit...|`|5PAfTUfIaa	it is very silly to say that quran is greater than the hadith...    because Allah says in the quran that whatever he wants to say, he puts it in the mouth of Muhammed(pbuh).    what  am trying to say is that, if both the quran and authentic hadith is from Allah(swt), then both the quran and the authentic hadith is of equal importance.    The quran may instruct us to pray but how and when is given only in the hadith...    the surah al burooj can never be understood without guidence from the hadith..

Abd-Allaah ibn Masood said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allaah will earn one good (hasanah) thereby.

He has described Paradise, the abode of the believers, and He has described Hell, the abode of the disbelievers. He has made it (the Quraan) an explanation of all things:   And We have sent down to you the Book (the Quraan) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allaah as Muslims)  [al-Nahl 16:89  interpretation of the meaning]   Allaah has told us in the Quraan the stories of the earlier and later generations and the creation of the heavens and the earth.

NwXnzARwaa	Same-sex couples are not asking to be recognized in the eyes of a religion, but recognized in the eyes of the law.    According to the General Accounting Office of the United States, there are 1,049 benefits, rights, and privileges only offered through legal marriage.|`|4Te5gVvDaa	So Buddhist can't get married? There are no christian gays? America is a theocracy? No one's constitutional writes are being infringed upon by subjectivity that should never have been considered by the people(not in a democratic republic). Your on partial reasoning on the accords of your religion differ from person to person. You should be far more worried on how the government has so easily circumvented this dilemma and what else they are getting away with. Not who marries who. It has no bearings to you and will have no effect on you or anyone else.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	We want to be able to have the same rights and marriage is not always religous.  Actually I'm perfectly for civil unions and do away with marriage all around. I'm sick of ther even being anything religous in our government laws at all|`|FqiA5BRraa	Its not getting married in the "eyes of religion", its getting a marriage certificate and rights we deserve, the ceremony could be religious, but marriage rights come from the government.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	What if someone is a member of a religion that accepts homosexuality? What if a person is a pagan, or a Unitarian Universalist, or belongs to a liberal denomination?    Furthermore, who said that marriage was solely a religious matter? Most of the straight people I know who want to get married, aren't doing it for religious reasons - they're doing it for personal and social reasons.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	The religion doesnt hate gays and lesbians soo badly, its the people. I personally dont want to get married and I am gay, but I do feel it should be a right because I feel its like taking a group and telling them they cant get married while everyone else can. Its like being in a classroom and the teacher tells like a group of 5 kids out of the whole class of 24 that they werent aloud outside for recess but everyone else is because the other 19 kids who are out there dont want you to be out there, dont you feel that its still wrong to keep them inside just because everyone else wants them to?    I feel religion isnt always the case for marriage anyway. My parents are straight and werent even married in a church and they werent even married by a priest, but they are still legally married, which is what we want, its our right to at least have that|`|xsZfN0JHaa	You don't have to go to a church to be married. We are a Society that equates marriage with religion. But religion isn't marriage.  OOPS! this question and  answer should go to the religions section and not here! Sorry!|`|0JmTIcy0aa	Why do straight people wanna get married?  You know the whole world isn't based on one religion?|`|hy3q2iWaaa	Gay people marry because they want to be happy with someone they love, if the case is marrying another gay person. But there are many cases like in Ukraine, there are a lot of gay people married to opposite sex because being gay is not accepted by their society. Another reason is that they want to have their own children. And it's very common around the world.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	The reason I am for gay marriage is because I believe in the Bible. The Bible does not condemn homosexuals that are in monogamous relationships. That is, if you understand the original context and that some terms have been mistranslated. I have a daughter who is a lesbian and I would love to see her married in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of God.      There is a legal aspect to it as well. I had a friend who is a lesbian who got "married" but not legally. When the woman she married decided she wanted to move on, she just pushed her and her son out the door. There was no legal recourse for her dumping the woman she had been with for 10 years! The woman who did the dumping had told my friend to stay home and take care of her son... and when she kicked her out, she barely gave her 30 days notice. She had to get a job and find a home in no time and she also did not reap any of the benefits of having been married. (Alimony or half the value of the house or even part of her partners retirement)      Marriage with the paperwork is a legal contract and an obligation. Yes, there is the divorce factor but since it is a legally binding contract, certain concessions are made when a divorce happens. Division of property etc... It also makes a couple work at their relationship instead of just deciding to drop out when they don't feel like playing house anymore. It's not as easy as just walking away. It provides some stability (which many gay/Lesbian people did not get growing up) in the relationship.|`|y4uoDjV0aa	Well... i don't want God to say I'm wrong. Of course i want people to allow this to be. God is suppose to love everyone, including me and including the girl that I want to be with. And the ones you love you always want to be happy. I want to know why God doesn't recognize me... I want a decent answer as to why they say they hate me. Because it's wrong isn't go enough, or it's not the way it's supposed to be. i will not accept those answers.|`|5RH9Osdsaa	I somewhat agree with you if you are talking about religious marriage.  The gay marriage issue, however, deals with civil marriage and is more about the rights, responsibilities and privileges of marriage in the eyes of the law.  There are hundreds of federal benefits available only to married couples and I think every one of these benefits should be extended to same-sex couples.    If the government wants to avoid confusion, I am all for calling all civil marriages a "civil union".  I just want it to be the same for same-sex as opposite-sex couples.  I think we are entitled to that bit of dignity and respect.|`|kfrWN7wQaa	I'm gay, married, and don't believe in God. Religion has nothing to do with my marriage. I am married because I want to commit myself to the person I love. It is important for my commitment to be recognized as equal to everyone else who has made a commitment of love. Not recognized by a church or a religion, but by society. I should be treated no differently.|`|46e2a496285e8eb37e4ada2aac6111b8aa	Because they're a glutton for punishment.|`|AA11139157	i want to get married to 'appear' to be normal like every other str8 person out there and to prove my love to my partner. i have spoken about marriage with my partne for i have always wanted to be married and i am gay do we have to improvize (spelling sorry).|`|59dfe741ccba056bb90441886fea3c57aa	I am so confused by people who think of marriage as religious institution. I am a woman married to a man, and religion had absolutely nothing to do with it. I'm no atheist, but I'm not a church goer either. Just because some people see marriage as some kind of religious thing, doesn't mean everyone else does. Gay people want to be married for the same reason straight people do- they are in love and ready to make a commitment to each other.     By the way, there are plenty of churches that recognize the fact that gay people are no different from straight and are happy to recognize their marriages as equal.|`|q5m9g1yWaa	Well first of all, I AM Christian, and would obviously like my love to be recognized in the eyes of God, no matter my sexual preference.    Secondly, it's not so much that they want marriage, it's that they want the same equal rights as heterosexual couples, and they want to be treated the SAME as heterosexual couples.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Gays are 'fighting' to get their Constitutional and Civil Rights...it's called EQUALITY...  Whether or not they have religious ceremonies seems irrelevant as it's the two people who marry each other...not the religious organization...all the organization does is 'officiate'...|`|1fs74nzjaa	becouse....we dont wanna feel alone...and protection too!|`|CfZn9kK5aa	A) It is not about being recognized in the eyes of a religion, but rather about getting the legal rights and protections that are offered to other couples.    B) There are many religions that support homosexual marriage, and would gladly, and eagerly perform them.|`|wBxXGASgaa	cuz they feel like it if they want let them they won't do anything to you y would u care|`|80JBvRdFaa	It's about equal rights and getting the same legal recognition and benefits that heterosexual couples receive. The problem is that marriage isn't a fundamentally Christian institution. And the so called "moral majority" looks at marriage in a strictly Judeo-Christian sense. It doesn't allow any lenience for other religions or secular beliefs. So we are being dictated marriage in the narrow sense of a man and a woman when there are obviously others that would disagree. They call it "pandering to minorities" or whatever but I don't want to live in a theocracy where someone tells me how to live my life based on their beliefs. No one can force churches to marry gay couples. That's their right according to the constitution but it isn't right to deny it to others that don't follow your faith.|`|PvJdZcZTaa	Why do straight people who aren't religious want to get married?    You make an assumption that people who get married do it for religious reasons. It's quite the opposite in fact. In the oldest of stories, histories, movies, books, etc etc people have gotten married for one thing; Love. I would make an estimate that 100% of people want to marry their partner(where that be same sex or not) because they love them. Marriage has always been a binding contract of a sort to your partner. Religion only finally comes into marriage with the location(usually) and the vows.   Another thing to take into account is what marriage means in this century. As well as the social status you get, there is also the benefits you get from a legal marriage. It's not a question of religion. It is a question of equality, legal rights, and discrimination.    Of course this is all a personal opinion. I want to someday be able to marry the person I want without having to worry about anything else except what plates to choose.

This uses more texts from a gnostic and nontraditional Christian view and then claims this is just as valid as the canonical scriptures when this has been shown to be false. Then I put more thought into it and realized that the actual accounts of healings have very little to do with anointing and is mostly just touching a person. One is even Christ spitting on the ground and then rubbing the mud into a man's eye sockets and suddenly he has eyes and can see. The facts of scripture do not match up with what this idea proposes.|`|nVYc3pc0aa	i think you have proved there a great sources for people who are chemically enhanced, nieve, idiots!|`|vJZYIGJBaa	stupid stupid stupid|`|QWr0mocnaa	Now i think Jesus was cooooooool mann..

LuN1unJ3aa	This is the infamous "Adam-God theory" sermon which is not LDS doctrine. Because of the way the Journal of Discourses was published, (in England, several years after the sermon, and from notes only), there is considerable doubt that President Young actually said that "Adam is our God and the only God with whom we have to do."    President Joseph Fielding Smith, as a church historian, addressed this same discourse and raised other points, that Adam is like a squad leader - a sergeant of a platoon, whose members report to him, and the sergeant reports the the company commander, who reports on up the line until the report eventually reaches the head of the Army. He said that considering Adam's place as the head of the human family on earth, that the troops in the platoon only have to deal with the Sergeant and that Adam is like the sergeant where the human family is concerned.    Adam is _not_ God in LDS theology, but he _is_ the head of the human family on earth and as such, is in the chain of command in that instance and situation.    Regardless of what anyone wants to make of this talk, it does not establish doctrine for the church.    From my own view, I have read the entire discourse and it is one of the most disjointed in terms of structure, that I have ever read. In addition, printer's practices of putting added material in italics (where direct notes were not available) indicate that this material, particularly the Adam-is-our-God part, (all in italics) was extrapolated by the British publishers. I see this (the statements) as an extrapolation and not a directly attributable quote.  Source(s):  Journal of Discourses, Vol 1, pages 50-51.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	I think that the method of transcribing talks was lacking and the persons are confusing (keep in mind that Young called Adam "father Adam" as the father of all living) and careful attention to this shows that he wasn't stating that Adam was God.    Young gave thousands of other speeches mentioning God, none of them even hinted that God and Adam were the same people.    He created the current temple endowment ceremony in which God and Adam are clearly separate entities.    Nice try, but your confusion on the matter doesn't change the fact that Young never once taught and clearly didn't believe what you are trying to suggest he did.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	notice at the beginning he says the elders have conflicting views so where did the authority of his homily come from|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	:It's a crock!|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Yeah they tend to ignore/ not discuss the earliest of their church history because of this stuff. Journal of Discourses is one of them. But the truth is the truth...what has been said by their prophets is as contradictory as the Bible and even more so...  Here's more of their recorded prophets you may find interestingly contradictory...  http://www.challengemin.org/adamgod.html|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	Brigham Young taught Adam-God as doctrine, he claimed God had revealed this to him, he taught it from the pulpit for thirty years and threatened to excommunicate anyone who did not accept the teaching as doctrine.  This LDS church now disavows this doctrine and will excommunicate anyone who teaches it.    So what?    Brigham Young said his sermons were equal to scripture:       "I know just as well what to teach this people and just what to say to them and what to do in order to bring them into the celestial kingdom...I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call Scripture. Let me have the privilege of correcting a sermon, and it is as good Scripture as they deserve. The people have the oracles of God continually." (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 13, p. 95.)    Brigham Young, we are told by the LDS church, was a prophet of God - God's earthly spokesman.  And yet he taught a false identity of God according to the LDS church today.  So how does a prophet of God teach the wrong identity of God, a false doctrine, for thirty years and still be considered a prophet?|`|DZNdxcnhaa	Mormon's will buy any line of crap they are fed, much like the Christians who pre date them, and the Jews who pre date them and the Zorastrians who pre date them.  Lets call it like it is. Religion is written by men who claim God told them to write it and the sheep of the land who either need something to believe in or who are threatened buy it and pass it on to their children like a genetic disorder that mutates into lunacy over time. Terror, ethnic cleansing, racism.......lunatics, all of them.  God would not approve.|`|sDNTMAkmaa	You trying to prove something with that cliffhanger at the end?    As Sofa King Weird was so kind to point out, we Mormons are obviously gullible and don't research and get a testimony for ourselves after our general authorities give talks. *sarcasm is the word of the day*  On the reverse, anti-mormons will believe anything they can get their hands on that contradicts the church. It doesn't matter if it's entirely false, if it makes them seem right, who cares?    EDIT: Awesome Old Timer! I didn't even know all of that information. I love learning new stuff. :D

QL0FOQMmaa	Yes it is wrong, and yet typical for a politician. I'd have more respect for an atheist who outright states he's an atheist and is forthright and although I wouldn't typically seek to vote for an atheist, an honest atheist who is strong in his personal convictions, who is not a toe-kisser, would have a much better chance at winning my vote, than a toe-kissing, Bible toting, pew warming liar would any day.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Sounds like politics to me....they have no integrity or morality...just a plastic shell full of sh*t.|`|41db5b486612d71aef27d2e88a94662caa	I think it's simply a reality of American politics.|`|0wUZbRguaa	Is not what you represent,is what you have in your heart.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	By definition God (He/She/It) cannot be localized.

As a church - specifically, a Christian church - we are open to all who wish to come.  Personally, my hope would be that if one were attending for reasons of image that they would eventually encounter the genuine and eternal truth of God.    As far as elected officials go - namely Obama, since that's who you are implicating - I don't elect people based on their church attendance and reasons for going.  I vote for who I think is best for America as a nation.    And yes, I voted for Obama.    God bless you.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	No i do not
BQ6WmoHiaa	No, it would be less peaceful.  True believers in God who follow His commandments are people who can only result in peace.  Those who you see leveraging religion and faith as a veil over their personal agenda are NOT believers or followers of Him.  Canceling out those who legitimately believe in Him and follow Him would only reduce peace.    Atheists make their own rules or follow what society decides.  In other words, one has to HOPE that an atheist falls upon a good moral code...or else.    God bless you.|`|E9chZY74aa	It would be gone if that were true.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I don't believe so.

Of course, as Qui-Gon points out, we would find other things to fight about.

DTog0VZWaa	Trye described the group.  For religious reasons they fight for Israel to not exist.  Meanwhile, they accept money from the Israel government (social services offered in general).    ====  The number of Arabs pre-Israel was around 250,000 NOT 2 million.  Not necessarily Muslim.  Most of the Arabs moved into the area  AFTER the Jews because of much improved conditions they brought especially economic.  That's why there was more at a later point.  In general it was mixed mutt area of people with Jews, Armenians, Beduion, Druze, Coptics, Christians of all sorts, you name it.    There is NOTHING apartheid about Israel.  It's a secular democracy & Arab Muslims are full citizens with representation in the Knesset.  PA Arabs are under the government of the Palestinian Authority -- NOT Israel.  Even the security for most is under the PA's command (except in Gaza where it's under Hamas since they couped & took it over from the PA.)  Israel loses money big time on the terroritories, so that blows the whole reason apartheid existed.  It's also why Israel tried things like unilateral withdrawal from Gaza -- but was getting missiles AS it withdrew.    The Khazar thing has long since been completely disproven as the "source of Jews."  Anyone who brings it up, is more interested in destroying Israel with garbage myths, than in peace in the region or truth of any kind.  It's sad really the lengths people will go to, to support the hate of groups like Hamas & their myths, instead of truths that could maybe really bring peaceful ideas to the Arabs (& coincidently help those Arabs who do what peace already.)    ======================  Davan  You might want to consider that in a coalition government, the smaller parties including religious have a great deal of power.  Orthodox are the deciding party in religious Jewish matters.  It is a secular democracy so that doesn't effect non-Jews -- and there are non-Jewish citizens including 1.2 Million Arab Muslims, so that's a good thing.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Scripture says that the Land will be returned to the People of Israel (the Jews) by Gd, in HIS time.  And there are those (and there aren't a lot of "groups", just individual people, who aren't organized in any specific way, because we are taught to think individually) people believe that Zionism is wrong, and, well, the cause of much trouble in the Middle East.        Then there are those who disagree with the formation of Israel as it was done, but, now, since it is done, it should stay, and be a homeland for our people who have no place otherwise to call our own.  No place of refuge when the Nazis resurface and start taking prisoners again.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I can't think of the name for them right offhand, but they believe that Israel can only be restored when the Messiah comes.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	I've never heard of anything like that|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	I forget the first part, but I'm sure that that the last part was: ____ Karta Movement.

According to The Guardian, "[e]ven among Charedi, or ultra-Orthodox circles, the Neturei Karta are regarded as a wild fringe".     The Haredi Jews were the smart ones. I dont know why they are zionists that live in israel, but not everything makes sense lol. Here some more stuff that doesnt make sense.    Israel was a brilliant idea LOL. Lets take 2 groups of people that absolutely hate each other. Lets displace a large amount of group 1 to the area around the displacement and put group 2 there LOL. Brilliant LOLLOLOLOL. Now lets outfit group 2 with updated military systems. Let them be our watchdog in group 1s area. Anything that happens badly in this area we can always blame on group 1 and 2.     You inhabit an area that displaced 2 million people you idiot. It should be obvious why people hate you. Chosen people? LOL    There is the answer you are looking for. Israel is a terrible idea.

Get ready for an asswhooping LOL.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	These are Jews from mainly Brooklyn and other parts , they are against something called Zionism, Zionism is like Jewish fundamentalism and their leaders are world bankers like the Rothschilds and powerful players in the Western media which is why you've probably never heard of it.    Some are not against Israel but call for Israel to return to its UN designated borders, like a lobbyist group called "J Street".    Israel is a Jewish state that has Zionist values, like that Gentiles or non Jews are second class citizens and has designated areas for Jews and Gentiles, like an apartheid state.   Under the table, 25 thousand Iranian Jews have been offered cash incentives to live in Israel but they have rejected the offer.  Most of the European Jews who went to Palestine are Khazar converted Jews with no heritage in the land of Palestine or Hebrew blood.  Zionists are the dishonest version of the KKK.|`|iraiRVT1aa	Hello the  answer for Tyreeisme,(answer got deleted accidentally) I think you mean Naturei Karta and other ultra -orthodox groups who believe Israel should be the work of G-D not man.

R9Wfv6Rbaa	Yes, I believe vampires are real, although twilight does not represent vampires realistically of course. Vampires are real - they look and act like normal people but have a carnal craving for blood, a need that causes pain. People also say that vampires feed off of energy, but blood is the most direct source of energy. They can go out during the day, although they're just more sensitive to sunlight than others.     A big difference between vampires and normal people is that normal people cannot digest blood whereas vampires can - after consuming enough their skin gets a pinker colour, also vampires do not suffer from iron posioning after consuming blood, unlike normal people.     Hope this helps you and many others.|`|bmoCpcdraa	know days them bloodsuckers are called lawyers|`|94PHAJw9aa	I don't believe.

91hxNCfWaa	I've actually heard this exact question before, but in the parenting section. Have you asked this before by any chance?    The only thing I could suggest is sitting down with Nicole and do your best to explain the situation. Maybe take her to a therapist, who can explain the situation better to her and help her understand.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Not a thing, they'll figure it out.

By posting twice, it seems you are bound and determined to get into this family problem, stir things up and make it worse.  You really should cool your jets.|`|StJGeiFyaa	probably nothing. stay out of it.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Why do you keep asking this same question over and over?  I'm sure I've answered it several times before I caught on.  Have you just not found your answer yet?  I mean, the wording is even exactly the same.      You can't do anything to help a sick child.  Only a doctor can help a sick child.  Of course her parents comfort her and her sister as much as possible, that doesn't make them spoiled.  They sound like normal children facing a difficult family problem.|`|yaaNbLeyaa	If you live near where they do, perhaps you should take little Nicole out and spend time with her.  Make her feel special and have fun with just the two of you.  Yes, she might be spoiled but she's too young to understand cancer and everything that goes with it - all she sees is the stepsister getting all the attention.  Not only will it make Nicole feel better, you'll be taking one of the kids off the parent's already full hands.  Taking care of someone with cancer is exhausting.

gWOQd9Xcaa	No one can be held responsible for other peoples sin.  ur sin is urs and his sin is his.      I believe in Jesus (PBUH-Peace Be Upon Him)   Jesus(PBUH) healed lepers.   Jesus(PBUH) caused the blind to see.   Jesus (PBUH) raised the dead.                            But this all was by the will of God the one and only,  as mentioned in Mark 12:32 -   "And the scribe said unto him, 'Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is One God; and there is none other but He.' "                           So I believe Jesus(PBUH) did all this miracles by the will of the only 1 true God(the father).  as Jesus (PBUH) said in John 5:30                 "I can of mine own self do nothing"    Jesus(PBUH) DID NOT DIE but was raised up to the Heavens.  Jesus is the Messiah. ( A Messenger of the only true God)  ? "The woman (from Sumaria) said to him (Jesus-P*), 'I know that Messiah is coming; when he comes, he will show us all things. 'Jesus said to her, 'I, who speak to you, am he'" (John 4: 25-26).     The thought that Jesus (PBUH) is God or the son of God or de 1 in  trinity,, as for this I believe is a man made game.    SHALOM SALAM PEACE|`|E9chZY74aa	He was God.  Yes, His physical body, the same one you have, died.

Why he was sentenced to death was because he came down as a poor king. All people know that to be a king you have to be rich, but jesus didn't show that because cherishing money is nothing later it will vanish, so he was killed for that. he is the real King.|`|kRkTaJHwaa	Lets consider the situation...  Wouldn't it have been safer if Jesus had been sent to the world during modern times... when his message would be spread across the whole world via internet and modern TV. A modern democratic country wouldn't nail anyone to a cross for professing what they believe.    No god sent jesus to the earth as a sacrifice. Jesus had the opportunity to escape, but he didn't. Thank God for that.|`|r8rykCkGaa	He willingly died for our sins.  He was the only one who could do this.  He was the perfect Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.    God the Father in Heaven did not die, His son in flesh died physically a man's death..It is a sacrifice in that Christ did not owe a debt...He paid our debt for us.     The sacrifice of animals has been since the beginning. It illustrates how deadly sin is. Adam and Eve needed to be clothed because of their disobedience, animal skins were provided...They never would have been needed if not for their actions.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	How can you talk as if he was a real person that existed?!!    There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!

Luke 22:3, Jesus was identified to his enemies with a kiss from Judas Iscraiot, so he died.  Heb.2:9,14, Jesus has a very good reason, he does away with the cause of death, he came to give life, 1Cor.15:22-28,51-53, to his firstfruits the heavenly first, then they give life to the earthly all are for the new heavens and the new earth.|`|I11BEwi5aa	exactly|`|yegDdZfRaa	I don't think you know the entire story, nor do you understand. There are several instances where He could have escaped or talked His way out of His death - but He did it for YOU. Why is that so hard to accept?    Here's an excerpt from Matthew 27:    11 Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" So Jesus said to him, "It is as you say." 12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing. 13 Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?" 14 And He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.     15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished. 16 And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 17 Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?" 18 For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy. 19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him." 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. 21 The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!" 22 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let Him be crucified!" 23 Then the governor said, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they cried out all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!" 24 When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see to it." 25 And all the people answered and said, "His blood be on us and on our children." 26 Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.    He died for you. It's your choice whether to accept the truth or reject it. I hope you accept it.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Wow. You really showed everyone that you don't pay attention very well.   When Jesus said "Father, why hast thou forsaken me?"... HE was quoting Scripture !  He was still teaching from the cross.  Jesus is the Son of GOD, the Father, thus making Him God, the Son.  He didn't say, If you have seen me, you've seen GOD.....  He said, "If you have seen me, You have seen the Father.  I can say this about my own son.  He looks exactly like me, only a lot younger.    You can't compare human pain to animal pain. Especially due to a blood sacrifice to Almighty GOD.   I can assure you that GOD let none of his animals that were to be slain as sacrifices suffer.    Besides all of that, GOD and Jesus can do whatever they want to. They don't need your opinion or your permission.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	He didn't do anything for me.

Mnm35sjNaa	The bible writers were not really versed on the doctrine of free will which was a new concept and hadn't spread much outside of Greece. They undoubtedly believed in determinism, as most of the world did, at that time. This ignorance, by the Gospel writers, of free will is best revealed in the Lords Prayer. There are 2 lines in it which confirm predestination -- not free will:    1) "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"  2) "And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil"    The concept of free will didn't exist until about the 4th century B.C.  The Old Testament was written before the concept of free will existed. Free will developed out of the concept of freedom, which Socrates and Plato elucidated somewhat. Aristotle added a moral element to free will. Even then, the doctrine of free will, in all its ramifications, took a while for others to work out in just its basic form. At the time of Jesus, free will was still a fuzzy concept. The church was established in 326 A.D., after the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. Clearly, as the council decided what to include in the bible, free will was not part of their thinking. In fact, free will didn't receive any formal attention until St. Augustine, almost 400 years after Jesus.  By then, it was too late to edit the Bible for free-will contradictions.    According to the Catholic Encyclopedia:    "The question of free will, moral liberty, or the liberum arbitrium of the Schoolmen, ranks amongst the three or four most important philosophical problems of all time. It ramifies into ethics, theology, metaphysics, and psychology. The view adopted in response to it will determine a man's position in regard to the most momentous issues that present themselves to the human mind. On the one hand, does man possess genuine moral freedom, power of real choice, true ability to determine the course of his thoughts and volitions, to decide which motives shall prevail within his mind, to modify and mould his own character? Or, on the other, are man's thoughts and volitions, his character and external actions, all merely the inevitable outcome of his circumstances? Are they all inexorably predetermined in every detail along rigid lines by events of the past, over which he himself has had no sort of control? This is the real import of the free-will problem.    . . . Free Will and the Christian Religion    The problem of free will assumed quite a new character with the advent of the Christian religion. The doctrine that God has created man, has commanded him to obey the moral law, and has promised to reward or punish him for observance or violation of this law, made the reality of moral liberty an issue of transcendent importance. Unless man is really free, he cannot be justly held responsible for his actions, any more than for the date of his birth or the color of his eyes. All alike are inexorably predetermined for him. Again, the difficulty of the question was augmented still further by the Christian dogma of the fall of man and his redemption by grace. St. Paul, especially in his Epistle to the Romans, is the great source of the Catholic theology of grace.    Catholic Doctrine    Among the early Fathers of the Church, St. Augustine stands pre-eminent in his handling of this subject. He clearly teaches the freedom of the will against the Manich?eans, but insists against the Semipelageians on the necessity of grace, as a foundation of merit. He also emphasizes very strongly the absolute rule of God over men's wills by His omnipotence and omniscience--through the infinite store, as it were, of motives which He has had at His disposal from all eternity, and by the foreknowledge of those to which the will of each human being would freely consent. St. Augustine's teaching formed the basis of much of the later theology of the Church on these questions, though other writers have sought to soften the more rigorous portions of his doctrine."    The dominance of determinism was almost total in the ancient world and its inclusion in the Bible is yet another sign that the Bible is NOT divinely inspired. It is scripture written by ancient men from ancient societies with ancient ignorances. Apologists have been "interpreting" away problems, like free will, for centuries and are continuing to do so.

God tells Adam:    "but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die." (Genesis 2:17)    The "knowledge of good and evil" is free will. The only thing that free will stands for is CHOICE. God knew that if humans had free will or 'choice', we would be susceptible to Satan's seduction of his "sugar-coated" lies that lead to anguish, misery, suffering, and the torment of evil. The most important reason that God warned Adam about that particular tree, was that He did not want us to die, as the penalty for eating its fruit was death - and was not negotiable.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Because it was written by MEN in the MIDDLE EAST.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	What bible are you getting this from?|`|AA11604732	Because it wasn't written in English|`|AA11616515	Its not free will, its free Willie, the whale that ate Jonah - we need to free him.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	It is not there  because it is a lie ; how can we have free will and be a slave to sin?|`|a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	you are right, it is not in the bible, and therefore, it is not god's word.

jjt2enntaa	I cannot think of a reason elders should have yearly drivers tests.  Just like everyone else, not all elders are high risk drivers.  I think that is very biased thinking.    maybe a better idea would be to have all people under the age of 30 have annual drivers tests.  I believe that group is higher risk than elders.  Either way, I think it is a bad idea to demand yearly tests for anyone.   The only fair way, that I can see, is to every 10 years or so everyone gets retested.  But even then, what's the point.  You can pass a drivers test and still be the worst driver on the road.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	What are 3 reasons why this question comes up all the time?  They drive because the law allows it.

AA11440601	These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.

ALL it is is that some nutty folks got a hold of a Mayan calendar and decided to make up crazy stories about it. The Mayan calendar is hundreds of years old and was made in a CIRCLE. A circle has to end somewhere, and based on the size of the calendar, it happened, totally by coincidence, to end in the year 2012.

And how does this end of the world theory compare with others? Well if you look at y2k, 6/6/06, or other ridiculous theories, they aren't backed up by ancient knowledge from around the world. Y2k was science fiction and 6/6/06 isn't the date, it is the number of a name, an evil guy ya know, already happened like a long time ago.  This is when the Mayan Calendar ends. These were a people who predicted very precise things, much dealing with astronomy. They were fascinated with the heavens. Their beliefs very much revolved around finding the meaning of their place on earth or when there will be the end. Civilizations across the world prophesied very similar beliefs that the date of December 21, 2012 will be the end. The I Ching for example, created by the Chinese, is a fortune teller used by coins, to depict certain outcomes. These outcomes, can be mapped across a graph. Disturbingly enough, a man...I don't know his name but has fitted every major point or time in history onto this. With the date and time set along the graph, strangely it ends on December 21, 2012. Many prophets such as Merlin or Nostradamus, had foreseen the end, seeing visions of our time. So many years ago, how would these civilizations come in contact or even create such identical information? But also, the solar system will complete a 25,000 year cycle aligning us with the central plane of the galaxy. No one knows what will happen.

You may hear "?Qu caliente que est ese pibe!" (How hot that guy is!) or mina (girl, but it's quite vulgar), but even most used: "?Qu bueno que ests!" (literally "how good you are!", meaning "you look very good" or "you're hot")|`|pnxzK1nhaa	He is hot=Es caliente  Hot girl= Chica caliente  Hot guy=Chico caliente|`|tQsxsuNPaa	?l me gusta!     or just ?Qu guapo!|`|CzYbvApraa	"estas calientes"

My friend got  assistance for caring for her mother and also a visiting nurse to do medications and a practical nurse to do other patient care for her, like wash the patient, feed her and clean the bedding, etc.  They also paid for a nursing home for the mom finally then bought a hospital bed for the mom to be brought home to live again.  There 's an 800 number for social security and have the soc. numbers when you call.|`|9eMB6BZ6aa	Not likely,unless you use first response.
