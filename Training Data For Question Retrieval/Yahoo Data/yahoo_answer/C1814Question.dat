Any input would be much appreciated. I also would like tips on the best security systems to protect my computer from viruses and such. **I do have a budget, but I would rather the input be based on the notion that money is no object. I would rather know the best computer, not the best computer under a certain dollar amount. Thank you for your help.

20081022150756AAGxNqm	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How do I make a file "uncopyable"?	Here is my mission:      I have a friend who owns a burglar alarm/fire protection business. He has an engineer that creates blueprints of buildings with either a burglar alarm system or sprinkler system installed. Sometimes both.       What my friend would like to know is if there is anyway possible that his engineers can open a floorplan, make changes, re-save the file to the hard drive, but not allow that file to be copied to anything else.      He is running Windows XP Professional SP2 (I know there is SP3 available but he doesn't have it YET!)      He is just leery of people stealing all the blueprints that his firm has created and either using them somewhere else or presenting them as work of his firm with sub-par work on them as to sabotage his business.       Putting a windows log-on password and making the folders "private" is not going to work. The engineers need to get on their computers without having the boss log them on. He really wants them not to know that they can't copy those blueprints unless they try...then obviously they will know.       Does anyone know of any software or a way that WINXP will make a file "uncopyable"?

20070513224941AAT63oe	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Wonder if my hard drive is about to fail?	My computer has been acting up lately. I reformatted my boot drive a few weeks ago because of a Trojan I could not get rid of any other way. Worked fine for a week or so. Now is slowing up again. Defragged about a week ago. Drive was badly fragmented, this only a short while after re installing windows. Have run several virus scans, spyware scans. Everything seems clean. Ran a Western Digital Hard disc diagnostic, came up ok. One read error. Just checked the fragmentation again and it is fragmented as bad as I have everf seen it. This only a couple of weeks after last defrag. The dirive is not used that much to save stuff to. I have another drive I use mostly for storage, deleting, moving files etc. I am suspecting that my boot drive is about to fail. I only have zone alarm and anyDVD  and my AV set to run on startup. The drive is over 3 years old but I dont want to go through the hassle of buying a new hard drive and reinstalling windows again unless I have to. What do  you all think?

Tipo, preciso fazer edi??o de vídeos, exemplo este clipe  http://youtube.com/watch?v=jf2Xh1TGAVU  Touch ih - Busta Rhymes feat. Cia   Por que este?

Ah, claro que a música também é show!   Mas tipo, se vocês observarem bem no vídeo, ele é um cara com uma camera na m?o filmando os rappers, o resto é tudo computador, ai eu gostaria de um programa que fizesse coisas um pouco parecidas, a exemplo de aparecer o cara aqui normal e um outro dele mesmo no fundo, pois tenho um grupo de hip-hop, só que nóis já compomos as músicas, e tá na hora dos vídeos,  só que queremos fazer desses tipos, pois onde moramos n?o fica legal filmar um clipe!   rsrsrs   Ou melhor, fica, só que n?o queremos, pois se repararem todos os vídeos brasileiros s?o fracos em edi??o!   E a nossa música tá ótima, tá tipo as gringas!   Só tá faltando vídeo com qualidade!

These names include first name, last name, and some include middle initials. An example is: Smith, George, C. I need a function that puts the middle initial if there is one or returns a blank value if there isn't. So far I have: =IF(RIGHT(B8, 2)=" ", 0, RIGHT(B8, 1)), where B8 is a name. It works for those with middle initials, however for those without it just gives the first letter of their first name. How do I fix this function? Thank you.
20090205125647AAGzL63	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Need a new computer what is best Rebuilt vs New?	I am not the greatest with hardware. I have had the same computer, no upgrades, for 6 yrs and it is just about dead. I do not need a "gaming" computer. I am just looking to go online, download games from iwin and maybe play a game like Sims. Right now my computer can't even handle Sims or some of the games on IWin.       Here is my question - I have been looking at new computers which will run me about 600 - 650 USD. My mom suggested that I go to a mom and pop computer shop and buy a rebuilt computer. I am very hesitant to do this for a few reasons. I feel that I am less likely to be taken advantage of at a larger chain like Dell or BJ's. Any thoughts?      Also, what if the thing breaks down. In this economy these mom and pop places are going out of business left and right. Is it true that I could probably get a rebuilt computer for 200 dollars?

How can I remove/delete the Windows 98 and previous version of XP from my pc without upsetting the current version that I just installed.      Thanks

I have 4 other videos like this, and none of them have been deleted, all from the same game. I used the song Pinch Me by the BNL in the video that got deleted... Did it get deleted because of the song? It's an old song.. I've used more current ones and they've been fine. If so, I lost the file on my computer so now I only have it on my ipod, and I worked hard on it. I'm very angry that youtube just randomly took it down without telling me.

20090203041613AATwNmn	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	My Mom gave me her old computer, she lost the manual & recovery disk, is it safe to do a full system restore?	My Mom just bought a new computer & gave me her old one. This one is probably over 5 years old. She likes to download lots of music, videos, games & other stuff so it's kind of slow. I tried uninstalling programs, but it's still slow, it freezes & does this critical error warning sound for no reason, so I was thinking of doing a full system restore. She had a virus a couple of years ago & had her computer serviced by Nerds on Call. The computer is an emachines Windows XP, model #T3985, 340 Intel Celeron D Processor 340, 80GB hard drive, DVD+/-RW 16x Double Layer Drive, 512MB, 2.93GHz      She didn't have any of the paperwork or a system recovery disk, so I was wondering will it work if hit F11 & do a full system restore or since it has been serviced by a company other than emachines will it do more damage than good? I don't really want to have to spend more money on the computer since it is working, so I'm trying to figure out what is the simplest way to get it back to the way it was when she bought it or is that even possible? Since it has been serviced before does the full system restore option even work anymore?

My page doesnt let others see/view my blogs and I know how to MAKE a clickable link but when I click "manage blog" then "go to my blogs" and put the URL in the code it makes people who click it go to THEIR blogs.

20090205140627AA5JCva	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Whick CPU is better? Q8200, or Q6600?	I am going to get a new CPU to replace my stonaged Pentium D.   I have two good ideas on what to get:   The Q6600 -    http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/Intel-Cor...    65NM core, 1066MHz FSB, 2.4 GHz, 8MB cache      Or the Q8200: http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/Intel-Cor...    45NM core, 1333MHz FSB, 2.3GHz, 4MB of cache      I'm not sure which one to get because the Q8200 has got a 45NM core, and a faster FSB, but the Q6600 has got more cache, and a slightly faster core clock.      I am also thinking about overclocking, but i'm not to sure about it, since the last time i did it on an old AMD Athlon 64, the FSB caught fire, and the CPU melted itself to the socket, so could anyone offer some suggestions about overclocking too, and which would be more stable  when overclocked.      My current PC specs-   Intel Pentium D 935 (2 cores @ 3.20GHz - 800MHz FSB)   XFX nForce 680i LT SLI   EZCOOL 700Watt PSU   XFX 9600GSO 768MB Graphics card   XFX 8600GT 1GB Graphics card (Running the nVidia physX thingy)   2.5TB HDD space (across 4 HDD)   2x DVD drives   Antec 900 case

20090205161259AA00zs6	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Im making a web site and need to know how to redirect my ip to ip/index.html?	OK,      I have my IP (24.206.152.52) and when I type it into my browser I get the WAMP5 homepage. If I type 24.206.152.52/index.html it displays what I want which is my website. Now what I want is to redirect 24.206.152.52 to 24.206.152.52/index.html OR make 24.206.152.52 my websites homepage. Now at the moment I'm using a free Template just to know if it's working properly. So if if you go to it you will see some crappy website.      If you don't understand what I'm talking about here's an example.      if you type "googel.com" into your web browser it redirects it to "google.com". This is what I want.      I've configured port fowarding and put my private IP on the DMZ so I know it can be seen by others. Let me know if you can see my web page.
