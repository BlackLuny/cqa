6difexIJaa	Yes but there's lots of evil things (virus, trojan, malware) that may come with that.  I recommend this:<br>  <br>  You rip your copy of the cd to the harddrive using programs like "Alcohol".  This will create a .iso file.  Which is basically your cd on the computer.  Then you download Daemon Tools <--(spelled right).  Once you download that, you can open the .iso file in Daemon Tools and emulate the cd spinning in the drive, without it actually being in the computer.  <br>  <br>  I find this method lots better than a crack.|`|1uDsQdljaa	First you'll need <br>  (if you don't, im not sure how experienced you are with cracking software)<br>  <br>  1.

AA11084698	You want to downgrade your PSP<br>  <br>  To downgrade your PSP to custom firmware you must…<br>  <br>  1) First format your memory stick (Whether your PSP is a slim or a fat).  [Warning: Formatting your Memory stick will delete EVERYTHING on the Memory stick. I recommend that you backup all of your files by copying them to your computer. You can put everything back later]<br>  <br>      a. To format your memory stick, just plug your PSP into the computer using the USB cable.<br>      b. Click “My Computer”<br>      c. Right-click your PSP. (On the computer, you will see it as a “removable disk”. On my computer, it’s called ‘Removable Disk (H:)’ However, yours may be different)<br>      d. Scroll down and click format…<br>      e. Make sure you select : File system: FAT32<br>      f. Click Format.<br>  2) Now your memory stick should be cleared of all its files.<br>      a. Keeping your PSP plugged into the computer, Click my Computer.<br>      b. Open to your PSP. (Now you should see nothing, since you formatted it.)<br>      c. Now, create a new folder and name it “PSP”. [Without the quotes and all capital letters]<br>      d. Now double click PSP and create a new folder inside of PSP. Name it “GAME” [Without the quote and all capital letters. It is “GAME”. Do not name it “GAMES”. There is no “S”.]<br>      e. Now download this file:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96630083/pan3xx_Rev3.rar" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96630083/pan...</a><br>  <br>  To extract this file, you will need a program like “WinRAR”. If you don’t already have it, download it from <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm</a><br>  <br>      f. Now once you downloaded it, Extract the folder onto the desktop. The folder is called PAN3XX_R3.<br>      g. Once you have the folder, move this folder into the “GAME” Folder you created a few minutes ago.<br>      h. Now download this file:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96635073/150.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96635073/150...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96632174/340.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96632174/340...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96636306/371.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96636306/371...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96638006/380.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96638006/380...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/195156516/UPDATE.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/195156516/UP...</a><br>  <br>  <br>       i. Now place all of these files into the “root of your PSP”. That just means to place all the files into your PSP. Do not put them into the PSP file. Do not put them into the GAME folder. Just put them into the PSP.<br>      j. Now, disconnect your PSP from the computer.<br>      k.  Go into the GAMES underneath the PSP menu and click memory stick. You should see a program called PANDORA INSTALLER<br>      l. Launch the program<br>      m. Ignore all the weird messages and just find your way to the main menu.<br>      n. Go down to “Install a DDCv7 MagicStick (For Fat + Slim) and click it<br>      o. After it finishes installing, go back to the main menu and go down to battery options.<br>      p. Click it and chose to “make battery Pandora”<br>      q. After that is complete you can quit.<br>      r. VOW-LAH! You have a magic memory stick and a Pandora battery.<br>      s. Now, take out the battery from the back of your PSP. <br>      t. While holding down the “Down-arrow button”, carefully put the Battery back into the PSP.<br>      u. Once the PSP turns on, you should be on a screen where you can downgrade your PSP.<br>      v. Install 4.01 M33 Firmware.<br>      w. Now you have custom firmware. Congrats.  <br>      x. Wanna download games and applications? I suggest <br>  <br>  www.PSPISO.com|`|NqW6yCrpaa	hey!<br>  do you want it as an emulator or to burn it for PSP. cause you cant burn psp games the disk is too small (the center hole) so if you want it for windows or computer version (play in the computer) you can go to <a href="http://www.coolrom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolrom.com/</a>   **or**   <a href="http://www.emuparadise.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emuparadise.org/</a> and download the emulator (if they have it) and you will need WINrar to open the folder or WINzip.
Aw2KS5swaa	The stickers should still fit, because almost all 3x3 stickers are a pretty standard size, so size shouldn't be a problem. However, if for some reason they don't fit, you can buy a standard Rubik's cube at like Target or Walgreen's, that's where I've always gotten my regular Rubik's cubes. <br>   <br>  If you want a really nice cube though, you should check online. Sites like cube4you.com sell a large variety of good cubes, all of higher quality than standard Rubik's cubes, but of a slightly higher cost when shipping is included. Sorry, i'm a collector, you probably didn't need this second part.

6N3yjlXhaa	Yes it will do what you want.  I had a similar model and used it for almost 30 years, sewing just about everything from spandex to auto upholstery.<br>  <br>  This is just a how to thread graphic, but the site also has manuals - <a href="http://www.sewusa.com/Threading_Diagrams/Threading_Pages/Singer_Sewing_Machine_Threading/singer_600_threading_diagram.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sewusa.com/Threading_Diagrams...</a>|`|fvre0o9laa	The touch and swears can be a bit balky, and many of them are difficult to repair now.  I've not dug into a 600 to see what it's particular foibles are, but I wouldn't recommend the touch and sew series machines that I've tried for something this heavy.  If you're just looking for something that is cheap and easy for straight stitching, look around for a Singer 127, 15, 66 or 99 that's still in running shape.  Around here, they go for $0-20 at garage sales, $20-50 at thrift shops.|`|AA10269450	You lucked out as many Touch and Throws are not worth the effort and wouldn't do the job due to their plastic gears. BUT... your 600 is one of the last Singer models to still have steel gears and should be fully capable of light leather and webbing. Leather is iffy so be sure you have the correct needle (for leather), thread and tensions. You will have to set it up on scrap materials first. Do an internet search for setting it up for what you want to sew. Techs don't like Touch and Sews mainly because of the plastic gears breaking and its a bigger job than the machine is worth. Also the self-winding bobbin mechanism is hard to adjust. With heavier thread for what you want to do I would wind the bobbins on something else if it doesn't work well.<br>  You will not be able to hurt this machine, it will give up if the job is too heavy but it won't break.|`|PHKXThDNaa	Hi! <br>  I think that most machines are strong enough as long as you use a chisel point needle for leather. The standard point will work fine for the nylon strap.<br>  <br>  Newer machines have a feature that allows you to adjust for thickness. As the presser foot raises you loose tension on the bobbin thread and this feature (usually a button of some sort that you press in) resets the tension for the different thickness.<br>  <br>  Button hole thread is thicker and will still work in regular sewing machines. It can be found in most any fabric store.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Michael

gvRunxCaaa	Ummm....<br>  first of all, every time a pokemon levels up, every stat is raised by either 1, 2 or 3. Sometimes, it doesn't raise. It depends on the pokemon, AND its nature. for example, a scyther, is good at attack, but is not good at Special attack. Like a Chansey is good at sp. defense, but it bad at practically everything else. You could use Chansey for healing, using moves like wish, stuff like that.  and that's JUST the pokemon.<br>  Examples of natures are if your pokemon is adamant, it is good at attack, but suckish on sp. attack. probably the best nature for a scyther :P<br>  To level up your pokemon, you have to defeat pokemon, trained or wild. If your pokemon is level 50, train by defeating the elite four. <br>  <br>  btw, scyther evolves when it is traded while holding a metal coat into scyther<br>  <br>  <br>  PICK ME PLZ=)|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The pokemon has to be defeated to gain the ev. And no, the pokemon and way you get the ev's does not matter. They all count. You don't need to fill one stat at a time nor do you have to battle the same pokemon every time. Everything is counted. If you attach the macho brace ev gain is doubled. Same with pokerus. If the pokemon has both the macho brace and pokerus then ev gain is quadrupled. If a power item is attached it doesn't matter what you battle you will get 4 ev's for the stat the power item is meant for. And if your pokemon has pokerus than the power item gives 8 ev's for that particular stat.<br>  <br>  The pokemon you have at lvl. 50 ev's slots have been filled and therefore cannot be ev trained. The pokemon has to be fresh for ev training to be fully effective. Fresh as in just hatched or caught and never used in a battle.
OZ0DgzrJaa	That's really you DM's call.  <br>  <br>  I've had a DM that would defiantly say no, saying the weight is what drops the bonus, not the hand.  Another of my DM's would go, "Why not?" because it increases the AC of what is supposed to be a tank class.<br>  <br>  If there is ever an official ruling on this, however, I'd guess that it would be against.  The Warforge and SowrdMage aren't supposed to be on the same world after-all, not that I think anyone is going to be a stickler for that.  (I play a Living Forgotten realms game with a Warforge and my local groups have no problem with it.)<br>  <br>  Regardless what your DM's rule however, remember that the bonus is +1 AC, +3 if the other hand is free.  You still get the +1 bonus regardless!

crhJLuw5aa	It's totally different for every casino. It depends upon how busy they are, how many tables they have, how many decks they use on each table, how often they change the cards;and the policies of the casino itself. <br>  <br>    For example, one casino might have all single deck blackjack tables, and change the cards every two hours, which means that each table goes through 12 decks per day.<br>    The casino next door might be all single deck, change the cards every two hours, but use automatic shuffle machines. A table using shuffle machines typically uses two different decks; while one deck is being played, the other one is being shuffled. This means that each table would use 24 decks per day.<br>    The casino next door to THAT one might have all 6-deck shoes, & change the cards once a day, which means that each table goes through 6 decks a day.<br>    So, as you can see; the possibilities are pretty much endless.There are even some casinos in northern Nevada that use 4 to 8 decks, and change the cards only once a week.

You can usually rent a marker for pretty cheap if you're interested in running around outside all day and shooting people (who later respawn).<br>  <br>  As for sports, track, cross country, volleyball, all of those were good ideas. There was a girl who was on my wrestling team back in high school. She never really wrestled, she opted out of it, but she was in fantastic shape.

If shes on the spot. I dunno. Im not so good at this question.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Tell your mom that Karate is a Japanese art of self-defense in which sharp blows and kicks are administered to pressure-sensitive points on the body of an opponent.<br>  <br>  Martial art in which an attacker is disabled by crippling kicks and punches. Emphasis is on concentration of as much of the body's power as possible at the point and instant of impact. Striking surfaces include the hand (particularly the knuckles and the hand's outer edge), ball of the foot, heel, forearm, knee, and elbow. In sporting matches (usually lasting about three minutes) and in sparring, blows and kicks are stopped short of contact. Performances are scored by a panel of judges. Karate evolved in East Asia over a period of centuries, becoming systematized in Okinawa in the 17th century, probably by people forbidden to carry weapons. It was imported into Japan in the 1920s and spread from there to other countries.<br>  <br>  It is not a boys sport, and would actually profit you. Tell her to open her mind. <br>  <br>  If your mom is going to restrict you from everything because she is worried about it being more boyish rather than you enjoying yourself then that is her perrogative & I wish you the best of luck with that one.|`|exYJISb3aa	Welll you actually probably do always play on the computer.

28WJwHf4aa	Here you go:<br>  <br>  There are many ways that you can make an ouija board, that’s the beauty of it all! I normally just make mine out of card. That was until I bought a glow in the dark one off Ebay, but I’ve not noticed any real difference in terms of response between them. You do NOT have to invest in a “real” ouija board to start, you can easily do it yourself!<br>  <br>  You’ll need<br>  <br>  A pair of scissors<br>  An A4 sheet of card (or bigger)<br>  A pen or a marker<br>  A glass or a penny.<br>  Some paste (optional)<br>  <br>  Start by writing out all of the letters in a row. Make sure that the characters are large enough to read. I recommend using two rows instead of cramping all of them into one row. <br>  <br>  In the row below that write out all of the numbers 0-9. <br>  <br>  You’ll also need to write out “Yes”, “No” and “Goodbye” symbols, which will make communicating with the spirits easier. <br>  <br>  In past seances I’ve used others phrases which were specific to the spirit I was trying to contact. <br>  <br>  Once you’ve finished writing out the characters, numbers and phrases, begin to cut out them out neatly, ensuring that you keep them in seperate piles (believe me, this will save you some bother in the long run!) <br>  <br>  You can skip this step if you don’t want to create a permanent board at this time. Apply paste to the back of each character and leave it to sit for a few seconds before affixing it to the board. Have a look below at the various ways you can lay it out. Remember there are no hard and fast rules for laying out the Ouija, it should just be as accessible for both you and the spirit as possible.<br>  <br>  OR you can just purchase it at Target, Walmart, Games by James, eBay, Amazon....|`|Qas05nZraa	get a piece of board and write the words yes and no and the drawing of sun and moon on top and write all the letters of the alphabet and all the numbers from 1-10 and write the word goodbye|`|0x9WHALNaa	I would not make one.....seriously!!!!

M9FQSKRwaa	holding two strands of a size 4 yarns would make a size 5 yarn or a bulky weight yarn.<br>  <br>  How big you want the blanket will determine how many stitches you need to cast on.|`|AA12042448	Practice a bit with the double yarn and knit a swatch.  Cast on 15 or so stitches and knit until your piece is about 3" or 4" long.  Use a ruler and measure 4" across the middle.  Count the stitches in 4" (going across) of your swatch.  Divide by 4.  (It may seem easier to measure just one inch's worth of stitches, but it honestly is not, since your answer may not be a whole number.)  Figure out how wide a throw should be (48" x 54" and 54" x 60" are common sizes.)  Multiply the width by the number of stitches you get per inch.  That's how many you should cast on.<br>  <br>  If you get 2 stitches per inch and want your trhow to be 48" wide, cast on 96 stitches.<br>  <br>  If you use the stockinette stitch, your edges will curl.  They will.  For a flat item you'll need to use the seed stitch or the garter stitch or an alternating pattern of mixed knit and purl.  (For example, if you do k4p4 all the way across and p4k4 all the way back, then change every few rows, you'll get a fun checkered pattern that will lay flat.)

Super smash bros melee was best for gamecube and super smash bros brawl will rule the Wii.|`|5yBAMbIZaa	get it and get the gamecube controller as well you can use it with the wii it works just fine. and its way easier to play that way|`|BxvHkvcZaa	If you only get one game for the Wii, this is the game to get. It is great, and even after a year of it being out, I still play it (although not as much, but how many games are you playing a year after they came out?). <br>  <br>  P.S. Anything that inputs to the Wii as a controller works in smash bros, so that makes it that much better.|`|iJjN3KrLaa	Yes you should. I don't even like fighting games, but I like Brawl, it's that good. I prefer the original controller, but if you want to use the remote, that's fine.|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Honestly i liked SSB for the gamecube twice as much. The reaction time for the wii's version is too slow. hope i helped.|`|Us7LWF0baa	well I think that you should buy Super Smash Bros. Brawl b/c its extremely fun, I play with a GameCube controller and my friends play with the Wii-mote and Nunchuck, and others play with jst the Wii-mote. It all depends on what you think is better. one of my friends use to play with the gamecube controller but then switch to using the Wii-mote b/c he thought it was easier to use. You should buy the game and c if you like playing with the Wii-mote and nunchuck, or jst the Wii-mote. Then if you don't like playing with either u can go borrow a Gamecube controller from a friend or go to buy a "used" Gamecube controller from gamestop, then if u find out that u like the other controllers better you can return it, it can only be returned within 7 days usually.|`|HisG2qnTaa	Yes because it is a great game to play. When i heard that Brawl was coming out I thought the Controller would be the wii one. But it turn out that you can use the game cube Controller the play. The game cube Controller is a lot better to play with i think so that is why i use it all the time. Oh and if you get Nintendo WFC then you can play with other people around the world and even your friends so if i where you i would get it!|`|uIP1muT2aa	yeah you shoult get it.  it has a story mode which is ok.  but it also has the dual thing and you get new characters as you go.  you can use the wii remote, but you should get the nunchuck.  i think that it's easier.|`|PMuzO1LNaa	well if u like the ssm series then yea. the wii can use gamecube controllers but i dont think n64 controllers will work with the wii.|`|KBTk6V4Jaa	Its really fun, but it isn't motion activated, its like using a gamecube controller. Idk if thats a good or bad thing to you.|`|S7SKSXhBaa	Yes, its the must own game if u have a wii. the controllers for the wii are okay but i recommend the gamecube controllers|`|mWtjr1Lsaa	dont worry its easy
Z2EzfQFvaa	Are you stupid?Your not too old.If you like it then good.Don't worry what others think.If others ridicule you over it,then DEAL with it.Don't stop liking something if others hate you for it for the wrong reasons.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Well you won't exactly be like the "gay nerds" because I can assume that you aren't gay and you aren't a nerd.<br>  <br>  I'd say if you like it then stick with the hobby. I still know kids in highschool who still play Pokemon. The only thing that might go to far is if you start watching the cartoons while curled up in a blanket while eating cereal, that might be a bit over the line for your age. :)<br>  <br>  If you have fun with it, why should you not do it? Because of what your friends think? Don't worry about what they think, do the things you like to do. It doesn't hurt them it just means they have a friend who plays Pokemon..Big deal? Nah. And your family should accept you no matter what. It would be pretty immature of your mom to tell all her friends, your sister can get over it i'm sure you have dirt on her, most siblings do, and I doubt your dad will shun you...I'm sure he might heckle you a bit but I don't think ignoring you would be the way to go.|`|3mNci0fGaa	N-O period. You can play, but if they ridicule you to the point where you can't take it try ignoring them. If that doesn't work stay away from those critics when you play Pokemon so you don't have to listen to them.|`|9mrjbqJaaa	you're never too old to play the classic RPG's, but I'd stay away from the trading cards.
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	To quote (literally) the answer I gave to someone else 6 hours ago:<br>  <br>  Lets see...we're 9 weeks into the new year, and this question has already been asked about 15 times... We're behind the curve. It's usually asked about 2-3 times per week.<br>  <br>  The actual answer is neither.<br>  <br>  If you want to know which YOU should buy...see what your friends have, and how much you can afford to spend. Make your decision based on that.<br>  <br>  Here's an answer I posted earlier to the same question:<br>  Own neither, but...<br>  <br>  Price: X-Box 360 ($100 cheaper)<br>  Age: PS3 (newer console)<br>  Life Expectancy: PS3 (again, newer console)<br>  Graphics: generally, X-Box (runs on modified Dx10 graphics)<br>  Games Library: X-Box<br>  Error Issues (heard of): PS3 (fewer fatal errors)<br>  On-Line Play: PS3 (FREE!!!, unlike X-Box Live)<br>  Features: Tie<br>  Alternate Uses: X-Box (Space-heater / Hotplate / Fire-starter)<br>  <br>  As an example of the level of Fanboi fanaticism that can be found out there...Even after nVidia flat-out publicly admitted that they could not compete against the HD4870x2 video card, there were still nVidifiles that insisted that the latest (single GPU) nVidia cards (the 9800 series) were hands down better than the (dual GPU) ATi product, despite the fact that every Benchmark test performed showed the ATi card as superior. <br>  This type of attitude prevails unbelievably in the conslow market (hence the "Wii is gay" comment made by one poster). On that topic, I have only one thing to say...the Microsoft and Playstation products are "hardcore" machines...the Wii is for casual and party gaming. All are all-around excellent machines, and each satisfies different gamer niches.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|jxpV13rTaa	PS3 <br>  -one of the best blu ray players on the market (if not THE best)<br>  -free online play<br>  -rechargeable controllers<br>  -VERY reliable and durable<br>  -will have more games than the 360 at the end of 2009 (with bigger and better titles)<br>  -online play is great<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -game discs are blue ray (which makes better graphics than the 360)<br>  -only 0.2% defective rate after opened from box<br>  -won best console of 2008<br>  -built in free wifi<br>  <br>  360<br>  -larger online community<br>  -online costs money to use<br>  -30% defective rate after opened from box (yes, 30!)<br>  -breaks down and creates the ring of death (scoaring of the discs until they arent readable)<br>  -amazing graphics<br>  -great selection of games<br>  -has HD DVD player (which is obsolete and useless because they only make Blu Ray DVDs, not HD DVDs.)<br>  -not cheaper. wifi adapter is 100 bucks and 1 year of online is 50 ($150 added to any bill)<br>  -have to buy batteries (or buy rechargeable ones)<br>  <br>  Dont waste your time with an xbox they will just break. i have owned both for a long time and the PS3 is by far the better choice. so its 100 dollars more...big deal. you get a larger hard drive and an amazing blu ray player. dont listen to bias people. you will get xbox lovers saying how the ps3 is junk. they are beyond ignorant. they are both amazing but the ps3 triumphs.|`|znccVpkeaa	Xbox- Xbox live cost ￡40 per year but it is worth it. way more enhanced than the PSN. What was that guy on about??, xbox 360 controllers are rechargable as well with the play and charge kit- and the battery lasts longer. More people have xbox live. Everybody has headsets whereas on the PS3 you have to buy them. On PS3 you have to be in the same game to talk to more than one person, but on the xbox 360 you can talk to up to 12 people whether or not you are on CoD: World at War or kung fu panda!!. trust me Xbox is the better console.|`|N2p30Mo4aa	In the long run, I think a ps3.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi. Here's three scenarios.<br>  <br>  1. The most likely problem is that YOU attacked the enemy on the campaign map (when they have surrounded your province). This means the opposition will assemble outside your city in defensive formations - they aren't going to besiege the castle or settlement. Consequently, as a result of being the original aggressor, you must make the first assault move against them.<br>  <br>  2. The AI in Medieval II: Total War is appropriate to the situation, but it's still rather dumb. If they have a small force, and your walls are lined with archers, then it's possible they won't try and over-take the fort. Instead, your foes might just wander around aimlessly or wait to test your patience. Use triple speed to fastforward quickly.<br>  <br>  3. It might be a software issue such as a glitch. Medieval II was apparently notorious for these, but I rarely encountered one on my detailed playing. If you're concerned, consult the official website - <a href="http://www.totalwar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalwar.com</a>|`|vExQCsNYaa	First of all, the enemy wont attack the walls if you sally forth to fight them (you attack them while they siege you)<br>  <br>  If the enemy attacked you then its a glitch that was fixed in patch 1.2 which you can download here <a href="http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/patches/medieval2totalwar/patch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/patch...</a>
QWHpXlNCaa	JoE is 100% right so all I can do is add to his very good answer. Now when you go online they all have a different deal i.e.:military, family, groups and other types of discounts.

Take for instance my site, <a href="http://uscarnys.com" rel="nofollow">http://uscarnys.com</a> , has discounts for Six Flags for $29.99 by the day and a season pass for $49.99. That is as cheap as it gets. You will also find various parks in another advertisement for Seaworld, Disny parks, and Busch Gardens for cheaper and yet the same as the other specials. They are on the amusement park pages at <br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/ThemeParks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/ThemeParks.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/WaterParksA-K.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/WaterParksA-K.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/WaterParksL-Z.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/WaterParksL-Z.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/IndoorParks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/IndoorParks.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/FamilyAmusementCenters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/FamilyAmusementC...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/AustraliaThemeParks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/AustraliaThemePa...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscarnys.com/UKThemeParks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscarnys.com/UKThemeParks.htm...</a>|`|ACr8KYfFaa	the play pass is $60.00 online.  it is probably cheaper online than the park because they dont expect people to waste time looking it up and purchasing it online.  its like when you go to the movies. they charge more for food because they know you didnt bring any with you.

AUCcZ8lQaa	Because xbox live is more than just online gaming, it is a service.  You can easily connect online, find friends, chat, video chat, download demos, etc.  <br>  <br>  I have both systems so I know, and trust me, you get what you pay for.  The PSN online system isn't too swift if you catch my drift.  The store is good and such, but as far as playing online, well it sucks.  <br>  <br>  With the xbox everything is integrated.  If there is a system update it does it automatically when you turn your box on.  If there is a game update it updates as soon as you put the game in.  Simple!<br>  <br>  With PS3 you have to either manually tell it to update, or try to play a game online and have it say, no you need to go back and update the system, then try again...30 minutes later you might be playing online.<br>  <br>  With xbox you sign one agreement when you originally sign up and you are good to go.  All games have the same interface and you can get online quickly.<br>  <br>  With PS3 you have to agree to the company that made the game, then create a separate account with them, then many many agonizing minutes later you could be playing online.<br>  <br>  I love playing xbox online, its the way to go for online gaming.  The PS3 has some good exclusives, but it wasn't made for online gaming.|`|ezP95Lq6aa	X-Box Live Silver is free<br>  X-Box Live Gold (multiplayer) is paid.<br>  <br>  It is paid, because people are willing to pay for the service. There is no need, at the moment, to have it go free.<br>  <br>  PSN is free as an attempt to compete with Microsoft by offering a selling point that the 360 did not have, free multiplayer matchmaking.<br>  <br>  X-Box live will likely go free within a couple of years due to the increased pressure from the PS3 with the larger number of units they are selling, especially if it ever gets that $100 price drop.|`|bcQgFW89aa	No matter what any fanboy will tell you, Xbox live is not free because it is the best service, and they need the extra revenue to run it that way. Slight hiccups aside, they're online service beats all hands down and does nearly everything you want it to. PSN is free because it has to be, they were late to the party. The Wii is free because honestly there isnt that much there.|`|KBTk6V4Jaa	to make money....|`|A2mycw0taa	my personal opinion is that Microsoft and Xbox do not feel like they have charged u enough for just buying the console so they think adding "Xbox live" is another way to continuoulsly scam money out of you, but PS3 sales are lower because the console is like 2 hundred odd quid but every thing is in cluded, but to my understanding u still need ur own connection for xbox live to work =[|`|AQeX9xMUaa	It is because Microsoft (creators of Xbox live) is sort of a "profit" company. I ask that question too, I mean the Microsoft company is like filthy stinkin' rich and sony (creators of psn) is also rich but less and psn is free. xbox live was never completely freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<br>  go with ps3 its freeeeeeeeeeee|`|j6swGMlwaa	When the PS3 drops 100 bucks the 360 will likely go free.|`|LnSKQISDaa	Cause xbox 360 is greedy. and they want u to S88t online!|`|TGXkiCXzaa	because Bill Gates and Microsoft love their money|`|awdT7ZrCaa	Because people will pay for it.<br>  <br>  Live has a lot more users than PSN, and more exclusive games and DLC.  Also, Live is pretty cheap, only about $5 a month.  It'd be cool if it was free, but the service you get is worth it.

Also if you have a smallish sample size then maybe your cash rate shouldnt truly be 45%...which would change this result obviously.  A streak like this would happen to an "average" player (33.33% cash rate) about 1 in 305 times. <br>  <br>  I've lost at Stars 11x in a row once according to sharkscope (I don't remember running that bad...lol) and I still have a ROI of 25%.  :)|`|crhJLuw5aa	You're right about one thing: It sure does SEEM like it's defying the laws of probability. But it's NOT. This is the nature of poker. What you're going through is standard variation. I don't mean to sound harsh, but GET USED TO IT. If you play 40 hours a week you can expect a run like this about once or twice a year. If you've been playing longer than that & it hasn't happened yet, consider yourself lucky. <br>  <br>  ALL professional gamblers HAVE to go through this from time to time. All you can do is make the plays that you know are correct, & God does the rest. Just keep playing solid poker. It WILL eventually turn around.

A few years back, a friend of mine was playing in a heads-up BJ tournament at the Atlantis Casino in the Bahamas. It came down to the last hand of the tournament. My friend was ahead by slightly more than 3 maximum bets. His opponent (correctly)  split face cards, got a 7 on the first one and doubled down! He drew a 4. On the second hand, he got a 9 and doubled down, drew a deuce; and won the tournament, which BTW paid $50,000 for first place.<br>  <br>  As you can see, his ONLY chance to win 4 bets was if he got a hand he could split, AND doubled down on both hands.<br>  <br>  What's the craziest/stupidest thing I've ever seen someone do at a blackjack table?<br>  About 10 years ago, at the TropWorld in Atlantic City, a guy, about 6' 7", probably 300 lbs.; with a beard that would have made ZZ Top proud, walks up to a dead table (no players, just the dealer), and standing up,plunks down $5 on the betting circle. He loses the hand, and without saying a word, reaches down & flips the table completely over; cards, chips from the rack, & everything else flying all over the floor!  He then turns around & slowly ambles out the door, with all the security guards too scared to do anything but watch.<br>  <br>  You had to be there.....|`|AV4CYfGDaa	I played in the million dollar blackjack tournament at the LV Hilton a few years back.<br>  <br>  I saw a guy who stood on 14 when the dealer had 10, stood on AA, and tried to hit with AA36. This guy actually finished high enough to win some money in the first round of the tournament. <br>  <br>  I'm still amazed at the people who think a bad player will always bring them bad luck. I just roll my eyes when I see somebody leave a table because of it. <br>  <br>  If somebody hits when they should stand, or stands when they should hit, they are just as likely to help you as to hurt you. In the long run, it makes absolutely no difference.<br>  <br>  Nobody ever remembers the times when the guy gets a low card, and the dealer busts as a result.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	I have doubled down on soft 20s,  It can be the correct play if you cound cards and knwo how to detect when it is.  I have also split tens to 4 hands<br>  <br>  I have seen many peopel double down on hard 13s, and even double down for less, but in all seriousness, NOT doubling down when you have 11, is the MOST COSTLY error you can make.<br>  <br>  I just dont understand it, they have 11, the dealer has less by having 6,7,8,9,10 whatever, and for some reason they cant see why at that very moment, they are going to win more often than not, so they dont put more money into the circle.<br>  <br>  Another stupid thing i saw, one time, a guy was mad about how i was playing my hands, he claimed i messed up the game, and im quoting here.... pointed at the shoe and said "those are my cards, this is my game, you cant just play however you want and mess it up"  i just looked at him and laughed in his face.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  There are advanaced strategies that go beyond card counting that can guide play of hands, you cnat just assume somebody doesnt knwo what their doing.  There are mathmatically appropriate situations where it is ideal to split 10s, double down on 7, hit hard 17s, stand on 15s and 16s<br>  <br>  Many players at the tables have called me the worst player they have ever seen in their life, it doesnt matter what they think because i have lots of cash to show for my efforts.|`|ZdKSNv5zaa	I've seen a guy double on a 13 with dealer showing a 10, $50 bet.

43zXRpLYaa	Dumb.<br>  All they are is a place to go and listen to loud music and take drugs. Sort of like a modern day woodstock. People are on all sorts of drugs and sometimes more than one. The music is made by people who have done various drugs so that when people are on them it makes the music more understood and realized. For example, really fast techno and being on Nos, everything slows way down. A lot of people I knew would do acid and then smoke weed to keep from tripping out. A lot of others did ecstasy. Acid and ecstasy are the main drugs that people do there. You show up late at night, get hopped up on drugs, and dance till 6 or 7 am.<br>  <br>  I went to one all the way out in the desert. There were thousands of people there. The police came and surrounded the entire area and made everyone leave. The car I went in got a flat, no spare, no one would help, not even the police. We seriously had to walk down the freeway for miles till we found a call box. We waited for hours for a tow truck, meanwhile the thousands of people all left and we were left out in the middle of the desert in the middle of the night. We finally got towed to the nearest town, but not until 10am the next day.<br>  <br>  I guess they are something to experience if you like drugs, but stay away from the ones in the desert and the low budget ones in crappy areas like the ghetto. I went to one in Hollywood and some black guys broke into my truck and stole everything. I saw them from down the street, but as I got to my truck they jumped in their car and drove away.<br>  <br>  I think those times were a complete waste of my life.
YEooEeKGaa	its called betfair trading.. use the "what if" option on your betfair account and you'll what happens if you put lay bets on positions that you have already backed. <br>  <br>  so if you backed $100 on liverpool at 3.8. And the market price drops to 3.0, and you layed liverpool for $120 then you create a position where you don't have any downside risk whether liverpool wins or loses. <br>  <br>  ie liverpool wins then you win net $40 ($280 - $240) or if liverpool loses then you win net $20 ($120 - $100). <br>  <br>  laying off the bet is basically slang for closing off the position and locking in some profits but obv the reduced risk means that you'll make less on the event, so theres a balance between keeping a position live or just taking the smaller amount of free money. hope this helps.|`|u2slnVCoaa	Imagine you beting the bookmaker. Thats exactly what laying is. You accept the bet of someone else. That means you have to hope he loses his bet. To make guaranteed money you need to back for example 3.0 and then lay under 3.0. Lets say 2.5. <br>  This ensures guaranteed profit.

jExpA0Qlaa	halo always came off as a bit of a cartoon to me. The enimies look like something of cartoon networks ben 10 and the storyline is basic and not graphic at all. All Halo has at all is combat, so it really depends on how you feel personally about fighting. Although Halo Wars is a pure strategy game, there's not really going to be much hands on fighting anyway. I would say yes, its appropriate. But games like Gears of War 2 and Fable 2, absolutley not. In the end it's your call though. Hope this helps|`|vtGlSJfCaa	u can play nothing bad in it so u can play and halo wars is gonna be awesome im 12  and i play halo so any way do u know there is gonna be two types limited edition one is with a lot of spartans and the other one is alien guy i dont read the names so i dont remember the name alien guy one is a limited edition so buy that 1st and then buy the other one if u wanna buy both go to gamestop.com good luck in buying both|`|5Kqrn0Baaa	9 years old is fine to play Halo Wars.

YEooEeKGaa	casinos are businesses so they won't exactly give you free money.. you'll need to read the terms and conditions to find out what the play through requirement is. it is normally anything from 10x to 30x the bonus. <br>  <br>  so if you have $100 in bonuses and have a 10x playthrough requirement. then you'll need to wager at least $1000 on casino games before they let you make a withdraw. <br>  <br>  still its better to be gambling with a bonus than without as it does effectively reduce the house edge. but i wouldn't be thinking of bonuses as way to get free money from casinos.|`|L2S9jjdLaa	No you won't be able to do that. Players claiming a bonus must place bets to the value of 10x to 40x their deposit and bonus before a withdrawal can be made depending on which online casino you decide to play at. <br>  <br>  Once you have made a deposit and claimed the bonus, you will not be able to make any withdrawals until the wagering requirements have been met for 'both' the deposit and the bonus.<br>   <br>  Bets at Sic Bo, Craps, BlackJack, Roulette tables, Progressive Jackpots and many other games usually do not count towards the wagering requirement for the bonus. So you need to look at the terms and conditions for any promotion.<br>  <br>  If you decline the offer of the bonus before you make a deposit. Which you will need to get confirmation of this from the casino via email. Then there are no limitations with your deposit and you can withdraw your balance when you please.|`|u2slnVCoaa	No, you can't. You need to reach specific sum that you bet on the games to withdraw both the bonus and the deposited money.|`|BwyRLFrhaa	No, if  you withdraw before meeting the rollover requirements then you forfeit the bonus.  The rollover is actually when you are required to wager the amount of the deposit+bonus a number of times before being allowed to withdraw the funds.  Some sites won't allow you to play certain games even to qualify for the rollover requirements.  It is very important to actually read the terms of the bonuses before accepting them!

syUydvhoaa	Well the only way u would really make money from instances is by getting badges and using 10 badges to get a frozen orb which sell's 70-110 gold depending on your server<br>  <br>  .So u gotta aim for the easiest and fastest heroics for example VH,DTK,Gundrak(if u manage to get past first boss).<br>  <br>   The only instance that you can solo and will get u money is ony which is a lvl 60 raid. Ive seen a lot of pally's solo onxiya.When u kill ony u get some gold like 60 and a lot of boe blues which u can sell. the cooldown for onxiya is 2 days unlike other raids which only reset on tuesdays.<br>  <br>   Another option which would benefit u the most is just lvl ur mining sell the ore u get then just farm ore in winter grasp when u max mining|`|iU7ZizxSaa	Professions, professions, professions.<br>  <br>  Mining makes a good bit if you invest the time into it, create a good mining route, and install gatherer add-on to keep track of where the nodes are on your server.  Gatherer will also get info from any other guild member that has gatherer, so you get info on how to get to nodes quick without even working yourself.<br>  <br>  Skinning is good also, especially in Northrend... if you're horde, you can run around the starting area in borean tundra (with the spiders) and all the spider-covered npcs you rescue will help you farm.  It's great.  I get about 2-5 arctic furs per hour, sell them during the week when supply is low, and get 75-100 each.  Skinning also levels extraordinary quickly (1-450 in a few hours)<br>  <br>  No clue on the instances, though, sorry bro. I hate 'em.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	You wont really get a lot out of the instances unless you are an enchanter or are playing the market.<br>  Professions are the key to making money. Just make sure you sell them at the right time for the right price. <br>  It really comes down to supply and demand basics. If there are lot of skins and ore on the ah, then wait for their numbers to decrease and the price will go up. Also, if you price your goods slightly under the average price, they will sell faster if you are just interested in short-term cash.<br>  Another thing to notice is if ore sells for more than the bars do. If the ore sells for more, then don't smelt them. If the bars do, then smelt them. Also, if the bars sell for more, buy some ore and smelt them to resell for a higher price, if it's worth it.<br>  You may want to list your professions as well, for further help.|`|2k6QUpXtaa	if you need help. do what i did<br>  <a href="http://dman61.luke13.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=6120" rel="nofollow">http://dman61.luke13.hop.clickbank.net/?...</a>|`|LRHjirzhaa	I would just mine and sell the ore/gems.

Try to rememeber a good 1-player game from way back, and start it up again. You might get into it.|`|PwvhYlwZaa	i am going through the same experience right now and i have before. its not a matter of mojo, as you put it, just interest. as your growing older and maturing your probably finding the games tedious and boring. but its most probable one day you'll just pick up a game and get hooked and play it all the time, and further down the track you might get over them again. <br>  i wouldnt worry or waste time thinking about it, its not a major life change or anything, its not like you have gotten bored of eating or something. everything usually works out in the end, at least thats what i always believe<br>  peace|`|yFWAjOKmaa	Ha, maybe its just you havent found the " right " game (: I love video games, personally as a girl, but i dont play all day. Or everyday as a matter of fact. Just because you dont play games everyday or sometimes boring, doesnt mean you still dont love playing games. Plus, its a good thing, because now you can actually go out & enjoy life instead of staying home all day playing games :D!

Also, maybe your hormones are kicking in and you are deciding you like girls or something?  Try going outside and doing stuff with friends, then go back to the games.  If you don't want to play and instead feel like dying your hair black, painting your fingernails, and listening to My Chemical Romance all day then you probably aren't a gamer...but you may be a Vampire...muahahahahahahah. j/k.|`|u2XdPAk6aa	No you probally just found more fun things to do with your spare time and now video games are not as fun for you as they used to be.|`|KFKOmKZSaa	yes, it will only come back with time...play something else for a while, then your chops will return.|`|fiBWZTyjaa	i got the opposite of that.

H2qEN27daa	You don't have to scream if you don't want to. I usually just smile or laugh and enjoy the ride. I love the feeling of being on a coaster so I just enjoy it. Sometimes I'll scream for fun, just because. And sometimes my best friend and I scream or talk in deep man-type voices (she can go muchhh lower than I can lol) just because its funny =) If you really want to scream in a high pitch then try practicing at home. (Make sure you don't have neighbors that will get worried if they hear constant screaming lol) Try talking in as high of a voice as you can and then turn that into a scream. I'm sure if you practice enough if you really want to have a high pitched scream you can do it :)|`|cCAGstnpaa	That's funny, because I have the same problem. I don't even try to scream because it is super embarassing. I just yell "Wahoooooo!" It is so much fun. Try it! It really works.
MHKwqFfGaa	Bunny invasion 2?<br>  <br>  You crazy kids these days.
EH0ZgD43aa	You state you are sewing the Velcro onto possibly satin. As satin is not a tough fabric and has "floating" threads, I question how long the Velcro will remain sewn to the satin. If you are planing to use a backing behind the satin to give it more stability and help the Velcro stay in place without pulling the satin apart, I'd use regular thread (cotton-wraped polyester) and a small zig zag stitch. When I made costumes for a Las Vegas show, we had several items made of satin and used a heavier and somewhat stiff backing to help the satin hold the Velcro. As you pull on the Velcro to fasten and unfasten, it pulls on the satin and causes the threads of the satin to pull apart. Putting a backing on it helps eliminate the problem. There are several different types of Velcro...among them is a lighter-weight version that may be better for satin than some of the heavier ones. We used Velcro on spandex, latex, silk and satin as well as on head pieces that fastened in the back of the head. However, be prepared to do repair work on the area as repeated closing and opening will cause the item to require repair after awhile.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Normal sewing thread, like Coats and Clark. You may want to use a heavier needle. I use a straight stitch and a medium stitch length. Sew over all four sides twice.|`|q5fqP31taa	Sew with coats & clark poly/poly or dual purpose sewing thread. <br>  <br>  I prefer a long, wide zig-zag.<br>  <br>  Don't try to sew adhesive back Velcro - it won't will gum up the thread and needle - you will get about one stitch and a big mess.<br>  <br>  Test first - any time you are using a new-to-you product or technique.

I know that 1st Edition is good, but I would with Limited.|`|MPJYNAgqaa	In my opinion, Limited Edition is sometimes better, because most cards that are out of print are Limited Edition.  There are some limited edition cards that are not as valuable.  It all depends on where you got the limited edition cards.  For example, the limited edition cards you get by buying the booster pack special are not as rare as the ones that you can get from the booster pack.  Limited edition cards you get by winning a yu-gi-oh tournament, or one you get from a magazine/game will AWLAYS be rarer than ones you can find in a booster pack.  Think about it, which Blue-eyes white dragon do you think is rarer and worth more, the one from Starter Deck Kaiba, or the one from Dark Duel Stories GB game (Parallel Rare), or the one from Shonen Jump (The one standing in front of the earth), or the one from Legend of Blue-eyes?|`|PHO7FrmAaa	Limited Is better because well their limited lol<br>  1st edition is just that their 1st edition of the card that means thats 1 of the other style the card has|`|BmnwsvfOaa	1st edition is better. pretty sad to see people say limited edition.<br>  u can easily get limited edition cards by buying games and items which will give the cards out for free|`|7WGKtkd0aa	if it is a limited edition keep it, you can get only a fair price off of e bay.

iDyRd9Raaa	hi<br>  in vilestone  city you first have to beat the gym<br>  than when yo go out side the assistant will be there. help get the poke Dex back.  go inside the storage and get HM fly.<br>  you than go to pastoria and defeat the gym. than your rival.<br>  talk to the grunt near the safari zone. than start chasing him. every time you see him talk to him<br>  yo will eventully have to battle him.<br>  defeat him and keep going up.<br>  yo will meet cynthia and she will give you a potion.<br>  go to the psyducks and give them the potion.<br>  from there you keep heading up and you will eventully come a town called  celestic town. <br>  talk to the grunt near the entrance to a cave.<br>  a lady will walk up to you and you give her the old charm. she takes you inside.<br>  when she done talking go out side and cyrus will talk to you. than go to heart home city.<br>  the leader is back and yo have to verse her. defeat her and walk out side. Cynthia is there again.<br>  she says go to canalave city.<br>  head to route 218 and canalave is west of there.<br>  once you get to canalave just follow the directions of what the people tell you to go.<br>  hope i helped.|`|MFAVIW1waa	Well right after you beat your rival, continue going to way the grunt ran off. When you're on the beach, you should see the grunt near the water, talk to him and he'll run off again and run to lake valor. You'll find him standing there and when you talk to him he'll battle you. Once you beat him he'll slowly run off and you stop chasing him there. Taka a few steps up and you'll see cynthia. Talk to her and she'll give you a secret potion which you need to make the psyduck move on the route north of Solaceon town. Fly there and talk to the psyduck and they'll move once you use the potion. Cynthia will appear again and give you an old charm that she wants you to give to her Grandma in the town at the end of the route. When you get there go to the middle and fight the grunt. Cynthia's grandma will come up to you, talk to you for a bit and you give her the old charm. In return she gives you HM surf (the best HM in my opinion) Once you've finished witnessing all the events in the town fly to hearthome city and get your fifth gym badge.
xGcONj9Waa	Try sending an email to one of the employees. That's all i can think of. Unless somehow you can key log the guy, but that would be illegal and i don't recommend it. So just email one of the employees and see what they have to do about it. Hope that helps ;)|`|dKsQktrjaa	you cant talk to a person because all they do it send automated messages. reset your account 3 times with different information all the time and the third one different from how you started but something you will remember. good luck|`|u2XdPAk6aa	Talk to a runescape employee or try to talk to jagex.
