Also where do you live and what type of weather will you be driving in?  Arizona you can drive an open jeep all the time...even right now.  Back east I wouldn't want that type cuz its too cold. See what Im saying?   It depends on where you live and what you plan on doing or where you would be going in your vehicle. Will you use it off road?  Four wheeling?  Camping?  Only on the paved roads ariound town?  Is it only you riding in it or will you have friends/ family/kids that will need to be able to sit somewhere?  Lots to factor in.

They don't cost much to buy, generally a decent Cherokee can be found for around 3,200 to 4,500. They are more reliable than un, and they can get from 18 to 22 mpg. The 4.0L inline-six engine was produced for many years with minimal modification, so parts are readily available. Cherokees are versatile and can handle any road surface. You would enjoy a late 90s Jeep Cherokee.

Bl9zcqxQaa	Have the neutral safety switch checked, as thats probably why it doesnt start ( doesnt crank) .   That switch is mounted on the top of the transmission, as the car is being hooked up to the tow truck, they put the car in neutral, then, when the car is dropped off at the shop, it starts for them.  I live in Michigan also, they can be effected by cold damp temps also.   Next time the car doesnt start, try as your cranking the car, move the shifter back and forth, or try to start it in neutral, my guess will be the car will then crank over, if so, have the switch replaced|`|AA10331789	If the battery's over 4 years old, don't fool around anymore with it.

The idea is to love your vehicle and take your time to Take it all in. Not fly through in what ever your travelling in/on.|`|FDeoPn89aa	Most bikes are going to go less than 200 miles between fill ups per tank. Most cars will go longer between fill ups (Most cars I have owned could go 300+ miles on a tank). More fillups make bikes slower on long trips. (the Honda ST1300 has like an 8.8 gallon tank - which means it could go further than even most cars - figure 40-50mpg X 8 gallons = at least 320 miles on a tank). Ironbutt riders will often use a fuel cell, and wear diapers, so the fuelstop/bio break thing is not always a problem on a bike.    IF you have a flat on a car, you put on the spare. If the same problem happens on a bike... well, if you have a plug kit and way to fill the tire, you can scoot on down the road (otherwise, you might be stuck for a while)... but in general, breakdowns are a lot more difficult to deal with on a bike, so that can be a factor on a road trip.    Many big cities will have carpool lanes, and if you hit traffic and you're alone, you might save a lot of time if they let bikes in the carpool lane - that can make a huge difference.    Of course if you had a dual-sport or even better "adventure tourer", you might be able to go off-road in places where a car could not (but maybe a 4x4 would be fine).    I would not consider the top speed of the vehicle to be a factor, because most cars and bikes will go fast enough that they will attract the attention of law enforcement. Driving faster means lower mileage means more stops, so sometimes it doesn't save as much time as it seems like it might. Going really fast is also much more demanding of the driver, and makes longer trips much more difficult (not to mention dangerous).    So I guess the answer is that it depends on a lot of factors. There is a lot more variety in types of bikes than in cars. Most are specialized a lot more than cars are. The ones that are specialized for long distance trips do a lot better at long distance riding than ones specialized for other things. You also have to be in the right physical condition to ride a lot, and if haven't done it before you would have to build up to it.|`|YmXTatN4aa	I've made the same 750 mile trip several times on a bike & in a truck.  in the truck it takes 11& 1/2 hours with one gas & food stop (carry a porta john bottle)  on the bike it takes 14 to 14 & 1/2hours with 4 or 5 gas stops but its more fun.|`|Lsng62eLaa	A bike is faster.

6df704ddf5d9c6a1b0f9e438065e7cfbaa	I would say that you have a partially clogged catalytic converter creating back pressure in your engine under a load. The back-pressure bogs down the engine.    Have your mechanic put a vacuum gage on it and give it a read...it should tell you a lot about your engine.    Here is how to heck your engine codes...http://www.troublecodes.net/honda/    Hope this helps  Wildman|`|zlPAVkUBaa	Hard to say, it's 22 years old and probably has 230,000 miles on it.     Blocked exhaust, weak compression, poor spark, and on and on and on.|`|yBc0HJifaa	I would guess that you went to the wrong shop. From what you said I would say the exhaust is stopped up. Maybe the converter.   This is so easy to check that I could almost teach a monkey to do it.   It takes a vacuum gage but most mechanics don't use one anymore or rarely. Hook up the vacuum gage and snap the throttle wide open then let go.   When the throttle is snapped wide open the barometric pressure will change dramatically and the gage will dip momentarily to zero. When the throttle returns and the engine idles it will attain ambient pressure(approximately 14.7 at sea level) and the gage will return to the previous reading. If the exhaust is stopped up the gage will not dip to zero.   To make this simple: Hook up a vacuum gage to a constant vacuum port. If a person does not know the difference pull one off at the throttle body(or on the intake) and listen for a leak. If you do not hear air rushing pick another somewhere else on the intake or throttle body.   Crank the vehicle and observe the gage the snap the throttle wide open and release as fast as possible. The gage will drop to zero if the exhaust is working normally. If the exhaust is stopped up the gage will not drop to zero and the exhaust(muffler and/or converter) has a problem.   If a mechanic does not know how to do this he(or she) is a parts re placer, and not a mechanic and certainly not a technician.   However, I have only given a guess, with the information provided so a simple and short answer. It could be the transmission but that would mean the person you took it too only played like being a mechanic.   I could get serious with an answer with more info but I still suspect the exhaust.   Oh! a dianostic test on the computer might shed more light on the problem but might be misleading if the exhaust is stopped up. It still needs to be checked and cleared.
Ak35Y562aa	Its probably not going to be any cheaper.  Its a speciality car like he said.    Dealerships WILL likely do a price drop because of the pure desperation to sell cars right now(especially ANYTHING with a v8 in it)    But your best bet to score a corvette, would be to find a low mileage corvette in a Used Car Dealer....someone who it probably hurting alot more and is Required to keep cars moving on and off the lots!  They WILL drop the price quite a bit, but if your going for a vette or higher end sports car, you have to prove to them that you are worth their time.  (goto the dealership, get the price they are asking for the Vette, then go to kbb.com and get what its REALLY worth, then goto the bank and get pre-approved for a LOWER amount than what the vette is worth. Then go back to the dealership, let them run a credit check on you,etc....then go for a test drive, then shoot around some numbers, then tell them you have a check for X-amount of dollars, 99% of the time they WILL NOT let you walk off that lot without the car you want.  If you got a pre-approved check in hand, that is practically instant money in their pocket, and if they are hurting financially they WILL sell a $20,000 car for $13,000 flat out.....because it happened to ME....im speaking from personnal experience!)    You never know until you go out to the dealerships....  If one dealership doesnt wanna play ball, fine, just leave, if they dont chase after you, then goto another dealership until you find one that wants a sale.      Getting a steal on a Corvette IS going to be alittle tricky, alot of delearships will hang onto them until someone with more money comes along...which is only a matter of time.  If you were trying to buy an Explorer or mustang GT or Camaro, you could probably drive it off the lot for SUPER cheap right now......but a corvette is IFFY........    Im sure you could definately score a vette for less right now, the economy is hurting, especially the Car Market....  But your not going to walk off with a $60,000 car for 30 or 40......    But theres no doubt, if you want to buy a sports car, Now Is the time to buy....you should have no trouble getting a nice little chunk knocked off the total price...

Don't use the 1 ohm configuration because that will most likely blow your subs or your amp or both. if you wire it the way that site shows you then it will be the correct ohm load unless you made a mistake and put some wires in the wrong place. some DVC subs can be misleading as to which positive or negative terminal goes with which voice coil. the terminals are always paired together so don't be tricked into thinking one negative is one the opposite side of it's own positive terminal.

No voltage to the coil.|`|Cpdyn1M3aa	The ignition module tells the coil when to spark, and the distributor pick up tells the ignition module when the engine needs spark, of course nothing will work without power.  If you have no spark at a plug wire check for spark on the coil wire.  If you have spark at the coil wire you need a cap and rotor.  If no spark anywhere follow these steps  1) Check all your fuses.  2) Check for power at the coil, on the pink (red)wire  3) Remove dist cap  4) Install spark tester  5) Turn key to RUN (lights on dash light up)  6) Take a test light and hook the clip to battery positive  7) While watching the spark tester touch the tip of the test light to the terminals on the back of the ignition module where the pick-up coil connects.  There will be a white wire and a green wire.  Touch the tip to each connection point on the back of the module.( You may have to slide the connector back)  8) If when you touch either one of the wires you get a spark then you have a bad pick up coil.  If you still do not get spark then you have a bad ignition module.      The ignition module is easy to change, three wire plugs, and two screws.  Make sure to spread the pack of silicone grease on the back of the new module before you install it, otherwise you will be doing it again soon.    Hope this helps,  Mike

349430e91043395f31bd69026affa76eaa	Well first of, do your research and find out as much as you can, all it takes is a few google searches, do a little history, such as where the first one was made, who invented it, throw a little micheal angelo in it and a little flight theory.     While your doing your research and preparing your PowerPoint presentation, call who ever is in charge of where ever you attend your meetings in CAP, and ask them if your class can have a tour.    If you rally want to make points with your commander or whatever he/she is and with your classmates ask if  maybe 4 or so of your  of your classmate would be able to fly in one( obtain parent consent forms) .     Now if you really want to impress your teacher, make your PowerPoint presentation end with a test on your presentation and essay the four highest scores get to go up on the chopper.   ask for help from your teacher, to make it difficult, as only 4 can fly?

I will add that one of the strengths of this website is how accessible the information is made; you might use some of the analogies and explain concepts in a similar order to the way they do, and you're likely to be on a winner.    In my experience, people get the most out of this kind of thing if you don't assume knowledge, but explain right from first principles and use very basic analogies so they understand the relevant ideas quickly. Then they get a sense of achievement that way and if learning is rewarding, people tend to enjoy it more than if they're confounded.

When the key is turned on the fuel pump relay energizes to provide fuel for cranking. If the engine is not running the fuel pump relay will shut the fuel pump off. If you do not hear the fuel pump energizing there may be a separate problem.  If there is no sound make sure to see if this model has an inertia switch(roll over) in the trunk.

The Seikan tunnel has a shorter undersea section, but it is the longest tunnel because it has a long stretch underland ramping down.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikan_Tunn...

c48nm70gaa	marie b, Usually when an engine such as this is under load the throttle body is opening up gulping more air. When this happens the fuel pump is trying to force gasoline through a *fuel filter on toward the fuel injector nozzles that's probably somewhat *plugged and restricted.

If you pass the course and get your certificate, the DPS will waive the drivers test, but you still have to take the written test. The MSF course also prepares you for the written (computer) test. Whether it was the easiest way (and it is), the MSF course teaches what you have to know to stay out of crashes and stay alive. MSF courses include use of a bike for the course. Most MSF courses provide a 250cc bike; the Harley Davidson Riders Edge Course supplies 500cc Buell Blasts.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	Take the MSF approved class either at your local college  or the local Harley-Davidson dealer.

byFPLL4Taa	Typically parts and labor will come in around 500-$600 for the job.  If the clutch went out so soon in your car....way too soon by any automobile standards then you are really hard on the clutch.  I would expect that you would want to migrate up to a little better friction material and get a lifetime warranty on the clutch if you can.  Several manufacturers provide lifetime warranties.  What I would suggest is a Centerforce/LUK/ACT clutch or the equivalent...you are going to pay the same amount of money for the Toyota clutch anyway so why not upgrade to a little better clutch that will take the abuse a little better.  Better friction material and stronger spring plate will allow better clamping force and less slip on the clutch = less wear and tear.  Toyota won't warranty the new clutch very long anyway...maybe 3 months to a year.  You may, depending on how bad the clutch was, need a new/resurfaced flywheel which will add some cost but it shouldn't be much for the resurfacing; couple hundred more for a new flywheel.  You should be getting at least 150k on a clutch.  All of mine have went >200k miles before needing replacement.  You can buy the clutch and take it to the dealer....will be much cheaper that way....and no it will not void any warranty so don't let a dealer tell you that.  They just want the 40% profit margin off of their parts that they sell to you.    Some costs to think about:  Simple straight forward Exedy/stock replacement clutch kit: ~120-$150 for you to buy at any local parts place or internet  Stage 1 clutch  will be around $300...still smooth but will grip better and can take the heat from hard launches, slipping and fast shifts  Stage 2 clutch ~$350-380...harsher "stiffer" engagement...will feel a little "grabby" when you release off of the pedal...much much longer life though.  Not much in the change of the pedal "feel" when you engage and disengage but more $$$$ = better engagement, less slip and longer clutch life for you.  You most likely will not have to change a stage 2 clutch again for as long as you will own the car as long as it is stock in the engine compartment.  If you want a stage 1 AND lifetime warranty then I would go with the LUK performance clutch...about $300 to buy plus installation. BTW get your old parts back and inspect the clutch disc....is it glazed "shiny" on the surfaces? ...that's a sign of high temps from riding the clutch too much etc.  Stock friction materials are not good performers under high loads...they don't take the heat buildup that well and essential "melt" and the surface becomes glazed.  Hope those hints help.  PS any good mechanic can do the clutch in less than 5 hours....at $50 per hour it should be around $200 to $250 for them to change the clutch if you bought it and brought it to them.|`|2b41502a771b2edca9121889f430992caa	Its a tough call without knowing Toyota's, but I would say the clutch will cost you around $250-$350 and labor will really vary but count on no less than $900 and no more than $1400.

I took off the wheels, followed by the nuts for the struts that are in the trunk. I actually had to step on the rear suspension a little to get the struts to break free, and the old springs just popped out! When I wedged the new springs in, I had to raise the suspension with the jack to get the struts back into their mounts because my new springs were heavy duty. I put the nuts back on the struts once I managed to align them in their holes, and repeated this on the opposite side.<br>  It was an easy job, and brake lines, E brake lines, and my air lines to the shocks were not in the way.<br>  Good luck.|`|evK3hMEbaa	raise the car and remove the struts,be sure to brace up the rear end and brake lines will be fine ,,, just dont over extend them

kOlZqhSdaa	Does it really matter who invents something or does it really matter who exploits the idea and makes money off it. While some European dude invented the auto, Henry Ford took the idea and made it available to the masses to make a buck. More Recently, the Japanese took the idea and re-injected quality.

This is the time in history that the US can regain the lead in the Auto industry.|`|F4FCBEgzaa	You can go to Wikipedia and get the rundown on the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the 1st automobile. Henry Ford has been credited with the mass production of the automobile. He had this novel idea that if you made cars cheaply enough, even the people who made them could afford to buy them. <br>  <br>  Detroit has been doing it's damnedest to quash that idea ever since by buying up smaller car companies and becoming so big that they can no longer control themselves. Back in the 1950s, there were about 20 or so car makers. Once a few figured out that if they bought out the quality car makers, they could put any piece of crap in the showroom and people would buy them, the whole industry went to hell.

Call the police and advise the situation.  Ensure you have a full description of the person and the car etc.  If they drive off then again call the police and also pass all information to your insurance company.    Your insurance company and the police could trace the owner from the registration (assuming it is registered correctly).

Failure to give all that is an offence under the Road Traffic Act, sect 170 if I remember right.  Ring her, point that out and if she won't provide then report to the police.

d9ECb7N8aa	They are two different series of trucks. The Ford F650/750 is comparable to the Kodiak 4500/5500.<br>  <br>  The Ford F450/550 is the same dimensions as the lighter rated 250/350. The 450/550 has a larger rear axle, higher rated frame and suspension, and larger brakes.<br>  <br>  The Kodiak 4500 and F650 are considered 'mid-sized' trucks, and can require a CDL because of their GVW ratings (depending on state and usage). At this time, GM is not producing a truck to compete with the F450/500 or the Dodge 4500/5500 trucks.<br>  <br>  With that said, the use of the vehicle will determine the size. The Kodiak uses the same Duramax engine that is found in the 2500/3500 series trucks. So the power output rating is similar to what the Ford Powerstroke engine is... <br>  <br>  Running the smaller truck will net better fuel economy, but is the smaller truck rated for the work that it will be doing? The larger K4500 or F650 will last longer because the chassis is constructed to handle a larger load; so the F450/550 may be near max GCWR so it is legal, but the Kodiak/F650 will have a longer life because it isn't working as hard.<br>  <br>  I'm currently pulling horses with an '04 F450. I gross out slightly under my max rating when 'fully' loaded, but I don't always run maxed. I would love to pull with a midsize truck (like a Freightliner FL60 with a small CAT) but it really isn't cost effective to run the larger truck at this time. The smaller detuned CAT that is available will put out similar power numbers as the Powerstroke. I know that the FL/CAT combo will outlast the Ford, but it isn't cost effective at this time...<br>  <br>  From the people that I've talked to, their midsized trucks are getting similar fuel mileage numbers as my Ford...

I worked for the local Cadillac dealership and here's what i have to tell you. YOUR GETTING RIPPED OFF! You pay what 50 bucks for a rotor? I paid $11. The fact that cadillac's engine blocks are aluminum make them better, however more expensive to replace the garb. Basic maintenance at a dealership can get hefty our labor rate was 98.00 an hour.

Lifted trucks are pretty darn fun to drive though! But 23k miles really doesn't make much difference, I would go for the one with fewer miles because of the simple fact that it's quite possibly easier to catch a catastrophic problem and get it fixed now, than get one that already has been used and abused, and one thing that I'd like to point out is when you buy an already lifted truck, or a truck that's had any after-market items installed on it, you're running a high risk of buying that person's problems. Like, for instance, if the lift was installed in the driveway on a Sunday afternoon, there's a high possiblilty that there may be some pinion alignment issues, which could mean a lot of vibiration at high-way speeds and excessive driveline wear. Also, if it has larger tires, there's a possibility that the breaks are in-adequate to stop the truck and now are wearing out three or four times faster from having to stop larger tires. The choice is yours really, but I'd stick with the '01 and throw my own lift, breaks, and tires on it.|`|GKyjsNzjaa	4x4<br>  <br>  Def|`|W0SUfFrSaa	if they both have the same motor and both are 4x4  get the 2001. i assume they are gas engine.|`|FFUpnfq4aa	neither keep looking till you find a ford or chevy dodges have weak frames and bad trans horrible engines and styling that hurts my eyes

0Th3lvynaa	You need a minimum of 40 hours of total flight time.  If you study and know everything before you start your flight training then you can get your private pilot certificate in as fast as you can fly off the 40 hours.  I have a friend that got his Private Pilot Certificate in 25 days with 45 hours.  As long as you study hard you can do anything(you will also need about $10,000 for your training).<br>  Good Luck|`|f9wQ8RcAaa	It's up to you. How often you take lessons and complete your tasks will determine how long it takes. While the FAA requires every private pilot to have a minimum of 40 hours to get certified, very few pilots actually get their certification in 40 hours. This is mostly due to pilots taking flight time that is in addition to the required flying tasks and lessons. You will find that, under the direction of your instructor, you will want to fly and practice some aspects of flight to get more confident before you take your check ride. This is especially true once a pilot goes solo. Because you no longer have to pay the instructor, you want to fly more. It took me 8 months to get certified, and that was flying about every other weekend. It really comes down to how much flight time you can afford to spend on in any given month. Learning to fly is very expensive.|`|dWLgwb3baa	40 hours flight time minimum, 60 hours typically.<br>  <br>  How many weeks depends on the person and schedule.

JCtvUjyKaa	Having quieter engines DOES have some benefits:<br>  <br>  - The aircraft may be able to climb more quickly over populated areas, instead of having to throttle back to avoid noise complaints.<br>  <br>  - Passengers inside the plane have a quieter, less stressful trip<br>    or<br>  - The plane can be more efficient, because it doesn't need as much sound-absorbing material in the fuselage for the same cabin noise level.<br>    (or some compromise of those two)<br>  <br>  It also has drawbacks.<br>  - As another response indicates, quieter engines means more birds in the area, and thus increased chance of birdstrike<br>  - some of the methods used to make an engine quieter also add weight and reduce efficiency for the entire flight, even though the noise reduction is only important when you're taking off or landing.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're talking about the commercial jet that I think you are (lots of composites, not yet in servicie), then the REAL advantage is that this plane has a higher bypass engine, leading to higher efficiency.  The reduced noise comes mainly from moving a large volume of air slowly instead of a small volume of air quickly, but the passengers and people around the airport don't really care about that.  They just care that there's less airplane noise at their home, or that the ride is quieter.<br>  <br>  The only reason to make a plane quieter is because it makes the passengers happy and reduces complaints from the people around the airports.<br>  <br>  If you can design a plane that makes people happy and costs less per passenger mile to operate, the airlines will buy more of them.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Many airports have noise restrictions because of residential development nearby, which means that noisier aircraft are restricted as to time of day and approach patterns, or have to climb more slowly thus burning more fuel, or might even be prohibited from using certain runways.  Airlines can be fined for noise restriction violations.<br>  <br>  San Francisco International (SFO) is an excellent example.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	None.  The main reason for having quieter engines is to make it less likely that people near airports will complain about the noise.<br>  <br>  It even has some drawbacks.  Quiet engines are less likely to frighten birds, and so the risk of bird strikes is increased at an airport when aircraft with quiet engines predominate.|`|cN4pYes0aa	The benefit is quieter take-offs, landings, and operations over metropolitan areas.  The aircraft engine manufacturers (Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, GE) know that their customers (the airframe makers, i.e. Bombardier, Boeing, Airbus) are better neighbors and friends of the public when their aircraft are quieter.  There is the benefit of less cabin noise, which can tire and irritate the passengers and cabin crew.  There is the larger benefit in that quieter engines (high bypass turbofan engines) are also more fuel efficient and powerful than the old turbojets which powered the 707, DC-8, etc.|`|aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa	Technically speaking, all energy that is not diverted to produce noise could be available for propulsion, although one has to admit that this is a very (very very) small contribution at best.<br>  <br>  The main benefit of quieter engine, as some have mentioned, is a smaller noise footprint for the community around the airport. Does this have an impact? Of course it does. Some airport have curfew for noisier planes which therefore cannot operate past a certain time.|`|1f8667fa7bae46c3ffc3ff576f55d53baa	This results in much less noise and far fewer noise complaints from residents who live near airports.|`|ATxJ6bn8aa	does anybody else think its funny that people buy or build houses near airports then complain about the noise?  just a comment, all the answers are good and correct.

You can read up about the different types of pilot certificates here: <a href="http://www.flightschoollist.com/articles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightschoollist.com/articles...</a>  You can also get a lot of information about flight training here: <a href="http://www.faa.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.faa.gov</a> .<br>  You can start flying at any age.  You can get your Private Pilot Certificate at 17 years old and you can solo the airplane at 16 years old.  The first thing you should do is take an introductory flight with your local flight school; just to make sure that you like flying before you start studying and spending money on flight training.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck
Yq2CUhtYaa	Aftermarket mods to a WRX only gets it to the level of an STI.<br>  <br>  An STI is highly tuned from the factory, but that doesn't mean you can't push it further, it just means that the next steps are more expensive.<br>  <br>  Let's put it this way.<br>  <br>  Say there's ten levels of performance. Each one costs more than the last.<br>  <br>  The WRX is at stage 2.<br>  <br>  STi is at stage 5.<br>  <br>  The STI won't benefit from things like an intake, exhaust, etc, because that was all done on stage 1-4. Now, you need to invest bigger money, to get bigger gains.<br>  <br>  The WRX will benefit, but as soon as it gets to Stage 5, same thing. It costs more money again.<br>  <br>  The STI is ultimately the better vehicle to start with; because you'd have to invest that much more just to get the WRX up to it's level. And then an STI with any kinds of mods at all, will still destroy it.<br>  <br>  What you end up with, is people complaining that they can't mod the STI. They can. They just don't want to spend the money to do so.<br>  <br>  Somehow, to them, it makes more sense to spend $2000 on intake, exhaust, etc, which barely helps the car at all, than to buy a $2000 turbo, which would significantly help the car.<br>  <br>  It's still $2000 though.<br>  <br>  Pretty stupid, no? Happens all the time, though.|`|9b36c8a9cd2a6e74b0258c1980397e49aa	The '09 WRX is updated w/ more power (265 hp).

The WRX is cheaper so buy th WRX.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	Anything you can do to an WRX, you can also do to an STI and get just as big a gain if not more so you were given some wrong info.  And yes the STI is more money but for the difference you get a lit.  Brembo brakes, a bullet proof 6 speed tranny, AVCS which is cam timing adjustment(Dual AVCS on the 08 and up), plus better wheels and tires and stronger wheel bearings.  So it's worth the extra money if you can afford it and the added insurance.  If performance is what you are after and will be modding, the STI will reward you more than the WRX.|`|WdcjDGU0aa	The STi is faster and has better features in the car
33ztb5CZaa	Make sure your tires have the correct tire preassure, underinflated tires can decrease fuel economy by 3%, don't over inflate it or the tire will wear out quickly.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't have anything heavy in your trunk or anything on the roof. This will cause drag resulting in bad mpg. <br>  <br>  The fuel injectors might need to be cleaned, you can easily buy yourself a bottle at walmart for 10 dollars. Just pour it into your gas tank and presto. <br>  <br>  An oil change may be necesary. With all the gunk in the oil, it gets sticky and causes more friction on the pistons making them use more power to move them. <br>  <br>  Make sure your intake filter is clean, to check this look for a black box with clippings on the side, its abou 7x11 in (don't mistaken this for the battery, the battery has wires coming out of it, intakes don't) Open the clippings and buy a square intake filter for 15 dollars and put it in.<br>  <br>  Oxygen sensors may be malfunctioning and the best way to check is to buy yourself a 300 dollar self check device or go to your local mechanic and let them do it. for about 20 dollars.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Check the tire pressures too, even a 10lb drop in pressures will have dramatic effects.|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	plug wire and plug and cap will helpat 50000 should be change|`|71thHKZAaa	exhaust! make sure everything is in place with your exhaust system.|`|ZY4M287Gaa	i would check the air filter if you live down a back road it can clog the air filter|`|TMU1cwe8aa	you need to service your fuel system have it clean up that should take care of that matter.

More than 50 ambulances rushed to the site, transporting injured survivors to nearby hospitals. <br>  It was very lucky. It's unbelievable. If it had moved another 250 meters away, it would have hit the trees, the risk will have been much bigger," a local official said. <br>  <br>      Mirjam Snoerwang, spokeswoman for the Schiphol airport, told Xinhua that the plane crashed three to four miles from a north-south runway where the plane should have landed, adding that there were 128 passengers and seven crew members on board. <br>  <br>      The plane, which was seven years old, left Istanbul's Ataturk Airport at 8:22 a.m. local time (0622 GMT), and was due to land at10:30 a.m. local time (0930 GMT). The plane appeared to have just missed the runway. <br>  <br>      A survivor told Turkish NTV television that the passengers were in panic when the tragedy occurred. <br>  <br>      "We could not understand what was happening, some passengers screamed in panic," Huseyin Sumer said. He said the crash was over in five to 10 seconds. <br>  <br>      Reports said that the fact that the plane landed in a muddy, plowed field may have contributed to making the accident less deadly by absorbing much of the force of the hard impact. <br>  <br>      No fire also helped to reduce the casualties to a relatively low level, experts said. <br>  <br>      The Turkish Transportation Ministry has set up a crisis desk to deal with the accident. Turkish Airlines sent a delegation to Amsterdam to deal with the accident. <br>  <br>      The list of the dead and injured, whose nationalities were not yet known, may be released at another press conference scheduled for 4:00 p.m. local time (1500 GMT), Snoerwang said. <br>  <br>      Relatives of the dead were taken to a reception center in the airport, she said. <br>  <br>      All flights in and out of the Schiphol airport, which is Europe's fifth-largest by passenger volume, were temporarily suspended after the crash. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      Wednesday's crash came weeks after a U.S. Continental Airlines plane crashed on Feb.12 in suburban Buffalo, New York, killing all49 people aboard the aircraft and one person on the ground. <br>  <br>  <br>   US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into a chilly Hudson River on Thursday, apparently after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to officials and passengers.<br>  <br>   <br>  iReporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the scene in the river. <br>  <br>   1 of 3 more photos ?  Everyone on board was accounted for and alive, officials said. About 15 people were being treated at hospitals and others were being evaluated at triage centers. <br>  <br>  Flight 1549, headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, was airborne less than three minutes, according to FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown. <br>  <br>  The pilot radioed to air traffic controllers that he had experienced a bird strike and declared an emergency, a New Jersey State Police source said.<br>  <br>  "I think a lot of people started praying and just collecting themselves," said passenger Fred Berretta. "It was quite stunning."  Watch passenger describe landing ?<br>  <br>  He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart, but it did not.<br>  <br>  "It was a great landing," Berretta said. <br>  <br>  Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia saw the plane clear the George Washington Bridge by less than 900 feet before gliding into the water about 3:31 p.m.|`|u3novh9Zaa	It's just a coincidence, unfortunately a very bad one.

It'll just take a while.......|`|PvCngXKIaa	In order for the tire to inflate it must seal itself to the rim.  Using a small portable air compressor might not do the trick.  But if you are having problems try wetting the sidewall all around where it contacts the rim. that might help it to seal.  Once a complete seal is accomplished it will just take time for it to inflate to the proper level.  Unfortunately, you might wear out your compressor in the process.  If I were you I would just take the tire (on the rim) to a tire store in your neighborhood and ask them to inflate it for you.  Most folks will do that for nothing but if there's a charge it should be very minimal.  If you have the money why not have the inflated tire (wheel) balanced while you are there.  That alone might make the trip worthwhile.
54jCmmI4aa	Your requirements very strongly suggest a Toyota or a Honda, especially two that require smooth driving and high reliability after a lot of mileage.    I would likely use AutoOnInfo.net's Best of 2009 list that summarizes the reliability of models for the 10 most-recent model years. From this, some prime choices, together with their Composite Reliability Values, are:    The 4-cylinder Toyota RAV4 small sport-utility vehicle, with a Composite Reliability value of +1.00 on a scale of -1.00 to +1.00,    The 4-cylinder Honda Accord family car, with a Composite Reliability value of +.95,    The Toyota Matrix wagon, with a Composite Reliability value of +.93,    The Honda CR-V small sport-utility vehicle, with a Composite Reliability value of +.85,    The 4-cylinder Toyota Camry family car, with a Composite Reliability value of +.80.    The list is larger, but other models seem to fall short of your specifications.    See http://www.AutoOnInfo.net/NAEd200811Best... .    If a Toyota is your preference, a reasonably well-maintained vehicle from the late 1980s forward should serve you well; if a Honda is your preference, I would rather require it to be from the mid-1990s or later.

There really aren't that many cars anymore that are that impressive.  I guess the Younger generation would be different,  they can afford anything, but I really don''t think among them any of those 3 would be their choice,  if I had to pick one I would say Mercedes as it makes real special high end cars that the public can''t afford, and are made in very limited editions.|`|xuThaCvRaa	Audi's are the most popular car with wealthy citizens of the U.K.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Mercedes are traditionally the car for the rich and both BMW and Audi provide cars for the discerning driver.

9EdJHqKHaa	Every car is different. The "life expectation" will be different on every G35 depending on how well the car was maintained, quality and quantity of servicing, car history, etc... this is not something you can get a cut and dry answer on. You cant even get an estimate considering the car is only 6 years old. If you are talking about a '80 infiniti then you can get an estimate of mileage before the engines in the vehicles blew, but this would only be if all vehicles were driven the same, cared for the same, used in the same geographical location (ex mountainous, weather conditions, etc...). There is no way to provide a reasonable expectation, and if anyone tries they would be telling you stories.|`|kz9O7QKwaa	124,309                     7 years    http://www.pinkcheeks.com/analbleach.htm...|`|AA12162127	When i was looking for my used G, i found a few 03, 04s that the dealers said drove like new.

43DHFQnKaa	unlikely there is a specific installation for your car.     there are a quite a few car profiles - such as yours - where there is little or virtually no performance aftermarket,  as simply demand does not exist to drive design/production.    so creating performance parts is possible using "universal fit"  performance product ,  like here.    http://www.andysautosport.com/saab/2003_...    this will give you a better sound,  but be advised a stand alone installation of a performance exhaust system may give you a little hp boost at the crank,  but nothing that will be noticeable in the drive.    for general performance increase, a performance exhaust system, catback has to be done in combination with:  -installation of cold air intake and throttle body spacer  -performance headers  -re tune of engine management system (performance chip, tuning chip or pro tune)    together these will be noticeable yielding about 15% plus increase over stock hp, and with headers much of that will be delivered to the wheels.    so if you want sound,  go for the exhaust installation but if you want performance you may have to search out what is available for your car in respect to the other installations above - i suspect you may have either very limited, and or very expensive options    cheers

WO68RZdIaa	Most states are now setting the age for teens to get their permits at or near 15, so it's not a big deal that Michigan is allowing you to get your permit 3 months shy of being 15.    This may sound dumb, but you need to be a resident of Michigan to get your permit at 14 yrs 9 mos (hey- I had a teen ask me in an email last week if he could go to another state to get his permit because he had just turned 15 & in his state you had to be 16 to get your permit)    To get your permit, you need to pick up the forms, complete Segment 1 of an approved Driver's Ed program, take a vision test & have the Level 1 application signed by a parent of guardian.    If you feel that you can learn to handle a vehicle safely & will be a responsible driver while operating the vehicle & your parents get you enrolled in an approved DE course, then go for it. Just remember that the ability to have a driver's license is nothing but a privilege- not a right. And you must earn that privilege to be granted a license by the state & that license can be suspended/revoked if you abuse that privilege.      http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127...|`|n7jXAQFWaa	That's really a personal decision isn't it?

You might get a ticket for reckless driving or failure to stop or failure to yield a train. It might be similar to failure to stop at a stop sign.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	At 4500 miles since last reset, the Maint Reqd light will blink at you on startup (very easy to miss seeing it).  At 5000 miles since last reset, the Maint Reqd light will stay on solid.    It's just a reminder by miles that you are due for the next scheduled maintenance.  It is not smart (doesn't go by time, or do any oil analysis), just a mile counter. Usually that is an oil change/tire rotation:  http://smg.toyotapartsandservice.com/    Should your dealer forget to reset it, or you go to an independent mechanic or DIY, you can reset the light yourself.

An hour is 60 minutes.    2 mph = 2/60 miles per minute  3 mph = 3/60 miles per minute  4 mph = 4/60 miles per minute    distance = rate * time, so:  distance / rate = time    5.57 miles / 2/60 miles per minute = 5.57 miles * 60/2 minutes per mile = 167.1 minutes = approx. 2 hours 47 minutes  5.57 miles / 3/60 miles per minute = 5.57 miles * 60/3 minutes per mile = 111.4 minutes = approx. 1 hour 51 minutes  5.57 miles / 4/60 miles per minute = 5.57 miles * 60/4 minutes per mile = 83.55 minutes = approx. 1 hour 24 minutes|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	12.6

Ford will void your 100K warranty so fast, your head will spin if you come in with a turbo problem after the install.  The factory air filter will hold up to 5 pounds of dirt and still flow the correct amount of air to the engine.  Why would you want to change it?  It does not need changing until the vacuum gauge on the side of the filter says so, and that may be 100K miles from now.  It will cancel your engine warranty if you change the filter housing and it causes engine damage because it does not stop dirt as well as the factory filter.  It's up to you.|`|O6PydzY9aa	Hi,    I agree with David, with a K&N Air Filter you will see a power increase instantly.

The whell has to position properly, on the steering shaft, so that when you have the front wheels aligned the steering wheel will be straight.|`|X2ED3OrRaa	'GM LOCK PLATE REMOVER' [tilt/telescopic]   State that this is a 'tilt/telescopic' column, the plate remover is different for the tilt/telescopic type column, because of the 'telescoping' action of the column. [up and down].  Auto Zone has a loaner program that has this tool as a 'loaner', You get your money back when you return it! Good Luck!    EDIT:  That 'C' clamp only goes one way, up or down, that held me up all day once, without the tool those tiny little bearings are in a thin plastic case and are fragile.  GET THE LOOCK PLATE REMOVER/INSTALLER!             "BRILLIANT"!!!!|`|sLgI3cRpaa	go to pep boys
AA10788612	That can vary widely based on structure design, size, location, materials, man power, & season.

WO68RZdIaa	As long as you follow the rules & have a qualified licensed driver with you at all times while driving, you can drive until you run into an ocean, turn around and continue driving until you run into another ocean. (Sorry for the Forrest Gump reference here- that wasn't intended)|`|kXUwDLgWaa	NO.
b8cupXj7aa	Unfortunately for you, you are medically unfit for the military.  Suicide attempt is taken very seriously and Uncle Sam is not going to   take any chances. In this case, you have made your bed and must lie in it.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	It's great that therapy has assisted you in adjusting.  No.  You're done as far as the military (including USCG) is concerned.  Military flying is physically and mentally demanding.  You've shown you have issues dealing with mental/emotional stress of everyday life.  Some decisions are unrecoverable.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You may still become a civilian pilot if you can convince the FAA that you aren't likely to attempt suicide again.  This requires a lot of documentation and preferably a specialist in dealing with the FAA to help you through the red tape.  Decisions on medicals for people who have attempted suicide at some point in their lives are made by FAA headquarters.    A suicide attempt will generally disqualify you from becoming a commercial pilot, because of the greater responsibility you would have for the lives of others.  A private pilot's license would be easier to obtain, but it's still a lot of work compared to a normal medical for someone who has never tried suicide.    The military generally has much stricter standards, although I'm not familiar enough with them to comment any more precisely on whether or not the military would accept you.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	--Exactly why the suicide attempt?|`|u0My4f5uaa	Since you've soloed, I'm assuming you've held a medical certificate at one point.  If you're on antidepressants, you're automatically disqualified.  Once you've been off them for long enough, you become eligible again.  I'm sure that even if you weren't, your application would be deferred to Oklahoma City or the regional flight surgeon.    You can fly again, but you have to prove that you are medically qualified.  I'd consult an aviation medical examiner.  Do NOT get an appointment, though.  Just a consultation.  If you put anything on the questionnaire, the FAA owns it and you can't take it back.    On another note, I'm very happy that you're alive.  My brother committed suicide in September, and I guarantee you that you don't want to do that to your family.    Clear skies and tailwinds!|`|f9wQ8RcAaa	Not only can you not become a pilot, you have disqualified yourself from many positions of responsibility. Suicide is just as serious as murder and most agencies that employ people for positions of responsibility will not even consider your application. You may be able to get a civilian pilot rating, but I really doubt it. Not only was your suicide attempt really dumb, but you have effectively messed up your life for a very long time. Society never forgets these sort of things. You are now, and will be for a very long time deemed mentally incompetent. Your decisions are clearly not thought out very well and perhaps you are not the best candidate for a pilot rating. While this may seem a bit harsh, this is reality. Society no longer tolerates this sort of behavior. If you really wanted to kill yourself, you would have done so.
fKVF8fufaa	If you had given year, make, and model it could possibly have helped more to diagnose your problem. Don E has given you a good suggestion check it out. If the lever is not hitting the case you will have to look inside, I don't think you have a bent shift fork because that doesn't happen all of a sudden ( unless of course you just had a hard left side crash). My best guess is that the shift pawl or the end of the shift drum is somehow damaged or misaligned. On a typical Japanese bike these items are located in back of the clutch under the right side engine cover, and you will not have to remove or disassemble the engine to repair or replace these pieces, good luck.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	The shift lever may be hitting the side case from getting bent.If so bend it back.|`|AA11275863	Get it sixed.

If it is I would recommend getting it looked at if your not to confident with bikes.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	i would check out the clutches if it was on my bike(400ex)
m7DheoPIaa	knewton valve or muffler bearing are shot|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Cold weather destroys batteries. Since the car sounds like it's starting, then sputters, it's not the battery. You'll know it's the battery because it will crank much slower than usual, or the engine won't crank at all, and you'll hear 'tick tick tick'. Maybe the alternator, some form of ignition wiring, or bad fuel pump. Are you seeing any kind of check engine light when the car is running?|`|Pt0BFl0jaa	I think it may be in the chargjng system,alternater.|`|DnuNsN1xaa	yes the cold makes your battery have less voltage.  It could be that your alternator isn't working well enough (not recharging your battery as you drive)  It also could be that your battery needs to sit on a low amp charger for a while to be 100% charged up, so it can cope with the weather.  clicking sounds, and/or your tachometer and speedometer jumping around are signs of a dead battery.
