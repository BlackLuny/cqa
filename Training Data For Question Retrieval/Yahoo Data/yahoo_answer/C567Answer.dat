You shouldn't expect to make top dollar fresh out of school.<br>  <br>  To become an orthodontist, you need a dental degree, then  at least two or three years of advanced specialty education in an ADA-accredited orthodontic residency program.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	I can't really think of any medical conditions called CK, I wonder if you mean Creatine Kinase? CK is an enzyme and is one of the tests given along with Troponin to diagnose whether one has had a heart attack- it indicates muscle/ heart cell damage. CK is also elevated when other muscles in the body are damaged. <br>  <br>  CK–MB levels are more useful  that CK for determining whether the damaged muscle is the heart or other muscles in the body. CK–MB will also let your Doctor know if drugs given to dissolve the suspected clots has worked.|`|N3t7uv1saa	Not a condition, but a blood test.  Creatine kinase.  It is an enzyme that is release in the damage of muscle.  Used mostly to show heart muscle damage, but is elevated in all muscle damage.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Like Rhianna I am unaware of any condition which is known as CK disease. Of course it may be an abbreviation peculiar to a medical sub-specialty.<br>  <br>  Again as Rhianna suggests the abbreviation CK does refer to an enzyme, creatinine kinase. This increases with muscle injury in general and also was used in the past to identify patients who had had a recent heart attack, using iso-enzyme CK to cardiac muscle.
yE2vM76naa	Are you taking medications for blood pressure or cardiac function that are contraindictaed by Grapefruit?<br>  <br>  If so - avoid them entirely.<br>  If you are not taking a medication - enjoy them all you like...|`|U4V6TkZEaa	This is new to me. Who said that grapefruit hurts your liver?|`|aXnVFFUkaa	there is some information in grapefruits in the link for you|`|hSOEgpPNaa	That is ridiculous, of course it wouldn't
AA11388527	This is a toughie.  There are many diagnoses that qualify a person for SSI and I don't understand why the SSA (Social Security Admin.) specifically requires a diagnosis of depression for your son.  Go to their website and check out his eligibility.  You'll see the option to do that.  You can determine if hydrocephaly is an eligible diagnosis.  He may also be eligible for partial SDI payments.  If you can't, for some reason, add him to your insurance, he may be eligible for Medicaid.  This is a priority as he needs to be followed by a doctor.<br>  <br>  Yes, denials can be fought and won but you don't enter into this battle without being well prepared and well-armed.  Be persistent and persevere.  You may also get help from a local Legal Aid Society should you require legal counsel.
xvey8ixPaa	It depends on where you get them and what is being ordered on them. It can take anywhere from an hour to 3-4 weeks for specialty stuff. The average is 7-10 working days.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Depends on where you order from of course.  Sam's Club & Costco have the best prices (Costco especially) and they come back within 2 weeks.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	That depends greatly on who you ordered them from, or where you bought them.<br>  <br>  The place I go (Dr. Bizer's Vision World) usually has them ready within in an hour.<br>  <br>  You should have probably asked them when you ordered/bought them.|`|kTZevQNHaa	depends where you ordered them Some places will have them ready for pick up within the hour...some make you wait 8 to 10 working days.<br>  If they have to send them out--it takes longer. That's why.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	Anywhere from 24 hours at lens crafters to six months.|`|z9GAhgiUaa	Ordering from O4L I got my glasses in 11 days.|`|FqDEUk7faa	I ordered online from FramesDirect and received my glasses in 18 days.<br>  <br>  I ordered online from Optical4Less and received my glasses in 8 days.<br>  <br>  I ordered glasses in Walmart and got my glasses the next day.<br>  <br>  OF course your experience may be different than mind.
rSXZOU5zaa	They sell pill cutters, that let you cut any pill in half.<br>  Also, you could try to mix it in some jello and swallow it all at once. (goes down easier...you could use pudding too)<br>  Hope that helps!|`|2OO9U8o9aa	You could crush it into smaller pieces and then make sure your throat is wet with water , and swallow the broken pieces with a large mouthful of water . If you think about things then you will realise that you swallow bigger things in your food than pills|`|AmpW5HuAaa	Don't worry about it! ^^<br>  You can always drink a lot of water with them,<br>  That way it will just seem like drinking water<br>  Soon, you won't have aproblem<br>  Good luck! =D|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Don't you think it's time you grew up and got over this?|`|uK3EkOxRaa	Are you taking it down with water? Try it if your not. <br>  <br>  If you are, and still doesnt work, you can try thinking of it as food. Make your mind think its delicous and taste wonderful. Its prolly the thought of just putting a pill in your mouth and the taste of it that is preventing you.|`|CuL8nLRgaa	i'm the same :(<br>  <br>  but WHATEVER YOU DO...<br>  <br>  DON'T CRUSH IT UP.<br>  you can die from it getting into your bloodstream too quickly.|`|AA10350894	If your medication allows it, take it with some food.<br>  A lot of people have some sort of trouble or phobia about swallowing pills, but if you swallow it with some food perhaps it will go down without you really noticing it.

4SKIE1C8aa	Depends. Contact sports require longer healing time since reinjury can cause brain damage or death while non-contact sports will require less time. It also depends on the degree of the concussion, minor concussions obviously require less healing time than major ones do.|`|xzwZ3lt3aa	There is no "normal" time. Most people with a concussion don't ever lose consciousness. If there is a loss of consciousness it can last anywhere from several seconds to several minutes, or more, depending on how severe the brain injury.<br>  <br>  Sorry, didn't get the question. A concussion is a bruise. A brain bruise. My guess would be a week or two.|`|eez2gtaLaa	I forgot...
mrndKIYvaa	I am on day 5. No catheter here at all. I did get a drain because my gallbladder was about to burst so they did it to make sure nothing nasty like bile was draining from me. The drain was removed in 24 hours and I was allowed to go home.<br>  <br>  I ate a chicken salad sandwich about 6 hours after surgery and did fine. I then ate some cereal in the morning, and for dinner I had a hamburger patty with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes with bread and butter. All via the hospital.<br>  <br>  When I got home I ate cereal and blueberry muffins, and tonight (a little scared) I just tried a fresco steak taco! My only complaint has been heartburn but I have always had a lot of heartburn problems and to boot I am 11 weeks pregnant and still breastfeeding my 2 year old. <br>  <br>  I am off of pain pills, but the right shoulder pain from the gas has been the worse part. Just walk and stay mobile. Get that wretched gallbladder out before it kills you like mine almost did! You will feel better. Before it was out I needed 2 mg morphine in a pump every 1-2 hours to just feel "less" pain from the attacks I was suffering while in the hospital. I was terrified when they told me I needed surgery that night but I've been better with the surgery than without it. Plus I'd be dead without the surgery since my gallbladder was going to burst and kill me!|`|IHdnrXuyaa	Hi! I had my gallbladder taken out when I was 15..I did not have a catheter after surgery or a drain? I'm not sure what a drain is so I'm assuming I didn't have one.  They made three or four tiny incisions no bigger than the width of your pinkie nail. I had it taken out on a Thursday and was home by Friday and back in school by Monday or Tuesday.  I also know a few people who went home the day of the surgery.  I also can't eat certain things and they run right through me if i do--my biggest issue is with pasta, but it is different for everyone.  If it becomes too big of a problem, I went to a GI doctor and he gave me medicine to help with it.
aiBOMU9kaa	The little cases use 5 ml to fill them, so out of 300 ml, that would be good for 60 fills, minus the amount you use for cleaning and rinsing.<br>  <br>  Say you are using 2 ml a day for cleaning and rinsing, which should be plenty, that makes 7 -8 ml's a day total...which means 35-37 days.<br>  <br>  Thats providing of course that you only clean them once a day .<br>  <br>  Most of my contact lens patients tell me the bottle lasts a month.<br>  <br>  How was that for some quick math huh ?|`|HbQmDGb6aa	It goes faster than you'd expect. A couple weeks, max.
bvt9kvS8aa	Hold the dumb-bells in your hands. Keep your arms by your side. Now raise your weight up and down while elbows attached firmly to your body. Do 3 sets of 15 counts each. This exercise is known as biceps curl.<br>  <br>  Define the top muscles of upper arms by toning the biceps. Exercises such as hammer curl, angled biceps curl, biceps stretch, bent over flyes and wall outs are for toning up top muscles of upper arms.<br>  <br>  Tone up the underside muscles of the upper arms by working on the triceps. Overhead press, triceps dip, triceps stretch, backwards lift and triceps extension are some exercises for triceps.<br>  <br>  Go for power walking or swimming. Play tennis and basketball that requires movement of upper arm muscles.<br>  <br>  Eat a balanced diet. Reduce the amount of fats and carbohydrates. Consult your dietician for framing a suitable diet plan for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
EpMi1OgLaa	that is totally rubbish!!! Proteins are considered either complete proteins (which supply enough essential amino acids) or incomplete proteins (which lack adequate essential amino acids). Meat, eggs and dairy products are considered complete proteins, but vegetables, beans and other plant products are considered incomplete proteins. therefore the protein found in dairy and meat is exactly the same and as a result gets absorbed all together|`|yE2vM76naa	People who keep kosher do not eat dairy and meat in the same meal.<br>  Other wise, there is no real reason for it.|`|tIldpr7vaa	thats stupid. Do yourself a favor, ignore any advice that person says from now on
m9eSPvdfaa	Your blood pressure skyrockets and causes the dizzy head spinning thing. Your blood pressure rises cuz you get so angry? Why? I'm not sure. I used to get insanely pissed and in a rage like that. I DID break stuff and had the head thing too. I don't do it anymore. I think I found better ways of handling my emotions|`|3e8B2hMBaa	join the club. my doctor and i think its like-migraine, they have pills for it.|`|AA10202389	Anger blocks reason and kills brain cells, probably making you more illogical. I try to stop it before it starts because I know it doesn't help anything. I found that when I felt pain about something I went right to anger, because I wanted to do something about the pain. The only thing you can really do is sit with the pain and relax and let the intuition give you solutions or insights into the situation and perhaps a solution. Sometime the only solution is to just live with the pain, sometimes you are only feeling someone else's pain and anger. I look at it as a service to carry their pain as they're unable to. I just feel compassion for them and even try to help them if I can.<br>  What I hate is when I get angry at an inanimate object. I started to get mad once as I FELT I was too slow at doing something, but when I stopped and tried to look at why, I noticed that actually I was doing it remarkably fast. I was proud of myself instead and realized two other things. The mind goes faster than the body, so naturally I couldn't do it as fast as I could think. The other thing was that I expected too much, judgmental, too critical. There are thoughts behind emotions. Correct the thoughts and we have healthy emotions that can help guide us in life. All those negative thoughts bring on depression also. Negative words, even, add up like a poison slowly poisoning you to death.<br>  It's hard to control our thinking, but easier to control our word choice. I entered a whole new world when I dropped, what I called, judgmental words and thoughts. It is also painful to compare ourselves with other people and judging them just makes us and them unhappy. Oh, yeah, dropping negative words made it so I could be as happy as I wanted to be also. So happy I get high. LOL I have to stop it to drive. Hope it works for you. It's a whole lifestyle change. And don't let them kid you about intuition. It's more powerful than our thinking. We only go wrong when we mistake our thinking for intuition. Test it to see which is which, but using it is the secret to life. Do I get any thanks for that? Not hardly. I sure would like to know if it changed someone else's life or if I'm wasting my time trying to tell people what I discovered.
9pLdhuBnaa	You would need to see an ENT to have them evaluate this pain from your right nostril.  When you call to make the appointment to have them evaluate this further ask the receptionist to put you on the cancellation list.  Let them know that you are really hurting.<br>  <br>  However, even before doing any of this I would recommend seeing your regular doctor first if you haven't already so that they can evaluate this situation further.
S7rc6mp7aa	I would encourage you to visit this great website: www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago now and they have saved me thousands on all services over the years. From cleanings, braces, xrays, root canals...etc. There are no limits and restrictions that really benefited me because I needed a lot of dental work at the time. They even had my very affordable plan active in 2 hours and was able to use them the very same day. good luck and hope this helps.|`|5WSJbkcFaa	There is a dental plan that has no waiting period and even allows ongoing conditions. This means that you could have a dental problem for a long time and get it fixed right away.|`|vc36XGXNaa	healthplans.bebto.com - my family have this health insurance. It is affordable and has good coverage for dental issues.|`|MYilJDb5aa	you can go through a dental plan like dental plan saver, which lasts a year.
EhJlgKLAaa	you don't need to improve your eating habits|`|RKMgokm6aa	Uh, your eating habits sound fine. I don't really see a problem, just eat a variety of things, but it sounds like you know what to eat and when. At 5'3" you are a great weight. Although you may aspire to lose an extra pound or two, most guys do not find overly skinny girls very attractive.|`|NKdJeUVoaa	According to your Body Mass Index you're almost considered underweight as it is (not a good thing!), you should not be trying to lose more weight. Your diet is very healthy (but maybe add some more nuts, eggs or dairy for more protein) but you you're right -- you need to be eating more.|`|4XRKoGDWaa	from the sounds of it you're only getting half of the recommeded daily calorie intake, which for women is around 1900 calories, you body mass index for 5'3 and 105-109lbs is 18.6-19.3.

Once you get it, it's hard to prevent it, you sort of have to let it work itself out.  However, you don't want to become dehydrated.  If you do, you need IV fluids.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No such thing as the "stomach flu".flu = influenza (respiratory infection)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.
bYoOYmeDaa	Probably in less than a month.  Maybe a few weeks.  It all depends on how much fat is on your thighs.

You haven't been on them long enough to experience any bad side effects from stopping.|`|IUeav3oXaa	It's not a good Idea to just quit a medicine but there again you only been on it 4 days. Its not even in your system yet. To be safe I call your doctor or get a second appion.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Talk to your doctor, he can help set your mind at rest about the side effects. Don't just stop taking antidepressants if you need them. Every medicin in the world has a long list of side effects, even aspirin, but very few experience them. If you suffer side effects you can always change to a different medicin.|`|76a921a934a58675d13407d3f018e39baa	Its tough to say weather you should or not.

I just got out of the emergency room because of those 5 hour energy drink things so im still in lala land.
2qPtGTNcaa	You are not alone. According to a national sleep study, more than 30% of us are sleep-deprived and fall asleep at work or going to work. You have to try to go to sleep about a half and hour earlier  than usual to try to catch up. It also helps if you make sure you drink 8 glasses of water a day. It helps you to stay asleep and to sleep more soundly.|`|rh5vbol9aa	Its possible you can not to sleep deeply. And this is very important. And the stress causes this. Eat 10 pieces nut before go to bed.|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	You should get a checkup at the Doc for it, or get to bed earlier!|`|yp8NtB0faa	If i could fall asleep at work i would!
Y1Wr2sG8aa	Thread worms are tiny, if they did come out you probably wouldn't see them. Tiny and white and look like tiny lengths of cotton.  It may just be a slight irritation though. They're easily treatable, there's some sort of medicine you can get from any pharmacy, there was an 'outbreak' at my son's infant school years ago, and there was no problem. Don't worry about it!!|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	Yes it is a possibility. Even if you are very clean and eat only fresh foods you can get them. Especially if you eat out time to time. And it would be normal if you did get them. as yucky as it sounds its actually normal. The only way you will be able to tell or get help is if you see a Castro dr. The dr will ask you to poop in a cup like the one you pee in at the dr's office than bring it in the same day so they can send it to a lab for testing. If you do they will give you a small amount of pesticide to kill the worms and their eggs but not you. If you test positive you should have any one living with you get checked.|`|24vZfnF3aa	If your bottom feels itchy & it's worse at night(which is when the worms come out to lay their eggs) then more than likely it is thread worms. They are common, mostly in children, because of poor hand hygiene. Children scratch the itch, get eggs under their nails, then pass it on with hand to hand contact. Medication can be bought over the counter, but the whole family needs to be treated. Otherwise re-infection is likely. Take care
5RoYyprkaa	Your first few periods are usually chunky and stringy. It's most always full out disgusting. I freaked out when I started mine, because I was 10 and in school and my mom really hadn't told me to expect that. I thought you just bled. Haha.

IKakoOfyaa	First, go to the Aetna site, register (if you haven't already), login and check to see which dentists are in your network.  Then start making calls.  All offices are different, but you'll find that most places will bill your insurance directly before you leave the office and present you with a bill for your portion immediately.  You may find someone who will work with you on a payment plan though, so please do call around.<br>  <br>  *****************<br>  I just thought of this as an alternative....if there is a university with a dental school in your area, call them.  Many accept insurance plans, will work with you on payment, and will do the work for a greatly reduced cost making your responsibility much less than that of a regular dentist.  They do good work too and it's all under the supervision of licensed dentists and orthodontists.

Q4ggnG0waa	Heart cancer is extremely rare. Less than 1% of soft tissue cancers are heart cancer.|`|aCDWwsisaa	People can, and do, but not many...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/h/heart_cancer/stats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/h/heart_ca...</a>|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Yes. It's called cardiac sarcoma. My sister passed away from it. She developed a tumor on the back of her heart the size of a grapefruit. It is very rare. When I told people they looked at me like I was crazy as if there was no such thing. Look it up on-line. It's called cardiac sarcoma. Very very rare.|`|LDxMBcktaa	In answer to you question, yes, but it is very rare. Unless someone blasts your chest with a gamma radiation laser gun, you are very unlikely to develop it.
aMHSG5Jaaa	Yes, it's a great natural product. The acai berry is high in anti oxidants and other things. They are a really great way to help augment a solid an exercise and diet program if you are looking to lose weight.<br>  <br>  The Acai berry is gaining popularity because of being featured on such TV’s shows as The Today Show, Rachael Ray and Oprah. What are some of the other reasons why acai berries are healthy?<br>  They also help combat fatigue and other things. I have been using them for a couple months now and I have noticed a difference. The best bet in my opinion is to take advantage of the free trial bottle offer that many companies selling the acai berry offer that way you can decide if you really like them without having to buy.<br>  <br>  That’s what I did and I used them along with a diet and exercise program and it worked for me. I found that the acai berry was very good at curbing my urge to snack which really helped since it can be so easy to blow that workout right out of the water for naught if I gave in to my urges and had that mid afternoon snack.<br>  <br>  I got mine from here|`|MzWM9rBRaa	You can lose belly fat with any weight loss supplement.  You just have to have your diet healthy and you have to be getting exercise.  They are called supplements because they "boost" weight loss you are already doing.  No product works if you sit on your butt!|`|8ZczHpWtaa	I have tried acai berry and I love It !!!<br>  <br>  You can find it in <a href="http://www.dietpillsplan.com/buy-acai-berry" rel="nofollow">http://www.dietpillsplan.com/buy-acai-be...</a>|`|g3Ocpal5aa	It does help tremendously.<br>  <br>  Acai berries work by reducing the appetite (due to a high concentration of fiber they are a wonderful appetite suppressant) and by upping the bodies metabolic rate (which decides how quickly you burn calories even when resting - so the acai berries will increase the amount of calories your body burns).<br>  <br>  These two benefits alone (ignoring other health uses of the berry) can really help reduce the amount of belly fat that you have.<br>  <br>  Whilst Acai berries shouldn't take the place of a healthy diet or exercise regime they are a wonderful supplement to help you lose a lot of weight, including belly fat.

qrGLcTh4aa	Becoming a hygienist requires a high school degree, then you have to get an associates in applied science (which takes 2 years), while you are completing the associates degree you will apply for the hygiene program. Once excepted into the program you will have to commit to 2 years of full time class room practice. THEN, once you graduate you will need to become licensed by the state in which you live. You get 3 chances to pass the licensing test. That's pretty much the norm in all states. Check with your local University or Junior College to see if they have the program and what their requirements are. <br>  You will do fine. It's a great career and you will make great money.|`|wOecmtrzaa	Being a dental hygenist only requires a 3 year professional school degree, you can go right out of high school.
WvBgXv5daa	How is sunburn treated? <br>  It may help to: <br>  <br>  Soak in a cool bath. It may help to add bath products containing oatmeal to help decrease itching and the burned feeling. <br>  Put cool, moist cloths on the sunburned skin several times a day. <br>  Take an anti-inflammatory medicine, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. It will help the sunburn be less painful. It may also lessen the damage to your skin, especially if you start taking it when you first suspect you are sunburned. Carefully follow the directions on the package for taking the medicine. <br>  Put aloe vera lotion or another moisturizing lotion on your skin 3 times a day for 2 days. <br>  Put calamine lotion on your skin to lessen the itching. <br>  Take antihistamine tablets, such as Benadryl. Taking the tablets may cause you to become drowsy. Do not drive or operate machinery or equipment while you are taking this medicine. <br>  If you have just a few shallow blisters, treat them like a minor household burn. You can apply some antibiotic ointment, such as bacitracin, and then cover the blistered area with a bandage. <br>  <br>  Don't try to open the blisters. Let them open on their own, when the underlying skin can better protect itself from infection. If you are not sure about how severe your blisters are or if they are becoming infected, check with your health care provider. Signs of infection are increased redness or pain, and yellow discharge from the blisters. <br>  <br>  How long will the effects last? <br>  The symptoms of sunburn usually worsen 24 to 48 hours after you are burned. The symptoms gradually go away over the next few days. <br>  <br>  Sunburn causes long-term damage to the skin. Redness alone is the same as a first-degree burn. Redness with blistering is a second-degree burn. Both types of sunburn are harmful to the skin and over time increase the risk of skin cancer. Blistering burns increase the risk of malignant skin cancer (melanoma) by several times. This is especially true if you have severe sunburns 3 or more times when you are a teen or young adult. <br>  <br>  Too much sun exposure, even without sunburn, also causes the skin to age faster. Wrinkles, sagging, and brown sunspots develop at an earlier age|`|4ZC14zPTaa	It depends.<br>  One time I got it so bad it is still there!<br>  (That was a year ago)<br>  But it usually only takes a few days or so.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	Depends how bad, if its just red skin it will usually go away in one or two days.  If it gets bad enough to peel then a week.|`|qg9l2gcPaa	My shoulders got sun burnt and it took about a week or more for it to go away.|`|XdBN0uO8aa	It can take about a week to go away. I get sunburn real easy and I hate it. You should get some Aloe vera gel and put it in the fridge and get it nice and cool than rub it on twice a day. That should help it heal faster and it won't dry your skin out to bad...Good luck!!!|`|TWaV0Agoaa	It really all depends on how badly you were burned. If it's starting to blister I would say at least 2 weeks. I wore a tube top to an all day concert without sun screen and got badly sunburned with blisters and it took a month for my skin to completely heal.|`|8OnvPHDbaa	well if it's aint too bad then it should b gone in 2 or 3 days...if it's pretty bad it may take a week to 12 days...it will peel on the last few days..but it should b fine...|`|Shhp0Mepaa	how the hell should i know|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	12 days|`|22Oy1qp0aa	It depends on the severity of the burn, I'd say 1 to 2 weeks|`|yN9ei6fqaa	just a few dayz. they hurt so bad.|`|81xtzlYCaa	im gonna go with 3-4 years. give or take|`|4SyYpBChaa	hmm in about 3 days it'll go brown or w/e<br>  <br>  but yeah put moisteriser on it and lots of it, or after sun,<br>  <br>  it should lighten each day,<br>  <br>  ssame thing happened to me 2 weeks ago and its gone completely now,<br>  <br>  xx|`|SiomJ10Saa	depends on your skin .. redness should go away in a few days .. maybe a week .. but then there's the lovely peeling process! lol<br>  <br>  Buy some aloe, you can get it for like 3 dollars at any store<br>  <br>  it will make it feel sooo much better, plus keep in moisturized so hopefully you don't peel

And when I mean a lot, I mean like 1000+ a day. An easier way to lose weight would be to jog/run while eating right (don't eat as much, watch what you eat a.k.a no soda, chips, or fatty foods, and exercise in general)<br>  <br>  Like the other user said, most people quit after a week or two of exercising. Just remember, it might not feel like you are losing weight but you will slowly.

bvt9kvS8aa	So far you've done great, to mix and match foods try the diet plan below. and there are also a few tips I have wrote for you to achive a quicker weight lose success.<br>  <br>  Diet Plan:<br>  Breakfast - Oats or porragie<br>  Lunch - sandwich or soup<br>  Dinner - mash, veggies, and some fish or chicken ( grilled ) or some spinach and brown rice<br>  Snacks - try to only snack on stuff like Fruits, raisins, low<br>  sugar popsicles ect..<br>  <br>  & Heres a few weight lose tips:<br>  - No sugar or sweet stuff.. sugar turns straight to fat<br>  <br>  - Buy Low fat salt, low fat sugar or no salt or sugar would be even better.<br>  <br>  - only drink water and green tea, green tea is great its known to speed up the metabolism. Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|AA12212403	Skip the Chex Mix and chips, otherwise you might be OK.  If you want a snack try 94% FF popcorn.<br>  Was there real or low fat or no mayo on that sandwich?<br>  It's the fats that are the killer.<br>  I love tuna with mayo, now I eat it on the side dry and have lite toast with FF butter spray on it and veggies on the side.

Also, try salad, skinless chicken breast (baked or grilled), salmon, shrimp, turkey, and beef jerky.  Some good snack foods are caramel corn flavored rice cakes or chocolate chip flavored rice cakes, prepackaged 100 calorie snacks, sugar free jello, fruit cups, and apple sauce (mango or peach flavored).

8s4RUAmyaa	If you are looking to lift your breast and create better shape then get a molded underwire bra. The pushup bra is specifically to create more volume on the top of your breast. Or ,sometimes to create better clevage. The bra you want should have a band all the way around the torso that creates solid foundation for the cups and lifts the breast. Avoid bra's that do not have a full band.|`|Adq6y8tXaa	go to a bra store and get fitted also buying a more expensive bra would be better then buying a cheap one|`|D0XTAF5Taa	if u want to have breast like other females , high , tight , and firm u got to have them pumped of implants , thats what i did
Rk46lIBwaa	Rhianna is right, vitamins can indeed be a double edged sword. certainly excess of any vitamin appears to not produce any health advantages and some are toxic in what is in effect an overdose.<br>  <br>  Excess vitamin A can damage the retina, D can damage the kidneys and excess E seems to reduce lifespan, though it is not clear why. Black stool might suggest the preparation you are taking contains iron, also toxic to the liver in excess.

If you are taking iron supplements, then black stool are completely normal.

If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an excellent exercise, you can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool, and put your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that it is not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will damage your back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to the number of repetitions. You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack and muscles. Dumbbells do wonders. Much better than these<br>  crunches - I came up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.<br>  <br>  Thighs = Squats, squats and more squats. If you want to to work the inner thigh ecspecially, do plie squats. Essentially, it's a normal squat with your feet turned out, forming sort of a V-shape on the ground. Doing 3 sets of 15 reps or doing them for a full minute everyday will make a huge difference. And don't forget - don't let your knees go past your toes!<br>  <br>  Butt = There is this exercise where you get on the ground with your palms on the groud and your knees on the ground. Then you extend your back leg and then curl it up to your chest then extend out, flexing your glut muscles. Then you switch and do it with your other leg -- hard to explain without a visual but its a relaly great workout.

Just little sips and you will find that you drink it quite quick. Also, if you play on the pc a lot, stop, and just start reading a book for a few hours at night, or do school work. Also, try doing a bit of exercise, maybe just a few easy warm ups for half an hour every day should be enough.<br>   It's very easy for people to assume they have a cancer simply because they hear about it in the news and see it on the internet. But don't over concern yourself. Although, in saying that, i'm no medical expert, and i doubt there will be one on yahoo, so if after a week of drinking water, doing a bit more exercise and less computer playing, you should feel better.

It is filled only with excess oil and dead skin cells. Blackheads are also sometimes referred to as "open comedomes" because the surface of the skin is opened rather than closed.<br>  <br>  Hair Follicle: A hair follicle is a tiny shaft in the skin that a hair grows through. Sebum is excreted from sebaceous glands to the surface of the skin through a hair follicle.<br>  <br>  Whitehead: A whitehead is an acne lesion that forms when oil and skin cells block the opening of a hair follicle. Sometimes whiteheads are called "closed comedomes."<br>  <br>  Lots of other terms are used when acne and its causes and cures are being discussed. These are only the very simple, basic terms.

In about 50% of cases, discolored nails are a result of infections with common fungi that can be found in the air, dust, and soil. There are many species of fungi that can affect nails. By far the most common, however, is called Trichophyton rubrum. This type of fungus has a tendency to infect the skin and is therefore known as a dermatophyte. Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that infects the nail bed and result in a greenish color to the nails. Red or black nails may result from a hematoma (a collection of blood) under the nail as a result of trauma (including ingrown toenails). <br>  <br>  Chronic medical conditions also can affect the appearance of the nails. Specific color changes in the nails can be suggestive of diabetes or of liver, kidney, heart, or lung conditions. This is why doctors pay specific attention to nails during a routine physical examination. <br>  <br>  Other, rare causes of discolored nails include the "yellow nail syndrome," an inherited condition that results in slow-growing, discolored nails and is associated with lymphedema (swelling of tissues due to the accumulation of fluid) and lung diseases. Nails may also appear lightened to a whitish-yellow color if there has been separation of the nail from the nail bed, termed onycholysis.|`|cCbKTbzSaa	it is all down to painting your nails a nd the remover,  try  using  <br>  <br>   the wipes  instead,  they  do not corrode  your nails  they  are called  quickies  , i use them  all the  time. <br>  <br>  never had any problem  with them  at all.|`|4ZC14zPTaa	uhhhhhhh<br>  just live with it|`|WvBgXv5daa	Fungus may be a resource read more about it on google its called nail fungus.|`|aR0hjmKoaa	its because you paint your nails a lot <br>  stop painting them for a while it will go away|`|yN9ei6fqaa	dont paint them for a month and ill bet u they will be normal again|`|vPpy4zK9aa	Look a little closer and you'll probably see that they're very fragile and a little too transparent.<br>  <br>  It's not fungus or anything like that, it's just that they're fragile.<br>  Yes, the reason is probably de nail varnish remover, so try to paint your nails in a light color so you don't have to remove it so often.<br>  And buy a nail varnish remover with NO ACETONE.

xdo49r2iaa	Hi,<br>  Pl. go through the my article below you will find your answers.<br>  Masturbation is the stimulation of the sexual organs usually by a person himself, to obtain an orgasm. Though masturbation can be done by partners on one another, the term is more commonly used when sexual satisfaction is provided by self. Most people use their hands to masturbate, but instruments like vibrators and dildoes may also be used. These imitate the movements of the hand and provide sexual pleasure. <br>  <br>  Masturbation is a way of releasing pent up sexual energy. Most people start masturbating at the time of puberty. With changes in an individual's hormonal profile during puberty, there is a surge of sexual energy which can be released with the help of masturbation. Masturbation is reported more in males than in females. More than a physiological difference in libido, this may be due to sociological taboos on females. Females also tend to discontinue or reduce masturbation when they form sexual relationships. <br>  <br>  Is masturbation harmful?<br>  <br>  This is the biggest myth surrounding masturbation. If indulged in moderation, masturbation, on the contrary, is a healthy practice that releases sexual energy. According to certain religious practices and beliefs, masturbation is harmful since it results in the loss of a man's "seeds" and makes him weak. Masturbation in women has largely been ignored in the religious texts. Other myths surrounding the act are that it reduces virility by making the semen less thick thereby reducing the chances of a man to bear children. This is totally untrue. Masturbation does not cause any loss of strength or virility in a person.<br>  <br>  The other myths surrounding masturbation are<br>  <br>  Only males masturbate – this is not true. Females masturbate as much as males do. However, they tend to report it less than males due to the social stigma attached to it. Also it has been observed that females tend to reduce or discontinue masturbation once they get into meaningful sexual relationships.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is unhealthy – masturbation per se does not cause any health hazards. It is not an unhealthy habit. However, it may be mentally unhealthy if it assumes obsessive proportions and the individual is unable to think of anything else. It may also have physical repercussions if the instrument used to masturbate is dirty or infected.<br>  <br>  Only adolescents masturbate – though the practice usually begins during adolescence, almost all adults practise it at some time or the other. <br>  <br>  Masturbation does not provide as much satisfaction as sexual intercourse – sometimes masturbation is more satisfying than the sex act. This is because, during masturbation, an individual is in control of his own movements and can maximize the pleasure according to his or her needs. During sexual intercourse, the degree of satisfaction may, to some extent, lie with the partner.<br>  <br>  People masturbate only if they have unfulfilling sexual relationships – people also masturbate for self satisfaction, even when they have fully satisfying sexual relationships. <br>  <br>  One can stop masturbating if one wants to. Just as one can live without indulging in sex, one can also stop masturbating with some will power. However, since the activity has nothing to be ashamed of and most people do it, there is no scientific reason to discontinue it. If one still wishes to discontinue, then the sexual energy may need to be channelised into alternative physical activities.|`|A5J4Exc1aa	Your masturbating won't affect anything.

You will be able to satisfy your partner, I promise. Just talk to her , and ask her what pleasures her. (If you're mature enough to do it, you're mature enough to talk about it!) Ejaculating  within a minute is normal, but there are many tricks to hold an erection longer- I'm not going to list them here; you can find them if you need them, all over the internet. Not having wet dreams is just as normal as having them. Masturbation has no effect whatsoever on hair growth. It has no effect on your fertility, since males cannot run out of sperm.  Masturbation is not harmful. Unless your religion dictates it as sinful, you can do it with a clear conscience. (By the way, it's not sinful, it's normal.

dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	Are you saying that the size of your head is disproportionate to your body? It sounds to me like the people who are making these comments to you have a disproportionately small brain and an unusually small amount of good up-bringing along with an especially large amount of rudeness. <br>  <br>   There isn't any way you can shrink your head. It's almost all bone, so you can't make it smaller. Sometimes people get fluid on their head and the head grows larger (hydrocephalus ) but I think you would know if you had that condition.<br>  <br>    I feel really sorry that you are stuck with these people who would make fun of you and now you are getting more and more sensitive about the way you look. If you are beginning to feel freaky then go to a doctor about it.  But I think the most important thing is just to feel good about yourself the way you are. Nobody is perfect.  Some people have crooked teeth or bad breath, some people have thin stringy hair, some people have belly buttons that poke out, or big ugly moles or warts somwhere on their body. Worst of all, some people don't even know how rude and stupid they are, and that's a lot worse than being physically imperfect.<br>  <br>  You are stuck in a phase where you are naturally sensitive; and stuck in a school where people are naturally rude.  You are going to have to remind yourself that you won't be in that school forever. Also when these people become more mature they won't think it's funny  to make fun of people.  I think you must have a friend or two (in addition to family or friends or acquaintances from somewhere else like church) who don't make fun of you. Just be strong and igore the ignoramuses who make fun of you.  I suppose if you told them it hurt your feelings they are the type who would just keep it up.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, I don't know of any way you can shrink your head. The more important thing is to build up your confidence.  No matter how anyone looks, it's their personality that's most important in relationships with other people.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're a lovely person.  Be strong!|`|WvBgXv5daa	You cant shrink your head. Just tell them you got a big brain. and the reason why you have a big head is because your body is going to grow into it when you get older.

LvELjQ2saa	i wouldn't reccomend not wearing a condom, because that definately helps, but i know what you mean.  the first time that seems to happen to almost every guy. its very embarassing.  once you get thru it once, it'll start to go smooth.  it's a natural things for guys to go flacid their first few times.|`|FDiVwCRCaa	you need a bigger condom. if its too tight the blood won't flow the right way and that can make it go away
ilMi2HSeaa	i would imagine it would be noticeable. try tampons or choose something else to wear.<br>  <br>  also leggings ARE NOT PANTS!|`|pexxZB8Daa	yes, its fine|`|PYIA2FCFaa	unless your planning on exposing your vag to someone then no.|`|lJskQMPUaa	Well, not if you're wearing a skirt OVER the leggings... which I hope you are.

I was wearing granny panties, and I tried on leggings to see if you could see the underwear line (because I too was on my period, but I use tampons with a pantiliner, not a pad), and you could see the lines. So I'm sure that you could see the pad as well, considering you wear pads with granny panties, like the rest of us. You can't very well stick a pad on a thong. So, I would say yes, they can see it.|`|J2UtYd5Naa	Don't do it!

MvMMIxjIaa	How did you find out about your irregular heart beat? have you self diagnosed?  If a Dr. has found a murmur or such, you need to go back for a check up and explain the other symptoms you are experiencing.

1oBilGHuaa	It is very important for you to tell your parents or the counselor at your school about this.  You probably know this is not really happening.

He is ready to come into your heart and love you, run your life the way that He knows will give you peace, cause that is all He is about love, love, peace and forgiveness.<br>  Go ahead, talk with Jesus.<br>  now

During this visit they tell you if you are a good candidate for the desired surgery and advise regarding how much it would cost if they do the surgery.<br>  <br>  best wishes..

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Generally, vitamins and minerals, while very good for you, do not make you gain or lose weight.  If you want to gain weight the best thing you can do is eat more at each meal and have a healthy snack with milk right before bed.  Some people are just genetically prone to be thin and there really isn't much you can do to change it especially if you are a teenager and your metabolism is still fast.  If you want to eat more, don't add junk food to your diet, which can mess up your blood sugar, etc.  Just eat more of what is healthy.<br>  <br>  good luck..

jQglJiMhaa	Thats a really good question.  <br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder used to be known as manic depressive disorder or manic depression. It's a serious mental illness, one that can lead to risky behavior, damaged relationships and careers, and even suicidal tendencies -- if it's not treated.<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme changes in mood (poles) -- from mania to depression. Between these mood swings, a person with bipolar disorder may experience normal moods.<br>  <br>  Along with medication, ongoing psychotherapy, or "talk" therapy, is an important part of treatment for bipolar disorder. During therapy, you can discuss feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that cause you problems. Talk therapy can help you understand and ultimately master any problems that hurt your ability to function well in life. It also helps you stay on your medication -- and helps you deal with effects of bipolar disorder on your social and work life. It can help you maintain a positive self-image.<br>  <br>  Types of psychotherapy used to treat bipolar disorder include:<br>  <br>  Behavioral therapy. This focuses on behaviors that decrease stress. <br>  Cognitive therapy. This type of approach involves learning to identify and modify the patterns of thinking that accompany mood shifts. <br>  Interpersonal therapy. This involves relationships and aims to reduce strains that the illness may place upon them. <br>  Social rhythm therapy. This helps you develop and maintain daily routines. <br>  <br>  "Manic" describes an increasingly restless, energetic, talkative, reckless, powerful, euphoric period. Lavish spending sprees or impulsive risky sex can occur. Then, at some point, this high-flying mood can spiral into something darker -- irritation, confusion, anger, feeling trapped.<br>  <br>  "Depression" describes the opposite mood -- sadness, crying, sense of worthlessness, loss of energy, loss of pleasure, sleep problems.<br>  <br>  But because the pattern of highs and lows varies for each person, bipolar disorder is a complex disease to diagnose. For some people, mania or depression can last for weeks or months, even for years. (My mother was mis-diagnosed for 25 years) For other people, bipolar disorder takes the form of frequent and dramatic mood shifts.<br>  <br>  "There's a whole spectrum of symptoms and mood changes that have been found in bipolar disorder," says Michael Aronson, MD, a clinical psychiatrist and consultant for WebMD. "It's not always dramatic mood swings. In fact, some people seem to get along just fine. The manic periods can be very, very productive. They think things are going great."<br>  <br>  The danger comes, he says, when the mania grows much worse. "The change can be very dramatic, with catastrophic results. People can get involved in reckless behavior, spend a lot of money, there may be sexual promiscuity, sexual risks."  It can seem as thought their concept of concequenses is completely gone, they dont "see" all of the possible out comes of a situation<br>  <br>  The depressed phases can be equally dangerous: A person may have frequent thoughts of suicide.<br>  <br>  If you or someone you know has thoughts of death or suicide, contact a healthcare professional, loved one, friend, or call 911 immediately.  <br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is equally difficult for families of those affected. The condition is the most difficult mental illness for families to accept, Aronson tells WebMD. "Families can more easily accept schizophrenia, to understand that it is an illness. But when a person is sometimes very productive, then becomes unreasonable or irrational, it wreaks more havoc on the family. It seems more like bad behavior, like they won't straighten up."<br>  <br>  If this rings true -- either for you or a loved one -- the first step in tackling the problem is to see a psychiatrist. Whether it's bipolar disorder or another mood-related problem, effective treatments are available. What's most important is that you recognize the problem, and start looking for help.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	It is a mood disorder.

Be sure to avoid junk foods as they'll add weight but as you already know in unhealthy ways. Additionally you should do some calisthenics to build muscle. Do lunges, jumping jacks, and other exercises (maybe do yoga or palates) because these build muscle and won't bulk you up (something most girls don't want) muscle will increase your weight, but as long as you don't do cardio it won't go against eating more.<br>  <br>  Lastly and most importantly you should probably talk to your Doctor or a nutritionist as the best way for your body.

Neosporin works well.|`|HKKu4CjEaa	You can puncture it with a safety pin after you burn off the pointed end with a match or cigarette lighter.  You burn off the end to sterilize it to prevent tetna or lockjaw.  Then after you puncture it, gently mash the pus out of it.  Okay, once you do that, then rinse it under warm water and wash it with soap.  Rinse again.  Dry it.  Now, put some ointment on it.  I think Camphophenique or Blistex is good.  Good Luck.

JMcmb9eRaa	I wouldn't take sleeping tablets unless you can't sleep at all.  It sounds like you just can't sleep at night when the rest of us sleep.  Is there any reason why you can't sleep during the day?  I get that you are a Mum but you haven't said what age your children are - can you sleep while they are at school or nursery?  Can your husband get them up and dressed before he goes to work and let you have another couple of hours?  <br>  <br>  Maybe you could "train" your brain to sleep at night.  Have you followed all the usual advice - exercise, warm drink, lavender etc?  If you normally go to bed at 3am can you try going to bed at 2:45am until you gradually start to fall asleep a bit earlier and then try 2:30; 2:00; 1:30... until you find you can go to bed at midnight and get up at 5 or 6am.<br>  <br>  If none of this works then you need to get a job that involves working night shifts!  Most people really struggle with having to stay awake all night because the body is convinced it should be asleep.
wDtA9hrhaa	Theres a type of sugar that contains Zero calories, and its called " Z sweet" its Vegan and all natural, and taste just like sugar, b/c its made from sugar. Its nothing like splenda i mix this stuff up in Sugar free syrups (which are zero calories as well) and put it on fruit, drinks or just eat it raw, and i found it curbs my cravings for sugar. They usually sell them in health food stores, you can use stevia too, but a little goes a long way, and its mainly used to sweeten drinks.
7fe0cbf361c24bbe8e34eb867acd5686aa	I've been a nurse for 15 years.  I started out working on a med surg floor, did that for a few years, then moved to CCU.  I really learned a lot in CCU and enjoyed it a lot, but found that whenever I got pulled to the ER to help out, I really loved it.  So, that's where I've been for the last 6 years.  It's never boring, it's fast paced, and you get to see things that other people can't even imagine and wouldn't believe if you told them.  It can be a little overwhelming for a brand new nurse, so I would suggest that you start out somewhere a little less crazy to just get used to being a nurse, first, then work your way up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|33c7604846ce88a1376d830caa5b089eaa	i dont appreciate you using my question to get ppl to answer yours soo im doing the same answer mine  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvfQI_MghxWQcgjzLiJLFBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309185609AAsKlE3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZnN7KTinaa	Yes.

I work with a lot of nurses so I hear the ups and downs- it can be a very rewarding and exciting career and there are still a lot of jobs available.  On one hand there is a lot of flexibility- full-time, part-time, weekends only, but if you work in a hospital you might be asked to stay over if your replacement doesn't come in- you can't just leave.  Also with a hospital there is shift work involved.  But if you don't end up wanting to work in the ER there are lots of other branches of nursing.  On the downside it can be very stressful (especially ER) and there is a certain amount of burnout.

5QicX6O4aa	1rst---don't try going on a diet, that's why people fail. Your new lifestyle should be your 'diet'---meaning, eating healthfully. Yes, you may want a greasy cheeseburger, french fries, choc cake, etc from time to time, but everything in moderation! That is the key. Don't eat after 7pm, unless it's cereal or carrots/celery sticks or even nuts, etc. <br>  <br>  However, you still must either exercise like simple walking uphills/downhills or workout---sorry, no getting around that. Key is to jumpstart your metabolism.<br>  <br>  Drink alot of water to flush your system.<br>  <br>  If you have a 'belly or pooch' ya gotta do crunches or sit-ups. Or even knee lifts if you can't do the former.<br>  <br>  So much, too much more to write, but the hard work is worth the effort! Trust me. Just get ready tho for people to 'hate you cause you look so good' when you see the results---& fluff their comments off, as you will realize, it's hard effort, you did it, & again, results are magnificent. Just please, do not starve yourself, never deprive your body of nutrients.<br>  <br>  I believe you can do it Lou. I know you can. Just takes time...takes time to get the weight off as it took time to put it on. BE PATIENT! & don't hop on the scale everyday, YES, I will tell you, once working out, on the scale you will notice it's higher, not to mention your pants around the waist may be tight or won't fit---that means you are doing all correctly---fat rises, then it will dissapate.

Meaning your doing great! But if you want to work out in other areas I would think about buying a home gym. They cost around about ￡400, but if you are like me and don't like going to the gym its worth it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|9hTPsTvFaa	yes thats enough exercise but i reccomend going for a thirty min brisk walk straight after running. your heart rate is still up so it helps you get fit, and the walk seems so easy after the jog. your arms and abs will get thinner and toned just from running alone but you could try wearing light weights while you run for your arms.|`|hqHWnarSaa	Running every day is good but you need to build muscles too.

Go to a doctor or something, where they can roughly examine you and make an estimate. <br>  <br>  We're not doctors here, and if there were a doctor here to answer your question, they'd still have a tough time determining your next growth spurt by just being given the information that you're 6'1". They have to check your parent's heights and etc.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Nobody can tell you when your next growth spurt will be - they sneak up on you when you're not looking.  Nobody can tell you how tall you will eventually be - that's in God's plan - NOT yours.  You still have at least 7 more years of puberty left with the possibility of more growth on the way.  Anything is possible.  No guarantee's.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  Everything will happen in due time - and NOT before.  The keyword here is PATIENCE!
AA10820062	It's okay if you puke or lose your mud every once in awhile. But you mentioned that you didn't eat all day, that isin't a good sign, you need to load up a little bit on carbs before sparring since you're going to be doing some pretty high intensity movements for several rounds. Not having enough energy and then receiving hard blows would make anyone throw up.

So be careful and try your hardest to dicipline yourself. If you buy the foods in the household. Don't buy anything you know is not going to help you loose the weight.  Drinking lots of water will also cleanse the body and help you burn calories faster, Green Tea is also a good calorie stimulator ----- MIND over MATTER!!! <br>  <br>  you can do it!|`|r3o10XbAaa	You should first drink a lot of water, so that your stomach is slightly fuller without consuming any calories. Also, avoid empty calories (foods that don't really fill you up but are high on calories) and just make smaller portions. You can have that pizza, but don't take more than one slice. You can have those chips, but don't eat the entire bag. You can have the icecream, just only have one scoop.

AA10076710	How long have you been on Remeron? I'd wait at least a month for it to kick in before you add on something else. Other antidepressants have serious and unnecessary side effects, but if you still with Remeron, normally you'll only have to worry about being drowsy at night and putting on a few extra pounds. I take Remeron alone, and it's done wonders for me. It was definitely a miracle pill. Just give it some time.<br>  <br>  Since it's not an SSRI, you can pretty much add anything to it except for an MAOI. SSRIs like Lexapro and Prozac may help, but I've heard very good things about Remeron with SNRIs (especially Effexor), tricyclics (like Elavil), and Wellbutrin. I'd stay away from the atypical antipsychotics unless you can't tolerate the other medications, have less than favorable results with them, or if your depression has psychotic features. They are much more serious drugs, with the potential for all sorts of crazy side effects.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.

The guideline now says 21 or whenever she has sex for the first time whichever comes first.  However, there are still some doctors that recommend that their 18 year old patients have a pap smear for the first time.

Meth is the culprit. That stuff does a lot of damage to your body. The reason why his face looks like that is because he's geekin on meth, and can't leave his face alone, or get away from the mirror. He's hallucinating, and see's things in his face that ain't there. I have heard people call them crank bugs, but they're hallucinations. His skin isn't falling apart, he's picking his face to pieces. Next time you see him, watch and see if he eats, goes to the bathroom, or pays extra attention to small things. If he hasn't eaten in a couple of days, or more; meth, if he hasn't gone to the bathroom for a long time; meth, and another way to tell if someone is geeked is watch their jaw. Meth makes you grind your teeth really bad, and your jaw makes like a rippling in the skin. Crack does it too, but the effects only last a few minutes. A meth high can last up to a month, one dose lasts about 8 hours, but if someone is making it, or has a really good connection, the high will last as long as the user pleases.|`|ehoAzCBkaa	Yes, definitely, all of those drugs will make your body fall apart. It usually starts with the face. My husband worked with someone who didn't have any cheeks or jaw left, because of drugs.

Do you wash your hands more than other people? Do you feel that you always have to do things in a certain order? <br>  <br>  I would talk to someone about how you're feeling, your parents, your friends, a counselor or a therapist.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: If you're not displaying any more obsessive or compulsive behaviors then you might just be set in your ways when it comes to your furniture. When it comes to the panicking about not falling asleep, is there any reason that you should be worrying? Do you have school/work in the morning? Are you afraid you're going to miss something? If you're having a hard time sleeping all-together that could be something to look into.

Ua3l7OXpaa	I was depressed when I was a teen, now I'm over it (I'm 26 now). I realized I was just feeling sorry for myself for really stupid, immature reasons. I think it's part of being a teen, I knew a lot of teens that went through the same thing. If you go to the doctor, he/she'll just give you meds to take that will convince you that you have a problem.<br>  Ride it out. Start exercising, join a yoga class, get a hobby, go out with your girlfriends and just remember - you grow up way too quickly to have a shitty time as a teen, enjoy it... seriously. I think teenage depression is a pretty normal thing. However, if it gets to the point where you're seriously considering suicide, it's time for medical help. I doubt you'll get to that point though. <br>  Good luck.|`|JMcmb9eRaa	I wouldn't pay much attention to what an online and very generic test says.  If you feel like you are depressed then go to your Dr or the school nurse and ask for a referral for counselling.  Lots of teenage girls have depression that is associated with their cycle; this can be helped by birth control which levels out the hormones.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	yes you should definitely see a doctor. also keep in mind how you feel instead of relying on online tests (but, keep in mind that it said you are depressed for a reason)<br>  it's normal for young adults to get depressed and it's also very common.<br>  i don't think it's a stage, and most of us are embarrassed to admit we have a problem. but if you don't have the money or insurance to go to the doctor, then speak to your parents or a school nurse. they will be able to help you out. and you will feel better just by knowing you are getting help.<br>  good luck and i hope you are alright.
AUOp1j5Saa	If you are on birth control, then your chances are very low to begin with and since you had a negative test, I would imagine you're just late.<br>  Try taking another test if you don't get your period in a few days, otherwise, just continue with your pills as usual.<br>  <br>  Taking hormonal BCPs while pregnant CAN cause birth defects; however, I do not believe you are pregnant.

Flow varies from person to person and sometimes from period to period. <br>  <br>  For the first few years, your periods might be irregular. On average they're likely to last from 3 to 7 days. It's possible you won't have any warning that you're about to start menstruating, so carry spare pads in your purse/backpack. A lot of people begin by using pads then experiment to find what products, or combination of products, work for them.

FU4TyghIaa	Hey Zawi<br>  <br>  that was a really nice email that you penned.  To remember the better times and not to hold a grudge and stuff.  That's really nice and takes a lot of strength of character to do.  Her initial response was nice too.  Then you say something else, like even just dragging it out or reminding her too much, but just one more thing to say and it gets ugly.  Why'd she do that?  Why'd you mention the guy at work?  That was a it too much to make the comparison i reckon.  You told her that?  Not nice to compare man.  I understand how it all seems such a strong good thing to say, but it's also very emotional could almost be seen as inflamatory way to approach it.  You told her about the guy from work?  That's how it reads.<br>  what she said, to play head games like that.  It's not nice at all.  <br>  <br>  But you say it's bipolar but when it's like this it's similar in many respects to borderline (personality disorder), and i can so understand and relate to that situation with bipolar.  <br>  It's an illness, it's a problem bipolar is like this for people, and you know it is.  So, if you want her to stop that behaviour or get it cured.  The medicine for this stuff is not straight forward by any means.  Trying to attach culpability to her not taking it.  That's not fair.  Those meds and stuff, often don't work and inevitably have side effects, but just taking them, it can be really really hard.<br>    Some stable patients have weight gain problems that are very hard to feel good about and it can shut down a person till they're almost incapable of a relationship in that they're so detatched..<br>  And do you play a part too?  you know the behaviour is bipolar but you still take it personally.  Hard not to, i know, but you do know, you would have better insight into it than she, that this behaviour doesn't need to be taken personally because it's aberration of her normal self..<br>  <br>  And then it's like you say, the anger thing, you just get so caught up in it.  And I feel it's not anger like you wanna hurt your partner.  It's anger like just frustration that look here, this is what happened.  It can seem so wild and such an injustice and you feel so hurt by things that just aren't true, the pain is anger, but not hostility or violence.  <br>  Anyway, like you say, there's much worse situations, and much more bitter.  <br>  She cant reply now.  You've said enough.  You know you both said you respected each other, and shared the sadness at the demise of your relationship.<br>  I know i've seen it in some internet sites for people partnered to people with these kinds of problems, and i was saddened to see so much about standing up to the illness (wasn't bipolar but similar situations) and i don't know, just invalidating the people with the illness, their partners.<br>  As much so they could be strong to stay separated because there was still so much love and then the conflict behaviour.<br>    You cant argue with an illness.  <br>  So, it would mean a lot if she were to tell you this, but you know her probably better than anyone else, and you understand what's going on.  At the end of the day, you should know that even acknowledging she said it, is like, i dunno.  It's a really unwell thing to say, well the way you tell it.  So, you know that, and that's the only reassurance you can get sometimes.

HcS8vzNCaa	Weightlifting exercises do not stunt growth--unless you were to lift so much weight that the bones become more dense and close the epiphysis (the growth area of a long bone). Only at that point would this possiblitiy arise.<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics amended their own, two-decade old statement about this issue  recently. "Strength training programs do not seem to adversely affect linear growth and do not seem to have any long-term detrimental effect on cardiovascular health."<br>  <br>  Lifting weights didn't stunt the growth of Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. All of them began lifting weights in their early teens.<br>  <br>  However, it is important for adolescents to not try to lift too much too early in their lives. As long as they can do an exercise at least ten times or so, the weight they are lifting is not excessive. They should be properly supervised by an adult too, so that they utilize proper form while lifting weights.<br>  <br>  The advantages of doing bicep curls outweigh the disadvantages if you simply use common sense.  Don't try to max out with one rep.  Just find a weight you're comfortable with, performing the curl a minimum of ten times, and you will be fine.|`|bfbb075a648d2adfef8a614187b2e269aa	No not at all!

sEuxr5Xcaa	Congratulations :)<br>  <br>  First things first, if you haven't told your mum yet, do so now. She's been through all this before and will be the best person to help you. If not your mum, I would tell a female relative or friend.<br>  <br>  There aren't really any 'rules', just some 'tips' to make it easier:<br>  <br>  You may experience some light cramping (which you may get every month, or you might not). Take some painkillers, have a warm bath and do some light exercise to ease the pain.<br>  <br>  For school, I suggest you put a couple of pads (or tampons) in a small makeup bag, along with a spare change of underwear (in case you get caught by surprise) and some pain killers (in case you get cramps). <br>  If you don't have a school uniform, don't wear anything white on your period, or light coloured, in case you have a leak. If you do notice a stain, tie a jumper or something around your waist and then go and change your pad (or tampon). Keep a spare pair of jeans (or whatever you wear at school) in your locker so you can change if you notice a stain or leak. Wearing a pad with wings may help to stop leaks, or wearing both a pad and a tampon. <br>  Take a body spray, or wear some perfume, to school, as sometimes pads can start to smell, so you can cover up the odour with a nice scent if you don't have time to change it straight away.<br>  <br>  If you get your period in the middle of class, just ask the teacher if you can go to the toilet. If you can't, tie a jumper around you, and then sort yourself out after class.<br>  <br>  I suggest for your first few periods you use pads. 'Always' are a good brand and they have lots of different types so you can find the one you like the best. If you would rather use tampons, 'tampax' is a good brand. Remember to relax when inserting one & follow the instructions that come with the tampons.<br>  You will need to change your pad (or tampon) around every 4 hours, depending on your flow. Never leave a tampon in for over 8 hours. For the night, I suggest using a slightly bigger pad (you can get special ones for the night) to avoid any leaks.<br>  <br>  Other than that, just make sure to have a shower/bath every day to keep clean and you should be fine :)<br>  <br>  For about the first year or so, your periods will probably be irregular, so don't worry if they are late or if you skip one all together.<br>  The average cycle is 28 days, but nobody is perfect, so yours could be longer.<br>  Your period will probably last between 3-7 days, but it could last even longer. The length of your period will probably change over time as your body sorts itself out.<br>  <br>  It might be a good idea to take a look at this website for more help and advice: www.beinggirl.com<br>  <br>  Take care :)|`|FWWegktKaa	Always carry pads/tampons around with you, even when you're not on because they are irregular to start off with so that is a good precaution! Also carry some painkillers just in case you get cramps and the school won't give them to you.<br>  Maybe carry a spare pair of knicker just in case you leak.<br>  Maybe talk to your friends about it or if you have any specific question post additional information and I'll try to answer them!<br>  <br>  I would recommend you wear pads to start off with because they are easier in school, people might find them dirty but I prefer them because they are easier and the idea of tampons freaks me out.<br>  <br>  They might be light to start off with or they could be heavy. It will take some time to discover what protection is best for you and you will have to try different ones to decide. Maybe ask your mum what she was like first of all and what she uses. You might find you are the same.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, that is all I could think of at the moment but if I think of anything else I'll add it!!|`|rLRid8NEaa	Ok. I just had my first period a month ago, so your not alone. ok here are some things you need to know:<br>  <br>  your period can last from 2-7 days<br>  the cycle should start again about 28 days after your previous period stopped. <br>  When you have your period for the first time in the next month, make a red circle on the date it started on your calendar, so you can count the days to see when your period will start again. <br>  <br>  so now you have to choose between sanitary pads and tampons:<br>  <br>  i think that tampons look really uncomfortable, although you have to wear them while swimming.<br>  <br>  i would recommend wearing a pad. Make sure you look at your pad every 3 to 4 hours to see if you need to change it. YOU MUST!<br>  <br>  I forgot to do it and blood soaked through my pants at school :(<br>  <br>  If you find that you have heavy periods, tell your mom that you need to go shopping for bigger or more absorbant pads. <br>  <br>  When disposing a pad, do not put it in the toilet. Wrap it up in a piece of toilet paper, and throw it in the trash can. In a public rest room, there is a metal box on the wall of the stall, and you place it in there.<br>  <br>  When you think your next period will arive soon, put on a panty liner. It just protects you so when it comes, your underwear won't get soaked. When you notice it happens, pull off the panty liner and put on a regular pad. <br>  <br>  Cramps are normal. Some can be severe, and some you can barely feel. <br>  <br>  MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR MOM ABOUT YOUR PERIOD!!! you have to although you may feel uncomfortable. write it down on a piece of paper if you have to. She can also help you through it, cuz she went through it too :)<br>  <br>  Here is some advice for your period:<br>  <a href="http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/menstruation/a/understandmenst_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/menstru...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|obIMwp99aa	take a shower every day and just keep clean... change your pad/tampon regularly and yeah.. have fun with that XD|`|SKaLskpAaa	NO..u have now became a young woman|`|shcsbtbYaa	Aww grats girl! Its a good thing - sign of you growing up! Nothing really to know just to keep changing your bad and don't excersize a lot and dont drink a lot of cold things- drink hot chocoalte and stuff to keep the blood flowing down. You need to get rid of the dirty blood inside u...good luck<3|`|X3QbcIUwaa	Welcome to womanhood honey.<br>  <br>  This is what my mom said to me and I am passing it on to you:<br>  <br>  At times you may hurt and feel a bit low, that is called PMT and it is normal, we all have had it.<br>  <br>  Be careful with the odour that blood can exude. If you wear sanitary towels (and I would recommend them to a virgin), make sure that you change them regularly). <br>  <br>  Wash your private area with very gentle soaps (Dove is the best) and frequently (2 times a aday morn+night).<br>  <br>  Start keeping a period calendar, so that you can tell when your next will come.<br>  <br>  A few days before your period is due, make sure that you carry with you an extra pair of knickers and some sanitary towels. You don't want to be caught without, it can be embarrasing. However if that happens, don't worry, we've all been there. Just ask the girls around for a towel.<br>  <br>  If you hurt the absolute best is a warm water bottle. Also try feminax, they help loads. Warm drinks also work.<br>  <br>  In the beginning your period will be unstable, that's normal. Also buy several types of pads to find out which you prefer.<br>  <br>  You may feel tired or sleepy. Again it's normal.<br>  <br>  I think that's all. Good luck lovie!

r3o10XbAaa	Well you CAN lose 10 pounds in two weeks, but thats only becuase once you start dieting (which i'm assuming you plan on doing) your liver will start to use the 7 pounds of sugar it stores. You should go on a diet, just be sneaky about it. You don't have to tell them you are going on a diet, but just try to eat healthier and less.  You should exercise for probably more than 30 minutes a day, if you want to lose a lot of weight, and look really good. Try running - it burns calories really fast. Plus your parents can't exactly get mad at you for just saying like "hey i'm gonna go on a run" or something. Or, if you don't like running, you could just go on a long walk around the block, if you have a dog, you could just say you were going to go walk the dog. Also, you should count the calories that you consume. Try not to eat more than about 1500 calories each day, and try to burn more than that (google a calorie counter, so you can calculate it online). good luck :D

DFWvjolMaa	I don't have a proffessional answer for you, but as far as I understand it all information between you and your doctor should remain confidential and should not have any affect on your studies.<br>  <br>  I understand why you're thinking this way, depression can also go hand in hand with anxiety and I have experienced thought processes similar myself. What you must remember (and I know you must know this, but it's hard to think clearly when your head feels clouded) is that you are not the first person to suffer this and nor will you be the last. Plenty of medical proffessionals have suffered depression, just the same as anyone else. It's a big step looking for and accepting help with the way you feel; this shouldn't damage your future in anyway, but make it stronger.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay strong.|`|Au0HK3O6aa	If you had a pain in your toe and you knew the doctor could fix it  would you hesitate in asking for help in case it affected your future as a nurse? <br>  <br>  Seek help from a doctor, if you are nervous about the college finding out about your illness go to a private doctor off campus. Move on to the future as a nurse with the knowledge that we all suffer from some problems but seeking help is the difference between getting beyond them or falling beneath them.  And remember when you are qualified, what your feelings are now, so that you can help others, professionally, when they are down too.|`|51Ib0kxVaa	What you tell the doctor is confidential and doesn't go on your nursing file. I fyou are depressed seek help.  Letting the depression escalate will just further delay and affect your studies as you become sicker.<br>  And incidentally lots and lots of nurses have depression....and no it hasn't gone against them for having it.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	I think that the information would be confidential.  If you are worried about that, go see a different doctor, or a psychologist.  Perhaps you have some issues that you need to talk over and a psychologist is better at that than a doctor!  Either way, you should seek help if you are depressed and good for you on recognising the value of doing that!  Best of luck.  I hope you feel better soon.|`|ToILKl6waa	No. If you have a malfunction that needs to be taken care of, it must be done. Your life at home and your work life are two completely different things. Before you find joy in working, you must learn to let go of grief and deal with the depression. Get to the core of the problem and seek help from a professional. Believe you, you'll be doing what's best for both you and your patients. <br>  <br>  Don't lose sight of your potential!
UOZP4Ma5aa	When the jaw is forward
9e2c3b2991b278870cf3169d10d82381aa	Firstly to babi_girl1669, wot sort of idiot are you ?? This question was placed by a 14 yr old girl, you trying to give her a serious eating disorder or wot?? Grow up.<br>  Now, to answer the question - exercise will tone up the muscles so no matter what size you are, if you are toned you will look amazing, also remember that when you go on your hols you will get a tan and a tan always makes you look slimmer. Oh, cut out ice cream and also chocolate, they are not good no matter wot size you are. Tell you mum you want to start eating a healthy diet so she can bear that in mind when making your meals etc. boys like funny and confident girls of all sizes rather than slim sour whiney ones!! Good Luck and remember the most important thing about a holiday is to have FUN.|`|HsrRNnIBaa	You're not fat at all and you have no need to lose any weight. You're weight is healthy. And healthy girls always look great in a bikini. You can look great in a bikini right now!|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  Since you've got a treadmill then it'll be easy, just go on it everyday, starting with 15 minutes, then adding 2 minutes everyday until you've reached an hour. If you don't have a solid hour a day then do little sections of 20 minutes, or even just 15 minutes!<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|Im1nCEC2aa	green tea cleans ur system and citrus help burn fat:)|`|Am1JsWmAaa	You can't loose fat in a specific area. Cut out all crap foods: hamburger, pizza, chocolates, fizzy drinks, everything. DO NOT EAT LESS. Don't do like most teenage girls because it's easy to develope a problem. Start doing cardio 3-5 times a week, find something you think is FUN, if it's not you're not gonna stick with it. I personally go swimming and jogging, which I enjoy. Jogging may seem like a real pain to do, but you can always try any sport that gets your heart pumping. <br>  <br>  You're probably not gonna look amazing in 2 months, but trust me you can see a big difference if you just cut out all the crap, eat regular sized meals and exercise a good bit. If you exercise aswell your body will also get leaner. Most women who look amazing in bikinis are not only slim, but quite toned aswell.

It's a serious mental illness, one that can lead to risky behavior, damaged relationships and careers, and even suicidal tendencies -- if it's not treated.<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme changes in mood (poles) -- from mania to depression. Between these mood swings, a person with bipolar disorder may experience normal moods.<br>  <br>  Along with medication, ongoing psychotherapy, or "talk" therapy, is an important part of treatment for bipolar disorder. During therapy, you can discuss feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that cause you problems. Talk therapy can help you understand and ultimately master any problems that hurt your ability to function well in life. It also helps you stay on your medication -- and helps you deal with effects of bipolar disorder on your social and work life. It can help you maintain a positive self-image.<br>  <br>  Types of psychotherapy used to treat bipolar disorder include:<br>  <br>  Behavioral therapy. This focuses on behaviors that decrease stress. <br>  Cognitive therapy. This type of approach involves learning to identify and modify the patterns of thinking that accompany mood shifts. <br>  Interpersonal therapy. This involves relationships and aims to reduce strains that the illness may place upon them. <br>  Social rhythm therapy. This helps you develop and maintain daily routines. <br>  <br>  "Manic" describes an increasingly restless, energetic, talkative, reckless, powerful, euphoric period. Lavish spending sprees or impulsive risky sex can occur. Then, at some point, this high-flying mood can spiral into something darker -- irritation, confusion, anger, feeling trapped.<br>  <br>  "Depression" describes the opposite mood -- sadness, crying, sense of worthlessness, loss of energy, loss of pleasure, sleep problems.<br>  <br>  But because the pattern of highs and lows varies for each person, bipolar disorder is a complex disease to diagnose. For some people, mania or depression can last for weeks or months, even for years. (My mother was mis-diagnosed for 25 years) For other people, bipolar disorder takes the form of frequent and dramatic mood shifts.<br>  <br>  "There's a whole spectrum of symptoms and mood changes that have been found in bipolar disorder," says Michael Aronson, MD, a clinical psychiatrist and consultant for WebMD. "It's not always dramatic mood swings. In fact, some people seem to get along just fine. The manic periods can be very, very productive. They think things are going great."<br>  <br>  The danger comes, he says, when the mania grows much worse. "The change can be very dramatic, with catastrophic results. People can get involved in reckless behavior, spend a lot of money, there may be sexual promiscuity, sexual risks." It can seem as thought their concept of concequenses is completely gone, they dont "see" all of the possible out comes of a situation<br>  <br>  The depressed phases can be equally dangerous: A person may have frequent thoughts of suicide.<br>  <br>  If you or someone you know has thoughts of death or suicide, contact a healthcare professional, loved one, friend, or call 911 immediately. <br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is equally difficult for families of those affected. The condition is the most difficult mental illness for families to accept, Aronson tells WebMD. "Families can more easily accept schizophrenia, to understand that it is an illness. But when a person is sometimes very productive, then becomes unreasonable or irrational, it wreaks more havoc on the family. It seems more like bad behavior, like they won't straighten up."<br>  <br>  If this rings true -- either for you or a loved one -- the first step in tackling the problem is to see a psychiatrist. Whether it's bipolar disorder or another mood-related problem, effective treatments are available. What's most important is that you recognize the problem, and start looking for help.|`|ToILKl6waa	Increased energy, activity, and restlessness<br>  Excessively “high,” overly good, euphoric mood<br>  Extreme irritability<br>  Racing thoughts and talking very fast, jumping from one idea to another<br>  Distractibility, can’t concentrate well<br>  Little sleep needed<br>  Unrealistic beliefs in one’s abilities and powers<br>  Poor judgment<br>  Spending sprees<br>  A lasting period of behavior that is different from usual<br>  Increased sexual drive<br>  Abuse of drugs, particularly cocaine, alcohol, and sleeping medications<br>  Provocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior<br>  Denial that anything is wrong<br>  <br>  Seek help from a profession if you think your daughter may have the symptons.

nKnc90jnaa	What is an ultrasound?<br>  <br>  Ultrasound produces sound waves that are beamed into the body causing return echoes that are recorded to "visualize" structures beneath the skin. The ability to measure different echoes reflected from a variety of tissues allows a shadow picture to be constructed. The technology is especially accurate at seeing the interface between solid and fluid filled spaces. These are actually the same principles that allow SONAR on boats to see the bottom of the ocean.<br>  <br>  <br>  What is ultrasonography?<br>  <br>  Ultrasonography is body imaging using ultrasound in medical diagnosis. A skilled ultrasound technician is able to see inside the body using ultrasonography to answer questions that may be asked by the medical practitioner caring for the patient. Usually, a radiologist will oversee the ultrasound test and report on the results, but other types of physicians may use ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. For example, obstetricians use ultrasound to assess the fetus during pregnancy. Surgeons and emergency physicians use ultrasound at the bedside to assess abdominal pain or other concerns.<br>  <br>  A transducer, or probe, is used to project and receive the sound waves and the return signals. A gel is wiped onto the patient's skin so that the sound waves are not distorted as they cross through the skin. Using their understanding of human anatomy and the machine, the technician can evaluate specific structures and try to answer the question asked by the patient's physician. This may take a fair amount of time and require the probe to be repositioned and pointed in different directions. As well, the technician may need to vary the amount of pressure used to push the probe into the skin. The goal will be to "paint" a shadow picture of the inner organ that the health care practitioner has asked to be visualized.<br>  <br>  You may or may not have to disrobe.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Ya know those things women get when their pregnant?

EpMi1OgLaa	no defiantly not, in fact it might even help lose weight. in order to increase weight a person must consume more calories then what they require(burn) in a day. these extra calories are then stored by the body as fat. with regards to whey protein, this has the lowest calorie count per serving then any other protein shake out there. the reason for this is because whey protein has about 1,6 - 3.5 grams of carbs per serving which is really low compared to other protein shakes out there. so if you want to gain weight(fat) then i would look at a protein shake with about 70 - 100 grams of carbs per serving.this will defiantly help you increase you weight|`|wwRbkCMraa	Yes.

However she wouldn't end up in a psych unit just for being raped, so she'll be out when the PTSD is sorted out, though she'll always be affected by the rape.|`|6t3bUFteaa	its actually not so bad. not at all. If she seriously wants to get thru it though u have to be obediant to the staff. the more u *****...the longer u stay......I learned that the hard way. Its like living in a Hospital with real beds. u can make it cozy if u want.....they usually have front rooms...kitchen...u meet others that u can relate to and sometimes become good friends. Its nothing like u see on t.v.. Im 32 now and had a road in my teens where I neede to go. Dont worry about her too much...Tell her to stand her ground with other patients if their jerks.<br>  Some are..Its kinda living with people that have similar feelings to share even if their problems are different...She'll have crafts everyday and make some pretty cool things. I have a few still...as a reminder...Hope all goes well:)|`|BextORpbaa	I don't know how's a mental institution but be loving with your friend because rape is something very difficult to get over.|`|OWiIUNp7aa	Long ago I was in one for several weeks.  We made crafts and had individual and group sessions.  It wasn't too bad.  I learned that I wasn't the only one dealing with the kinds of problems I had and also that there were lots of people living with even worse problems!|`|oiNkygNtaa	well i don't think the place i was in and the place they will take your friend is the same type of facility but i was in a psych unit (Dorothea Dix) for 3 weeks after attempting suicide, when i first got there i had to strip down to nothing and put on one of their uniforms then i had to wait several hours to get talked to then put in a room they will not let you have any phone calls or personal items for 24 hours and then your only allowed one phone call unless you get a doctors note (from the doctor on staff) the day started at 5:30 am every morning there (that's when we were made to get up) they have group activity's such as bored games and so on then we would have to go to classes for coping skills and things of that nature, we had a breakfast, dinner, lunch, snack, shower, laundry, outside schedule (if you don't do it then you can't do it at all...most of the time they didn't take us outside anyway there was a lot of paients that got really stir crazy from being caged up like a animal all the time) if you don't choose to shower they will throw you in there and bath you themseleves. they tried to shove pills down every ones throat there was so many patients there that where so over medicated that they couldn't even walk all they would do is either lye there crying or lye there completely still (they where like zombies) if you didn't eat or participate in activity's they would keep you there even longer, if you where bad they would throw you in a small room with no windows and nothing inside it (people would be in there over night sometimes and i could hear them screaming) as for the patients themselves they wasn't so bad (other then those that where on med's that would make them angry all the time...i had one that was angry at a nurse throw a chair at me) the only thing that helped me at all where the patients cause to the nurses, doctors, and therapist, all you where was a number and a guinea pig.|`|RMZ21EUuaa	I've never been placed in there<br>  <br>  but once my moms friend was in there when I was like 1 1/2, and she took me with her to visit and some crazy lady kidnapped me.

GtgNZveMaa	Try putting ice on the area for around five minutes.  Then apply a calming cream several times for the rest of the day.  (Preferably any lotion with Oatmeal in it.  Aveeno Calming lotion is a VERY good product.)  Then before bed, apply calmine lotion and then Aveeno again when you wake up.  If all else fails, using a slightly green tinted make-up stick (Or mix a bit of green eyeshadow into your regular moisturizer) on the area should counteract the redness and play it down quite a bit.  This works because red is opposite of green on the colorwheel, so they cancel each other out.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|nxW1zZ9naa	where powde and moose
95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Counting the calories is not a good idea. You already work out, you probably have a lot of muscle mass now, and this will be heavier than fat, but not nearly as bulky - muscle mass is good because it helps your body burn excess fat. <br>  <br>  Just stop eating junk food (there's a reason it's called 'junk;), cut down drastically on desserts (once a week, make it the treat it should be), white bread, butter, mayonnaise, cream, full-fat milk, and cheese. Eat five small meals a day, and eat healthy food: lean meat, fish, lots of veg, virgin olive oil, nuts (if you're not allergic to them, only have 25g every 3 days), and 250g of carbs a day - this allows 3 small helpings of potato (boiled, steamed, roasted, no butter but I do recommend mustard or mustard oil), pasta, couscous, bulghur wheat, or similar. You can have as much as you want of raw, steamed or stir-fried veg, provided there's not too much oil used, and as much as you want of herbs and spices. I suggest having lots of carrot and celery sticks handy for snacking on, it's also very good for the digestion. And drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Cut out those nasty sweet fizzy drinks. <br>  <br>  It's possible to eat very well and feel great and still lose weight.
B7jaxWCCaa	ok he needs to change his diet to boil food, also when exercising instead of running he might need to walk fast  that also helps and if he wants to sweat he might want to cover his upper body with a plastic bag like this one <a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Raidmax/Iceberg/images/bagside1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Raidm...</a> (the one covering the product).  Also he has to wear something in his knees (I dont know what′s the name in english) like the one in the picture <a href="http://img.alibaba.com/photo/212183699/knee_support.summ.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.alibaba.com/photo/212183699/k...</a>

35cyAIdlaa	No the chances of him catching a disease from a toilet seat are about a million to one. It's about as likely as getting pregnant from a toilet seat. You really shouldn't worry about it.
AA11388527	You must be very young yourself.  Call it a hunch, if you like.  Very doubtful he'd catch anything unless a woman with a blood-borne pathogen leaves blood on the toilet seat and your son has open sores on his penis.  An unlikely scenario, wouldn't you say?  Use a seat protector for crying out loud.<br>  <br>  And you seem to ask a lot of questions about blood. You touched a bloody doorknob, your son touched blood at hockey practice, you've asked this question before.  Stop being so paranoid before it rubs off on your son.|`|YuUNESK5aa	stop asking the same question|`|tqhr4V33aa	He cant catch it like that.  Why dont you use a seat protector when he goes??
4VNFsmanaa	Whenever I'm sick I drink lots and try eating some saltine crackers. They're soft on the stomach.|`|mdwyZpyHaa	She should concentrate on drinking small amounts of liquids frequently.  By small I mean a mouthful at a time every five or ten minutes or so.  That should allow her stomach to absorb the fluid and not accumulate it in amounts enough to vomit.  If she does vomit, she should not eat or drink anything for four hours and then try again.
AA10450066	Yes, as long as she lets any perspective employer aware of it. But after she gets her license she should take the time to get the treatment.If she gets sick then she might not be able to.She should already know what the treatment is if she's taking nursing and already know the answers to this.Why wouldn't anyone that can get a treatment for a disease that can destroy your liver and be a possible problem working in nursing when she can take the treatment and save her own life first.Then she's got the rest of her life disease free.
zzaScg0haa	My guess is it was the Tylenol 3, when you are on meds like that you should bring the bottle with you when you go to take the test, good luck!|`|2f0cmIF5aa	exerciser will get rid of the thc it was probably just a low level from drinking too much stuff in anticipation

Also, just try to do some really intense cardio, 3 times a week for 20 minutes..<br>  <br>  You should lose about 1-2 pds a week!
ErtMD5NZaa	Not necessarily. Contact lens and glasses prescriptions are usually different as one sits directly on your eye and the other is a short distance away. That being said, it's normally the reverse of what you're saying - the glasses prescription is usually higher as they are farther away from your eye. <br>  <br>  Did you get your contact lens prescription redone more recently than your glasses one? If that is the case, you should be able to get a copy of your updated glasses one as well.|`|A57Qjaszaa	I think the contact lens prescription is different to the glasses because of the fact that it is directly on your eye, rather than perched on your nose...|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Contact lenses and glasses have completely different prescriptions. For example, you can't take your glasses prescription in to get contacts, because they wouldn't know what level your eyes are for the contacts (as it is a glasses prescription and not a contact one). So, it SHOULD be different.<br>  <br>  But, if you are saying that your contacts are more up to date that your glasses, I don't think its that bad. My contacts are very current, but I still use my old glasses at times (with an old prescription).
RMmh0aimaa	If you are true friends you should be able to tell each other anything without pissing one another off.<br>  <br>  Just approach it casually "Man, ****, you're looking super boney lately - What's the deal? Surely it can't be good for your health!" and carry on from there.<br>  <br>  No need to make a fuss about it or it will sound too serious and he may back off.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	No. The problem is, just telling doesn't do anything. Manorexics and anorexics don't believe they are too thin; just the opposite. He sees himself as too weighty, chubby, etc. (IF that's his condition), so mentioning it only rubs salt into the wound.<br>  <br>  Best bet is encourage him to seek counseling. Or at least an appointment with a nutritionist.|`|qXpxILnRaa	Yes, please tell your friend before he passes out!|`|YJtJin8Zaa	hes probably sick cuz mostly girls are anorexic so yeah but u should still tell him that he has a problem:)<br>  well i hope that this helped|`|IBshj7fDaa	yeah that would be a good idea and if you dont feel comfortable telling him directly then maybe a teacher or a parent.|`|ZJDQ1jTkaa	Why not? It won't hurt anything|`|G4YfDQOiaa	well just because he doesn't finish his food doesn't mean he's anorexic. (though if he's going to the bathroom after every meal he may be bulimic, keep an eye out) people with anorexia typically don't eat anything and work out compulsively. are you guys close enough that he would tell you if he was sick? like.... cancer sick? I would just explore all the options before jumping into some kind of accusation. But by all means comment. something nonchalant like, "hey man, we should hit the gym sometime, you need to bulk up, summer's comin." or "Dude, you lost so much weight so fast. can i ask how?"|`|NS0Cjw2Raa	carefull how you go about it.. ask him if he has an eating dissorder, dont tell him hes anorexic..<br>  <br>  people with anorexia know they are suffering but are pretty much incapable of curing themselves on there own.<br>  <br>  just tell him your there for him if he needs to talk.. remember it isnt as easy as just eating... the stomach shrinks as it gets less food too.|`|ljIm7fI1aa	For his concern yes.
jQglJiMhaa	1.  Work on your self esteem.<br>  2.  Eat Healthy<br>  3.  Stay Active<br>  4.  Don't obsess over your weight<br>  5.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I can give you some suggestions on what to eat and what not to eat if that will help.  Losing weight slowly is best and you will be less likely to gain it back.  Also, you should incorporate regular exercise, at least 4 days a week into your diet.<br>  <br>  If you want to eat healthy, try low fat, high protein, low carb diet.  Eat meat like chicken, fish and turkey, never fried, either grilled or baked.  Eat low fat cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, etc., to help cut the fat out of your diet.  When it comes to carbohydrates, avoid potatoes, rice, pasta and anything made with white flour, like cake, bread, cookies, pies, candy or anything with suger.  Don't drink soda with sugar, try tea, coffee, diet soda instead.  Do eat salad, green leafy veggies like lettuce, spinace, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, etc., because these are low glycemic veggies.  Also try to get fiber in your diet through bran cereal, fruit with the peel, whole wheat bread, etc.<br>  <br>  This type of diet is filling and healthy and will produce benefits in the long run.<br>  <br>  hope this helps
lcuxD3qlaa	I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k? I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox

But i guess not everyone drink caffeine and get addicted to it either.|`|oORYI7Jvaa	it is a drug--you can't become"addicted" but you can become "dependent" on it, meaning you will have headaches for a couple days to a week after you stop using caffeine but definitely nothing serious<br>  <br>  also just like other drugs once you become addicted you develop a tolerance-meaning now two energy drinks or two cups of coffee you might be bouncing off the walls but if you use caffeine every day-it will have a very subtle effect|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	yeah it is a drug and can be addictive.. i dont think itll completely ruin your life though because you can get caffeine anywhere and it isn't that expensive|`|cy8VEbuCaa	yes because its a stimulator<br>  its not as bad as other addictions but you still go withdrawall with major bad headaches and stuff like that

PvIFahGjaa	Not bad. Maybe a little more. I'd say about 135. Thats what I benched when I was around that age.
4HQxLXQCaa	You can't really do much with either pushups or 35lb weights.  You gain muscle by lifting heavy weights.  35lbs will only be effective for so long.<br>  <br>  "I'm 16"<br>  "I can't afford the bench weights"<br>  No, you CAN afford weights.  You are just lazy and don't want to find a job.  Get a job at Burger King or JC Penny or even mowing lawns.  Then buy a gym membership, which is a hell of a lot cheaper in the short run.<br>  <br>  Push ups and a 35lb dumbbell won't get you far.  If you are serious about putting on muscle, you need to start a program that is focused around heavy compound lifts.  Below are two websites that are great resources and have fantastic beginner programs.  Choose to do one of these or don't.  But if you don't, don't start complaining when your pushups don't get you bigger.
dUj7rP2haa	Looks pretty good but I might have eaten something other then the cheese popcorn. You might want to check to see if your getting enough calcium.

dpgXzMenaa	An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure.  It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation.  You will *definitely* know when you have one.  There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm.  Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee).  The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  Then you'll know how long yours last, for sure.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|jZ7qw9fdaa	It's different for each woman.

Do that for a week or two. You should get over the sugar crave in about 3-4 days (atleast i did). Then try taking a walk for about 30-45 minutes. Or you can run 20-25 minutes a day. I prefer running.

lcuxD3qlaa	I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k? I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox

gULNGNkFaa	Please speak with the doctor who prescribed the pills and see about another appointment. You shouldn't be having this kind of pain. Anyone can have any kind of side effect, even if it's not common.  If you have intercourse, make sure to use lubrication so you don't tear the vaginal tissue. If you have a vaginal infection, it could cause burning during sex as well.|`|6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	Birth control sometimes causes you to produce less lubrication, making you drier and more uncomfortable. Get some lubricant from the store.|`|fQgY1lxkaa	I had a severe dryness problem when I was put on Yaz... that and I retained water like crazy.  You need to just go to your doctor and try out the other b/c pill options.  It took a while, but I finally found one that worked for my body and didn't cause massive amounts of side effects.  Usually your doctor can you give you samples so that you don't have to shell out $$$'s for something that may or may not work for you.  I can tell you that in the end the pill that worked best for me (I was having similar problems to yours) is Seasonique... and as a bonus I only get my period once every 3 months!|`|fMiLQnSJaa	i really think it was due to vaginal dryness ... it happens to me ALL the time unless I use A LOT of lube.  It's annoying.

jQglJiMhaa	I prefer it for after.<br>  <br>  Yoga makes the energy in your body "even" out, stretches you out, and brings your mind to a calm state.  There is no real evidence that stretching before workouts actually prevents any kind of exercise related injuries, so to do it before would be pointless.  It also makes you focus on your breathing which helps you lower your high workout heart-rate, to a lower, more relaxed pace.|`|A9WCbC8aaa	I do 20 minutes of yoga workout called YRG before my main workout.  It is a great warmup and stretch.  They also have a 60 minute workout and sometimes I just do that instead of running.|`|dhlSrrMwaa	I like doing it before and after. <br>  Before: It gets me into the mode of focusing on the workout.<br>  After: I feel it really stretches out my muscles that I just worked really hard.
3IimJWgXaa	try drinking as much water as possible before and during your cycle. so sadly? For girls that have this problem, our cycles take 2 week maintenance. haha. Im guessing youve tried Advil, or Tylenol, Motrin, Alieve etc. If not, try those. Also, Go to your local health food or herbal store and buy cramp bark. You will cry out of JOY the relief that the tea brings. vaporize it, if you have the right set up. Also try different positions. Laying on your side, your back stomach etc. Also try going in the shower and just letting the water hit your back. Also you can buy corn feed at a local pet store and make a little pillow case (the size that you desire, smaller the better, no bigger than a foot across.) And put the corn feed in their, then put it in the microwave. the heat could help. Also learning some yoga breathing exercises. And eating dark chocolate during your cycle is GREAT!. Dark chocolate. no other kind, even if you like milky like me haha. <br>  Also there is a pill that you can get out of Germany and Thai Land called Meftalspas and you take it ten days before your cycle and during, it simply amazing, and NO, you DO NOT get any sort of reaction or head high etc. Its very safe and VERY effective, go ahead and let your mother read over this letter ive written so you two can take the next steps to get this under control asap. If this information was helpful and your interested in some of the medications i know of for cycles (its to long to list) then id be happy to do so. Please e-mail me.<br>  <br>  xxpeacexx|`|lry4ncIBaa	take paracetamol with codeine this is stronger, try sleeping with a hot water bottle and do exercise ( i know you wont feel like it but it really helps me) just a short walk in fresh air u know...<br>  <br>  if it keeps n getting worse and not better then go see your gp again and ask to be put on the pill, this makes them less painful, more regular and not as heavy, but it also stops you getting pregnant (99%) <br>  <br>  good luck missy x x x|`|HUlAkj7gaa	When i have cramps like those<br>  My mom usually qives me alot of hot liquids;<br>  like soup;<br>  And when they qet worse; i just have one tylenol.

Also, a hot water bottle is really soothing. You can buy much stronger painkillers than paracetamol from supermarkets. Unfortunately you can't get rid of them, only wait until your body changes and hope that they get better as you get older.|`|1qmRNRT0aa	Tylenol helps me or Advil <br>  you can always try it, might help|`|2C8EgULuaa	Midol, Chocolate, Coffee & Exercise|`|UibsALccaa	Paracetamol doesn't work for me too.

I'm positive it's less than 50p and it comes in a pack of 16.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I don't know how many days are in your cycle, but since Feb. was a short month, you are only a couple of days late if on a 28 day cycle.  You know, there is a reason this guy is an "X", and you probably don't want to have a baby with him.  I think friends with benefits is okay, but you really need to at least use condoms because you don't know who he is with when he isn't visiting you.<br>  <br>  Wait a few days and if you don't start do another hpt.  This time use it first thing in the morning, as there are more hormones present in the first urine of the day.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|1taqxI72aa	If your doctor said your period should have been starting soon after the exam and it has not then you should get back to the Doctor and have another exam done. Having unprotected sex wasn't the best choice and you could be pregnant even though the test said other wise. I think you need to find out what is going on with your body. It could be stress that is causing you to be late.
PpKJIT0aaa	Try not to throw up. Foul stuff!<br>  <br>  Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. Fruit in the morning is best, because your body is in elimination mode between 4 am and noon. Raw is tops, because it contains the fibre you need to stay regular. <br>  <br>  Lots of water as well. Lay off the heavy carbs, fatty foods, candy, soda, etc. That will give your body a chance to heal.|`|SltEwVX7aa	gotta have fiber in your diet.  just about any fruit or vegetable is gonna have some good fiber content.  dairy products will plug you up.  and not much fiber in plain meat.|`|AGlpdpAKaa	Totem is right.  that's great advice! raw fruits and veggies are the best.  foods to avoid are white bread, white pasta, white rice, cake, cookies etc.  try not to eat too much sugar.  it's great to make a lifestyle change NOW, so you don't get hemorrhoids when you're older.  try to go to the bathroom at least once a day, and NEVER ever hold it.  tonnes of water will help.  also, if you have a day where you can't seem to go to the bathroom, try some really strong ginger tea.  ginger has a laxative effect. it won't give you the trots, it'll just kick your system into gear and help you have the urge to go. :) good luck!|`|jq0ZMkL5aa	well i useto have constipation now im pritty good erm eating oranges and apple really helps it makes it come out more slippery and fast but you gotta have it every day erm the one thing i had a problem was after i had done a massive load was to do the next one because i i thought its still early days i can let it go for a few more days but trust me you gotta do it like 4 days after the massive load exercise helps alot do situps they help|`|CtgBMZewaa	eat more fiber...theres really nothing you can do besides that...|`|OVtUnuYnaa	I'm 14 next week but II had to do use it too.

There is a lot of useful information on that site about eating disorders, their symptoms, treatments, help, etc.  <br>  <br>  There also is a helpline number on the site that I think you should call.  By calling that number you will be able to speak to a professional in the field and they will be able to answer any questions you may have.

7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	You seem to be eating relatively healthy, but make sure that you aren't under-eating. I would add another carb and protein to your diet. Maybe you could add a yogurt to your breakfast and eat some whole grain crackers or bread with your soup for dinner. You could eat some vegetables with your lunch or dinner, too. Steamed veggies or salad would be a good start.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't have to be outside to exercise. You could just dance around the house or something for 20-30 minutes a day. I hope that I have given you some helpful ideas. Happy dieting!
JxowGsKYaa	i feel this way too...its probs just anxiety or stress|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	A lot of people have guilt for whatever reason. It's not unnatural to think about it. It's not unnatural to be anxious, or down, sometimes. <br>  <br>  If this is happening constantly rather than just now and then, you may have social anxiety. This does not mean, under any circumstances, that you're crazy. It means you need to talk to a doctor about getting on some medication to control your symptoms.

jVGnfoa8aa	My mom got her period when she was fifteen and she didn't get boobs until she was eighteen, it depends on your body. I know when you gain weight and lose weight the first two places that gain it or lose it are your boobs and your face. Usually it's your boobs. Thats all boobs are is fat,. it also depends on how your family are. On my fathers side my two aunts have huge boobs! On my moms side they didn't have any until they were seventeen or eighteen and now they only have size c . I am a double D, but it took mine to grow for four years! I started my period when I was   ten and when I was fourteen I started getting boobs.( It takes time)  But you will get them! I've heard there's pills you can take, excercises to make them bigger! Or maybe if you eat certain foods so you can gain a little weight so you can finaly get boobs. Don't get stressed out, I tell ya sometimes I wished I didn't have boobs. They get sore when you have your period, they make your back hurt. And you have to wear a bra that's shitty! LOL good luck!|`|QsbB6vkoaa	you grow more after your period. i don't think you should worry because you will be able to tell when your body changes. per example i got my period when i was 14 but didn't get breasts till i was almost 16.<br>  also remember that women who grow breast to soon usually end up with bigger breasts than they wanted. even though all body's are beautiful i read in a poll that women and men think the perfect breast size is 34B, so don't worry you will get there.|`|5fuFXlyIaa	Don't worry, they'll come. :)

It's generally caused by a lack of potassium, so maybe take a banana (they're high in potassium) with you to practice and make sure you're also drinking plenty of water. A vitamin in the morning is also a good idea- ask your parent to talk to your doctor about which supplements would be best for you.|`|zanIH8FVaa	It sounds like a cramp to me.<br>  <br>  That happened once to my toe while I was swimming - that's basically the same sensation I felt, except my pain lasted a little longer than that.<br>  <br>  If the pain doesn't go away, I suggest you seeing a doctor.

AA10064810	I used to not eat because I would get busy and forget about it, not because of stress.  It would probably be a good idea for you to drink something like Ensure which is what my doctor recommended when my weight dropped to low levels.  The only kind I can tolerate (enjoy) is the Ensure Plus chocolate drink.  I also notice it was on hand at the strength room at a nursing home, rehabilitation center I visited.  <br>  <br>  As for splurging, you already know that 2 muffins and a couple of bites of dumplings aren't enough or the right kind of food for good health.  If you ate 3 decent meals, there is no reason why you can't snack like that unless you overdo it.|`|5ibhLxhxaa	wooww you splurged bigtime! 2 muffins and dumplings in a whole day! unacceptable. ru serious?

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Implantation bleeding happens about 3-4 days after fertilization of the egg.  If you did not have this bleeding for a month after the unprotected sex, it was probably not implantation bleeding.  Many women on bc pills will experience between period spotting.  If it continues and is bothersome, you should discuss trying a stronger brand with your doctor.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|AUOp1j5Saa	Well, that spotting could have been implantation bleeding, but if you are on ortho then your chances are very low even if you had unprotected sex.<br>  Take a pregnancy test if your period is late; however, since you are on birth control you probably just experienced some discharge as a side effect of the ortho.
N2syOdkGaa	What are energy drinks?<br>  Energy drinks are beverages like Red Bull, Venom, Adrenaline Rush, 180, ISO Sprint, and Whoopass, which contain large doses of caffeine and other legal stimulants like guarana and ginseng. Energy drinks may contain as much as 80 mg of caffeine, the equivalent of a cup of coffee. Compared to the 37 mg. of caffeine in a Mountain Dew, or the 23 mg. in a Coca-Cola Classic, that's a big punch. These drinks are marketed to people under 30, especially to college students, and are widely available both on and off campus.<br>  <br>  back to top<br>  <br>  Are there short-term dangers to drinking energy drinks?<br>  Individual responses to caffeine vary, and these drinks should be treated carefully because of how powerful they are. Energy drinks' stimulating properties can boost the heart rate and blood pressure (sometimes to the point of palpitations), dehydrate the body, and, like other stimulants, prevent sleep.<br>  <br>  Energy drinks should not be used while exercising as the combination of fluid loss from sweating and the diuretic quality of the caffeine can leave the user severely dehydrated.<br>  <br>  Know what you're drinking. Energy drinks are not necessarily bad for you, but they shouldn't be seen as "natural alternatives" either. Some of the claims they make like "improved performance and concentration" can be misleading. If you think of them as highly-caffeinated drinks, you'll have a more accurate picture of what they are and how they affect you. You wouldn't use Mountain Dew as a sports drink. And a drink like Red Bull and vodka is more like strong coffee and whisky than anything else.<br>  <br>  back to top<br>  <br>  What happens when energy drinks are combined with alcohol?<br>  Energy drinks are also used as mixers with alcohol. This combination carries a number of dangers:<br>  <br>      * Since energy drinks are stimulants and alcohol is a depressant, the combination of effects may be dangerous. The stimulant effects can mask how intoxicated you are and prevent you from realizing how much alcohol you have consumed. Fatigue is one of the ways the body normally tells someone that they've had enough to drink.<br>      * The stimulant effect can give the person the impression they aren't impaired. No matter how alert you feel, your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the same as it would be without the energy drink. Once the stimulant effect wears off, the depressant effects of the alcohol will remain and could cause vomiting in your sleep or respiratory depression.<br>      * Both energy drinks and alcohol are very dehydrating (the caffeine in energy drinks is a diuretic). Dehydration can hinder your body's ability to metabolize alcohol and will increase the toxicity, and therefore the hangover, the next day.|`|I4x74tZraa	Try to stay away from energy drinks period, as they are all sugar and caffeine.
sPT8ikgXaa	If you take more than what the directions say, your body will get rid of anything it doesn't need or anything you have too much of.  If you took 5 vitamins, your body probably only needed 1 or 2, so anything beyond that you will naturally get rid of, by urinating it out.  For someone that is healthy, its pretty difficult to overdose on vitamins, since your body will get rid of anything it doesn't need.  The reason it probably says to take 1, and not 5 like you are, is because the other 4 are just being wasted and will be flushed out of your body anyway.|`|MF9YknDYaa	1)you could die<br>  2)you can go blind|`|SJunThLBaa	it is possible to overdose and die. im am not joking. especially iron overdose.

6NZeItMAaa	Yes, but within a balanced diet. green tea or red tea, they have similar effets.<br>  <br>   The red tea is a green tea which is stored in barrels during at least fifty years until acquiring its characteristics. Thus it becomes red and has extraordinary properties. <br>  <br>  It is of easy assimilation and if it is prepared “strong” he points out the savour of coffee. If its savour seems to us strong or bitter, one can sweeten it with a sweetening substance, honey or molasses.

sPT8ikgXaa	Lifting weights has nothing to do with your growth or height.  There is nothing you can do to grow faster or taller or stop growing...unless you got lots of time and money and go have serious surgery to lengthen your bones.  Your doctor was right, your genes determine your height.|`|gERaZGZeaa	Your height is determined by lots of things, not just genetics.  Sure, genetics are a limiting factor, but you'll only reach your true potential if you eat right, exercise well, and sleep properly.<br>  <br>  Lifting weights won't do anything to stunt your growth.  If anything, it will promote growth, due to the increase in HGH your body will produce in response to the new stimulus (lifting weights.)

gULNGNkFaa	Actually, no. This is a common misunderstanding. If you don't burn off those calories from the fat free foods, your liver will convert them to fat anyhow. Bummer, huh? Take a peak at the comparison from fat food items on the shelves at the market, and chances are you'll see higher sugar levels (carbs) added to make up for the taste.|`|mYTVka5Taa	It means little fat will be consumed if you eat it. Fat free usually has very little amount of fat, but does sometimes actually have fat.<br>  <br>  There are still calories in what you're eating, fat is not the only place to get calories. If you eat a lot of calories and dont burn them off, even if it's not fat calories, you will gain weight.|`|AA12208063	Fat-free does not mean calorie-free.  In most fat-free products sugar is added to make up for the taste and that sugar raises insulin and encourages fat storage.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - it all comes down to calories.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I have been a B cup all of my life and am way, way older than you.  I have also lost several people in weight in my lifetime and since I am not that large, never seemed to lose much weight in my breasts.  Since you are just 14 you have several years for your breasts to finish growing as they can grow until you are about 20.  Good luck losing the weight.  I can offer the following helpful information about eating healthy if it can help you with your diet.<br>  <br>  If you want to eat healthy, try low fat, high protein, low carb diet.  Eat meat like chicken, fish and turkey, never fried, either grilled or baked.  Eat low fat cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, etc., to help cut the fat out of your diet.  When it comes to carbohydrates, avoid potatoes, rice, pasta and anything made with white flour, like cake, bread, cookies, pies, candy or anything with suger.  Don't drink soda with sugar, try tea, coffee, diet soda instead.  Do eat salad, green leafy veggies like lettuce, spinace, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, etc., because these are low glycemic veggies.  Also try to get fiber in your diet through bran cereal, fruit with the peel, whole wheat bread, etc.<br>  <br>  This type of diet is filling and healthy and will produce benefits in the long run.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|lP04jzv6aa	your boobs are mostly fat so there is no way to know until you lose the weight. probably not to much

I actually wrote to her to tell her how happy I was for her but also how depressed I was myself so please don't invite me because I am afraid...I'm too locked in my sad mood to come out of it for your wedding and I don't want to be like that on your special day.

dpgXzMenaa	Well, maybe you could get birth control and some advice/counselling there, but you can do that through your regular doctor.<br>  <br>  You should se  a gyno soon (within 3-4 months) *after* you begin having sex, though... the doctor can make sure you're properly healthy "down there" and will start a baseline chart so your genital/reproductive health will be easy to track for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  What's more important *before* is something your doctor won't have time to explain anyhow.<br>  <br>  For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Who told you that it was? You don't need to see the doctor before you have sex. If you want, you can go to the doctor to get birth control pills.. but other than that, no - you don't need to see a doctor.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	it's not so much to take tests or for you to have a pap smear. as it is about getting you ready emotionally.<br>  per example, they will talk to you about birth control and they will take tests to see which one is the right one for you. also they will suggest that your boyfriend takes tests, so you wont get infected or something.
143bm6cnaa	I know its really tough to give up a nicotine addiction.  You just have to remember why you quit.  There are no magic bullets - just your will power.|`|dog1vQNBaa	Ya its really hard.. What i can suggest is to use some good substitute like nicotine chewing gum. My friend have used them and found really useful, finally he quit smoking with help of those. He got a free sample of 100 pcs and tried it. You should also give it a try as the sample comes free.|`|N2syOdkGaa	Your not chemically addicted to it yet you still want it, because it helps calm you down and relieve your stress. my advice is don't smoke or find something else to do to relive the urge like running or chocolate.
dqVFLqCBaa	My close friend was at around the same weight that you are and she lost about the same that you are aiming for..<br>  Her boobs did shrink but because of the rest of her body did it looked good and she said she feels alot lighter and better : ) <br>  <br>  Good Luck : )|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I'm a 36C also and when I lost 10-15 lbs my bra size stayed the same.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be careful!|`|q92pt0jlaa	You might want to ask your parents on that topic.|`|krtYT43laa	It depends for each person but why do u care so much......
SuhnBZTgaa	If you are going from no working out, or very little,& eating junk to eating good healthy foods -  then yeah 10 lbs in a month is not outrageous. Not sure if it would be that way for multiple months though & don't be dissipointed of your rate of loss slows down a bit after the first few weeks 'cause it's normal. Yeah, you might lose weight in your chest first, it just depends.|`|PklJzGQRaa	you should do the classes so you have someone motivating you.  if you change your diet go everyday for at least an hour you could lose more than 10lbs a month for the first few months.  good luck!

69053024a914c4257a946955cd199b55aa	Look at something called a BMI, or a Body Mass Index, you can find it online. Then take your weight and height and find your index. The index will tell you what range is considered a healthy weight. I also wouldn’t worry too much if you’re only 13, unless you are overweight by more than 20 lb. But if people are telling you that you are skinny, then that’s probably not the case with you. But being too skinny is a problem. Just look up your BMI online and see.|`|hPt0hLyXaa	How much do you weigh and what is your height?
9KBqN0KAaa	No, i used to be abit like that.<br>  <br>  as i didn't have time to eat breakfast and lunch, especially with the distraction of school.<br>  <br>  Anyways if you had an eating disorder i doubt you'd be snacking.<br>  <br>  However that sort of diet type is unhealthy, as you'll have no motivation or energy during the day.<br>  <br>  But no way do you have an eating disorder :).|`|dNtJ9Ob9aa	well you don't have one.  Yet I'll be short with you.  Breakfast is soooooo important hun.  Breakfast should be one of your biggest meals of the day.  To help fuel your day of activities efficiently.  Breakfast means to "break the fast". <br>  <br>   All night your body was burning up calories believe it or not.  even though you might not feel hungry in them morning.   Your body urges for something to refuel itself.  Otherwise it will literally start to catabolize itself and eat away at muscle and fat to feed your vital body organs.  Yeah sounds weird, but it's true.  Look it up:D. If you don't provide your body with the right nutrients, it wil rather turn you to fat cause muscle is harder to maintain.  Fat uses less energy.<br>  <br>  Why do you think there are so many obese/overweight people.  They A)don't do enough physical activity B) they dont eat anything nutritionally, miss important meals like breakfast  c)probably sleep to much<br>  <br>  same can be applied for weak/skinny people. <br>  <br>  They have more fat then muscle and are just weak.  Always tired and have no appetite.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	no i don't think you have an eating disorder, i just think you get FULL very quickly|`|hPt0hLyXaa	You should try to eat breakfast because it is the most important meal of the day. You don't seem to eat much though and are probably only eating about 500 calories a day which is certainly not healthy. It is also not healthy to over-eat, but not eating much is dangerous as well. How tall are you may I ask? As mentioned by the person above, who I give credit to, an eating disorder is based on how you see yourself and what not. So you would have to ask yourself that.|`|wGkDlacqaa	I'm formerly anorexic myself, and I do understand how it can be annoying when your friends and family are always asking "Do you eat enough?  It really doesn't look like you do."<br>  An eating disorder is very mental based; do you feel fat, do you feel you have to eat only a little bit of food?  Even if you are happy with your body, and don't have that fear of eating too much, I would have to recommend to you that your current eating habits are far from healthy, and are very indicative of an eating disorder.<br>  Severely limiting your caloric intake as you've described only results in your brain eating away at muscle, while the little bit of calories you do consume are quickly stored away as fat. This is because energy stored in fat can not cross the blood-brain barrier, so the brain must get energy from food or, if not supplied, muscle. Until your muscle stores are depleted, the calories will go to fat to be saved because your body will be in survival mode.<br>  It won't hurt to eat a bit more; your hair will be shiny and healthier, plus your skin will have a lovely glow. Not to mention you'll have a ton more energy to get through the day, and be able to avoid some nagging.|`|dDTjpU3Baa	well my dear i think  you could do better.Have a little breakfast, fruits a toast a glass of milk. Later have a little lunch  some chicken a nice salad a little pasta, yummi ,d,ont you think? dinner  some pizza orrrrrrrrrrrrrrchckensoup, some cheese crakers, jello,if you like it.

Z7TzJWX4aa	it's possible but pretty unlikely.<br>  <br>  if you are using your fingers to rub your clitoris, it is very unlikely.  just wash your hands first and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  if you are penetrating yourself with an object, this presents a higher risk.  if there are bacteria on the object, you may massage that bacteria into your urinary tract.<br>  <br>  the best thing to do is make sure your genitals and hands are clean.  if neither of these parts has bacteria on it, then you probably won't get a bladder infection.|`|AFXdPMFhaa	it might

rbBwkdQOaa	well the best weight to lose weight is to eat right and exercise. I know everybody says this but its the truth and it is working for me right now. First you need to cut out all of the empty calories in your diet. Also eat more vegetables in your meals and eat fruit whenever you are craving sweets or chips or junk food.<br>  Also try to do some sort of cardio. If you like the outdoors, I would suggest to job outside or if you do not like to run, ellipticals are a great substitute. They burn about the same amount of calories but are low impact so you can go longer. <br>  Some other things that might be helpful to you would be to search the internet for foods that will help boost your metabolism. Whey protein, spinach, and some fruits are just some that I know of off-hand. Also, instead of eating 3 big meals throughout the day, try eating 6 times through the day with smaller amounts. It is a proven way to help lose weight. <br>  The hardest part to lose weight is getting into a habit and sticking with it. Get into a grove of things that you do and keep with it and you will start to lose weight in no time. One last thing, just because you don't see the results immediately, doesn't mean you should stop. It will take TIME before you see a major change.|`|XTmiI44laa	Quit eating, potato chips or other chips, try to not buy fast food<br>  .<br>  I read somewhere where a man lost a whole lot of pounds just by eating at a subway deli type store I think it might have been Abby's not sure tho|`|oVd2Zvptaa	Drink lots of water with food and chew your food slowly...this increases your metabolism<br>  Also exercise is a big part too...first try running elleptical if you can't really run on a treadmeal...run on elleptical for at least half an hour a day or 1 hour three times a week<br>  And finally cut down on junk food...stash it somewhere where you can't see it and don't drink soda...for some people it makes them fat but once they don't drink soda they become skinnier.|`|oZV7ukGqaa	Joining a free online community with support and motivation as well a free coach to hold you accountable has worked well for me. Also you can pick between many awesome programs that are specific for what you need that produce results. Good luck on whatever it is you decide to go with. Just make sure, you workout at least 5 days a week and eat a healthy balanced diet. You can do it!

nAp688tZaa	It sounds like a migraine.  These are common symptoms for people who have these.  Most migraines are one sided and very intense.  It is practically impossible to concentrate on anything but the pain you are experiencing!  If you have never had migraines before now, you should see your family doctor.  He may do an MRI to rule out any serious conditions like a tumor, but chances are good that it will come back normal.  At that point you can start trying some of the abortive migraine medications available.  There are tons, so if the first one does not help, just be patient and keep trying.  If you get 1 or more migraines per week, they are considered to be chronic and you need to start on a preventative medication.  Many anti-seizure drugs are used for migraine prevention, like Topamax, Keppra, or Neurontin. There are also medications like Amitriptyline, which is an old antidepressant (it is not used for treating depression any more!) that can be very effective.  I use this and it works very well.  I have been able to get my migraines down to 1-2 per month, unless I am sick, and they are not nearly as bad as they used to be. It is only taken one time per day, usually at bed time, since it can make you sleepy.  Most family doctors are pretty good at treating migraines so this should be the only doctor you need to see.  If yours is not able to help you, ask for a referral to a neurologist.  Good Luck|`|cxNLOPHNaa	Sounds like it may be a Migraine (there are several types of Migraines). You can use the site below to see if your symptoms match any of those listed.<br>  <br>  Also, if you haven't done so, lately... You better get your blood pressure checked.

tcJzBpmaaa	Sadly, you can not "make" your Dad do anything he does not feel ready to do for himself.  Your Dad's dependence on alcohol, paired with his need to blame your mother for his heart attack, tells me that he needs more than just a diet and exercise program.  Dad needs a wake up call.  I'm not sure of what you can do or say to get him to change.  It may not be in your power.  If you have expressed your love and concern, that may be all you can do.  The rest is up to him.  <br>    You and your mother might want to find a support group for family members of alcoholics to help you to deal with your own feelings about his abuse of himself.|`|70R9JYscaa	You can not make your Dad lose weight.  Sorry, I know that you want to help him.  Until he is ready and willing to help himself, nothing will really help.<br>  <br>  I am in recovery from alcohol dependence and have been for over 25 years.  The first month that I stopped drinking I lost 30 - 35 pounds.  Alcohol has a lot of sugar in it.  Alcohol also causes water weight bloating. <br>  <br>  I hope he becomes ready soon.  Does he know that you fear his not being around in your sisters and your future?  He may not realize the impact his lifestyle has on the entire family.

If you're nauseous, I suggest that you immediately go to the doctor or ER because that's the sign of it moving to your kidneys, which is life-threatening.<br>  <br>  Go to your doctor and get some antibiotics, drink some 100% juice cranberry juice and take it easy. Also, eat some yogurt so you don't get a yeast infection from the antibiotics wiping out the bacteria in your vag that combats the yeast, candida albicans.

Sharp sharp pain?  Makes you not want to pee but you have to and then you pee almost nothing?<br>  I went and all I had to have was a urine test, apparently I was really infected and it was lucky it was caught early... it can get really serious and can lead to hospitalization...<br>  The doctor gave me pills, and I felt better by the end of the day.<br>  My doctor also said they are usually caused by sex, all the bacteria, I'm sure you'll get the same speech, however I was told to make sure you pee as soon as you can after sex, and wipe well ;)<br>  My doctor also said that there is a certain percentage of women who just get them and it might come back, but since the meds I've been cured!<br>  Good Luck, and please don't be scared to go see a doc, it's worth it!!!<br>  Don't stress either, I know its hard, but it's really not a big deal!
LoO9LptJaa	You definitely should not go about determining how healthy you are by the number of items you eat and how many calories are in them! From what you listed, it doesn't sound like you ate that many calories, but the food you chose was very unhealthy. Try incorporating 3 meals a day with protein, vitamins, and other healthy components without keeping track of calories and just eating until you are full! Stay away from snacking on junk food and using a lot of toppings such as dressing and butter! Goodluck! ?|`|WRbbpRZzaa	No, that doesn't seem to be a lot of calories in one day. However, those aren't meals, they're more snack foods. You should eat meals to reduce risk of being hungry --- It's healthier, too.|`|EzWtyaVLaa	its nowhere near enough. its not just about how many calories you eat, its WHAT youre eating and youre eating lots of junk, so if youre trying to get healthy, i suggest you reevaluate your diet.<br>  <br>  we cant tell you if youre fat/overweight because you have not told us how old you are, how tall, or how much you weigh. if youre a teenager and your weight is not affecting your health then i wouldnt worry about it too much because youre still in puberty and your body needs all those nutrients to grow like youre supposed to. just eat healthy and exercise.|`|vFlUT9Zzaa	Most nutrition labels base the servings on 2,000 calories a day.<br>  <br>  Do you think you're eating healthy? That should be the question you ask yourself. I would suggest doing some research on *safe* nutrition, or talk to health teacher, or another adult about you questions.<br>  <br>  Along with eating a balanced diet, you should remember to exercise a little each day.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  (also, mypyramid.gov is really helpful.

I do not know the amount of calories, but I strongly recommend more fruits and veg to keep that healthy diet.<br>  And keep up the exercise, and if you feel you're eating too much unhealthy stuff, work out more and burn those extra calories !<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uc1ANvIDaa	If you're looking to lose weight, I'd recommend trying to take in about 1100 calories a day.  Don't limit yourself to things like salad and tofu, though.  If you don't eat things you like then you 'll get fed up with 'dieting.'  And just try to stay moving throughout the day.  When you're watching tv, do sit-up through the commercials.  Something like that.  my sister lost about 10 pounds just cutting down on what she ate and exercising a bit.

y1GInX9Daa	I have depression and ADD. There seems to be a very fine line between having those two together and BP. Very, very fine line. The kind of depression I have doesn't respond to regular anti-depressants (you get euphoric within a few hours of taking any the first time, but then there is eventually - weeks to months - no response. My Dr. finally figured out I have the kind of depression that comes along with BP so I started taking lamactl an anti-seizure (!)  med. Works better than anything else for what I've got. If it doesn't give you a life threatening rash when you first take it, it doesn't really have any side effects, except one they recently discovered that most people would rate as very positive. I have event caused depression and the big problem is that my ADD can create those events. It sucks.

A treadmill will do, and it will only be 15 min on it a day. Warm up at a semi-fast pace for 5 minutes. Then Go REALLY fast and sprint a minute, once its over, walk a minute, then sprint a minute, then walk a minute, then sprint and so on for 10 min. Then ur done, it confuses ur body and makes it work harder and burn fat. Also, do this wen u wake up, and do not eat anything, ur body burns carbs first, then fats, then proteins, wen u wake up ur body has no carbs to burn so it goes right to stored fat. So dont eat anything before u do this, unless u warm up with weight lifting or something<br>  <br>  Also, the MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LOSE WEIGHT, is your diet. Cut out soft drinks and fast foods, and deserts. U will see a big change in no time. Maybe 2-3 weeks.
zzaScg0haa	I like swimming as an effective cardio work out
jxHIMep8aa	If you are weight training regularly, the best thing is to eat at least 1 gram of protein, per day, for every pound of body weight you would like to be.  For example, if you want to weigh 165, then make sure you are getting 165 grams protein daily.  This is the age old standard of bodybuilding.|`|PoWNBIDUaa	Depends if u want to gain muscle and not fat, or bulk up. I use Golden Standard Whey Protein, it does thde trick for me. If u want to bulk up and be big, I suggest Powerweight 900|`|IvrcZVMjaa	If you are just starting I wouldn't waste your money on that sort of thing.  Sort your basic diet out so you are eating well.  Supplement with whey if you want and perhaps a multivitamin.<br>  <br>  Avoid the weight gainers - they often contain sugar you don't need.  Yes as you get stronger, so you will get bigger.  But there is  difference between training for bulk and training for strength, so you may not see as much bulk as you'd like.

I understand that, as my mother was a long distance runner before she had me. She ran because when she ran, she wasn't depressed. <br>  <br>  You're describing a textbook case of depression. Please go to a doctor, it will hurt your parents much more if this spirals out of control and you end up hurting yourself.<br>  <br>  Edit: To the fellow below who felt he needed to rate me down. Of course one must always have therapy in conjunction with medication, but therapy alone will not help you manage your symptoms if they are caused by a chemical imbalance. The only thing that will make them tolerable is balancing out the chemicals with medication. Therapy is ALWAYS a good idea, I find it frustrating that you felt the need to rate me down because I didn't mention that.|`|dab47577283a37a55ea29d50e0ddbb45aa	you are me but 2 years younger... best advice i can give, DO NOT WAIT IT OUT!!!! it gets bad, really bad. i suggest go to the mental health clinic on campus and see what they can do for you. most colleges have something in place to help out their students. i think sometimes the visits are free and if they are not, ask what they can do to make sure your parents wont find out through insurance bills.<br>  <br>  i didn't get help and i regret it, i should have graduated this semester, instead i withdrew and now i live at home doing NOTHING most days. don't do what i did, go and find a professional that will help you out and point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  the first person to answer pissed me off. medication is NEVER the only answer, meds WILL NOT WORK with out counseling.|`|ems2NJ46aa	please don't be embarassed talking to anyone about this, it's a serious problem, it's majorly affecting you and your happiness - if you had a friend or loved one in the same situation wouldn't you want them to speak out?  you should treat yourself the same way you would treat a friend or family member, you're just as important :)  <br>  <br>  going to your doctor is definitely a good idea, but remember that medication is not the be all and end all of recovering from depression and you don't have to take it if you don't want to.  i came through anxiety and depression without any medication, i know it's possible.  getting exercise in is a real help, but you may also want to try talking to someone like a therapist or counsellor.  taking naps in the daytime won't help, to feel good you need a regular and good sleeping pattern, so try your best not to take naps but instead work on getting into a good night time sleeping routine.  <br>  <br>  taking a good vitamin B complex can be good for depression, it soothes a stressed out nervous system and is vital for good mental health.  a healthy diet is also incredibly important, so if you drink or eat a lot of tea/coffee/sodas/alcohol/refined carbohydrates/junk food/white breads/white pasta/fast food it's a good idea to cut back and replace them with healthy wholesome foods to support your body and mind.  <br>  <br>  you're so young, you should really do something about this now rather than leaving it to get worse.  give yourself the helping hand you need :)

PAvYZJK2aa	because it feels good|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Oh, I don't think it is a sin. People masturbate because it is enjoyable and they don't hurt anyone by doing so. I think If you are that wife or girlfriend, you need to figure out why he is masturbating instead of having sex with you. My guess is you are talking about a baby. That cools off guys really quickly.|`|EJSdI25Naa	It is a dreadful sin for females to interfere with men's business. The bible condemns it. A woman must do as her husband tells her and stick to doing the jobs of the house, do the cooking, cleaning and raise the children and be obedient to her husband. She should know when to shut up, too. The bible does not state that husbands are bad, so therefore that can never be possible. A bad woman is to be cast out and an unclean one (i.. when she menstruates) most go away from the house so as not to pollute it. When his wife is no longer available, a man can masturbate if another woman is not provided.      Something the good wife must see to, as well. That is fair enough. It is a far more pleasurable experience for EVERY man, even if solo, than being with a female, anyway.<br>  <br>  Did you know that god was married to his own right hand, so how could this marvellous state of pleasure be evil unless said so by some wicked witches who want to bind men up with stupid ideas of evil. How do yu think that priest can exist if they swear to a life of being women free? That is the greatest sin to begin with. It only means that the wealth of religion is not lost to inheritance.<br>  <br>  Why is it that women themselves are more evil than men could ever be? That is just a natural occurrence for them and they, like you, are celebrating their evil by condemning men. In the bible, this unnatural activity is punishable by all the men throwing stones at the women until the are struck and killed. I don't believe in that, therefore I do not believe in the bible. Women only have to learn to know their place.<br>  <br>  Got it?|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	It makes one soft, just like crying makes one soft.<br>  If you experience a life of pain, masturbation is non-existent. <br>  You will find that men do not do this, as they are loyal to whom they love, mostly lil boys will masturbate, like monkeys.|`|jxHIMep8aa	You called masturbation a sin but talk about having sex with your girlfriend?

Somtimes we just feel the urge and let one go nothing agaisnt you i just its what it is pleasureing ourselfves whenever we can<br>  <br>  <br>  curtdude|`|jTKxLFuWaa	Masturbation in general is not a sin.<br>  <br>  Masturbating to sex, is a sin. Because when you're looking at a girl with "sexual fantasy/intention" and Jesus says that you have commited adultery in your heart when you do this. [In turn, viewing porn is a sin too]<br>  <br>  Also, the Bible says it's a sin to spill your "seeds" or sperm on the earth ground. So masturbating is acknowledged BUT looking at someone sexually etc etc is a sin, and people MASTURBATE WHEN THEY DO THIS. Therefore, masturbating not being a sin is inevitable. Even masturbating with sexual fantasies, it's a sin because, like I said, you've already commited adultery in your heart, and Jesus said that was a sin according to the Bible and is basically one of the most popular lines there.<br>  <br>  The only way masturbating can not be a sin, if you do it without fantasizing sexually, or your sperm "falls on the Earth" because its deemed unclean. And I guess that's why HIV came about, from egg cells "on the ground", but anyway you never know for sure. <br>  <br>  I think that's a pretty solid opinion. And I don't think someone would want to masturbate to a door knob, now that's just ridiculous.|`|JwIg9u7Haa	First of all... Masturbation is not a sin. Just because you draw conclusions from religion doesn't mean you're right.<br>  <br>  Second, by your standards a girlfriend shouldn't be fondling their man or sexing them up. That's something your religion also shuns. You'd still be waiting until after marriage. You should know that one too if you're ragging on masturbation.<br>  <br>  And that is why Masturbation isn't a "sin" and why guys do it. It's something they can control. There's nothing adulterous about it.|`|G4YfDQOiaa	I agree with josh m. <br>  <br>  also, i've asked my guy friends about it and a couple of them fessed up that there's the pressure to perform when they're with a girl and they don't always want to make a production out of it. so sometimes some time to themselves in the shower is a welcome relief.|`|c4QtLqqdaa	If I had a GF that was willing to have sex then I wouldn't masturbate because i would want to wait so it would be even better in bed.|`|13G7AxsRaa	why dont you ask yourself that question and get back to me.|`|gIuzRMLxaa	crtbryn is right

gB9p09rXaa	You are a healthy weight and do not need to diet according to your BMI.<br>  However, if you are serious about wanting to lose weight, resticting your calorie intake to 800kcals everyday will only work so far. because you are so tiny, you will need to shock your body into revving up your metabolism so that your weight loss will speed up. However, this will take a couple of months at least (it is harder to lose weight when you are skinny to start with).<br>  The way to shock your metabolism by diet alone is actually quite complicated - but basically is known as the calorie shift diet. <br>  for 3 days you would eat 800kcals, follwed by a day of 1000kcals. Then two more days at 800kcals, followed by a day of 1300kcals. It is important to eat 6 meals a day and at different times each day. Also following a high-low-high calorie ratio throughout the day. <br>  e.g.<br>  Mon<br>  weight watchers bread and tomato soup - 123kcals<br>  strawberries bowl - 22kcals<br>  banana large- 190kcals<br>  broccoli, cabbage, tomatos - 50kcals<br>  ready meal - 300kcals<br>  packet of crisps or chocolate bar - 115kcals<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you should eat every 3hours so you dont feel hungry|`|d8mDPfjgaa	No.  And plus why do you need to lose weight.  if you eat less, youll just be more tired and you wont be able to do anything, increasing your chance of gaining weight.  what you need to do is eat heathy and excercise.  you have to excerise if you want to lose anything.|`|uKeexsFiaa	Given your numbers, do you really think you need to lose weight? I think it would be an unhealthy choice
EMbaak9waa	Spooky.<br>  I don't know why that is happening for. Maybe its on your clothes from when you were around a smoker.|`|KII7vTbSaa	Holy cow I know what you mean!  Have you smoked, and then quit?  Because that's what happened with me.  I just completely quit (wasn't addicted), and then I smelled smoke for a long time, even after a shower, and washed my clothes many times.  Odd.  No idea why though.
p1RdTbP2aa	I do care I feel for her children, but i think that now she should just carry on treatment in private cos isn't there a certain point into how much you can publicise. And also I feel that so many people are hypocrites because like what 1/2 years ago they were all hating now it's I love Jade Goody so much it's so wrong. And it's good that her campaign has raised awareness more.<br>  I think her two boys sholud have some privacy now to at least try and get use to what has happen. Because they need to and she sholud try to spend more time with them.|`|lynmeenmaa	i have feelings about her children, i think its very sad. but i think its disgusting the way she has exploited this, she should have been spending private moments with her children up until her death not making a circus out of it. pathetic. and u can say "oh its gonna support her kids in the future..." Her kids are gonna be looked after money wise anyway, its the last few days they'll treasure and they'll wonder why wasnt mammy with us all the time instead of making a soap opera out of her death.<br>  its sad whats happening to her but it happens to millions of other people every day.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	People will lie to make them look sympathtic but they dont really care as soon as she is gone a few weeks later they will totaly forget about it|`|4VFEkqJiaa	I feel sorry for her children.<br>  <br>  I can't stand Jade Goody as she is ignorant, aggressive and unpleasant.<br>  <br>  However, it is tragic that she should die so young.  Unfortunately she chose to ignore the hospital letters telling her to seek treatment. When you have children you have to ensure that you are fit and unhealthy not just for your own sake but because your children need you to be there for them.<br>  <br>  Jade stupidly through away her hospital letters and now she is paying the price for her own ignorance.|`|fk8Lz10Aaa	yh i do feel bad for her<br>  i mean her children and everything<br>  shes like raising 5 million pounds forher kids isnt she?<br>  i hope she doesnt give it to her husband to look after...im a bit unsure of him|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	I care and anyone who has nursed and loved someone dying from cancer would never ask the question you just have.................|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Yes ,we can form a group of people to console her|`|luQ1N9rSaa	I feel bad for her children because they are losing their mum and they are so young. I know it is no kind of substitute but at least they will be well set up in life in terms of money. Providing that it is used sensibly and that the money is given to someone who will look after it properly and not just waste it all away.<br>  <br>  Like someone else said I'm not too sure about the father. I know that being in prison doesn't necessairly mean he is a bad father or that he couldn't be trusted with the money......but well......it would be a tragedy if anything were to happen to it. Her kids need that money.<br>  <br>  However I do not know the man, I'm sure he is a perfectly nice man who really cares about his family.<br>  <br>  I feel bad for him too really because he is losing his wife and when he comes out of prison he will have to bring those kids up by himself without their mother.<br>  <br>  So I feel sorry for her children and I do feel bad for her as well but no worse than I do for anybody else dying of cancer. <br>  <br>  The fact that she is a "celebrity" and in the news does not make any difference to me. It has no special effect on me.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	Good news doesn't make good news stories. It must be hell for her and her family and friends, but ultimately she is just one person out of many who are dying every day.<br>  <br>  We already know that, eg, lung cancer is more likely in smokers, so it seems possible to me that many cancers are influenced by lifestyle. How has Jade treated her body in her earlier years?<br>  <br>  I don't watch, read or listen to much news, preferring to just dip in occasionally and read Private Eye. So my explicit feelings of care, etc, are mostly reserved for those close to me. That said, I buy Fair Trade and organic produce, because I have a general care about people that are being exploited.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	I never particularly thought much of her actually.  I always thought she was a bit thick to be honest, but my heart is going out to her.  It must be very scary knowing that you have a limited time left on earth, especially leaving her little ones behind.  I think it's a very sad story.|`|lYkvps54aa	yeah i care for her, its sad. i am a father myself and i do understand her thinking, but whether i would go to those lengths, i don't know.<br>  <br>  i have noticed that she is been admitted to a hospice.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Regardless of how you feel about her personally, cancer sucks and no one should suffer it.|`|6bMBwaosaa	I care - much more than i thought I would and I don't think people will forget that quickly. Most people I know do care too|`|XBYiHaWIaa	I care|`|748vhOyeaa	Of course, why would you not care about anyone dying of cancer. She has two gorgeous boys and as a mother myself you can't knock her for doing everything she can to make sure they are secure after she has gone. Anyone with children would understand. If you are in a position to 'exploit' the media and make money from it,  for your children, you would do it!|`|Zq3fkJmEaa	it is really sad when anyone dies of cancer, especially when they have young children. The difference is with Jade, that because she is famous, we all know about it. I cannot understand why some people are so nasty about Jade dying. I was on Yahoo news forum and someone posted about Jade using the username JadeJustDie. Having cancer doesn't make you a saint, oh, no, but jade is as deserving of compassion as anyone else in her position. She has made mistakes and hurt people, but so have we all. The difference is that most of us don't have it all over the tabloids when we mess up. i wish her peace.|`|M6UbAi83aa	Hi,  I've never really been a big fan of Jade but I really do feel for her.  She's only 27 and she has everything to live for.    What she did before on BB wasn't very nice but she doesn't deserve this.  I just feel that if she hadn't been fobbed off with pain killers when she was admitted to hospital then there might have been some hope for her.|`|NgvxN3Cwaa	yes

Kq4usVUTaa	usually I'm not mean... but what is WRONG with you?  Allergy medication is not safe for children under age 6, and even then it's debatable.  If you would have waited to get a hold of the doctor he would have told you that.  Allergy meds make kids sleepy, so sleepy that sometimes they can't be aroused, or can't arouse themselves if they get themselves into a situation where they can't breathe (i.e. face down on a pillow). Secondly, you shouldn't combine ANY meds, especially with a child unless the doc has ok'd it.  Many cold meds have Tylenol or Motrin already in them.  Tylenol is very toxic to the liver, so you may have just overdosed your child.  If I were you, I would contact the poison control center and tell them what you gave your kid.  They can look up how much of what ingredients were in each medication and whether or not it was too much for your son.  Next time wait for the doc... I know you don't want to see your kid suffer with a cold, but geez, it's better than over-medicating them!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	too late to ask now -he sounds over medicated.  give him lotsa fluids, be sure he blows his nose well & washes his hands frequently.  follow up with the pediatrician.|`|lsvL1FV9aa	How about you should take your child to the Emergency Room it sounds as if the child has anEar, Nose and Throat infection
2Ccfsy9Maa	Any brain surgery can cause issues. There may be some left over swelling<I don't know enough of when it was to tell> You need to discuss it with his neurologist since he is the one who knows exactly what was done and any difficulties there might have been. He may just need to relax, it might be more of an emotional barrier than a physical one or a combination of both. Surely the school will understand and cut him some slack, talk to them. Good luck.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I had a complete hysterectomy with both ovaries when I was 46 and had been so completely miserable before the surgery, that it was a great relief to have it gone.  I had many similar problems as you, and the relief from pain, after the initial surgery recovery, that it was like a new lease on life.  They should be able to maybe remove any endometriosis in your bowels while they are in there.  For the first year I used the estrogen patch and then just stopped them.  For a year, I used nothing, but the hot flashes and mood swings were running my dh out of the house.  The next 7 years I used Premarin and never felt better in my life.  Incidentally, don't let anybody tell you that you will lose your sex drive or can't orgasm after having this done, because I am living proof that is not true.  In fact, not worrying about getting pregnant alone can be a load off your mind and give you a new sexual freedom.  <br>  <br>  Have our surgery, get on a good medicine for hot flashes, think positive, and live your life to the fullest.  Your best days may be ahead, mine were.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Life sure isnt fair!   Here is a website where you can read the answers to all your questions. It is awesome.

The best advice I can give you is always always get more than one oppinon before surgery.  The success of a surgery depends alot on you (your physical health and your attitude) but also a tremendous amount on the skill of your surgeion.  Remember you only have one body so seek the best surgeon in your surrounding area for you!!!  You shop cheap and for sales when you grocery shop but when you surgeon shop get the very best most up to date!
0xWudBTgaa	I think you're better off eating fewer carbs and more fruits and vegetables. That way, you can eat a lot more than that but you won't take in all those calories.

Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox|`|al4ptXmWaa	Well not eating alot will not allow you to lose much weight and the weight you do lose will be unhealthy weight.

The pyramid tracker site I sourced below allows you to track what you consume, as well as your activity, and estimate how much you would lose given those parameters (plus your age, height, and weight) if you were to continue the trend.<br>  <br>  Your muscle will be the first thing to go (especially since you are not supplying much protein, only that which is fortified), and your body's first reaction will be to store (aka turn into fat) the little bit of food you will get.<br>  <br>  On a biochemical side...energy used to power the brain can not come from fat stores, since it can not cross the blood-brain barrier.

Together that's about 300 calories. You should be getting at least 2000. Let me tell you, after 3 days, you won't be sticking to this "diet" anymore. I don't get it with you people. You claim your fat and you probably aren't. This is how women get to be anorexic. I just don't get it. After 2 days of this you'll get nautious and fatigued. You'd probably only lose about a pound, if that. It's not necessarily how much food you eat, but what you eat. Eating that could get you in the hospital from passing out. I just don't believe that.|`|BbsF1tf5aa	it depends on how much you exercise...<br>  but if you 20 minute work out every day, and eat a little bit more than what you said... in a month you would lose I'm estimating 20 pounds|`|f52e5967d0543cca0ae7f2e43b08fc91aa	you probably won't losemuch.<br>  those are all carbs.<br>  try a protein diet if you really want to lose.

AA10755943	You say you eat healthy so I'm guessing you avoid sodas and excess sugar.  Do you also exercise hard?  That helps the immune system.

S7Q3fRvoaa	To gain weight, you obviously need to take in more calories than you burn. There are several healthy foods you should add to your diet that add healthy fat and calories:<br>  <br>  - nuts, seeds, and peanut butter<br>  -avocado<br>  -lean meat (chicken, fish, beef etc)<br>  -bananas (highest calorie fruit)<br>  -dried fruits (raisins, cranberries, apricots, etc.)<br>  -whole milk<br>  -yogurts/cottage cheese with higher milkfats (2% or whole)<br>  -oils (especially olive oil)<br>  -ice cream<br>  -carbohydrates (rice, potatoes, breads, pastas)<br>  <br>  I suggest spreading your calories out into 5-6 smaller meals rather than 3 big ones. This will help you feel more energized! Make sure you are eating something every 2-3 hours.<br>  <br>  Also, here are a few tips to help you add more calories in at mealtimes:<br>  <br>  - drinking fruit juice or milk instead of water is an easy way to add calories to any diet<br>  <br>  -swap low fat milk for whole<br>  <br>  -When having salads, be sure to load it up! Add some cheese, hard-boiled egg, beans, sliced almonds, dressing, and of course plenty of veggies!<br>  <br>  -cook veggies in olive oil or margarine<br>  <br>  - Add a slice of toast/bread to every meal<br>  <br>  If you find it hard to eat more, it may be easier to drink your calories. They sell Boost and Ensure Plus drinks at most supermarkets. Each 8floz bottle has about 350 calories, and plenty of nutrients, plus they come in yummy flavors! If you drink 2-3 of these a day in addition to regular meals/snacks, you will gain healthy weight fairly quickly. You could also get Carnation Instant breakfast packets and add those to some milk and drink one with every meal or as quick snacks in between meals. You could even make your own healthy smoothie with these by adding some fresh fruit and yogurt and blending it all together.<br>  <br>  You could also begin weight training if you wish. Gaining muscle weight is better than gaining fat, plus it will help fill you out and give you the look you want. And all you really need is to devote less than an hour maybe three or four times a week. It might be difficult to fit it into your schedule at first, but it will eventually become a part of your routine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|h2TOQkUsaa	work out!<br>  like not to loose weight.<br>  but to gain muscle!<br>  its will make you look more  toned and curvy and by the time of prom you  most likely will look hott!<br>  just start lifting, go to a gym.<br>  im sure there is plenty around.<br>  or you can just go to the nearest ymca and start working out there.<br>  (:<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped.

Becoming dependent can DEFIANTLY kill you.|`|0xgVNOsaaa	Yea...uhmm randomly taking that pill..not such a good idea, i mean if she was prescribed and everything then that much may not really make her OD but she could become addicted at like any time....so yea unless yu r prescribed to it and know what yu r doing with it then leave it alone.  =]|`|76iuxeLWaa	You cant overdose on a dose this low, unless shes taking it in conjunction with say alcohol or other painkillers, sedatives, barbitrates, etc. However, oxycodone is a derivative of an opiate allowing to a person to potentially become very addicted if this medication is abused.

That you vowed to love each other in good and bad when you got married. That you a beautiful woman regardless of your current weight. And that you don't need to change UNLESS you want to.<br>  <br>  If you want to get healthier for yourself, not him, then drink more water, cut out the junk food or just have minimal amounts and get some exercise in, walk around the block after dinner, take the stairs at work, do some gardening, dance around while cleaning the house.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
f8mLpPXlaa	You don't mention how old she is. Could she be smoking? But it could be a reflux problem. When she lies down the gastric contents could migrate to her throat and  make her aspirate a little bit which would set off the coughing and gagging. She might have a problem with what's called the cardiac sphincter. No, it's not her heart. They just call it that. It's the muscle that prevents food ,once it enters the stomach , from coming back into the esophagus. I don't know why they called it that, maybe because it was near the heart. Whatever, she needs to be evaluated by her doctor and possibly by a gastroenterologist.<br>  God bless.|`|1r05fktRaa	get a new doctor . hope all ok|`|ktbRE826aa	take her to a specialist, different doctors, different opinions, thats not normal.. if u dont get anything out of that, go to the doctor and get her checked out|`|9735d5833f65114f4de1c4472750fa51aa	Nighttime cough can be a symptom of asthma in children.  If she is coughing so hard that she vomits, she really does need to go back.  If your pediatrician continues to tell you nothing is wrong, insist otherwise.  That is not normal.  Demand a consult with either an allergy and asthma specialist or a pediatric pulmonologist.  They should be able to get you on the right track.  Good luck.|`|3NjmcjfGaa	How old is your daughter?

Most of the ingredients found in your protein can be found naturally in foods. Your doctor is just trying to keep his job by ensuring your safety. I'd listen to him though and heed his advice.

xj0lVyPraa	Protein will help you build muscle.  Creatine does not actually make your muscles stronger.  It just retains water weight in them and makes them stronger as long as you are taking it.  So you quickly loose the effects as soon as you stop taking it.

Since I have been using their products I haven't had a problem with my eczema flaring up.  My suggestion is to try changes in these areas if you haven't already and see if this helps before you inject yourself with medication.

4b9ac58e789dd7441f61926ee404111faa	Yes, it's medical-ese for a type of mild bipolar disorder. It means that you have periods where you are depressed and unhappy (the thymic word refers to mood) along with periods when you are hypomanic (an elevated or irritable mood). It's not as bad as bipolar where you swing between mania (abnormal high feeling with psychotic thoughts and hyperactivity) and severe depression. <br>  Many people are extremely creative with this disorder, as you don't have the abnormal thoughts that some people with bipolar disorder experience during a manic episode. Instead it can results in bursts of creativity and thought experiments.<br>  It can be well controlled with medication and counseling.<br>  It's important to structure your life more simply, to avoid stress, exercise and to maintain clear goals.<br>  Good luck.

AA11103615	Hi Rhea, it does take some weeks for anti depressants to 'kick in' and sadly it's one of the reasons people give up on them, they feel after a week or so when they don't seem to be any better that it just isn't working.  Sadly in some cases the first anti depressant you try might not be the best one for you and so it goes on.  I tried nine or ten different types until I hit upon one that really made a difference, and even then, some days I feel the depressed feelings are 'unmanageable' which is why counselling and 'talking therapies' should be used together.  Anti depressants (once they work) are a good way of allowing you to build up your health enough so that you can at least manage those awful feelings, and allow you to benefit from the counselling.<br>  Sometimes the side effects of the anti depressants can be to 'numb' everything, it's another reason why people tend to want to wean off them, the feeling of feeling 'nothing' appears worse than feeling the horrors of the depression and I've been there a few times, wondering how to deal with the conundrum.<br>  It's a shame your doctor gave you the impression he didn't want to help, I have been fortunate and have a very supportive doctor, but I know there are still many in the health profession who seem to not fully understand how a depressed person feels, what I did the first time I summoned uo the courage to see my doctor about the way I felt, was to write it down, because I knew talking about it might be difficult and that I might forget things or not  make myself clear enough, and it was helpful for my doctor to, to use it as a reference point.<br>  Is there another GP you could go to?  If it's a group practice you should be able to ask for someone different if you felt up to doing it again of course?<br>    if not are there any phone helplines, would you consider talking to the Samaritans?   They're non judgemental,  they'll listen to you for as long as you need and while they can't give you medical treatment sometimes just knowing someone is listening to you is a great help in sharing these difficult  feelings (or lack of)<br>  As for  feeling  you have a great family and friends etc and so you can't understand why this has happened to you, try to let go of that.  Depression can strike anyone, it doesn't matter if you have the happiest life in the world, sometimes it can be as a result of external issues going on in your life, sometimes it just 'happens' a chemical imbalance that has no explanation.<br>    Maybe try to write down the feelings, the frustrations that you say you can't get out, anything that helps you release this pent up frustration is a good thing, internalising it only nurtures the depression and so it becomes an endless cycle of guilt - hurt- frustration - depression.<br>  I'm so sorry you feel  this way, I've been where you are and I know how debilitating it can be and how lonely it can make you feel.  And I wish you well in finding a sympathetic doctor or counsellor and that you will come through the other side of this, it just might take a little bit longer than you hoped|`|fpv8IV3Haa	try eating jalapenos|`|BlA60kDVaa	You need some warm hugs!<br>  <br>  Depression isn't some new phenomenon.  It is simply a pretty normal emotion many go through.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with feeling a little emotional or numb from time-to-time.  Try change your life-style if you can.  A change in diet or activities can often be very valuable when feeling down.<br>  <br>  Cheer up babe, and be happy!<br>  <br>  If I could be there, as a good friend for you then I would.<br>  <br>  Being a human being is hard wok at times.

Everything inside me built up and up, so it spirreled for about two months until i smashed a mirror to peices and then i cried for the first time in those two months. i know how you feel, you just want to CRY but you cant, its like impossible. But the way i dealt with it was not to go off the rails or anything, i did lock it up but then i let it all out in my writing and drawings and music and singing and screaming and that is how i did it, i coped, and now its a year later (i hate thnking about last year, those days were dark) and im so much better now :) <br>  <br>  i have new friends and a life worth living and even though i still feel a bit numb sometimes (i think its honestly a teenage thing, i was crying buckets two months ago for the sillest of things like movies and sad endings to books, i was happy but very emotional) but its like now ive cried all my tears and sometimes i just want to cry and i dont know how. but just try to go for a walk, do something different, because thats what i did, i did my writing and drawing and i am not scared to go out the hosue anymore and now i just wander up the road and when i get back i feel so proud of myself for trying something new :) so many times i have looked at a bottle of vodca and thought omg i want to drink that and fall asleep, or i have seen a bridge and thought i want to jump off that so i can FEEL again but i didndt do any of those things, i held on and it made me strong :) and so what if you dont cry? you will when you least expect it, one day you will see a dog on a advert for the rspca or hear a sad song and you will cry it out, and then you will feel a hell of a lot better :) hope i helped, sorry if i rambled :) xx|`|RmSzWzbsaa	it will take a few weeks for ur medication to start workin but once it does ul start to feel better|`|T5uOsAgraa	u sure ur not on any other drugs cause u sound like vicky pollard on speed !!!|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Hi Rhae, well two things actually spring to mind, if you have no feelings, either you are going through some form of bereavement. Shock, a sense of loss, grief, which is actually a real sickness. <br>  <br>  Another thing, which I had not considered till I read this plea for help, might you go through the motion of being in the wrong body? It is possible that maybe you are not the person you think you are and at a deep subconscious level you react in a way, but feel this is out of character with who you really are. It is just a thought.<br>  <br>  The problem with your situation, many questions need to be asked and certain exercises need to be done, in order to assess where your mind is at. This is very personal and intimate, which I would consider inappropriate on a Forum such as this. You have a counsellor now and this person, depending on their experience, may be able to steer you towards the right direction. This is your life and therefore important for you to find these answers in your own mind. <br>  <br>  Psychotic drugs to me are never the answer, unless you suffer aggressive tendencies or are a danger to yourself. Psychotic drugs merely suppress the real feelings you so desperately seek to discover and which I gather is also making you feel physically sick. There are better alternatives, but it is not my place to tell you what to do. All anyone can do, really, is listen and hope that with suggestions you may recognise or identify with what you need to accomplish. <br>  <br>  You are in good hands, but always keep an open mind. Focus on the boundaries that you confront and stop you from moving forward, because they are a major clue also. Be kind to yourself and do not be too harsh with your current life condition. Maybe what you need is to be left alone and discover your own journey and path. Perhaps this big family who are loving and kind, are unable to give you the opportunity to face your own true entity or reality.|`|ILUfvatpaa	What makes you happy? Focus on that.
mXNylokeaa	Well, I'd say though it may seem like crazy way to ingest the drug, it may have some fun sides to it. a bit anesthetized  parts can be fun. but also better than shooting the stuff in your arm too. back to the anesthetic qualities. A little bit on the head of the penis can slow the sometimes premature ejaculation. which can make for a bit more fun for both. I'd stick to a glass or two of wine.   :-)|`|0sw9nrcpaa	i think thats isolated are u sure your not getting it mixed up with drug trafficking cos they always put it in their anus or vagina or whatever. u havent seen anything disturbing until uve seen bme pain olympics!
naI5hGjHaa	yes it does.  you have less nerve endings.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Of course it does.<br>  <br>  The mutilation of circumcision always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity, as well as other adverse effects and complications that the doctors don't disclose and in fact suppress.<br>  <br>  Circumcision amputates the foreskin, with its thousands of nerve endings.   The foreskin is about 15 square inches of skin on average, about the size of a 3" X 5" index card.<br>  <br>  Amputating all of those nerve endings and severing other nerves, and damaging remaining nerve endings on the penis is part of it.       The blood vessels, veins and capillaries severed permanently disrupt the normal penile blood flow.<br>  <br>  Scar tissue is formed.        The exposed glans and surrounding tissues, meant by nature to be covered, kept moist and sensitive, dry out and keratinize.<br>  <br>  The keratinization continues throughout the victim's lifetime, constantly and inexorably diminishing sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Circumcision destroys an average of 50-75% of sexual sensitivity, and more in many cases, like mine.<br>  <br>  Obviously, anyone with intelligence can see that a whole penis, natural and normal with a foreskin, feels and functions better than a partial one, made scarred and mutilated from circumcision.<br>  <br>  I restored my foreskin, and can attest that it's so incredibly much better with a foreskin, the way that nature intended.        The inner foreskin is especially sensitive, and the motion of the skin during sexual activity is wonderful.       The inner foreskin, when retracted, adds a new dimension to sexual feeling on the shaft that circumcised men haven't got a clue about.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I can't tell the difference, myself.

I've been with 2 guys that were circumcised and 2 guys that were not and sex with the guys that were not circumcised always felt better.

Plus it also makes the penis a little thicker with more skin on it and offers a little more variety to play with.|`|rFUqIakAaa	It's more pleasurable for the male when he is not circumcised because there are a lot more nerve endings on the foreskin that get cut of during circumcision and because the head of a circumcised penis is always exposed it looses sensitivity. An uncircumcised male also makes sex more pleasurable to females evidently because when the guy still has a foreskin it aids in reducing friction in the vagina. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/070615_penis_sensitivity.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescience.com/health/070615...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/60750.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/8812.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdZefUABUS0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdZefUABU...</a>|`|AA11966501	Logic tells me yes but I have not had it done.

If you are born an man and are circumcised, you will still be a man.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, Circumcision has pro's and con's.  I was circumcised as are most men in the U.S. are nowadays.  It has shown that the foreskin contains nerve endings so a circumcision would slightly lessen pleasure.  Mainly, it makes hygiene a lot easier.  Being circumcised lowers your chances of getting many infections and sexually transmitted diseases drastically, and makes conditions like paraphimosis impossible to occur.|`|SHXvUSd4aa	on the contrary, a circumcised male becomes a better sex partner  - can last longer. I am a woman who had the experience of years of great sex with a husband, who then got circumcised at age 40 (long story) and sex got even better for both of us. After that I had several partners - both with and without foreskin- and they all said it made no difference, ot got better.|`|e8WVidSsaa	Yes, it does, and negatively.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is extremely sensitive and pleasureful and during sex moves back and forth, stimulating the glands, so a guy without foreskin doesn't get as much pleasure as a guy who has it.|`|JwIg9u7Haa	It's better for both people if you're uncircumcised.<br>  The skin adds for more rubbing pleasure, and the man has more nerves to get set off.<br>  Thus why circumcision is stupid.

mjC5XldXaa	Pharmacy is right.  See a dentist asap.  This situation can only worsen.  I sounds like the infection is from an upper tooth.  Worse case scenario is the infection could spread into the brain and become a life threatening situation.  Beg or borrow the money as see someone at once, even if it has to be the ER.  The antibiotics and strong pain pills you need, can only come from a doctor or dentist by prescription.|`|AeeX1Wnkaa	Sounds to me like a tooth abscess, which is an infection. It definitely needs to be treated, because it can spread to other areas of your body and cause serious problems. You will need a round of antibiotics to clear the infection, then something will need to be done about the tooth (as in a root canal or just extracting the tooth). My fiance is going through this right now...he had to pay $75 for the initial visit, then pay for the antibiotics (don't cost much), and tomorrow he's going to have the tooth extracted ($85). So a little costly, but very necessary to get this done.|`|R3Jtm4Wtaa	Likely you have an abscess or other infection. You don't want to wait too long with seeing a dentist.

First thing u might want to do is get u some ora-jel, or anything with 20% benzocaine in it. This will not fix the prob, but will numb the pain for about 10-30 min at a time. Now that u can breath, U need to call around to every dentist and see what is the earliest they can get u in.. i had alot of dentist tell me that they can get me in like 3 weeks, which is BS. A infection is very important and u can die from it. So look for a dentist who excepts walk-ins. Other things that help the pain r Garlic, Mouth wash, with alcohol, Anbesol, WARM SALT WATER ( a very important thing to do alot of times a day, it helps with the fluid in the abcess, make sure u gargle it. Keep a bunch of cotton swobs around u so that u can add the anbesol, ora-jel, garlic. Cigerattes seem to make it hurt, so calm down on the smoking. They also make this gum like substance that is made out of wax, anyways it has benzocaine on it and it can cover your tooth so that u can drink cold drinks or smoke. I used 7 days of 500mg Amoxacillin, and still was hurting, so even though the anti botics r helpful, they may take a very long time to work, so get to dentist, get cut out or get a root canal and crown, and u will be set. If u can find someone who has ultram, it will help for pain and it wont make u all messed up feeling, good luck with the tooth|`|wlxuCXSzaa	oh bless your heart!! tooth aches are the worst. If I had to GUESS just based on the info. you've provided, I would guess you have an infection. Is the tooth or any teeth in that area decayed? Do you have a blister/pimple like thing on your gums that drains fluid? If so, this is called an abscess and can provide relief/ feel better once it drains but cause extreme pain once the fluid/ puss fills the site up again. I would DEFINITELY see a dentist. If you are concerned or short for money, you can see if your area has a community dental clinic, they should do treatment very inexpensive as well as same day. Good Luck. definitely seek attention, infected teeth will only get worse EVEN IF it comes & goes.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	Your metabolism is like a car's gearbox. If you just crawl along then you only need a low gear ratio. The faster you go, the higher the ratio required to maintain speed.<br>  <br>  You body does something similar, - the higher the demand you put on it, the more metabolism increases to supply energy to meet that demand.<br>  <br>  That translates to exercise, nothing else. Eating smaller meals will help slightly, but not enough to make a noticeable difference. You need to make your muscles demand more energy on a prolonged basic to make your body "shift gear" and raise your metabolism.  Moderate daily exercise will have more effect than once or twice a week intense workouts at a gym. <br>  <br>  Take up sport and pastimes that include exercise. Ride a bike, swim, walk, play tennis, keep busy. Dancing is good, but not when accompanied by large quantities of alcohol. The body uses four primary sources of energy, carbohydrates, fat, protein, and alcohol. When alcohol is present the body uses it as an energy source in preference to all others - it needs little metabolic action to burn it and so exercise with alcohol present in the bloodstream won't have much effect on metabolic rate.|`|xrq4qKRbaa	Eat smaller meals more often rather than 2-3 larger meals.<br>  Work out and exercise often.<br>  Eat healthier foods when eating the smaller ones.|`|FVkq5RRZaa	eat healthier, smaller meals and exercise

WOvXaGUYaa	Yes it's probably a yeast infection. They can take from 3-7 days to heal up. Good to use Monistat. It should clear it up soon. In the mean time, make sure you're not washing with soap down there or anything other than water that may irritate it further. <br>  Sometimes if it's a tough infection it can take more than 7 days to clear. <br>  It sounds like you have had an improvement, however, since it's only itchy now. but if symptoms persist, you might want to think about talking to your dr. about a better antifungal ointment.|`|LriMdquJaa	It's never a bad idea to visit a gynecologist about itching and discharge. Depending on what Monistat you took (1, 3, or 7 days) it may not have worked the first time around. I have done the 1 day and found that it really didn't do much for me. Continuous dosage from the 3 or 7 day worked better (I did the 3 day). Naturally, don't scratch at it! That could make things worse.|`|hBmafVYoaa	It does sound like one but if you are prone to them it wouldn't hurt to get a check up to make sure there is nothing else causing them,|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Does your vagina burn? Does the discharge smell fishy? Is there a lot of the white CLUMPY cottage cheese-y discharge?<br>  <br>  If you answered 2 or more, you have a yeast infection.

O8h39Se2aa	The infection could be an STD. However, if you have always used condoms, it may just be a change of hormones from being stressed out about the sex and partying. I don't necessarily know that getting on the BCP will be the best option for you because it ONLY prevents pregnancy in your situation. At this age, you should be concentrating on school work and friends - not partying and sleeping around. The gynecologist will preform tests like a pap smear, which is where she takes a closer look at the outside and inside of your vagina. She may take an STD test if you're still worried about the infection.<br>  <br>  If you're truly ready to change your ways, focus on the things that matter: God doesn't approve of pre-marital sex nor birth control (unless it's for medical use). I really hope this helps. It's sad to see young girls with babies and STDs. Good luck on Wednesday.|`|fMiLQnSJaa	she's gonna do a pap test.  You will lie on your back and spread open your legs.  The gyno will put a speculum in there and open your vagina and look inside,  she/he will then stick a swab or something to get some cells and do a lab test.  It doesn't take long so don't worry.  You should also get checked for HIV/AIDS.
r4xRkqzdaa	an allergy is an immune response to an irritant.<br>  <br>  i believe that acupuncture is an amazing field, but i really don't see it changing the anaphylactic responses.  there's a chain of chemical reactions that go on in your body whenever you show signs of the allergy.  i don't think that it will change the chemical pathways<br>  <br>  but, would you really chance it- these treatments are not gauranteed or your $ back...|`|ldpDzaolaa	No. it doesn't affect the immune response in that manner, accupuncture usually is for pain pathways/nervous/muscular system, If it did, they wouldn't be doing research on peanut allergies, which, by the way are rare when proven.

The clitoris is.<br>  <br>  It might interest you to know that by the age of 12, 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that by age 15, it's 2/3 of them doing it *regularly* (many of them more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse.<br>  <br>  ... or that the very first thing sex therapists teach women who've never had an orgasm is how to masturbate - because that's the *only* sure fire way for a woman to learn how her body responds sexually and what will bring her to orgasm.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. <br>  <br>  Once you can have orgasms dependably when you masturbate, you can have them dependably whenever you have sex with a partner... either by giving them to yourself during sex or by teaching your partner what works for you so *he* can give them to you.<br>  <br>  Seriously. If you don't have orgasms alone... it's time you learned: how's your man gonna know how to get the work together with you if *you* don't even know what the job is?<br>  <br>  One thing you can do to find out is check out the "Female Masturbation" webpage at clitical-dot-com ... <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  ... to read up on lots of ways you can improve things.  (Actually, the entire section is incredibly valuable reading, but there's an awful lot of it to digest in one gulp.)<br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  You will *definitely* know when you have an orgasm. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm... both of these are unusual but normal, and anything in between is just fine.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it might happen that there'll be no interruption at all between orgasms, and it can feel like one single orgasm that lasts anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|p3iKqdh8aa	Not all girls/women can, or it'll just take A LOT. But don't worry, you'll know exactly when you've had an orgasm! :) x|`|TrEYixLXaa	Well, you are not alone.  The majority of all women do not have orgasms through penetration.

Try to not be in a  rush and have foreplay, make him touch you down there towards your clitoris. <br>  <br>  Clitoris:this is a tiny knob of tissue and nerve endings located at the top of the labia minora. The clitoris is the female equivalent of the penis head in terms of sensitivity and sexual arousal.
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

iFqfdj1aaa	Well yes that is small but there are options such as pills, penis pumps, penile enhancement surgery, if you want a perminant result then you may want to look into the max-extender it works like those rings african woman wear but it takes about 3 monthes to get results and you have to do it every day.

I really have no clue when i will get it, jsut the average time.  But some people know exactly wut day.  wut im trying to say is dont rely on the 28 day thing cause its different for every woman.|`|c14d3b5cbe3c5671fb48605311d2e82caa	the first day. the cycle starts on the beginning of your period!|`|lP04jzv6aa	the 28 day this is after your first day. count from there. all women are diff. so keep your own calender and find your cycle|`|njz5XFG2aa	After the 1st day of your cycle.|`|9TyrKyK6aa	after the last day.<br>  but it's not always 28 days.<br>  its usually different.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	28 days after the FIRST day<br>  <br>  doesn't sound stupid at all<br>  <br>  have you seen some of the questions on here?  haha|`|RTHWQvkzaa	It doesn't sound stupid!

Usually, lets say I got it on Feb 3, I would be prepared like a day or two earlier, just in case.

phXfnHAZaa	I was you once. I wanted to stop, but couldn't. I didn't steal big things, tried to be smart, and got away with it for 15 years or so. I'd guess I walked away with nearly $100,000 worth of stuff in that time. It was all so easy, I didn't even get nervous about it anymore. It was like going to work. I wanted to stop. I knew I needed to stop. I knew how the story was going to end.<br>  <br>  Then one day I went into the hardware store. I was there for one thing, but without really thinking pocketed something else...something I didn't even need, and just as I did the manager walked around the corner. My life fell apart in that moment. <br>  <br>  Most people think theives are scumbags, and we are I guess. But we can also have normal lives, good careers, educations, families, and friends. We can be totally trustworthy in the other parts of our lives, but we have this horrible darkside that haunts us. <br>  <br>  I got caught. I was arrested. My name was in the paper. My friends, family, everyone found out about it. It was the worst experience of my life, and led me to contemplate suicide. If not for my two kids I probably would have hanged myself; it was that bad. Even to this day I cringe when my boss calls me. I still live in fear that my employer will find out and my career will be ended, as will any chance of getting another decent job in the future. <br>  <br>  When you get caught, and you will my brother, your long nightmare will be over. Chances are you'll finally be able to quit doing this. If you're like me the lights will go on, and you'll try to figure out how the hell you wound up in this place, doing these terrible things, for so long. You'll realize that there are reasons why we do and did those things. They're not excuses, we know what we're doing is wrong and we do it anyway. But there are reasons why we do things that normal people do not do, and I beg you to explore that before you wreck your life too. <br>  <br>  There does exist a shoplifters anonymous, and you can find them with an internet search. But in the meantime I really hope you have the strength to do before you get caught what I only had the power to do after I was caught; go to a therapist, sit down, and tell them EVERYTHING. <br>  <br>  You need help to break this cycle. I jdon't think an addict has a good chance of stopping on his own. Even after the hell I've been through, and knowing that if I'm caught a second time I could very easily see time in JAIL, I still get tempted. I still have to think myself out of doing something, especially when I know it would be so easy to get away with it. Without the bitter taste and horrible memories of what I've been through I don't think I'd have the strength to resist those temptations. <br>  <br>  Alcoholics stay out of bars. Drug addicts stay away from other addicts. Everyone knows that addicts can't be around the vice that tempts them if they want to recover; the temptation is just too high. But what does the shoplifter do? We are in stores all the time, sometimes daily. We NEED to go in stores to live. You must get some help to beat this. <br>  <br>  You can do it. One day at a time. Live the good life and let someone help you. <br>  <br>  All the best, <br>  <br>  Jim|`|ParFJxnSaa	Most people are suggestible, to some degree, so either try professional hypnotherapy, or, quicker, and cheaper;  Perfect Partners: Conquer Kleptomania + Improve Impulse Control<br>  Perfect Partners: Conquer Kleptomania + Improve Impulse Control Hypnosis Downloads<br>   <br>   Conquer Kleptomania<br>  Conquer Kleptomania Hypnosis Download<br>  www.hypnosisdownloads.com|`|NpcSEJX1aa	get cought... or get help.. one or the 2.. the first one you will wish never happen..so get help..|`|e6rAMPjJaa	Yea dont go places that is a hassle to shiplift from so youll be all I better not shoplift.|`|N6t1q65xaa	so. if I called the police today I'd get a reward.lol just kidding.|`|4y2Gqj6laa	you can stop going into stores were you want things|`|CXgPkEPFaa	dont go to places where its easy... then every times ur tempted be like NO!|`|OiV3TkLqaa	Well, when you get caught and you will, you will go to jail and have a police record.

Find out what is wrong,  could be a simple solution.  Because suicide is the most selfish thing you can ever do!!!|`|ec77b7f46db199bd22fccb3b1e4641d4aa	I pray that you find the support and answers you are yearning for.  I am no way in your shoes but no doubt have I been depressed. Killing yourself is NOT the way out. After all, you have NO clue what happens after death. I dont know if u are religious or not but WHAT IF there is a heaven and hell. You dont wanna take your life and realize hell is a real place. You stay strong and keep striving for a better tommorow. Live for tommorow. Live for hope that you will be pain-free. Often, just when we are about to give up is the time of your breakthrough. ..<br>  much love hunny, be encouraged<br>  <br>  p.s. hopefully I did not offend u in anyway.|`|nAp688tZaa	Who are you talking to with the rant about sunshine and Mr. Sob story?  I have read all the responses and no one here has said anything that should be offensive to you.  I think you need to go the ER and get admitted for inpatient mental health treatment and evaluation.  You are very close to the edge as far as completely losing it and that is not safe.  If you love your boyfriend like you say you do, then go get some help.  There is no reason to suffer if you can help yourself by seeking professional counseling and treatment.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	I have chronic pain too and it sucks. The only thing that really helps is nothing. It sucks. I've been taking really strong narcotic pain meds for years now. They keep increasing the dose and increasing the dose. The dose I'm on now would be lethal for anybody else. And I'm still not getting adequate relief. I understand how you feel. I know a lot of people do! It's a shame, but pain is THE most under treated condition in medicine! I think what you should do is get enrolled into some sort of Chronic Pain Management Center. That's what I did. They provide you with group therapy, phsychology, exercise, meds, and daily doctor visits. The one I went through was very intensive. We met for 5 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. It was really a great program. Maybe something like that is just what you need. Believe me, suicide isn't your answer. Try getting some help first. If all else fails, go the the closest E.R. for help. I hope you get the help you need! Good luck! Take care!|`|98296d939b6e1a4572c6ef2dbace636caa	I personally don't believe the people there can evaluate you, and diagnose you as effectively as a professionally trained doctor could. They can help some, but they cannot cure you. They will only make you feel better for the moment. I've tried hot lines, emailing different suicidal help pep sites, speaking to counselors, teachers, family, and too many doctors to count. It wasn't until I had an overdose(s) that people actually began to see how serious I was. So I finally was put on Lexapro 10mg, then within a few days changed to Citalopram 40mg. It has made me horrible tired, to tired to give a damn about what's going on. I haven't had such intense thoughts, but I believe that nothing will cure us. I just have to put things in my life to make me care about it like my boyfriend, my friends, and my family.  There are days when the medicine helps, there are days when the hot lines help, when the doctor helps, etc- but there will always be that thought of suicide when things don't work out, when you screw up, or when people screw you over, in the back of your mind.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Okie Dokie, not to be mean here at all, BUT, Lithium is a drug that they prescribe for Bipolar Disorder.  From the reading of your information I would say that you DEFINITELY HAVE BIPOLAR DISORDER.  In addition to Lithium you should be taking a mood stabilizer and an anti-depressant, and probably an anti-anxiety medicine.  <br>  <br>  I understand that you have had some terrible times in life, so have I, but the one thing I do that you won't do is TAKE MY MEDICINE.  <br>  <br>  There is nothing anyone can do for you if YOU DON'T LISTEN AND DO WHAT THEY SAY?????????  As for Chronic Pain, I live with it everyday and have lived with it everyday since 1994.  I have arthritis and fibromyalgia, however, since I take my medicine for Bipolar Disorder, I don't feel like dying.  <br>  <br>  You did not say what the source of your chronic pain was, and sometimes when we are depressed we have pain too.  Depression can actually cause physical sickness.  <br>  <br>  Not being mean but it sounds to me that you need to TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF.  My advice would be to start with that, taking better care of yourself, getting on the medication suggested, and if you are having terrible pain see a doctor that specializes in Pain Management.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and I hope you feel better.|`|mAH9oHXaaa	I really feel for you, I know what its like to be suicidal but just the thought of what it would do to my loved ones helped me through it. Don't make any implusive decisions and talk to someone about your feelings, suicidal feelings are NOT healthy.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I'd go ahead and call the line, what do you have to loose??  You need to probably go back to the doctor, this isn't good (they need to do tests, maybe even again if they've already done them)  you might want to get admitted for pain management until they find what's wrong and can fix it!  You may need surgery or something, I'd go get checked in, that'll make you feel good without pain and they can figure out what's wrong.  But go ahead and call the number, they can help I'm sure and you can get there advice.  5 years is a long time and obviously it's not temporary pain, get some help to get back on the road of recovery
6NA2MXNPaa	It's completely normal. It happens to just about all women. Some women are lucky enough to not have to experience it, but most of us do. It generally just means you're either at the beginning of your period, or nearing the end of it.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	I just started and yes. It was brown when I satrted, then it faded to red, now its redish-brownish. weird lol|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Yes. <br>  <br>  But also remember that when blood dries it turns brown so if it has had time to turn brown on the pad/tampon then that could be it.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes, that is normal.

1vaqtRI2aa	It's in the front wall of your vaginal walls, close to your belly button.<br>  It is in different places for different women, but most women have it somewhere around there. It should be 3 inches inside your vagina. Be sure to look for a little area that feels different from the other parts.

If the texture changes as you rub- thats the spot.|`|GIxctDDuaa	The G-Spot is an area on the front wall of the vagina that when stimulated, can cause women to orgasm and sometimes ejaculate.

Just because your friends are thinner than you that doesn't make you heavy. You probably have more muscle weight than them because of your active life style. Anorexia is a disease and you do not want to bring a disease upon yourself! Just be yourself don't put your life in danger just to fit in. And I know that you think your life won't be in danger but trust me as soon as you stop eating you'll just keep going. And it never ends, talk to your parents or your doctor and tell them that you want to lose a bit of weight, but never ever go to extreme lengths like that!!!|`|owoQ93WHaa	Its going to ruin your life in the long run.

QRCQJF6Faa	The 100% just refers to what the government feels is a "normal" dosage per day. But yea, if your lacking vitamins then you might need more than the standard "100% daily value" and yea, your body can use and store more than that amount. <br>  <br>  Check the link below and near the bottom is a nice chart to tell you about the daily values and if the vitamin is "water" or "fat" soluble. This means, if it is water soluble the body will get rid of any extra in your system when you go to the bathroom. If it is "fat" soluble then your body will store that vitamin, which is okay as long as you don't over do it.<br>  <br>  Normally if you eat healthy and are generally "healthy" then you probably don't even need a vitamin supplement, but check with your doctor to see if you need to be taking additional vitamins or not.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Adam-O|`|AA10460179	My vitamins say that too, and if the bottle says to take 2 a day then it is safe. You could get away with taking one a day though.
j6dAbXCAaa	Gout is caused by too much of something called uric acid in the body. If the body doesn't get rid of the excess uric acid, it pools in joints. Then it can form crystals, then the body's immune system attacks those crystals, then you get inflammation in that joint, and BOOM! Pain times 3000.<br>  <br>  See this website on what you do about it:  www.best-gout-remedies.com.<br>  <br>  The simple things are to drink lots of water, 1 oz for every 2 lbs of body weight, make your body alkaline instead of acidic, stay away from things like beer and coffee and organ meats. Look for information that will help your body 1) get rid of uric acid, and 2) not produce so much uric acid.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	It's a build up of uric acid crystals in your joints.  I understand that it is quite painful.<br>  <br>  Treatments and drugs<br>  <br>  Treatment for gout usually involves medications. What medications you and your doctor choose will be based on your current health and your own preferences. Medications for gout include:<br>  <br>      * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs may control inflammation and pain in people with gout. NSAIDs include over-the-counter options such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others), as well as more powerful prescription NSAIDs. NSAIDs carry risks of stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers.<br>      * Colchicine. Colchicine controls gout effectively, but may cause uncomfortable side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If you're unable to take NSAIDs, your doctor may recommend colchicine.<br>      * Steroids. Steroid medications, such as the drug prednisone may control gout inflammation and pain. Steroids may be administered in pill form, or they can be injected into your joint. Side effects of steroids may include thinning bones, poor wound healing and a decreased ability to fight infection. Steroids may be reserved for people who can't take either NSAIDs or colchicine.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Gout is a disease in which your kidneys stop getting rid of uric acid. The excess uric acid gets into your bloodstream, forms small crystals that deposit in your joints and cause inflammation. Your body produces Uric acid when you eat foods high in purines such as sea food, red meat, mushrooms, and other foods. There are many websites dedicated to this which have lists of foods low, moderate, and high in purines. <br>  <br>  To prevent further gout attacks, you have to be prescribed Allopurenol.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS- Gout more commonly affects men over the age of 35.<br>  <br>  Women who suffer from gout are rare.
inZff9wQaa	I've used tea tree oil (also called Melaleuca oil) with success.

TnT8wnTFaa	you're definitely not fat. in fact you're in the normal range:)! trust me, you don't want to become bulimic. soon, you won't be able to control it. you lose relationships with people, because you're always lying or hiding from them. those nights where you're up gaging yourself are among the most painful. i know what it's like to not be overweight and to feel disgusting and how people might get mad at you and angry at you if they don't understand. but it truly becomes a mental disorder, and it can ruin your life. there are so many ways you can lose weight the healthy way. exercising, counting calories, and just getting out there and finding something you like to do!<br>  i'm here for you!|`|mVUpt8waaa	You will regret doing this when your teeth are rotten from all the vomit.|`|AhBJT5xFaa	Okay, first of all, that's not fat at all. That's average. If you want to be fairly skinny, but not crazy skinny 120 pounds is good weight for your height. 10 pounds lower that though, and you'll be near to being underweight. You are not fat, you're just growing, it happens to everyone.. It's okay to be skinnier and eat less. But don't let it get out of hand. That's one thing that you can not do. You do not want to be skin and bones, it will ruin your life and will become and obession. I, like you, want to be skinnier. What I do excercise once a day, or once every other day, running up to 3 miles, I cut certain things out of my diet- like soda, cookies, cupcakes, chips, etc.. If I do eat those things I will only take 1 or half of one at most. Also every morning I drink slim shots in my coffee, it reduces your apetite by 30%,<br>  so it's easier to eat less. It's not really necessary to tell your friends, but you can share it with them if you want to. But I'd only start with one very close friend.<br>  Anyway, good luck. But before you become pro-eating disorder, watch this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6WocbamM3Q&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6WocbamM...</a><br>  <br>  So do not, EVER let it get that bad|`|rrwXH62raa	that really gross to be throwing up and ur 5'6 and 130, thats not even pver weight.  guys dont like anorexic girls i can tell u that casue im a guy in highschool and i prefer girls to have a little more meat then to not have any at all. U should stop worrying about what u eat and throwing it up.|`|ywXrF7mQaa	I totally get you. You're great just the way you are. Don't start puking. Once you get into the habit you can't stop. It's almost like an addiction. Be careful about wat you say to your friends. You really don't want someone spreading that around. If you trust them go ahead.|`|Vz4ooIxMaa	I know you probably won't stop, but you really should listen to what I have to say.  First of all...130 lbs. is a fine weight; you could even gain more weight and still be healthy.  Second, you have made yourself throw up 3 times so it is not too late to stop this before it becomes a serious problem.  Never make yourself throw up again.  Please.  I'm telling you that bulimia is a horrific, disgusting, painful, and embarrassing disorder that you do not want to get involved with.  Even if it will temporarily help you maintain your weight, it is NOT worth the long term health consequences, and once your throat is raw from having thrown up so many times and you medically cannot vomit anymore, you will HAVE to stop, and by that time you will be so messed up that you will gain weight.  If you stop now, this won't happen, and you won't experience the rotted teeth, throat problems, bad breath and food issues that accompany bulimia.|`|QCr26nZNaa	Your body needs those calories to live. You need them for your mental health. If you feel like you have to do it impulsively, it's probably because you're throwing up all the nutrients that should be going to your cognitive processes. Try veganism. You can stay thin while still getting the nutrients you need.
GvVbAjJNaa	You honestly have to first-off, help this person realize that, simply, it could be worse.  I am not going to tell you to go out and make your friend join all sorts of things to make him/her feel better, or go to the doctor. But simply just realize that things could ALWAYS be worse. And they should gain a positive attitude that way. With a positive attitude, i suggest this person gaining a idea of well-being. ie: realizing GOOD things about themselves, and adjusting the negatives with the "things could be worse" attitude. A loss to someone is very hard, but the most harsh, yet true saying in all of this is: 'Life goes on."  I really suggest introducing this person with that idea. It WILL help in the long run.|`|6BpL5Pvxaa	It's hard when one of your good friends lose someone they love a lot. <br>  <br>  It's great that you are there for your friend. If he wants to talk about his dad, talk to him. Always be reminding him of what a cool dad he was, and let him know that his dad loved him a lot. That's the best way to deal with things until time helps your friend get over his loss. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your friend :)|`|QCr26nZNaa	Distract him. Go places and have fun, hang out with friends. Make out with him, if you're into that. Or find someone for him to make out with. Making out makes everyone feel better.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	you need to be there for him. AS sombody who has gone through a depresion he needs you. he may not always act like it but he does|`|mAH9oHXaaa	Just listen to him, don't give him advise, and when he doesn't feel like going anywhere just offer to be there for him, just being there physically is a great help for someone who's depressed. Cheer him up, buy him chocolate but never alcohol, buy him nice happy books and tell him how nice a person he is and how much he means to you.
8LyC55nlaa	eat some protien bars, no more than 2 a day though, do some weight training|`|98YxGIiRaa	You’re probably consuming enough right now. <br>  <br>  Most people repeat the tired formula saying you need 0.5-1.0+ grams per kg of lean mass. This would make sense if you destroyed and had to rebuild your entire body everyday, but you don’t. Even a hard workout does relatively small damage to the body. Then factor in that most of your lean mass is bone, blood and waste. In fact the average non-trained human body only carries aprox 25-35 lbs of muscle. As for muscle itself, it is mostly water and sugar with only around 10% being protein. So as you can see it is very hard to eat too little protein. <br>  <br>  The most important factors to look at are.<br>  1. Sleep- your body does all its repair work during the rem cycle. So if you’re waking up tired, you didn’t sleep long enough and short changed yourself some muscle growth.<br>  2. Frequency- A lot of people exercise too often. If a cut on your skin doesn’t completely heal in 2 days then why would you think a muscle has? Healing is healing and it takes time.<br>  3. Challenge- you have to ‘threaten’ your muscles to make them grow. Compound exercises let muscles work together using greater weight which creates a greater ‘threat’ on the system.|`|vx2MaQg0aa	You should have 145 grmas of protein everyday.. 1 gram of protein per body lb for ex if you weight 200lb you need 200 grams so you weight 145 you need 145 grams of protein everyday.. You also need to lift weight in order to build muscle
H1vfrIg0aa	it is highly advised that you have your teeth cleaned at the dental office within a month before your ZOOM procedure.  it gets all of the surface staining and debris off and out of the way, which makes it the ideal time to have the zoom procedure done.  how many shades the zoom whitening lifts your teeth and how long it lasts is determined by your habits (coffee, smoking, etc.).  most offices will provide you with custom made at home bleaching trays to take with you for maintenance.
OikNR8Ufaa	hey, I get the same thing.  <br>  <br>  paranormal experiences unnerve a lot of people, you want it to go away and for everything to be normal again, you feel like you're going crazy, or other people think you are! you are probably acting on edge or reacting strangely when the stuff you have dreamt has come true which is why people are getting a bit freaked out and unsure about you now, or maybe you're talking about it all the time and people think you've gone mad? I've learnt not to talk about the stuff I see...<br>  <br>  I think everyone at some point in their life senses de ja vu or dreams something that actually happens, some people get it more than others. For myself a lot of my bad dreams come true, the ones where I wake up crying because they are so vivid..also a lot of pointless day-to-day stuff I dream comes true that I dream..<br>  <br>  Now the hearing voices thing could mean you are mentally ill, but the fact you dream stuff that comes true, that's not an illness, thats something paranormal, so I believe that you are probably very sensitive to these things that cant be explained. Maybe the voices are spirits you are hearing? do you hear them in just one place or several? do they tell you to do anything? ofcourse it could jjust be your mind working overtime because you are paranoid about everything else that is happening, I think somehow you're going to have to accept your dreams because if you don't you're going to make yourself ill stressing about it...<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will grow out of being so sensitive to paranormal activity as you get older, maybe you could go to the doc and get some sleeping pills too, they may make you sleep deeper so that you dont dream? or maybe (now dont take the piss) you could get a blessing from a vicar...<br>  <br>  I never believed in all the religious stuff but my mum's house was haunted and I was getting some awful experiences and one day it all stopped, it turned out she'd had someone in the bless the house, so I guess there is something in all that...<br>  <br>  good luck with it all and I hope you find a way to cope :) x|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	are you taking prescription meds that you are intolerant to or maybe you need to clean up your diet ....... there's an awful lot of man made chemically processed sugar and other nasty chemicals in packaged and junky take away foods, sodas, soft drinks, candies, sweets, lollies, cakes, icecream and chocolate, alcohol ........ you could very well be unwittingly starving your mind simply by not eating fresh wholesome food ...... chemically processed and bleached sugar has no nutritional value and will only serve to further stress an already stressed system ..... think fresh leafy and green vegies like broccolli, kale, spinach, celery, buk choy .... all rich in magnesium and calcium ..... magnesium is needed for healthy nerve and muscle functioning and of course for heart health .... it is known as the antistress mineral .....calcium will bolster your frazzled nervous system and aid in giving you a good nightss rest, aid in digestion, bolster immunity and is essential for bone and heart and teeth health ..... symptoms of calcium deficiency are headaches and migraines, achy bones, irritability and moodiness, insomnia, digestive troubles such as bloating and cramping and nausea and constipation ...... symptoms of magnesium deficiency are headaches and migraines, nervous tension, muscle twitching and constipation ...... foods rich in magnesium will also assist in lowering high blood pressure and resolving any issues with constipation .......... eat some low sugar fruits such as strawberries, pears, watermelon and cantaloupe .... wholegrain cereals and breads like brown rice, potatoes, oats.... the carbs and B vitamins in wholegrains and cereals will feed your brain the fuel it needs and provide your body with the energy it needs...... ditch the white bread and cakes and pastries, if you eat any, treat it like cake as it really doesn't have much nutritional value anyways ....... eat some lean meats and fishes ..... the protein will level out your stress and anxiety levels and the tryptophan contained therein is essential in the production of serotonin in your brain (you know that natural feel good drug our bodies produce) ...... all you need is a piece of lean meat the size of your palm each day to sustain your nutritional requirements.<br>  <br>  EAt a handfull of organic almonds, brazil nuts or sunflower seeds daily too .. rich in essential fatty acids which will do wonders for levelling out your mood and stress levels ..... also a fine source of calcium.<br>  <br>  Organic with the nuts and seeds to avoid the nasty sulfites and other chemicals they use to "preserve" the commercial varieties that will upset sensitive bodies.<br>  <br>  Cut out the sodas, pop and soft drinks as they will rob you of your precious B complex of vitamins and dehydrate you terribly ..... the B complex of vitamins is essential for healthy neural, immune and digestive functioning ...... too much processed sugar in your diet will definitely make your mind work frantically overtime and give you vivid dreams ...... also, you'd be amazed at how being just a little dehydrated can affect your mood and energy levels....... coffee, tea and alcohol will also dehydrate you terribly....... drink 8 glasses of water daily.... your body needs water to breathe, digest your food, lubricate your joints, transport nutrients, think, to do anything at all really so drink up mate.<br>  <br>  Sugar is the key here i reckon..... i used to have some ghastly thoughts and mood swing problems and wild wild imaginations and was terribly paranoid and had very vivid prophetic dreams .... and even heard voices all the time ......  when i was flying high on junk food and alcohol all the time ...... try it mate and you won't look back.<br>  <br>  (((huggs)))<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|X09TLgENaa	Are you Autistic or have something similar?

This isn't "That's So Raven."<br>  <br>  A lot of times people will have dreams that are very similar to what happens in the near or far future and that is because when you get to know someones personality, it is much easier to predict how they will react in situations. As you dream about these people or situations (even if you aren't trying to) the dream sort of plants itself in your brain. The next day, week, etc., you will not think about it all the time, but the dream is still there in your recent memory and so subconsciously you probably start the conversations / situations on your own. And then you act the way you did in Your dream (not realizing it) and everything follows sort of like that.<br>  <br>  I am not saying you aren't, but as every "emo" person I have ever seen almost tries to be an outcast to fit the stereotype, if you were the most popular girl in school everyone is probably ditching you. When you tell people these things it almost screams "I want attention!"

ibMFwQoMaa	Have you got an eye infection?  Or maybe something is irritating your eyes?  That could make the skin around your eyes swell up and make the eyes themselves seem smaller.<br>  <br>  Eye infections can be treated by gently bathing your eyes with salt water.  The eyes would initially get more swollen due to the salt, but then start to improve when you stop.  To be on the safe side, perhaps you should go to the doctor tomorrow and get a proper professional opinion.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	show a fucingpicture!.

This exercise is one of the most efficient upper body exercises out there. The problem is most of us find pushups difficult to perform. To overcome this, all you need is the right variation. The pushup comes in many forms and I guarantee an option exists for everyone; you want to choose a variation that allows you to perform roughly 20 challenging repetitions. Listed in order from least to most difficult, consider the following options. <br>                           The wall pushup: Stand facing a wall with hands shoulder width apart and your arms parallel to the floor. Your feet should be together, roughly two feet away from the wall. Similar to a regular pushup, simply bend at the elbows and bring your chest toward the wall instead of the floor. For a greater challenge, move your feet slightly farther away from the wall or perform the exercise one arm at a time. <br>  <br>  Modified pushup: This pushup is performed in the traditional method, except your knees act as the pivot point instead of your toes. Place your hands shoulder width apart and bend your arms at the elbow as you lower your chest to the floor. Tip: tighten those abs, don’t let your stomach sag and keep your buttocks from pointing up in the air. <br>                   HAVE FUN TONING UR ARMS.I HPOPE THIS HELP AND GOOD LUCK.|`|IppPQJODaa	Sounds like you already have arm muscle, you just need to lose the fat. So what you need to do is cardio, and just keep training your arms like you do now. Run, walk, bike, swim - whatever you like. This will help you lose the fat on your arms. If you keep building arm muscle, they will only look bigger, until you lose the fat. :)
Ue56xZ7vaa	Ugh i have the same problem. i'm always 'hungry' and snacking on something when i'm really not hungry.<br>  even when i'm not bored or stressed i always find myself searching the cabinets or snacking on something.<br>  you should start telling yourself things like...<br>  "is this _______ going to make me any thinner?"<br>  ask yourself..."do i REALLY need this?<br>  and remember you will not die if you don't snack on this or that or have a second serving<br>  just as long as you don't starve yourself or go out of control with telling yourself those things.<br>  another thing that helps me is keeping pictures on photobucket of people that i think are fat and do not want to look like, and girls that are about the size i'd like to be. it helps alot and motivates me not to snack and exercise more.<br>  <br>  <br>  you didnt state your age, but if you're an adult or do your own grocery shopping, remember...if you don't have this or that junk in your cabinets, you simply cannot eat it. so if you want to stop snacking on chips or chocolate for example, just dont buy any! therefore you wont have any to snack on!|`|dDas43FZaa	You could stop buying junk food and buy fruits and veggies to snack on.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	instead of eating junk food eat fruits and veggies|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Go to your cupboard and throw away all the junk food.

Also, mix your work out up a little- between running, swimming, cardio and weight training. <br>  <br>  A few weeks of that should start showing results.

xUi2lQQXaa	I just got stitches on my hand a week ago and the stitching part didn't hurt, but when they give you the numbing shot, that really hurts. Watching the doctor stitch my hand up was so interesting. There was no pain at all but you can kind of feel the sewing happening in your skin. Hard to describe. I don't know if the length of the shot depends on the depth of the wound, but mine was a pretty long shot. I think the length of the shot was about 10-15 seconds. It burns, stops, stings, stops, etc. It kind of feels like a really really hot needle jabbing you. It stung pretty badly but it is worth it at the end because it will minimize the size of the scar. If knew it was that bad I probably wouldn't have gotten it, but I am very sensitive to pain. <br>  <br>  I don't think you need stitches because you already stopped the bleeding and it was a day ago. How deep is that one cut? Are you worried about getting a scar? Go see a doctor and if you're scared of getting the numbing shot/stitches ask them if you can have the skin glue instead.|`|GZ8N0Nieaa	It just feels like a pinch. I have had them in my neck, and twice in my knee. They will numb the area up before they do it, and you feel almost nothing. There are other options than stitches, but they are the best way to heal a cut the fastest. After they put them in you don't feel anything. Then it feels kinda cool when they take them out cuz they are moving underneath your skin. You can even pull them out yourself if you want. I did that with my knee the second time.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	It doesn't hurt at all. They numb the entire area so, you won't feel a thing. They just inject it with a needle, which doesn't really hurt. Just like a small bee sting. If you're slightly tolerate of pain, then don't worry.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Most wounds are stitched within 6 hours after they occur. It is highly unlikely that you would be a candidate for stitches at this point in time.  However, the wound should be properly debrided and treated medically, so you should get in for treatment asap.|`|YjM2LxANaa	No it doesnt hurt, I had to get stitches as well..on my hand because it was scratched up by broken glass..you should really get it checked out in case there are any pieces of glass stuck in your wounds. <br>  <br>  I only had to get 6 stitches. Not a very big cut, but wasn't painful at all. It might feel a bit weird because you can feel the thread tugging your skin while they are doing it. They injected something before they did the stitches to numb the pain. That hurt a bit more than the stitching itself lol.<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel better, you could turn away while they do it. Im deathly afraid of needles and blood, but I was ok, so you most likely will be too.<br>  <br>  I hope your hand heals well =)
lcuxD3qlaa	that five pounds will be water weight<br>  reduce your sodium intake to 500 to 1000...start reading labels...and you should loose it in less than 2 weeks actually<br>  ~*~*~*~*~*~***~*~*~**~*~<br>  <br>  I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k? I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious!

TORBP6QIaa	OK...I have had lots of them.  <br>  Its pretty noisy and the machine makes a lot of banging and clunking noises and then a little voice talks to you over the intercom and lets you know what is hapeneing. You will have to hold still for short periods of time and they may strap your head so you dont accidentally wiggle and mess up the scan.  <br>  It can feel a bit claustrophobic in there but be assured that they will get you out quickly if you start to feel ill or get scared.  The staff are very kind and usually tell you what t expect.  The scan can take 10-20 minutes .  They may give you some valium or similar to calm you down if you are very very nervous.|`|3rUEUKizaa	It's claustrophobic, but it won't hurt you
mzz9Icdjaa	yes it could be harmful if in fact you actually do have the 500mg tablets. you don't want to take a higher dosage than your doctor prescribes because overuse can lead to immunity to the drug later on in life. In other words, if you take too much, it could be less effective later. You should take it to your pharmacist if you are concerned, just to make sure you got the correct strength. Sometimes pills such as that look similar, but are just different sizes. It really depends on the brand name

PfE6bg5iaa	I came off birth control a few months ago. All that happened was the first month I had some stomach problems and maybe a few mood swings. Also my period is now a little irregular (the last few months it's been like a 35 day cycle instead of a 28). Pimples came back too :-( but I never had much acne so it's not terrible. <br>  <br>  Your hormone levels change thoughout your cycle. They rise and fall with or without the pills. Changes in hormone levels result in mood swings and just regular PMS symptoms!

Go out and buy this month's issue of SELF magazine (it has Taylor Swift on the cover) and it has a lot of details about the self challenge.<br>  <br>  In order to lose 2 pounds a week, it says you need to burn 500 calories a day. I forget how many calories it suggests you eat a day, but I think it's something around 1600.<br>  <br>  You need to keep track of what you eat, and you can't lie to yourself! Everything has calories and if you have one bite of this, and another of that it all adds up. I'm not trying to be harsh, but it's just how it works. And definitely drink those 8 glasses of water a day. it helps to initially flush you out (so you might lose an unexpected amount of weight the first week, and then 1 or 2 the following week). Plus water has no calories. Why waste calories on other drinks when you can actually eat something with them?<br>  <br>  As far as exercise goes, try and start with walking for 20 minutes a day, or riding your bike. If you dread exercise (which most of us do) it will last forever. I usually walk on my treadmill for 30 minutes and do 30 minutes on my gazelle. but i watch TV while I do it so it's not so boring.<br>  <br>  It's going to take a while to lose the weight but just remember that it's possible!!

b6Fsfbfnaa	1) Don't overdo the diet- eating not enough calories (below your basal metabolic rate, which you can calculate online-just google basal metabolic rate calculator) will end up putting your body in starvation mode and lowering your metabolic rate in the long run.<br>  <br>  2) Find things that are lower calorie but you still enjoy. A good soup, salad with meat, or sub can be an enjoyable everyday meal. Go grocery shopping after dinner or lunch, when you are full.<br>  <br>  3) I find jogging around my neighborhood (it's suburban, so scenery is not bad) or at a park or a beach to be enjoyable. I've always thought going to a gym is kind of boring. My dad on the other hand does jogging on the treadmill, but is watching tv the whole time, so I guess that helps not to bore him out.

Are you perhaps anorexic?|`|aMNharREaa	500 calories a day is not enough, you will put your body into starvation mode and your metabolism will shut down completly. You should never cut your caloric intake by less than 25%. For example, if you are typically consuming 2500 calories a day you could reduce your calories by 25%, leaving you with 1800-1900 calories a day. You are young and your metabolism will work well so you will lose weight fine sticking to 1800 cal. a day. Trust me you don't want to ruin your metabolism by starving yourself, there are people who have never been able to repair the damage done. Good Luck!!

S & M - Sadism and Masochism<br>  <br>     The term BDSM covers a lot of ground; if you live a 24/7 Master/slave relationship you're into BDSM, if you live a "vanilla" life but like to get smacked on the @ss every now and then, you're into BDSM. I think that it can bring a couple closer together like very few things can. This is because of the amount of trust that's involved.<br>  <br>     One of the things to keep in mind is that BDSM does not always mean a sexual relationship; however it should and must always mean a trusting relationship.<br>     <br>     A major saying with people that live the BDSM lifestyle is SSC- Safe, Sane, and Consensual. If a person is a true Dominant or Submissive they live those rules and do not push far enough for someone to get killed or even hurt more than they truly want to anyway. Most D/s couples have safe words for the submissive to say when they have been pushed farther than they can handle. <br>     <br>     A lot of people think that BDSM is all about whips, chains, paddles and collars. However this isn't the true essence of what this life means. Whoever the Dominant is whether is be female or male, once they take on the role of Dominant they are agreeing to protect and care for their submissive in a way that husbands and wives rarely experience....|`|O8h39Se2aa	Bondage/Discipline/Sadism/Masochism.

If you have in fact started drinking more coffee or anything like that, then you should stop. However, if that isn't the case, then you should talk to your doctor over a phone and try to figure out why he's doing this. There may be an important reason, or maybe you weren't clear enough when you were explaining this to him/her. <br>  <br>  I say that you just do as your doctor says, but if nothing improves after about two weeks or so, call him/her again and explain the problem.<br>  <br>  As for other things that can be safer than the medication, you could try walking outside, maybe sleeping a little more, eat healthier things, etc. They may help.|`|nXTDkokuaa	One good way you can start to get these attacks under control is by taking medication that is designed specifically to stop panic attacks. Some people don't like the idea of taking medication for these, but it can really help you when you feel like things are getting out of control and you can't think straight. They will give you time to calm down and figure out what to do. It's not good to become totally dependent on them, but they are good for a crutch.<br>  <br>  Talking to a therapist or psychiatrist may also be a good option if you feel like there are things you want to talk to someone about but there is either no one to listen or nobody that you think will care. Often times these pent up feelings we store inside can come out in the form of a panic attack, so start taking control today.

Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid or fight .<br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!<br>  <br>  Praise to Lucinda Bassett !|`|MmRDzhaHaa	I get these try this tip if it happens again,put a paper bag over your nose and mouth, and breath in and out slowly and calmly,do this until your heart slows down to normal pace, this stops the attack a lot sooner!
Rk46lIBwaa	Though BP does have a tendency to rise with age, normal blood pressure in adults is not age dependant and remains constant at 120/80.<br>  <br>  Single BP readings are notoriously unreliable and before making management decisions BP is either monitored for up to 6 months or a 24 hour monitor is used to determine if there is a real problem.<br>  <br>  160/125 is well into the treatment range so your GP should be arranging monitoring. He will exclude the 2 rare causes of hypertension, renal artery stenosis and pheochromocytoma. I searched in vain for 25 years and never found a patient with either. <br>  <br>  The remainder of patients with hypertension have no identifiable cause, weight loss, salt restriction and exercise all help in reduction, but medication might well be needed if that sort of reading proves to be your mean.|`|AA11434633	No.  It's high.

Normal BP is <120/80.<br>  <br>  You need to see your Doctor, he will need to rule out secondary causes for hypertension and discuss management with you. In the meantime, you need to think about making some life style changes.

Y0r69m4zaa	Educating your and your dad can make a big difference in his life.  <br>  <br>  I have found a website on diabetes and there is a lot of good information on it about type 1 diabetes, food and how it affects it, and much more information for you to check out.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your dad.|`|AeeX1Wnkaa	Type 1 diabetes is when your pancreas isn't making enough/any insulin. Insulin is what helps your body take up the sugars we eat into the body's cells, so that the cells can use the sugars for energy. If left untreated, diabetes can cause nerve damage and pain, poor circulation to the feet and hands leading to amputations, kidney damage, blindness, blood vessel damage...not to mention your body won't be able to properly use food to make energy. Type 1 diabetes is treated with injectable insulin, and type 2 diabetes is treated with pills and sometimes insulin too. Your dad needs to follow his prescribed treatment. It's great that he's stopped smoking, because that lowers his risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure. He needs to try to exercise at least 30 minutes for 5 days a week. He also needs to follow a diabetic diet (check out the American Diabetes Association for more info).|`|jlzdQSmzaa	Hmm, I thought type I was when you have had since childhood?

AEAxZEveaa	I doubt you'll get really great answers to these questions because it's such a controversial topic. I'll try my best. Personally, I'm against drug use because I used to have a drug problem. Although I hated weed, so that's where I stand on the matter:<br>  <br>  Yea, it kills brain cells. I don't have scientific proof on this one, but seriously, have you ever met someone who smoked every day for a couple of years? Do they seem like they have all their brain cells? But occasional smoking will probably not do too much damage.<br>  <br>  I've never smoked every day, but the people who do, tell me that their food cravings and other bad side effects go down, but that the high stays the same. No, it's not a good idea to do it daily (see answer number one. plus the whole smoke issue. If you insist, atleast use a bong, I would think that would damage your lungs less)<br>  <br>  No. Your homework will probably not even get done at all. :-)<br>  <br>  Yea, smoking anything will probably be bad for a cough and your lungs. Although the marijuana itself would probably reduce your cough. Maybe if you put it in some brownies or something. <br>  <br>  Now, my mom speech. Drugs are bad. They're very illegal. And if you get caught, you will get in a lot of trouble that will follow you for the rest of your life. Imagine having to put that you have a drug conviction on a job application. How embarrassing would that be?|`|HVO6z5moaa	1) it might kill SOME brain cells, but not much. you can always make more by learning.<br>  2) yes, you're tolerance will go down. the less you smoke, the more you get high cause it's not in your system if you don't smoke.<br>  3) yeah, i actually focus good and use more creative terms.<br>  4) it really didn't change anything for me.<br>  <br>  happy smoking!|`|tTkLgQduaa	yes, many many brain cells<br>  <br>  not a good idea doing it every night for 2 weeks, not good at all because it only gets worse<br>  <br>  no, your lucky if you can read a question without bursting out laughing<br>  <br>  don't you ever do anything while your sick, never mix your med.s with your drugs it intensifies your "highness"<br>  <br>  and it is addictive, just so you know|`|HrdGdiE0aa	weed=(:(:(:<br>  But the only answer i know for sure is it does kill brain cells.<br>  I get all A's.:D<br>  hmm dunno? lol.|`|uUvV7eadaa	1. yes, I think it kills brain cells because my memory is screwed because of it. no worries though I don't really need a good memory <br>  <br>  2. it depends on your tolerance. some people build up a tolerance really fast, of others never do. it is obviously more special if you keep it to a couple of times a week, just like when you were a kid, getting to have ice cream or something, its not that special if yo get it everyday, as apposed to getting it every once in a while.<br>  <br>  3. yes, I do better on my school work having smoked.<br>  <br>  4. yes it can make you cough more, I don't think it will effect a cold though.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	I don't know about the brain cells.<br>  <br>  You will develop a "tolerance" if you smoke it every day, and won't get as high as time goes by.<br>  <br>  Nobody can smoke pot and do as well as they would sober, at homework, or anything else. The only exception might be tasks that require a great deal of creativity.<br>  <br>  Smoking anything, pot or cigarettes, will affect your respitory system. If you have a cold or cough, smoking anything will ruin the lungs ability to remove mucus from the lungs and you could end up with bronchitis. Don't smoke when you're sick.|`|n4IOpH2Baa	ok yes to the brain cells but thats mostly the smoke itself.<br>  you really should'nt smoke it that often as i bet you already know, work on that or your gunna be all messed up later.<br>  smoking pot gives a similar feeling to staying up for 2 days straight (for me at least) and apparently theres a chemical called mescaline that fits in there somewhere, anyway this is what makes you "creative" i guess some people can do homework better because of it|`|c8FZAz00aa	Very interesting subject , short term it wont affect you you will loose brain sells that help you concentrate while some of your nerves and cells seam jumpy.

Oh, and it depends on if you smoke it by yourself & how much you smoke lol. My brother smoked like daily over the summer and his high was always the same or sometimes better. It depended on who he got it from & how good it was lol.<br>  <br>  question three: I don't know about you, but I had a friend that smoked before a spanish test, and he passed really good haha.<br>  <br>  question four: it might make it worst.

And I am sure you hear this one all the time if others know about it...What the HELL are you doing smoking marijuana in the first place man?  If it is a life problem see a counseler.  You don't even have to tell the counceler about it.  And even if you did they have to keep every thing confidential.|`|NUO74ztCaa	when i have a cold or a cough i tend to get even higher<br>  and it kills brain cells<br>  and the more you smoke you higher your tolerance is<br>  and i can do anything high better i can sober|`|ItuArLfqaa	damn dude how old are you|`|FywX0aJ3aa	1. Yes. Over a long period. Like anything that works on neurotransmitters, if its abused long enough, changes will happen.<br>  <br>   2. If you smoked for years the high will gradually become less intense, not weeks. And depends on the strength of the weed. I know<br>   life long pot heads who, if offered really good strong weed, can still <br>   green out from smoking it.<br>  <br>   3. I know many, many (and im talking even people in high responsibility/high paid jobs) who smoke daily. Even before and at work. I am not recommending it, but its a fact you should know about it.It's way more used/abused than it seems. But you gotta remember gettin busted with pot isnt like getting caught smoking cigs in the high school dunnies, if you know what im saying....<br>  <br>   4. Cold? wont do a thing, just put you to sleep. Cough? will make you cough more, then put you to sleep.<br>  <br>   peace.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Yes it does kill brain cells.

Flu is a killer and doesn't just give you a runny nose, it hits you hard and can lay you out for 2 or 3 weeks with aches, pains, fevers and worse.<br>  <br>  If you are fit and healthy most types of rhinovirus will give you nothing worse than a mild "cold" which can be treated best by lots of warm fluids, such as warm lemon and honey, ginger (a great antiviral) and rest.  Try to avoid taking anything with paracetemol as this will only prolong the virus.  the body needs to fight the virus and does this best by making you hot.  Paracetemol depresses the body temperature.<br>  <br>  If you do have flu don't ask your doctor for antibiotics.  Flu is a virus and antibiotics will do absolutely nothing to help.

If it runs in the family, it is very likely that he may have it, even at such a young age.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

I'm 41 with a 36c chest size. I started wearing a soft non-underwire to bed in my 20's when I was about a 34B. I now wear a sports bra to bed about 3-4 nights a week.

1pup885baa	Suck it up and eat your damn vegetables. Experiment with different types, there's bound to be something you like. You can get some nutrients from a vitamin, but not all of them, and the ones that come from food directly are usually easier for your body to use. <br>  <br>  Seriously, just eat some vegetables.

0didTstUaa	well typically if you are doing excersise, then you are turning the fat into muscle, which means that you will actually gain weight, but you will look much healthier, gaining weight is not always a bad thing ;)<br>  dont look at the weight, look at a body fat index, surf the net for a free thing from a gym around your area or something if you really want to go that far. but as i said, you are turning the fat into muscle and will stay the same weight, then gain weight. not a bad thing. <br>  any other questions, feel free to email me at soulstealer423@rock.com<br>  hope this helped<br>  good day ;)|`|AA11117282	dude you don't need to lose weight.<br>  your fine.|`|b6Fsfbfnaa	1000 calories is too little.

(Dont look at the numbers on the scale)  You have a pretty good height to weight ratio. You are not overweight so it is going to take you extra work to lose a few pounds compared to someone who is overweight. Its also possible that you could gain a few pounds (muscle weighs more than fat) This is what happens to me, no matter how many push ups or sit ups i do i cant lose weight, i sometimes gain a pound or two. Gaining this kind of weight does not make you "fat" or anything, it tightens your body and you do lose the inches.<br>  <br>  For other people who may read this. I know a lot of people who complain that they eat healthy and watch their calories, go on the atkins, or whatever, but they complain and complain that they never lose any weight. This is simply because you cannot just eat healthy to lose weight you NEED to work out. This is soooo important, if you dont work out you dont burn off the calories and fat that you need to.|`|InRFCN3Xaa	you aren't eating enough.

t7zuFsdwaa	I have played guitar for over 30 years. Really muscle strength has very little to do with playing well. It is the agility, coordination and light touch that works best. Unfortunately it takes many years of playing for most people to acquire this touch. Anytime that a brute force approach is applied the muscles, nerves and tendons are strained and produce pain and possibly permanent damage. <br>  <br>  Forcing the muscles is incorrect. The correct approach is to ease off, play fewer notes, slow the tempo and relax. Playing with this relaxed feel is the basis to play correctly. This relaxed feel should slowly be speeded up and more notes added as feels comfortable. Never force it and always play with relaxed muscles.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Take an Ibuprofen and go for it it'll lessen the stress from actually enjoying something in life.|`|P9s3r8oJaa	metals not very soothing so maybe try something a little more relaxing or just try turning the music down.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	try taking a break your damaging your hearing!

It might not be safe to give him anything on top of the anesthetic, anyway, even if it is typically safe for dogs.<br>  <br>  First thing tomorrow, you can call the vet and ask about pain medication.<br>  <br>  Your other option is to call a 24-hour vet and ask them this question, but unless they know exactly what your vet gave him (is it listed on your vet bill printout?), they will probably be reluctant to advise anything over the phone.<br>  <br>  You might not want to "borrow trouble" on this one.  I've had four male dogs over the years, and none of them were particularly painful after the surgery - the difficult part was forcing them to stay quiet and rest!|`|dHg78Phdaa	man, go to your vet and get him a prescription for something strong.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you are going for your first pap smear, it is uncomfortable but not painful. They will take your blood pressure and weigh you. Then they will ask you lots of questions about your health and when your last period was. Then they have you put on a paper gown and get ready for the doctor. When the doctor comes in he may ask some questions about your health. He will discreetly check your breasts for lumps. There will always be a nurse or lady in the room with you and if there isn't and you want one, ask. Then they will put your feet in stirrups with your legs open and he will put two fingers into your vagina and push on your ovaries to check them. Then they will insert a speculum into your vagina and take a long q-tip and take a sample from your cervix. It doesn't hurt but is a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they will put a gloved finger into your anus to check to see that everything is okay there. Then it is over.<br>  <br>  During the procedure, the doctor will probably talk to you about your life or family and try to keep your mind off what he is doing. If you try hard to relax and take deep breaths, it is less uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Don't be embarrassed, it is nothing compared to giving birth and being in labor, when it seems everyone is checking your vagina.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|YNVNnI0haa	relax its not that bad<br>  <br>  <br>  your doctor will ask a lot of questions and then he will leave while you get undressed from waist down<br>  you will get on a table and put your feet in stirrups and he/she will use a speculum to open you<br>  <br>  it wont hurt<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  they will swab your cervix<br>  and then put hand in vagina and pat to check ovaries and tubes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you wont feel it<br>  not any pain<br>  <br>  just a little pressure<br>  <br>  <br>  if you are really uncomfortable tell them and they will be gentle and if needed they will stop|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	It's not so bad.

UtwcSsfpaa	First of all: have you talked to anyone about this, in person? Better yet, have you been to see your doctor so that you can get your digestive & maybe even endocrine systems checked out?<br>  <br>  Bulimia is the eating disorder that involves "binge eating" and "purging" .. In other words, you stuff yourself and then vomit, and maybe eat more and then vomit again. One could also be laxative bulimic, wherein THOSE are used to "clear the system" as opposed to vomiting. I don't think that this is as common as binge/purge/vomiting bulimia.<br>  <br>  By comparison, anorexia nervosa is the eating disorder that involves simply NOT eating. One literally starves oneself into a dangerous physical state -- even emaciation (like those starving people in Africa that so many charities show us).  Females can serious mess up their menstrual cycles (and even jeopardize their reproductive capability -- I saw this in my bulimic sister).<br>  <br>  You may want to do some checking in to www.WebMD.com  specific to eating disorders and maybe even problems with the thyroid (???)<br>  <br>  You may also think about the possiblity of an underlying emotional or mental issue (I know that when I am seriously bummed, that box of "Nilla Wafers" doesn't last long at all!)<br>  <br>  ~B'yn|`|gsyhNAiRaa	You don't have bulimia, if you did then you would force yourself to throw up after every meal and from what you have said you don't force yourself to throw up. Most likely you are an over eater that is lucky enough to have a fast metabolism.It just seems like to eat too much in one sitting and then you get severe ingestion.|`|diYZ4Maraa	You should probably visit a doctor about this issue.  Bulimia is when you binge and then intentionally purge.  It's not really sounding like that based on your description, but you should see a doctor who might be able to help you further.|`|mNVipd2Maa	It doesn't sound like bulimia because your not intentionally puking. It might be Anorexia if you go this long without eating. You should really see a doctor

(not because I'm against it, but because the police started taking it really seriously where I live and it just isn't worth the risk).<br>  The only thing that changed was I noticed how annoying some of the people I know are.  Which makes me think they were always annoying and I was just too high to notice.  <br>  Same thing with you probably, you always had these problems, but they were dulled by smoking so you didn't notice.|`|nyk6l3c5aa	I'm going through the exact same thing.<br>  Some people have it worse when they get off of it. It generally goes away after two weeks or so. I also find that I have really weird intense dreams when I stop smoking. But don't worry the anxiety lightens up after a while. If you have a really tough time getting to sleep I suggest taking some over the counter sleep aid for the first few days if you need it. Marijuana isn't THAT bad of a drug but it doesn't help people who are prone to anxiety anyways, like myself.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Marijuana isn't physically addicting, so no withdrawals.

xasDy3Vxaa	Interestingly enough, this is a common misconception of weight management.  Exercise is sort of the "hard way" of keeping your weight down.  This basic method of healthy living is as follows:<br>  *Use diet to control your weight. (To lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than you burn in a day.   A 16-year-old female with a sedentary lifestyle burns approximately 1700-2000 calories per day depending on metabolism.  Focus on eating 1200 calories per day for a safe and steady weight loss.)<br>  *Use exercise for a healthy body.  This is essential!  Do not exercise to lose weight.

YOU MUST DRINK 10 GLASSES OF WATER EACH DAY <br>  <br>  DAY ONE - All fruits except bananas. Your first day will consist of all the fruits you want. It is strongly suggested that you consume lots of melons on the first day. Especially watermelon and cantaloupe. If you limit your fruit consumption to melons, your chances of losing a lot of weight on the first day are very good. <br>  DAY TWO - All vegetables. You are encouraged to eat until you are stuffed with all the raw or cooked vegetables of your choice. There is no limit on the amount or type. For your complex carbohydrate, you will start day two with a large boiled potato for breakfast. You may top the potato with one pat of butter. <br>  DAY THREE - A mixture of fruits and vegetables of your choice. Any amount, any quantity. No bananas yet. No potatoes today. <br>  DAY FOUR - Bananas and milk. Today you eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk. This will be combined with the vegetable soup, which may be eaten in limited quantities. <br>  DAY FIVE - Today is a feast day. You will eat sprouts and paneer and tomatoes. Eat 280 grams of sprouts and paneer. Combine this with six whole tomatoes. On day five you must increase your water intake by one quart. This is to cleanse your system of the uric acid you will be producing. <br>  DAY SIX - Sprouts and paneer and vegetables. Today you may eat an unlimited amount of sprouts and paneer and vegetables. Eat to your heart’s content. <br>  DAY SEVEN - Today your food intake will consist of brown rice, fruit juices and all the vegetables you care to consume. <br>  Vegetables can be taken in the form of salad if desired. No dressing except malt, white vinegar, squeezed lemon, garlic and herbs. No more than one teaspoon of oil. Do keep way from beans ( Lima , Pinto, kidney.) because they tend to be high in calories even though they are very good for you. <br>  BEVERAGES YOU MAY CONSUME WHILE ON THE PROGRAMME. <br>  <br>  Water flavoured with lemon or lime if desired. <br>  Club soda <br>  Black coffee, No cream or cream substitute, No sugar or sweeteners. <br>  Black tea. <br>  No fruit juices before Day 7. <br>  HOW AND WHY IT WORKS. <br>  <br>  DAY ONE - You are preparing your system for the upcoming programme. Your only source of nutrition is fresh or canned fruits. Fruits are natures perfect food. They provide everything that you could possibly want to sustain life except total balance and variety. <br>  DAY TWO - It starts with a fix of complex carbohydrates coupled with an oil does. This taken in the morning for energy and balance. The rest of Day 2 consists of vegetables, which are virtually calorie free and provide essential nutrients and fibre. <br>  DAY THREE - Day 3 eliminates the potato because you are getting your calories from the fruits. Your system is now prepared to start burning the excess pounds. You will still get cravings which will diminish by Day 4. <br>  DAY FOUR - Bananas, milk and soup sound like the least desirable and strangest diet. You are in for a surprise. You will probably not eat all the bananas that you are allowed. But they are there for the potassium you will have lost and the Sodium that you may have missed during the last 3 days. You will notice a definite loss of desire for sweets. You will be surprised how easily this day will go. <br>  DAY FIVE - Sprouts and tomatoes. The sprouts are for iron and protein. The tomatoes are for digestion and fibre. Lots and lots of water purity your system. You should notice colourless urine today. You must eat 6 tomatoes. <br>  DAY SIX - Day 6 is similar to Day 5. Iron and proteins from sprouts, vitamins and fibre iron vegetables. By now your system is a total weight loss inclination. There should be a noticeable difference in the way you look from Day 1. <br>  DAY SEVEN - Day 7 finishes of the programme like a good cigar used to finish of the Victorian meal. Except it is much healthier. You have your system under control and it should thank you for the flushing and cleaning you just gave it.|`|6754f89477bc905962f8248825d52046aa	bad idea.....if it is done wrong it could kill you|`|AA11387696	i would recommend you try the high protien diet whice consist of bacon egg and yelow grapefruit juice foe breakfast...... then for lunch any kind of meat with a saled or some kind of veg and the grapfruit juice....... for dinner againe a meat and a veg and the grapefruite juice.   the thing is you can have as much meat as you wont with veg as long as you always drink the grapefruit juice with every meal.. you cant eat starchy foods such as potatoes pasta ect.. no sweets or junk foods. drink water do exercise so the wheight you lose wont turn into flab. you will feel better and have more energy. this diet is not ment to be on for long periods of time. read up on it i think it is called the high protien diet or the adkins diet. i do work and in a short period of time in about  6 weeks you will have lost 20 or 30 pounds. get off of it for a whail then start back untill you have reached you'er goal. not for people with diabetes or high blood pressure unless checked with dr. let me know how it go good luck. i dont know why more people dont try this it works if you stick to it it dont take long at all..|`|a1ab90edc46546ca80e3ccdd1bccd6a5aa	My friend had it & no I don't recommend it, she's had to have like 3-4 corrective surgeries her skin is grey and she looks sick.... here's an artical I found for you about the lap band/gastricbanding <br>  <br>  For those desperate people whose weight is dangerously out of control and have exhausted every conceivable option - diet, exercise, pills - there has, in recent years appeared a ray of hope. That glimmer has shined in the form of gastric surgery. Technology continues to evolve and the dangers associated with these procedures have been drastically reduced. Now with the introduction of Lap Band surgery, there are fewer complications than ever before. <br>  <br>  Commonly referred to as gastric banding, this operation literally places a band around the upper stomach, creating a small pocket. The objective is the same as with traditional stomach stapling, to make the stomach smaller so that less food is needed to produce a full feeling, fewer calories are consumed and ultimately weight is lost. But Lap Band surgery is a newer, less invasive alternative to the conventional method.<br>  <br>  So what exactly can be expected after Lap Band surgery? Patients can be discharged within 24-48 hours and are encouraged to move and start walking as soon as possible. Of course, some discomfort and fatigue will be likely, but under normal conditions, patients can assume regular functions within a week. Although the procedure is fairly safe, some common, and even uncommon complications may arise: infection, bleeding, slippage of the band, pouch enlargement and food intolerance. In rare instances, death is a possibility.<br>  <br>  The key to success is following the required diet, not only post-surgery but in the coming months and years. Stage one of the diet consists of clear liquids for three to four days, followed a modified liquid diet that includes protein shakes or Jell-O. Then the diet will consist of shredded or blended foods. Realistically, a patient's diet won't ever be the same. Certain foods, such as steak, fried foods, and citrus fruits, may never be well tolerated. As evidenced by the strict diet, Lap Band surgery is no miracle cure and takes discipline and effort. However, armed with a more manageable appetite, an obese person is better equipped to face the challenge.<br>  <br>  There is another extremely important element that should be considered following Lap Band surgery - emotional factors. A surgery involving the stomach can't possibly be expected to repair the troubled inner mentality that has driven this behavior for so many years. Patients should strongly consider consulting with a specialist to confront these issues. <br>  <br>  The highest expectation following surgery is, obviously, weight loss. Research has indicated that studied subjects lost 40% to 60% of excess weight in a three-year period. Nevertheless, maintaining the loss means strict adherence to the outlined diet, since overindulging will lead to weight gain. People who have received Lap Band surgery cannot become complacent and take their new weight for granted.<br>  <br>  Lap Band surgery offers new hope to people who have long suffered and struggled with the scale. While there are some clear advantages to gastric banding, it is still a serious operation and complications can, and do, occur. Therefore, it should exist as a last resort for the dangerously obese only.

If there is nothing left but the root then yes.|`|F1OIpk4daa	If it's still your "milk" (baby teeth) the dentist would have taken it out as theres no point in doing dental work when you'll have the 2nd tooth yet to come through. Are you positive it was a baby tooth?<br>  I doubt it was a perfectly normal tooth and even the slightest of cavities can go through to the root to cause an infection. Which would be the reason to do a root canal. If you are still feeling asif you've been mistreated by the dentist then go to citizens advice bureau (depends on what country you come from) they'll be able to give you free legal advice and will be able to offer you the best course of action. I hope this helps.|`|edegZuyuaa	number  one no dentest is going to kill a perfect tooth, there is something wrong with it i dont care what you write or say a root canal is performed when a problem occors  to the nerve of the tooth.  when they kill the nerve the tooth becomes brittle and it could split in two or worse.  the crown is going to protect the dead tooth.  of course you can have it pulled and look real sweet when you smile|`|jHAoT9jzaa	No. It's also not fair or right that a doctor can make a mistake and still charge.

More and more it's about $$$$ and big business.|`|tZ2TK6CHaa	Since your 21 and have a baby tooth, you need to know that a baby tooth was not meant to be in your mouth more than 12yrs.  Every time a tooth is worked on it causes stress on the nerve in that tooth.  Sometimes the nerve will come around and other times it will not.  Since it is a baby tooth. most dentist would suggest having it extracted and a bridge put in to replace it.  If it had been a permanent tooth, an endo(root canal) would have been suggested, and then a crown put on it.  The nerve in a tooth is what causes abscess, the root is just the anchor for the tooth which the nerve runs thru.  If you want to keep that baby tooth, I would ask the dentist about having a root canal done in it and crowning it only, it would be cheaper, However if you have large fillings in the teeth next to that tooth you should probably have it extracted and have the bridge done.  Hope this helps.

And doing this often will lead to weakening the muscle and might lead to many orthopedic disorders... be it any part of the body...<br>  <br>         And maybe that's the reason already your fingers have started looking crooked..

But pollen shouldn't be a big deal with lenses, ask your physician anyway.<br>  <br>  Some components of the contacts lenses and the liquid to clean and lube them may trigger an allergic reaction.|`|RISNrGoLaa	i would say not i have the fricken worst allergeys ever and even the slightest exposure to allergines they go crazy so thats the most extreme|`|uGWHH7XGaa	i think you can|`|hXJ1RvUZaa	Yes just buy alcon Naphcon A-eye allergy relief.  It is safe for contacts.  works better then prescription eye drops.|`|KehRNRcKaa	yes it shouldnt really matter|`|PwKE009uaa	No|`|vOUr1AOyaa	contacts freak me out.....no it's not because it will iritate your eyes even more|`|KRhH6oXjaa	Yeah it's safe.|`|m7EHBKYFaa	they make allergies eye drops|`|YPAn6boMaa	not really|`|BhQtlObxaa	yeah they have special contacts to deal with things like that|`|fLibBLMvaa	no|`|GfCG6Jkgaa	just carry that contact solution with you, you'll be fine
a3fBGsPaaa	practice the presentation in front of mirror.Look at yourself in the eye when you do it.|`|xAQJuNcIaa	Stage Fright is awful..and I'm afraid that I may not be much help..I suffered with it alot...there's 2 hints  that may be of assistance--1.know your presentation inside out and back the front..if you feel its weak, strengthen it...But learn it and practise,practise,practise!!!Seriously..... only time I ever felt anything other than throwing up, on stage was when I was so well rehearsed that I knew the material in my sleep.It will lend you confidence.<br>  2.I've heard this-never had the prescence of mind(when onstage)to ACTUALLY do it, but Imagine every-one in the audience is NAKED. You hear people say that all the time..try it and see if it works.<br>  That's all I got-except to say that its really hard to beat..and all tied up with a general insecurity thing, a fear of failure thing. Well my fear of failure is so strong that it kept me off the stage and I never ever knew whether or not  I was any good at it. |`|8XwL3ToUaa	You can do two things that I feel will help you with your situation,<br>  Practice, Practice in front of your family and or friends or what helped me over come my fear of speaking to a crowd of people was when saying your speech.. look directly over everyone heads and move your head from right to left as if your watching them but in reality what your doing is looking into both of the corners of the room or auditorium. It worked for me just last month..|`|MayFs9EKaa	Don't look at the people. Look above their heads, close enough that it doesn't seem your staring off into space, far enough that you don't really see their faces.
14K1Vt3Paa	Yes, Nikki it does. Have been there, done that. Stay positive. Remember. You are only one puff away from a pack a day!! Stay strong !!<br>   If you have a friend who has gone through it and won the battle, enlist his or her help in being a mentor. This I found was a great help as I was lucky enough to have my doctor offer himself for this duty. He would personally call 2 or 3 times a week enquiring of my progress. That reinforcement was incredible, just knowing he was that interested in my well being.<br>  Keep ash trays, lighters, matches out of sight. Keep your hands busy. Example while watching TV I would squeeze a soft rubber ball.<br>  The good you are thinking of outweighs the cost advantages by far. Congratulations on what you will soon say is the best thing in life you've ever done.<br>  |`|q9BItD25aa	When you feel better you may take up smoking again.  I always did.<br>  I've been smoke free for 3 months now...only because I went on Chantix. You smoke while you are taking it..and then your body will tell you it no longer wants the cigarette. They taste bad and smell even worse.  It is truly a miracle drug. The only bad part is I gained 10 lbs. which I am working on getting rid of now.<br>  Quitting cold turkey is very hard. Good luck to you...and try not to pick up those butts!!?|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	Yes, 3-5 days out is the *worst* because you're nicotine levels have just gone to zero. It will keep getting better gradually for months and months.|`|THQxmYGhaa	It gets a little easier but the desire for one will always be there .its gonna take will power|`|PUNyJ0iKaa	I got to 8 days before i give in.. =/ but if your determined then yes i reckon you will do it!!<br>  Be strong!! =]<br>  good luck!!<br>  x

G1T0dCjaaa	it sounds like your a normal teen ager worrying about things that are fine :-) lol. try chaging your clothing or instead of eating lots to try and gain weight stay on a normal balanced diet. the best thing to do though is stop worrying about it. people that worry to much are expossed to stress which can make you lose weight.<br>  <br>  just be happy in yourself and let nature shape you. my nan is the same hieght as you and she only weighs 7 stone. AND SHE'S 67 lol. <br>  <br>  enjoy your teens and worry about things like weight when your old and fat lol|`|8Z7Rl860aa	Eating disorders aren't just for overweight people. If you're shoving a huge amount of food down your throat, then yes, it could be considered an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  If you're just upset about being to skinny, however, then you can't really call it an "eating" disorder.|`|jXwHiAaWaa	i think this is more anxiety due to what people have told you.<br>  <br>  don't listen to them! just eat as you normally do, healthily that is, and you should be just right.<br>  <br>  they are probably just jealous because you are nice and slim. x|`|SAhAc8EXaa	You could go to your doctor and he/she will tell you if you need to gain weight.|`|tPFHLcisaa	I have some friends like that. It's more common than you might think. I think it is eating disorder. Although, all over us don't like everything about our bodies. Also, if it helps you to see it as a disorder and perhaps get professional help don't refrain. But eating disorder is a very vague word that comes with a lot of sterotypes. Think about it as how you feel, what it is that's getting you down about yourself. You're a beautifully in proportion. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you can get this site in America but I found this really helpful when I was puking myself. Also, there is councilling you can get just by seeing you doctor. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/switch/surgery/advice/body_mind/everyone/eating_disorders/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/switch/surgery/advi...</a><br>  <br>  if you're in the uk, there are some links there. On BBC Radio 1 on Sunday nights they do this thing called the surgery which is where this came from. Starts at 10pm so it might be a bit late for you but you can phone in or text in for advice and they have doctors and therapists there answering them. <br>  <br>  Hope that help love.<br>  xx|`|85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	i don't think you have an eating disorder, you just are really concerned and influenced by the media/what other ppl think. <br>  you probably just have a really fast metabolism, so all the food that you eat just gets burned up before i can turn into fat. all you can really do is tell youself that you look great and try to get your self esteem up  because you're porbably a really beautiful person inside and out =] <3
aqLBwJtzaa	i would say optimum nutrition why protein gold standard, and ON casein aswell as phd pharma gain(weightgainer). this would help massvily with weight training.<br>  <br>  casein in the morning and before bed<br>  protein pre-post workout<br>  pharma gain 2 scoops lunchtime<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
AA11476749	As long as you don't eat a lot of it.|`|2Y1DLQ1Faa	Yes, it is.  The easiest and safest (and most effective) way to lose weight is to just cut all of your portions in half and exercise.  It's practically guarenteed and you don't actually have to stop eating anything.|`|BzdpL4mOaa	Not really because macoroni is a carb. Not exactly.|`|CBwFn5OJaa	It's alright - just don't eat too much of it because it is very high in calories!|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Yep but no too much~
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|bvt9kvS8aa	Diet Plan:<br>  Breakfast - Oats or porragie<br>  Lunch - sandwich or soup<br>  Dinner - mash, veggies, and some fish or chicken ( grilled ) or some spinach and brown rice<br>  Snacks - try to only snack on stuff like Fruits, raisins, low<br>  sugar popsicles ect..<br>  <br>  & Heres a few weight lose tips:<br>  - No sugar or sweet stuff.. sugar turns straight to fat<br>  <br>  - Buy Low fat salt, low fat sugar or no salt or sugar would be even better.<br>  <br>  - only drink water and green tea, green tea is great its known to speed up the metabolism. Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Eat salad with no dressing. Eat no other foods. Drink only tea, coffee (no sugar added) or water.|`|zuikX8Ikaa	The pattern for losing those excess pounds is easy - consume less food and workout more - the issues arise when we actually try to put that into practice! There are plenty of stumbling blocks out there aren't there?! The sole thing which definitely worked for me was green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN.

DD6QxUURaa	You can feel hungry because your body wants to replace the sugar hit that the biscuits and galaxy bar have given you. <br>  The galaxy bar could be replaced by another meal!!<br>  Try to keep the vegetables up - peas and sweetcorn have calories so choose carrots, cabbage, green beans mashed swede, butternut squash - cut into wedges and roasted using One Cal Spray are delicious and free! - sorry I'm assuming here that you are trying to lose weight?<br>  Cut out the cashews. You can more usefully eat the calories in another more filling way. [Medium slice wholemeal bread topped with mushrooms, "fried" in one cal spray  then add bit of bovril dissolved in hot water, and 2tsp of quark or very low fat phyllie stirred in - makes a fab creamy topping]<br>  These are filling without being high in sugar. <br>  Rolled porridge oats will fill you for longer than ready-brek.<br>  If you have to eat sweet things have some sugarfree jelly, more fruit like clementines and oranges or bananas.<br>  Up the portion size - chicken leg could be very little - bulk up on the veg. <br>  Baked potatoes are very filling.<br>  Suck mints<br>  Go and do something else for half an hour - like face book/my space and if you are still hungry then, have a cup of hot chocolate.|`|q5bcTa0waa	maybe you had small portions of too many food at a time. just have one big meal of one kind . maybe it will fill u up better.
wu47J6WPaa	Nope. Mine didn't anyways. I don't think I even told my doctor actually.

SS5py9jIaa	No it doesnt bother me. Just part of life. I often have sex during her period as she seems to be more horny then. Take the tampon out and let Spanky in.. lol. Lay a towel down on heavy days... menstrual blood washes off. Make sure you use cold water to rinse any linen straight away.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Oral is OK too... just concentrate on her clitoris and you will not be tasting blood.

2NRCJgq2aa	Not most.  A small percentage - it is possible, according to the numbers.<br>  <br>  Some girls who are still virgins have no hymen at all. Also there have been some cases in which girls who have had several sexual intercources had an intact Hymen. This condition is also called as elastic hymen. A minor surgical procedure should remove the hymen is such cases as elastic hymens sometimes do cause pain during sexual intercourse.<br>  <br>  Girls who do have a hymen can break their hymen in a number of differerent ways, many times without even knowing it.<br>  Some of the non-sexual ways in which a hymen will tear are:<br>  1. Through an accident or injury.<br>  2. Horseback riding, bicycling, high jumping, gymnastics or similar sports.<br>  3. Insertion of finger or instrument by doctor during pelvic exam.<br>  4. Tampon insertion<br>  <a href="http://www.starmatrimonials.com/hymen.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.starmatrimonials.com/hymen.as...</a><br>  <br>  Since tampon availability has become ubiquitous, several authors have opined about their effect on the virginal hymen, but only one paper has scientifically addressed the subject of tampon use and clefts in the hymens of never-sexually-active adolescent girls. It naturally has become an authority used by the courts. The Emans et al. (1994) study asserts that 'for physicians testifying in court about sexual assault cases, complete clefts in adolescents cannot be attributed to prior tampon use'. On closer inspection, however, it appears that the authors have interpreted their statistical finding using a strict scientific convention (chi 2, P = 0.06 as not having statistical significance) that may mislead in a clinical or legal situation. Indeed, there is a definite possibility that tampon use compared to not having used tampons in their never-sexually-active sample was associated with an increased percentage of complete hymenal clefts (14% vs. 6%; P = 0.06). Nevertheless, clefts were found in both the sexually active and the never-active groups: 20 of their 200 never-sexually-active subjects possessed complete hymenal clefts, as did only 84 of their 100 sexually active subjects. Caution should be used by all physicians asked to testify in courts regarding possible causes of a hymenal cleft.<br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9670493" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/96704...</a>|`|inST4SlAaa	With normal use a tampon will not break the hymen. The hymen is semi-flexible and the vast majority of the time it will not tear the hymen, but it may strech it a bit <br>  <br>  Now a days girls are more active in al most all sphares of life. From sports to to jumping for fun the hymen- a very thin layer covering the vaginal opening could break so easily. And this should the hymen to break. the reasons can be due to cycling, running. playing.. etc,..|`|AUOp1j5Saa	About 40-50% of all women will have broken their hymens before sexual intercourse from any number of reasons.<br>  Bike riding, horseback riding, heavy exercise, tampon use, or any kind of rigorous activity can cause a woman's hymen to break.|`|WpqfQOTJaa	yes, inserting a you know what will break the you know what.<br>  <br>  But if you go see a doctor and he sees your you know what is broken, you can just tell him the truth, and that you haven't been having you know what.|`|OKLBCesVaa	I think its just a superstition on mens behalf!<br>  <br>  I heard it just goes away on its own, from gym classes or sport acitivity, even plain walking.<br>  <br>  If you have your period, it already broke on its own; prior to the tampon insertion.|`|BXWvqUfGaa	No. Horse riding is a common way to break your hymen at a young age, before intercourse, but the vast majority of girls will break their hymen when they lose their virginity.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	They can but most of the time they don't.  Depends on how thick yours is.|`|7096c009cbfa017c4e16a7e737f601dcaa	I don't know, but mine did.|`|eMSP740Taa	Umm..I wouldn't say that most women's hymens break before sexual activity. However, if you have been using regular tampons for a year, you have probably stretched it or injured it. I wouldn't think that it would be completely broken. They do sell tampons for virgins though. They don't go in as deep.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	I would say yours is probably already broken if you have been using tampons for a year.  This is not to say it has been completely perforated, because there still may be some hymen tissue hanging one that will cause you to bleed during your first sexual experience.|`|PW5H6wO3aa	it really depends, some people it can break from random things like playing volley ball, and others can break from tampons, and then other girls' hymens break from being finger roughly, and then of course the most common way is sex. <br>  <br>  if it is by a tampon, you will never know it.|`|r9bGsI1Baa	Depends on what your doing, a guy can break it from fingering you and you can break by putting a tampon in to try and stop that from happening use the smallest ones not huge ones|`|6cBox7eZaa	Some do but some don't <br>  It depends because everyone is different =]|`|8hrOJBEHaa	wife says yes...although every girl is different|`|VYvpDsDIaa	yes . <br>  i broke mine way before anything. i was about four-<br>  i rode my bike a lot .|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	There is so much ignorance on sexual questions. Someone is missing the boat when it comes to knowledge for people, especially young ones.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Tampons dont break hymens. But yes, lots of women tear theirs before they ever have sex for the first time. It's especially common in very athletic people. But even if it's been torn, you're still a virgin until you have sex.|`|woOeYFrEaa	Ok, here's the deal.  If you have your period, then you already have holes in your hymen, otherwise the blood could not flow out of your vagina.  If you use tampons you've probably enlarged the natural opening in your hymen.  Whether or not enough of your hymen remains for it to "break" when you have sex is anyone's guess.<br>  <br>  I decided to remain a virgin until I got married.  I'd had multiple pap smears, a couple transvaginal ultrasounds (they put a probe up there), and even surgery to remove ovarian cysts which involved medical tools inside me to stabilize my uterus during the surgery.  I asked my gyno if I'd have any problems having sex for the first time and he said no.  My first time with my husband, the pain was severe and I tore and bled a pretty impressive amount.  I would've thought nothing would have been left of my hymen.  I used tampons and rode bikes/horses, etc.<br>  <br>  So there probably isn't any way to tell if your hymen will cause you pain the first time you have sex (I'm assuming that's why you're asking).|`|hiSa7qthaa	Girls who are very active in sports or other types of activities break their hymen without performing any type of sexual activity. It's normal, don't worry about it.|`|QJHE3z1raa	it could happen after 3 tries with a tampon,<br>  not just a year specifically<br>  you miight not even brake it!|`|iFTa9FqZaa	yes, you typically break it when doing various physical activities
X55EHXeVaa	hi<br>  no it can be taken out any time, why do you want it out, unless the side effects are awful give it some time, any irregular bleeding usually settles down|`|86g1v9hWaa	You should give it some time at least 3-6 months and then you may decide to keep it to have it removed. After removal, you will be highly fertile. According to my gyno, you can get pregnant within the first few weeks after implanon removal if you do not use condom or other backup method.<br>  <br>  During 3-6 months, you body has been adjusting hormone level so that may cause irregular bleeding such as constant bleeding or No periods at all. You may experience depression or mood swings. You may feel a bit cranky. Good news is these bad negative side effects would ease up after 6 months. <br>  <br>  Some women want to have it removed right when they are experiencing these side effects within the first new months after insertion.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is you should keep it for at least 3-6 months. Most women who are patient enough to keep it up to at least  months experience positive results. I want to get it inserted too. I wouldn't mind the negative side effects as long as my hair doesn't fall or grow extra facial hair :P. I can cope up with irregular bleeding as I know it will stop.  If the constant bleeding doesnt stop at all since the day u had it inserted. Contact your doctor. Maybe its not right for you.<br>  <br>  If you are having constant bleeding and want to stop for a while. You can ask your doctor to prescribe you some pills that help stops bleeding for a while. It is safe. Please contact your doctor.  Keep it for now !

If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|2kIoIhqyaa	1. No, tampons dont make you sore afterwards unless you yank it out really hard when getting it out.<br>  <br>  2.

I started using tampons when I got my period ata age 13.<br>  <br>  They are great to use, just dont keep them in too long or you can die of toxic shock.|`|CuWjsHM2aa	1. No soreness at all. If a tampon is inserted correctly then it should not hurt. If you are having difficultly I sugesst using a brand with a plastic applicator. Also insert it after a shower or bath when you are relaxed.

I was 18 when I started using them.|`|OnDIrxNEaa	I only get sore if I've inserted it wrong, or taken it out too early.<br>  Yes I use tampons.<br>  I started using them off and on at about 15, but only used them consistently since I was about 20.|`|ghh5Hy53aa	not sore i do use them an at 13|`|Djw56Be2aa	Nope.

bvt9kvS8aa	Low carb diets do seem to be a successful way to lose weight if you can stick with them.<br>  <br>  Low carb foods are usually foods with a low glycemic index. This means, they they don't increase your blood sugar. High blood sugar is a surefire way to increase hunger.<br>  <br>  No carb foods:<br>  Meats (Fish, Poultry (remove the skin), Beef, Pork, etc.)<br>  <br>  Low carb foods:<br>  Pretty much anything that doesn't contain grains/flour or sugar. Although there are plenty of exceptions. :)<br>  <br>  Both Atkins and South Beach have massive lists of acceptable foods for all of their phases. These lists are a great guideline even if you don't want to follow either diet.<br>  <br>  If you do end up going with a low carb diet plan, I'd suggest South Beach over Atkins. It's a tad bit more lenient. Especially after induction.<br>  <br>  The best non-mechanized lower back exercises I've encountered are yoga poses or physical therapy strengthening exercises.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple:<br>  <br>  Physical Therapy 1<br>  1) Lie on back, left knee bent.<br>  2) Tighten abdominals and buttocks, keeping back in neutral position.<br>  3) Raise right leg 12 inches, knee straight.<br>  4) Hold 3 counts<br>  5) Lower leg.<br>  <br>  Repeat 10 times.<br>  Progress to making circles and squares with raised leg.<br>  <br>  =-=-=-=-=<br>  Yoga 1<br>  1) Lie on your back.<br>  2) Bend your knees, placing feet flat on the ground. Inhale.<br>  3) Raise your right leg up.<br>  4) Exhaling, place your hands around the shin. If that is not possible place your hands around your thighs.<br>  5) Hold for a few seconds.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

The most popular mass builder is the bench press (which I don’t see enough women doing at the free weights area). The machine chest press works fine too, but free weights do have their advantages in terms of adding variety to a dull routin and effectiveness, especially if you’ve been dependant on machines for too long. As intimidating as it may look, this is not a ‘men-only’ exercise. Try the bench press with either barbells or dumbbells.<br>  <br>  2. Ensure you also include inclined presses into your chest workout. If you’re female, inclines help to keep your chest up and if you’re male - it will keep you from looking like you have man boobs!<br>  <br>  3. Try the Butterfly:<br>  - Lay on the bench/floor/flat ground and hold the weights to your side in your hands when you lay down.<br>  - Now, lift the weights as if you’re trying to meet your hands over top of your chest (imagine you’re hugging a tree trunk, which means don’t bend your elbows too much)<br>  - Hold the peak contraction at the top for a few seconds then return to the start position fully in control of the weights, and repeat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Found this on a website~  Good Luck~|`|b62b41b49e2ed2438ad3e0ce840b8713aa	bench press 3 sets of 15 at a lower weight...start at a small weight and work your way up...or the fly bench press (same amount of reps at the bench press) start with something small like a set of 5 lb free-weights...|`|b9EUvON3aa	WOW...

79d557802b74d7404ebf0c0f659e8b52aa	Hi Amy,<br>  <br>  Kettlebells are an incredibly versatile fitness tool.  They are highly portable and can be utilized for many different training goals including fat loss, strength endurance, limit strength, everyday fitness, rehabilitation, and joint strengthening.<br>  <br>  A lot of the exercises that utilize kettlebells are not really new to fitness, but they do utilize several linked muscle groups developing strength for everyday movements.  i.e. bending and lifting objects, lifting objects overhead, as opposed to traditional bodybuilding exercises.  (When is the last time you did curls in your everyday life?)<br>  <br>  Because you utilize several big muscle groups in each exercise, you can get a full body workout in a minimal amount of time.  In 20 minutes, I can put together a workout that will leave you thoroughly worked out.<br>  <br>  Portability.  You can take your kettlebell with you when you travel. (I bungee cord mine in my 53lb in my trunk when I go on multi-day car trips)  You can take it outside and workout out in the fresh air and grass.  If you live in an apartment setting, it takes very space to store.<br>  <br>  You only need 1 or 2 for a great fitness program.  You can own only one and setup your program to utilize it very effectively.  You may eventually want 2 different sizes or doubles, but you can get 90% of a great program with just one.<br>  <br>  They are great for women.  There are a lot of lower body exercises that are ballistic in nature, meaning you're doing high reps with a weight, which will give you fat loss and toning in the same exercise.  The exercises that utilize kbs link muscles groups which include the hips, butt, and hamstrings.  Kettlebells are great for toning that area.<br>  <br>  I guess you can say I love them.. ;-)<br>  <br>  John Starego<br>  Kettlebell Inc.|`|0RGt9r2aaa	i love them<br>  there so much fun and so versitile<br>  you can do cardio and strength and i like them better than dumbells<br>  go for the class its bunches of funn
G1T0dCjaaa	my brother has ADHD and when social services got involved they basically took him out and did activities with him. helping him to get out his energy. they also gave him the undivided attention that he needed to satisfy him and stop him being so in-you-face at home. however if you feel that the social isn't really helping him you could always try doing some sort of sport with him, or just playing with him for at least an hour a day (if you can). my parents had a hell of a job with him when he was younger but he's 17 now and one of the nicest and quietest people anyone would ever want to meet. i know people slag the social off but ultimately they are only trying to help.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	It forces them to pay attention? It doesn't do anything. Why (or how) could they?|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	Hi, Im glad you asked. Social Services helps families with ADHD problems providing them with various resources. One of those resources is a psychologist and in many cases, they also provide a psychiatrist to prescribe medications to help with the condition. They should help you. Its their job.
HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|MuRzzoq3aa	hi, well its hard to know what u look like as to weight but if u want to lose it u have to work very hard on this it not fun an its very hard ok ,well first u need to weight yourself to see what u want to lose then ,just start by running around ur block an then just do sits up an push ups, sqacks,start by doing 10-15 a day moring an night ,then rest one day workout  oneday rest eat right like fish an other vegegs,an water but not to much an then run an weight ur self every two days just to see what u lose ok bye 4 now|`|AxImXRK5aa	Walk. Everywhere. Or cycle if it's a bloody long way (like to work etc).<br>  <br>  When you feel like fast food, eat fruit that you love.<br>  <br>  Don't eat after 8 pm.<br>  <br>  Make your own vegetable soup. Loads of tomatoes/greens etc.<br>  <br>  Then when all else is done, indulge in lots (and I mean LOTS) of sex. And as energetic and as vigorous as you can. But remember to get plenty of sleep (minimum 7 hrs/night).|`|2wUq0LI9aa	Learn how to drop 10 lbs fast and easy <br>  with no exercises, pills, potions or lotions..|`|BYWDIhuLaa	run boy run|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I drink hebal tea if I'm feeling hungry between meals. <br>  <br>  Try to make the most of your time off of work.

Try to get around 7 hours of sleep and drink lots of water.  <br>  <br>  If you're doing everything the healthy way, then you're doing it right.

I'm sure that it is common for most to have the jealousy thing.<br>  Anyway, you don't have to be good at anything to be liked or a good person.  It might make it easier to meet new people, as being superior at things gives you more opportunities.<br>  I could be that these people are just extremely good friends and family telling you things to make you feel better, to take the edge off a bad performance or you not getting into a special school.|`|2Hm9kWoFaa	It's good that you're aware of this.<br>  You know deep down that you need to stop yourself being jealous.<br>  Just be happy for the other person. And happy for yourself for what you have achieved.<br>  But above all, you need to be confident in being the person you are. You don't need to be perfect. Nobody is. Just accept yourself and the talents you have. If you don't feel proud of yourself, you can't expect others to.

3CxtflUsaa	Obviously, you'd get pregnant.<br>  <br>  I hope someone explained birth control to you. <br>  <br>  If you're taking the pill, you will get your period at the last week. Those are actually sugar pills and not hormones. Don't skip a few days and then take them all at once. You need a steady stream of hormones for the pill to be affective. <br>  <br>  If you're talking about condoms, they'll be a break in them.

aFV5KvvSaa	It's quite vague.<br>  <br>  Do you just feel sad + lonely at the moment, or generally?<br>  If just at the moment, I would suggest going to bed. Do your coursework tomorrow. Being tired makes you feel utterly lousy.<br>  <br>  Actually, even if you feel like this generally, I would suggest working on your sleeping patterns (as well as eating healthily), and doing some exercise. You might start to feel a lot better.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the coursework :)|`|zym14EeJaa	I think when feeling lonely, sad and low. Which we all feel at times. The best thing to do is do something that you love and always puts a smile on your face. For the time being forget about your coursework, come back to it later when you are feeling up to it. Go out with someone who you love spend timing with go to a club, a bar, the movies and don't think about all the depressing areas in life. Because I think when we have too much time to think we all feel lonely, we all start criticizing ourselves, but what is the point? Saying you feel lonely won't make a room full of people appear to entertain you. You need to go out and find that room of people. Your a great person let other people see that! Go out and enjoy yourself! Life is too short!:)|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	We all feel sad at times. However, the best thing you can do is get motivation from something or someone. Look for something to look forward to. Make plans, get involved in some sort of activity that you like. You can also look for a boyfriend. That usually gives us motivation to get things done.|`|TeailU2iaa	I used to face the same problem too. I don't know why you are sad.... if you are really sad of something which can be fixed then you should fix it first, and then you can focus your mind on your course work.<br>  <br>  If the reason for your sadness if not fixable then you should be brave and bold and try to keep it aside. I think once you start your course work your sadness will be gone at least till the time you are working on your course work.........<br>  <br>  Cheer up start working............time is precious.......once you start working your sadness will soon be gone. Here's a link which will cheer you up......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5z4Vs26-TI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5z4Vs26-...</a>|`|Laxg0RBNaa	listen to music|`|1oBilGHuaa	Reach out and talk to someone.  Find someone to give you a big hug.<br>  We are here on Yahoo Mental Health.  We can't hug you but we can answer your questions.  Invite a friend over to study with.  Being lonely also makes me sad.  I hope you will be able to get your coursework finished.  Best Wishes to you.|`|AA12050428	Think first about why you are sad. Is it because of the Coursework?  Are you finding it too difficult?   Do you need something to spark you off to get started or is it someone else who is making you sad?<br>  Examine your feelings closely. Haven't you anyone you can talk to?<br>  Try a bit more on here if that helps.  There are a lot of very kind understanding people who have probably had similar experiences<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
dpgXzMenaa	Women's genitals come in all shapes, sizes and colours... and they go through a lot of changes in all three during puberty.  It's all determined by the genes the woman in question was given 9 months before she was born... and in women who've given birth, some of the colour changes during pregnancy end up being permanent.<br>  <br>  Some have big, puffy outer lips and tiny little inner ones that can't even be seen without spreading their legs and outer lips both... some have smallish outer lips and inner lips that stick out firmly from them or hang... some have one or both lips in two "parts"...some have one lip that's one shape and the other lip is completely different... some have pink, purple or dark brown inner lips... some have pale or dark outer lips... some have really big or really little clitorises. <br>  <br>  Knowing and accepting your unique "genital geography" isn't something mothers usually pass along to their daughters... but it's something every woman should learn.<br>  <br>  Every single set of women's genitalia shown at... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva/m_vulva.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva/m_vu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thumb008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thumb009.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thumb010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thumb011.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/y/vulva2/thu...</a><br>  <br>  ... is perfectly normal... and it's very unlikely that yours are *not* perfectly normal, so you should get to know them well and learn to love them. They're a very important part of what it means to be *you*.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sources:<br>   36 years of seeing many women's "down theres" up close and personal. Every one was different, and *all* of them were lovely.|`|pexxZB8Daa	OMG that's happened to me too! I think it's normal, at least i hope so!|`|7utsLRfyaa	extended labia<br>  horrible i know but like there are only a small percentage of women out there who have symmetrical vaginas<br>  nothing to worry about<br>  guys dont even notice|`|HzCBOwlyaa	omg! lol lol how old are you?<br>  <br>  The fleshy area located just above the top of the vaginal opening is called the mons pubis. Two pairs of skin flaps called the labia (which means lips) surround the vaginal opening. The clitoris, a small sensory organ, is located toward the front of the vulva where the folds of the labia join. Between the labia are openings to the urethra (the canal that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) and vagina. Once girls become sexually mature, the outer labia and the mons pubis are covered by pubic hair.<br>  <br>  The vagina is a muscular, hollow tube that extends from the vaginal opening to the uterus. The vagina is about 3 to 5 inches (8 to 12 centimeters) long in a grown woman. Because it has muscular walls, it can expand and contract. This ability to become wider or narrower allows the vagina to accommodate something as slim as a tampon and as wide as a baby. The vagina's muscular walls are lined with mucous membranes, which keep it protected and moist.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	lol you're not half guy. A lot of girls' labia minora are longer than their labia majora, meaning that there's some skin that sticks out. It's totally normal and very common :)|`|vooQPKTdaa	that could be your hymen, it could have popped<br>  or it could be just an bit of skin dont worry about it hun !|`|BTvRNrRLaa	sounds really nice your obv not half a guy if u have a whole vagina but some men including myself could consider it a turn on that its extended .|`|YzaqI9BJaa	Every Vagina is different|`|936dFoLeaa	I agree with the extended labia.

WDRO9vn9aa	You can do like jogs every once in a while like 1 mile one day and try 2 after the first 3 weeks, hit the gym, get a trainer, eat and drink weight loss foods, and just sorta watch what you eat try to minimize it|`|G1lSbvAQaa	You Spell bad....|`|B7jaxWCCaa	don′t people usually charge for this kind of information|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)
N9nJWYa5aa	If you are doing this in the afternoon/evening then:<br>  <br>  You'll need a snack say 30 mins before your work out.  A palm full (not a hand full) raisins is an ideal pre-workout snack.  Then have your dinner after the workout!.|`|Bbe8U9r2aa	omg to 5! wow thats crazy yehh after dinner like 7-8 is okay

yna24Nbuaa	Go to the doctor. That needs to be checked out. It could have something to do with your vaginal ph.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Vaginal discharge is completelely normal. That's the vagina's way of cleansing itself. Some women have more than others. As long as it's not accompanied by other symptoms like burning, itching or odor then you have nothing to worry about. If it bothers you, try wearing a pantyliner.|`|rcHnA1iQaa	it happen es to me too I think it's  normal but i'm not certain|`|RTHWQvkzaa	OMG I absolutely HATE that too! I get it constantly, and it is the most annoying in public or at shcool where you can't do anything about it. Yeah I think it's normal. But it is just so not fair. I am like walking down the hallway and it starts to feel like I wet my underwear or something. It's like you can't ignore it! I guess we'll just have to go get through it :-) (Oh and BTW I am 12 turning 13 in June) <br>  <br>  Don't worry- remember you aren't the only one! It happens to me too!<br>  <br>  And it is definately unfair :-)|`|FWWegktKaa	I get that too and I just wear a pantyliner all the time because I don't think there is a way to get rid of it!<br>  Sorry about that.<br>  So long as it's not a funny colour or a funny smell it's fine and you just have to live with it.

5SCMfucFaa	but anyway, also consider that you burn an enormous amount of calories through normal activities, including any kind of physical activity and all natural processes taking place within your body, so saying that you have to exercise away 3500 calories is ridiculous, since processes such as homeostatic mechanisms and digestion are doing most of that for you even while you exercise|`|qeR967J7aa	survival metabolism.  Our bodies will slow their metabolism if we don't eat.  So anorexia doesn't work.  Also very unhealthy;  can be life threatening.|`|LkcP0l0taa	You have to take into account that your body burns about 1500 calories a day just living. So if you burn 500 calories with exercise, that's 2000 burned for the day. <br>  <br>  If you cut your calorie intake by 500 and burn 500 with exercise, that's 1000 calories you burned in a day. If you did that everyday, you'd lose about 2 lbs a week.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you stop eating all together and "become anorexic", your metabolism will screech to a halt and your body will hold onto anything that you do it because your body will go into starvation mode. Any weight that you do weight will mostly just be water weight, and you will gain it back in one day of eating normal.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is cut back on your intake and do some exercise. Slowly but surely, the weight will come off, and it will stay off.
bvt9kvS8aa	Diet Plan:<br>  Breakfast - Oats or porragie<br>  Lunch - sandwich or soup<br>  Dinner - mash, veggies, and some fish or chicken ( grilled ) or some spinach and brown rice<br>  Snacks - try to only snack on stuff like Fruits, raisins, low<br>  sugar popsicles ect..<br>  <br>  & Heres a few weight lose tips:<br>  - No sugar or sweet stuff.. sugar turns straight to fat<br>  <br>  - Buy Low fat salt, low fat sugar or no salt or sugar would be even better.<br>  <br>  - only drink water and green tea, green tea is great its known to speed up the metabolism. Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.

00IZYVjsaa	When my sister and I go running in the morning, we usually eat just a little bit of food before we run. Such as a piece of toast, yogurt, an apple, or anything else small just to get your metabolism working. Make sure not to eat too much, and try not to run right after you eat; usually 20 minutes or a half hour should be fine.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|imaeJ3o3aa	if you have some sort of protein shake or similar about half an hour before you run this will help, eating after you run will replace the expended energy levels though.<br>  To build muscle you really need to target the muscles more specifically, ie; weights.

Then, instead of your last one being the 28th (a saturday), it'll be the 30th (a monday)... <br>  It doesn't have to start sunday... It can start ANY day... So just take one a day, every day, starting tommorow and take ALL of them. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Taking 3 in one morning is WAY too much.

Fructose has a low glycemic index, which means that it takes a long time for the body to break down, resulting in a slow release of sugar, rather than a sudden rush. yes in this case it would be bad, cause doesnt matter how good the sugar is, sugar is sugar and must be avoided at all times, especially when on a diet.|`|P5NR3Euoaa	the sugar is from the apple. the people who make it don't add sugar to it, it comes from the fruit. so its not as bad as something thats sweetened because the sugar comes from the apple. but still that is a lot of sugar.|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	Apple juice has natural sugars.

You need to gradually ease your way back to solid food after having completed a couple of extra days of juices. <br>  <br>  Days One and Two After Your Cleanse<br>  Drink several glasses of fresh orange juice (8 oz) throughout the day. The orange juice will prepare the digestive tract to be able to once again properly digest and assimilate solid foods. Don’t gulp it — drink it nice and slow. If you have any difficulties during the transition increase the amount of water.<br>  <br>  During the afternoon of day two prepare yourself some vegetable broth. This should not be canned soup that’s full of preservatives, rather make yourself some fresh homemade soup.<br>  <br>  Days Three and Four<br>  Drink orange juice in the morning, for lunch eat raw fruit, and at night eat fruit and/or vegetable salad. No eggs, fish, meat, pastries, bread, milk, tea, or coffee. Milk causes mucus and creates toxins in the body, and it’s known to cause problems in the stomach and colon…<br>  <br>  Day Five<br>  You can eat normally now. Though, you should have your glass of lemon and eat fruit, vegetables, berries, or seeds for breakfast — nothing else. <br>  It’s highly recommended that you begin to take Probiotics after breaking your cleanse. This will replace the good bacteria that was removed when you cleansed the colon. The good bacteria keeps the gut balanced and it also produces Vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B12, and K. Don’t take the Probiotics while you cleanse. They’ll just get pulled out of your body.<br>  <br>  During your cleanse is the time to start to retrain your brain about your eating habits. You’ve got a fresh slate, why not take advantage of it, and begin to live a healthier life, and what you eat is the place to start.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dUj7rP2haa	Cleansing systems are pretty much scams.

Good Luck.s|`|DsEEATKSaa	You cannot be seen by a psychiatrist without your parents' consent for treatment.<br>  <br>  The wise approach is to simply ask your parents to phone their insurance company to inquire about coverage and about who is on their provider panel. Get a list of 3-5 adolescent psychiatrists in your area. Be prepared to wait for an appointment. In some areas, the wait is lengthy. In others, you may be able to get an appointment relatively quickly.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|zym14EeJaa	You should not be ashamed of saying it to your parents, because it is nothing to be embarrassed about and you are very brave at the young age of 13 to seek help.

Its the best thing to do, because often school councilors are useless, hope everything works out okay for you. Good Luck!|`|Cb0bdPdxaa	Hello, talk to your parents about going to a COUNSELOR or a PSYCHOLOGIST. You cannot go to a Psychiatrist unless you are recommended by a Psychologist.

Remember before going on any weight loss program, consult a physician.
gGlUo2eAaa	Well there are a variety of ways you can do this. Try to cut down on what you eat at lunch, by perhaps eating something about an hour before. This will help to prevent you from getting too hungry and will therefore lessen the chances of your craving to binge. Alternatively, try eating more slowly, as this can give you the time your body needs to let you knwo that you're full before you over-eat. Try to set your self goals, for example, instead of eating a piece of pizza, i will eat an apple. Not only is this better for you, but it will help you to stop binging quite so much. Finally, you could try chewing on gum, which can stop you eating too much as your mouth is occupied by chewing and therefore you may feel less likely to eat?

The protein structure doesnt change because of cooking it.|`|RKMgokm6aa	Nutritional value is going to be essentially the same, although chemically it's altered a bit due to the cooking. The advantages are nowhere close to the risks of eating raw eggs (salmonella, food poisoning) which can potentially leave you out of the gym for days and unable to keep anything down. Essentially what the means is a lot of weight lost because you were sick, unable to eat, and unable to train. Be smart, and cook your damn eggs!|`|DumwR7l0aa	Well a large egg weighing 46g should give out around 6-7g of protein when fried. A raw egg weighing 17g gives around 3g of protein per shot. So if you work it out roughly, yes a raw egg is a little more protein, but as for the taste, id rather drop that extra gram of protein it gives me and put a nice egg in a piece of wholemeal bread for the added nutrition, whatever works for you is what you should be judging it on.|`|4gC38fKsaa	never raw, you can get salmonilla poisoning.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	No, an egg is still an egg no matter how it is cooked.

I take a gallon of milk, take out about 16 oz of milk.   Put in about 8 oz Hershey's chocolate syrup, then I put in 16 scoops of protein.  I blend this in a blender jar first using about 16 ounces of the milk, 8 oz of chocolate syrup and then the protein powder.  when it's blended well, then I put it back into the gallon of milk and shake it up ever morning when I am ready for my protein!!<br>  <br>  It's easy, settles a little, but just needs a little shaking.<br>  <br>  Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	Pre-mixing the powder will make it separate and get chunky.

Eat smaller portions more often, and drink a lot of water.  Most people can lose 10 pounds by super hydrating alone, which is on week one, drink 4 litres of water per day, and every week after that increase the amount of water by .5 litres until you are drinking 6 litres of water a day, you need to ease into it though, you can not just start off drinking 6 litres.  Sometimes belly's can be bloated when you're under-hydrated because your body is storing water in case it doesn't see water again soon, if you super hydrate your body knows it is going to get the water it needs every day, so it releases the extra water it is storing|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	You can get a tummy tuck or lipo. <br>  <br>  Otherwise you'll just have to work out and eat right and let yourself lose weight.

This would actually gain weight if you get muscle obviously, but it's still making it smaller in size and not all fat.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.|`|a1pmr73vaa	protein shakes and tons of wild salmon and portions of junk food not over eat or else you will bloat lol!|`|utObT8QAaa	I would take the mix-in protein powder, but even better, more weight training. Eat eggs a lot, but also don't eat too many it has a lot of cholesterol as well, and try for chicken breast, and turkey, it has more protein than most foods, and avoid the usual hamburger and other stuff, but essentially, eat things that have a lot of protein and definitely tuna tuna will be the highest protein food. If you eat nothing but tuna, and do weight training that will definitely help you bulk up.

For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic: <br>  <br>  “Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/strengthtrainingforyoung.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...</a><br>  <br>  NSCA position on resistance training for youth.<br>  <a href="https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/Y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/downlo...</a><br>  <br>  While you won’t stunt your growth lifting weights, you can be injured.  It is very important to get instruction in proper lifting technique.  If you don’t have an adult to instruct you, get this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-Young-Athletes-Faigenbaum/dp/0736002189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225944504&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-You...</a>|`|qeR967J7aa	Definately not!  Eat a good diet.|`|iRbrReXxaa	that depends on the age in which you do them and how much you are planning on lifting.  Too much weight can cause the gaps between your bones to narrow thus limiting the the distance your body would grow into.|`|9SXnUOb3aa	you've probably finished it.
I4x74tZraa	Creatine causes your muscles to retain water, and you will gain a considerable amount of weight that is just from the water retention. If you stop taking creatine you will lose the water weight and the bulk, but not the muscle. If I were you, I would stay on it as long as it doesn't give you any problems.
gULNGNkFaa	First of all, you did not ruin anything. If you are attempting to eat healthily that's what matters. Second, it's okay to eat red meat once in a while, unless your doctor puts you on some sort of a strict diet due to cholesterol problems or something like that. Take your new eating style one day at a time. Even if you eat a treat once in a while it's not something to be ashamed of. The number of calories we need depends on our age, sex, and activity levels.

ygcbrp5Uaa	It's nothing to worry about. I was like that when I first started my period.<br>  <br>  At first, I couldn't even fit the smallest tampon in because of the pain, so I used pads at first. Then as my body started to develop more, I was able to wear them, but it still wasn't enough, so I had to wear a pad also. That went on for a couple of years, but now it's not a problem.<br>  <br>  It's really nothing unusual. Your body goes through different stages, and your periods will very from month to month. Some periods you can get away with wearing a light tampon, while others you'll have to double up for. <br>  <br>  (Sorry, but for this stage in your life, there's really no escaping the pad.... To make it a bit easier on yourself, try wearing the ones that are kind of wide and flat with wings. They don't have as much of a diaper feeling as the others do.)<br>  <br>  As you get older though, your body will change to accommodate larger tampons, so for now, don't worry. Things will work themselves out.|`|HzCBOwlyaa	o.b. sport! they are very very tiny they dont have the applicator so you might get freaked out when you see them , they dont leak , they dont hurt they feel like your not even wearing them.|`|EMbaak9waa	You could change them more often and wear a panty liner for extra protection.|`|f280030b5c3fd08f70ea29f8d59505d5aa	did you do something? have sex? get hurt/ you may have a rash idkk, you hsould get that checked out. all i can tell you, is maybe something is going wrong. so just wear pads, until you see a doctor, you can try to wear tampons, and see if it hurts, but if it continues, consult a doctor|`|nZsHSKhjaa	hmmm...maybe wear pantie liners with the smaller ones and just change them more often.|`|p9GHfOloaa	sorry cant help u there|`|TkmHDaoTaa	hi i really probally can't help you too much because im only 12 but i tried using a tampon for the heavy period the other day and im with you they kill im soo glad that my period ended but in 3 weeks it will come agaion i use some called tampax and i do have some leaks i have the feeling of pads to but if thats what you have to do then do it i have an extremly heavyperiod(almost went through a tampon two pads pants and almostthe whole sweatshirt) sorry but i can't really help!!<br>  hope i helped as much as i could=]|`|Ui7WuDrJaa	OB has some tampons that come WITHOUT the applicator, they've always seemed thiner and smaller to me, even the regular and super ones. Maybe you could try that, the only downside of it is that you'll have to use your fingers to insert it, which should be a small price to pay to avoid leaks and pain.<br>  Best|`|EcXpNneIaa	Tampons are safe but.

bvt9kvS8aa	Diet Plan:<br>  Breakfast - Oats or porragie<br>  Lunch - sandwich or soup<br>  Dinner - mash, veggies, and some fish or chicken ( grilled ) or some spinach and brown rice<br>  Snacks - try to only snack on stuff like Fruits, raisins, low<br>  sugar popsicles ect..<br>  <br>  & Heres a few weight lose tips:<br>  - No sugar or sweet stuff.. sugar turns straight to fat<br>  <br>  - Buy Low fat salt, low fat sugar or no salt or sugar would be even better.<br>  <br>  - only drink water and green tea, green tea is great its known to speed up the metabolism. Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|xol0rAjLaa	Eat ur Vegetables!|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)|`|RlLtRvYoaa	Hi  The best way I found to lose weight was to start with a short walk everyday to begin with and then once a week jog the same route. At the same time drink at least 2 litres of water a day and always use the stairs whenever posible. Eat at least 1 apple and 1 banana a day and increase the amount of milk you drink. If you want a quick burst of weight loss you will need some help. I got some Acai Berry free at <a href="http://linkbee.com/ITRR" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/ITRR</a> and I used that and saw about 20lbs come off very fast using all these thngs together. Good luck!|`|olopisx7aa	Burn off more calories than you take in.<br>  Stay away from fried foods and fast foods.<br>  Common sense stuff like put veggies in your diet and don't snack on potato chips or candy bars.

Do at least 20 mins and take your heart rate. <br>  <br>  You need to burn more calories than you take in. Try to keep a journal of what you eat, and their calorie amounts. You can google many sites for this info.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest NOT starving yourself as this will actually make you gain weight. Your body will go into starvation mode and store anything you eat as fat, so it will have somethng for energy later on. Of course, if you stop eating altogether, you will cause your body more harm than you will notice. Losing weight too fast will also cause you harm, primarily to the liver is your body can't flush the fat fast enough. This is called fatty liver.<br>  <br>  So, go slow and steady and listen to your body. Otherwise, you may do more harm than good.
6e0PG4YWaa	I know it's hard.  I went through a very similar situation with one of my good friends.

That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment.

I'm 5'3 1/2 and I weighed in at 195. I really wanted to lose the weight before summer. It was already the end of March (2008). Then I looked on a billboard and seen this woman who said she lost 35lbs in 45 days. Of course, I didn't believe it. Somehow my mind wouldn't let it go, so I drove back and got the number. I called the office and set up an appointment with their physician. The program consisted of 2 HCG hormonal injections in the stomach a week. You could take them home and give them to yourself. Also, for maximum weight loss you could take the pills, which are 37.5 mg of Phentermine. SO...I went full force. The phentermine suppressed my appetite to where food didn't seem so appealing. But, I had to eat. Around 1200 calories a day. By June(2008) I stopped the routine and meds. I had lost 45 lbs. I felt so great. I wore bikinis and halter tops. I didn't have any loose skin because I did sit-ups and crunches. About 100 a day in 2 sets. Now it's March 2009 and I have yet to gain a pound back. As of yesterday my total weight loss is 50lbs. I've been running on the treadmill 4 times a week to make sure I don't end up where I started. lol<br>  <br>  You can google your state and type HCG Injections to see if there are any clinics that offer those services.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|21dxo8rXaa	salads for breakfast lunch and dinner and walking 60 minutes a day

HuGF2h2Laa	You will not lose weight the healthy way, if you do that.<br>  <br>  Diet coke does not equal weight loss, there's so much sh*t in it already, it's so bad for you. Even milk, dairy products, meats, are fattening and harden your arteries.<br>  <br>  The proper way to lose weight is to incorporate more vegetables, fruits, and nuts into your diet. Don't have 3 set meals a day, eat maybe 5 or 6 small meals. This will have your stomach constantly working so nothing just sits there, that's how you gain weight. <br>  <br>  Slimfast shakes are pretty bad, too. Anything that's marketed into commercials to make you think you're going to get "slim, fast" is just a scam in order for the company to make money. It doesn't really work.<br>  <br>  Have small breakfasts, a few lunch things to eat, and a couple small meals in the evening. Don't eat 2 hours before bed, this will gain weight on your body as well.<br>  <br>  Also sweating is a great way to lose weight- something as simple as sitting in a sauna, three days a week (for maybe 30 minutes) will lose you 10 pounds in a month. <br>  <br>  Hope this guides you in the right direction!|`|fPbjSNEHaa	That is not enough food ... first of all you are having no breakfast (most important meal of the day) and hardly anything to eat through out the day. You will not have sufficient energy for your weights and spin sessions.

And ensure you have a good balanced diet.|`|tvsfvWKKaa	you have to make sure you get enough calories, to burn calories...sounds crazy right?

2UzvWNMSaa	I don't know what a good weight for you may be because you did not list your height.  Being blessed with a high metabolism means that you "burn" calories (the energy in food) very quickly.  You should make sure that you stay active, eat healthy and calorically dense food, and stay away from junk food (which has little nutrition for the calories and won't help your body grow.)  Try to eat about 6 times a day, making sure that you have something from all 4 food groups. You can talk to your school nurse for advise.  If you are really concerned, have your parents take you to a doctor or a nutritionist.|`|dUj7rP2haa	First off without knowing your hight we can't tell you how much you should weigh.  Two, you're still young... you will grow.  Third, don't every let your body keep you from doing things you enjoy no matter what it looks like.  It's very likely few other people even notice and you'll miss out on a lot.|`|lFOnAeleaa	You are quite a bit under weight but it also depends on your height.<br>  Metabolism, im guessing thats what you meant, is the rate in which you burn calories.

6gthdHpnaa	Don't do unhealthy things to lose weight. 144 pounds is not fat, just try to be healthy and exercise, not necessarily to lose weight. Starving yourself will not work in the long run for weight loss and Disney Channel would probably turn you down if you had starved yourself to lose weight, because they don't want young kids to see that. Plus, not all actresses are super skinny, they're more real-looking so the TV show or movie looks more realistic. Don't change yourself to fit some ideal you have thought up. <br>  I really don't think it's a good idea to just go and audition for a HUGE thing like Disney Channel, though. Start small, audition for school plays and see if your town has a drama club or anything similar. Once you have some experience, you'll be better prepared for an agent and stuff like that. Acting is not about being famous.|`|sWahw84Haa	Atkins diet is really fast. Just eat nothing but protein. Not one bit of carb, not even veggies, fruit or bread. Just stick with white chicken breast, fish, cheese, some red meat, protein shakes, and anything else with no carb. Downside is always hungry, some drowsiness, and bathroom irregularities. With some light cardio (jogging) you can lose a pound a day.<br>  <br>  Or you can do the next easiest thing by getting the flu. Works for me every time. I lose 10 pounds in a week every time I get sick.|`|9lStxLbeaa	nick, I recently tried a hole bunch of different weight loss programs I found a few that really worked well for me and I wrote a review so I can try to help some of the other people here looking to loose weight take a look.          <br>  <br>  <a href="http://myreviewproducts.com/weightlossreview/" rel="nofollow">http://myreviewproducts.com/weightlossre...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps,

C8DOT8Y7aa	Consume healthy foods and do not skip meals. Eat three meals each day and some healthy snacks if you get hungry. Your blood sugar level will be steady, and you will not feel as hungry. <br>  Eat at the table, not standing up. Have one specific place you will eat all your meals (unless you are out with friends). This keeps you from eating food mindlessly in front of the TV. Take time to chew, count to 30 for each bite. Chewing more can help you lose weight. You will find that you will get full faster, and will not have to eat as much. Remember that it takes at least 20 minutes to actually notice that you're full or not hungry anymore. Try not to overeat, when you feel satisfied stop eating. and don't let yourself eat anymore if your not finished. <br>  When you snack, choose healthy fruits and vegetables rather than candy or chips. Or, if you really hate veggies, get some fat free dressing to go with it, or instead opt for the new low-fat chips that have recently appeared these days. Light yogurt helps boost up your metabolism and tastes great. Popcorn, minus added salt or butter, are excellent munchies. It is full of fiber, will fill you up, and tastes good. <br>  Walk as much as you can (the average person burns about six calories per minute walking). Try to walk at least one mile a day to start. Each day walk a little further. Walk at a brisk pace, and if you find you are getting out of breath then slow down. In the beginning it is more important that you at least walk, rather than walk fast. Take the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Dance by yourself to the music on the television or your MP3 player. Any movements will make you lose weight, so have fun and dance your way to a thinner you! <br>  Exercise. It doesn't matter if you lift weights, walk around your neighborhood, swim, or jog on a treadmill, you will lose weight, as long as you exercise 3-4 days a week, and burn more than your calorie intake. If you don't have a treadmill, find a pool, walk into waist deep water, and run in place, this burns just as many calories as running on a treadmill. <br>  Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. You probably don't have to drink that much, but many think that there's nothing wrong with it. You do not have to drink them down all at once, but keep sipping all day. Do whatever is comfortable and convenient for you, as long as you drink that amount of water. This will help you feel more full.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anything you drink will contain calories, but drinking only water is boring, and becomes a chore. Simply taking in more fluids daily will improve your health and digestion immensely. Fruit and vegetable juices will add sugars and calories, but they'll also add nutrients and anti-oxidants. Go for juices that are not from concentrate ("Simply Orange" is a good one and so is V8 and V8 Splash) or make your own to minimize the bad parts. <br>   <br>  Weigh yourself every week on a certain day in the morning before you eat and after you go to the bathroom. this will show you've lost weight rather than weighing every day. <br>  Record your progress. This way you can notice any major changes. Keep a log of everything you eat, every exercise you do, and how many inches your waist is (or whatever kind of body part that needs weight loss). Add up your total calorie intake of that day (try and keep it at a maximum of 2000) and how many calories you burned (most exercise machines will give you an estimate of how many calories you burned). If your diet or exercise changed you can see what plan worked best for you. Also, if you record the calories you have eaten, you can input them in websites that will then calculate whether you should have eaten more, or less calories that day, and you can plan from that. <br>  Be Confident. If you are confident about losing weight you will be more likely to have some great progress! It actually works! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsTeens need to get about 8.5-9.5 hours of sleep per night. <br>  Tired of that tummy? Try doing sit ups, crunches or leg lifts. <br>  If you get hungry between meals, have a healthy snack. It will keep your blood sugar up and keep you from overeating the next meal. <br>  Occasional indulgences are acceptable. Mom made her famous cherry pie for Christmas? Take a small piece. Better yet, don't eat the crust. Personally, I don't like the crust or the top layer, so I just eat the cherries in the middle and the bottom crust. You get the taste, minus a few calories. <br>  When exercising, think how you'll look after you lose some weight, it boosts your wanting to exercise. <br>  Listen to music while exercising. Try doing a different exercise every song. <br>  Rather than sitting,stand. Standing burns calories, too. <br>  Start off with a small amount of weight to lose (3,5,7,9) when you see that 3,5,7, or 9 pounds pop off, you'll feel great and feel like any amount of weight that you lose is a revelation. <br>  Think about joining Weight Watchers.

WBf2V8vSaa	They always seem to come at an inconvenient time.|`|UVgt1IhPaa	yes it is absolutely safe as long as youre not doing it month after month after month. you may experience some spotting if you do this though, just a little bit of bleeding, which my doctor told me is normal even if it lasts a few days.  have fun on your trip!|`|7DCWGVLmaa	Yes, I've done it before. It is safe, but you shouldn't do it more than once a year, twice at the MOST if you can help it. It's always healthier for your body to go through natural cycles if you can. So I mean if you really think about it, it's not like birth control is good for you, and skipping a period here or there isn't really going to make a difference. <br>  <br>  I did it once for a vacation and I plan to do it again soon for my honeymoon. Depending on your body and the birth control, you may get a little bit of spotting, but it won't actually start. Good luck!

AA11987492	I have the ParaGard and I *LOVE* it. It is an IUD that is hormone free, so you don't get all of those nasty side effects. There is no upkeep to it outside of checking to be sure you can feel the strings once a month. That means no pill to remember, no ring to go have put in every month, no shot every three months, nothing. It last for ten years and when you want to have kids, all you do is go have it removed. Your fertility should return that night, as there are no hormones that have to leave your body. Some people do experience heavier periods with it. I had a heavy period for the first 3 months, but now they are back to normal. To be honest, I just wore an ultra tampon instead of a regular one, it was no big deal.<br>  <br>  Now remember, it doesn't protect against STD's so if you have sex with someone and you do not know if they have an STD or not, then you need to use a condom. Because the strings hang out of the cervix, getting an STD can increase your risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). This can affect your future fertility. The #1 reason of a womans infertility is a history of STD's.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose!|`|vsaaaSsAaa	I think the Nuva Ring would be a good choice for you.  Since you probably have a busy lifestyle, it's hard to remember birth control everyday... Like when you're sleeping over at a friends house, etc.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, no sane doctor would give you an IUD or IUS.  Those are only meant for women how have already had a child, since they carry a risk of infertility complications.

Explain to her that it is IMPOSSIBLE to run that much everyday and swim without having enough calories to burn. The whole point of running and swimming is to burn calories. If she doesn't have any calories to burn, then she will pass out within a few days, or less. Also, if she doesn't have enough calories, her body will go into starvation mode and her metabolism will completely shut down, hence her weight will not be lost.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	Do not workout if you are on a fast. It is very dangerous. She needs to rest. <br>  And technically, eating anything at all would make it not a fast. But, eating so little is still very dangerous so she needs to rest while doing to fast. She should definitely not run.<br>  For about the first four days she can lose from 1-5 pounds each day. After that it will probably stay between 1 and two pounds. The first three days are very difficult, but after the third day, hunger pains go down a lot. After day 10 they are usually non existant.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay safe.|`|b9EUvON3aa	Depending on if she's done it before or not. Fasting usually leads to binging, (over eating).

HcS8vzNCaa	Figuring  out how many calories you burn in a day is not too difficult, but it does take some honest self reporting.  I suggest you carry a little notebook and a watch with you to record all of your actvitites after you do them, for the exact duration.<br>  <br>  The first thing is figuring out your basal metabolic rate.  You would burn this number of calories even if you stayed in bed all day.  The first source cited below will enable you to calculate this number.<br>  <br>  Then, you need to use that notebook to record your activities during the day.   For instance, you may have the following entries:  drove to work, 7:30--8:00; office work, 8:00--12:00; jogged, 7 mph, 5:00--5:30. Record everything you do and the exact duration of each activity.<br>  <br>  Before you go to bed, you can calculate the calories burned for all activities, and add them to your basal metabolism calories burned.  This number will give you your total calories burned for the day.<br>  <br>  "...If I don't do that everyday do I still burn the same amounts?  or what if  I do more?" you ask.   Each day is unique, and each day will burn a different number of calories.  You can only guess how many calories you burned unless you keep a detailed journal.  After a few weeks of doing this, you will have a pretty good average number for each day, but you can't rely on the average to give you precise information for each particular day.<br>  <br>  Anyway, with the sites posted below, you will be able to calculate your calories burned each day, without much difficulty.  It takes a little discipline to monitor your activities closely like this, but I have full confidence you will be able to do it without much of a problem.|`|a1pmr73vaa	<a href="http://www.peertrainer.com/CalorieWikiFoods.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.peertrainer.com/CalorieWikiFo...</a>|`|3bsIGHE4aa	mypyramid.gov<br>  <br>  Use the Calorie Tracker

M8a4Qe2Maa	it's a mother's first breastmilk.<br>  <br>  A precursor to breast milk that's rich in fats, protein, and antibodies,colostrum is sometimes called "early milk." Most women produce it a fewdays before and after childbirth; some women produce small amounts ofit from the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	NOUN: The thin yellowish fluid secreted by the mammary glands at the time of parturition that is rich in antibodies and minerals, and precedes the production of true milk.|`|JOVWBOOCaa	Colostrum is a thick yellow fluid, rich in protein, growth factors, and immune factors. It is secreted by the mammary glands of all female mammals during the first few days of lactation. It also contains essential nutrients and protease inhibitors that keep it from being destroyed by the processes of digestion. Humans produce relatively small amounts of colostrum in the first two days after giving birth, but cows produce about 9 gallons (36 L) of colostrum. Bovine colostrum can be transferred to all other mammals, and is four times richer in immune factors than human colostrum.<br>  <br>  Although colostrum has received widespread attention as a dietary supplement only since the late 1990s, it has a lengthy history of medicinal use. Ayurvedic physicians in India have used colostrum as a treatment for thousands of years. In the United States, mainstream medical practitioners recommended colostrum as a natural antibiotic before the discovery of penilcillin and sulfa drugs. In the 1950s, colostrum was used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dr. Albert Sabin, the researcher who developed the first oral vaccine for poliomyelitis, found that colostrum contains antibodies against polio. He recommended colostrum as a dietary supplement for children who were vulnerable to polio.<br>  <br>  The major components of colostrum include the following substances:<br>  <br>  Immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are globulin proteins that function as antibodies. They are the most plentiful immune factors found in colostrum. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) counteracts bacteria and toxins in the blood and lymphatic system; immunoglobulin M (IgM) seeks out and attaches itself to viruses in the circulatory system; immunoglobulins D and E (IgD and IdE) remove foreign substances from the bloodstream and activate allergic reactions. High-quality colostrum is certified to contain a minmum of 16% immunoglobulins. <br>  Lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is a protein that transports iron to red blood cells and helps to deprive viruses and harmful bacteria of iron. <br>  Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP). PRP is a hormone that regulates the thymus gland, helping to calm a hyperactive immune system or stimulate an underactive immune system. <br>  Growth factors. The growth factors in bovine colostrum include insulin-like growth factors (IgF-1 and IgF-2), an epithelial growth factor (EgF), transforming growth factors (TgF-A and TgF-B), and a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Growth factors stimulate normal growth as well as the healing and repair of aged or injured skin, muscle, and other tissues. In addition, growth factors help the body to burn fat instead of muscle for fuel when a person is dieting or fasting. <br>  Growth hormone. Growth hormone slows some of the signs of aging. <br>  Leukocytes. Leukocytes are white cells that stimulate production of interferon, a protein that inhibits viruses from reproducing. <br>  Enzymes. Colostrum contains three enzymes that oxidize bacteria. <br>  Cytokines and lymphokines. These are substances that regulate the body's immune response, stimulate the production of immunoglobulins, and affect cell growth and repair. <br>  Vitamins. Colostrum contains small amounts of vitamins A, B12, and E. <br>  Glycoproteins. Glycoproteins, or protease inhibitors, are complex proteins that protect immune factors and growth factors from being broken down by the acids in the digestive tract. <br>  Sulfur. Sulfur is a mineral that is an important building block of proteins
inST4SlAaa	this information is how to reset it at a higher rate<br>  <br>  There are many ways you can increase you metabolism. Here are a few suggestions. <br>  1. Drinking 10-16 cups of water. <br>  <br>  2. Eat small meals every 2-3 hours. <br>  <br>  3. Eat quality protein in every meal. For the foods that speed metabolism, see the related page link, further down this page, listed under "Related Questions." <br>  <br>  4. Eat a quality protein, low carbohydrate, breakfast within an hour after waking up. <br>  <br>  5. Use vitamins and minerals. Try Co-Enzyme Q10, Magnesium Citrate Powder, B12, and a B-complex to help boost metabolism. However, be sure to also take a daily multi vitamin and mineral supplement. <br>  <br>  6. Take 1800 mg of Fish Oil. Studies have shown that it will help you lose weight faster. <br>  <br>  7. Exercising in the morning will help to boost your metabolism all day long. Exercise before breakfast. Many people say it will burn 3 times as many calories then doing it after you eat. <br>  <br>  8. You should be having no less than 1200 calories a day. Anything less and your metabolism will slow down. <br>  <br>  9. Do daily aerobic exercise such as walking for weight loss. For instructions on the pace and distance required for fat loss, see the related page link, further down this page, listed under "Related Questions." <br>  <br>  10. Do weight training two or three times per week. For instructions, see the related page link, further down this page, listed under "Related Questions." <br>  <br>  11. Cut right down on high carbohydrates (wheat, corn, rice, potatoes, chick peas, lentils, yams, etc). Cut out refined carbohydrates such as breads, crackers, cakes, biscuits, chips, ice cream, etc., and all things containing sugar. <br>  <br>  12. Do not have any trans-fat. <br>  <br>  13. Do not have anything containing corn syrup. <br>  <br>  14. Eat low carbohydrate fruits and non-starchy veggies. <br>  <br>  15.

You need from 1700-2000, if you are a not very active female. If you are active, your calories needs may be higher. However, you may want to eat better foods; you can't survive off of momstly apples! Be sure to eat other fruits, too. And just other foods in general.|`|75MFPsEIaa	That is only 860 calories.  up to 1500 is recomended for women per day.

I went through the same thing when I was your age. And I know you don't want to hear this, so go ahead and give this answer a poor rating if that makes you feel better, but when you're 17 you aren't really 1000% SURE of anything. I have struggled with my lack of self-esteem due to my small breasts all my life, but getting a boob job really won't solve your problems. Trust me. I've been there and so have lots of other girls who really don't have anything to be ashamed of. <br>  <br>  If you really are honest with yourself, what is the real reason you're doing this? Because you don't like the way you look and you're unhappy with your breast size? Or becuase you want attention from guys? Whatever the reason, it all comes down to pure vanity. This is the kind of thing you'll have to live with for the rest of your life. And it doesn't mattter  what highschool you go to, you  KNOW everyyone is going to know. Do you want to be known for something that shallow? How will you feel when your family members ask you about it? Or future boyfriends? Will you lie or admit that they're just fake?<br>  <br>  I hate to say it, and you're going to do what you're going to do, but you need some time to grow up and get over yourself.|`|YbJ33ApSaa	Shelby, Why not try some non-invasive treatments before you take such drastic steps?  Take up of plant oestrogens through the skin is an effective way of enhancing and enlarging your breasts.  The best way I found was to rub ground fenugreek powder (from the supermarket) mixed with body lotion into my breasts, cover them with chicken fillet forms to protect my clothes and leave the mixture on my breasts all day.  After 3 times a few days apart my breasts were noticeably bigger - cheap, no side effects (except the smell of fenugreek while you have it on, and easy). And remember that a closed mind is the source of many regrets.

6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	It's an interesting fact that a large percentage of Americans are chronically dehydrated, to the point where the signal gets mixed up instead of feeling like "I need to drink something," they feel, "I am HUNGRY!"<br>  <br>  Are you drinking enough water? Are you getting all of the vitamins you need? Try eating your meals slower. It takes 20 minutes for your stomach's "I'm full" signal to reach your brain. You might be scarfing too fast and tricking it.|`|ttIofRlBaa	you could have a tapeworm? <br>  do you eat and always still feel hungry? if so look into it<br>  <br>  could you be pregnant?<br>  <br>  i think you should get checked out at the doctors to rule out anything more serious than just being hungry|`|SwtENJdOaa	Maybe you just eat too fast, and after your finished eating the food hasnt been able to settle in your stomach yet and therefore it cant tell if its full or not. Try and slow down when eating and enjoy your meal, also eat filling meals. Sometimes even a good sized meal can make you not seem full if you eat too much sugars or other less nutritional foods. If you continue to feel like I would maybe contact a doc? Sometimes not feeling full after meals can lead to over eating which isnt healthy either.

It will be annoying if you're not used to it, so start now. Be sure to bring plenty extra just incase, but as long as you put on a fresh one right before your walk, you should be fine.|`|RTHWQvkzaa	You should be PREPARED, not worried :-D<br>  <br>  it seems like you may get it soon, but there is a slight possibility. You don't want to take any risks! I auggest, if you can find them, get Kotax pads for "light flow days" or "Light days" whatever it is called, something along those lines. If you put it in your underwear, no one can see it and you don't even feel it there. The pad is very thin and very small, which is great because you can't see or feel it much. You may feel it barely at first but after like 3 minutes it will feel as if it isnt there.<br>  <br>  I wear this type when I think my period is coming, or if I'm not sure if its gone. You should too. That way, if you go on a long walking trip and come back to the hotel and in the bathroom you check and see you got your period, you can change into a bigger pad. (Kotax is the one i use, but there are different sizes so tyr to have some of each size available) So bring bigger ones in case. the thin pad is goo because if you get your period and dont realize, it will hold up for quite some time It is small so your undies will probably get stained if you get your period, but you can change into a fresh pai when you notice. If you can, keep some pads hidden in a bag that you take with you, like a pocketbook.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! :-)

bvt9kvS8aa	Pineapple is full if fiber.... good for your digestive tract because it takes your body awhile to 'break it down' and makes your metabolism work overtime breaking it down to digest its complex composition.

bvt9kvS8aa	How to Lose Love Handles<br>  <br>  The best way to lose those love handles is to go on a diet that will shed pounds from your entire body. By diet, we mean a permanent eating regimen that stresses healthy foods – and not an overabundance of them. There are plenty of diet books out there that will tell you how to balance your intake of protein, complex carbohydrates, fat, and fiber.<br>  <br>  Any fat-burning aerobic workout is what you need, though you may also want to tone and firm that area where the handles are attached while you’re losing fat. Exercising the abs is good for that, but the best exercises for it are side bends and torso twists.<br>  <br>  Exercises for Love Handles<br>  <br>  Side Bends:<br>  Stand straight with your knees slightly bent and your feet apart, then slowly lower the trunk a few inches to the left side then back up, and do the same thing again to the right side. Repeat until you’re sick and tired of doing them. Don’t bend forward or backward while you’re doing these as it would be bad for the spine.<br>  <br>  Torso Twists:<br>  While standing firmly with your feet a shoulder’s width apart, twist your torso slowly to the left side then to the right while at the same time keeping your hips straight and even. Again, there should be no bending. Don’t overdo it; twisting too far makes it easy to pull a muscle.<br>  <br>  hope this helped =)|`|TWMUXDhKaa	Use them up by making love :)
tIldpr7vaa	u need to decide a goal, if u really wanna lean up cut ur cals and focus on cardio. To prevent muscle loss on a cut, just keep lifting heavy and keep ur protein intake high.|`|2j2C44FDaa	The average daily intake for men is about 2500 cals a day and you are eating MORE. In order to loose fat try and stick to about 2000 a day plus your workout. It is also important to check what you are eating, not just how many calories it has. Anything with hydrogenated fat in it for example MUST be avoided as it takes weeks to break down.<br>  Stay away from any pills at all costs, if there was a safe quick fit, it would be on the market everywhere because it would be the biggest money spinner apart from a cure for cancer.<br>  <br>  You are doing fine, just lower your intake and eat healthily.

If you don't like eating vegetables then you have to get used to them or you may have a healthy vegetable or juice. You might have a hard time quitting, but it will help a lot. <br>  Eat only small meals. Also, chew slowly so it will take more time to eat -- you will be able to feel yourself getting full instead of just stuffing your face. Also when eating snacks, eat fruits and veggies, although you must eat slowly! <br>  Exercise! Go jogging, ride your bike outside the house, roller blading etc. You can even create your own dance at home! Anything that will make you sweat!!! And remember, exercise at least an hour a day. <br>  Learn to say NO! Cutting your addiction to sugary foods will help you a lot. <br>  Don't follow any diet plans or choose foods because they claim to have fewer carbs. Carbs can turn into fat, but carbs also give you energy! So exercise those carbs off! The healthiest thing is to just be healthy! Take it in moderation, avoid fast food, and choose the healthier alternative. As a kid, you don't need to count calories. Just make better decisions. <br>  You should, do at least 10 sit-ups and 5 push-ups BEFORE every meal, this will help you lose weight a whole LOT faster! If you do this after you may get indigestion and/or an upset stomach. <br>  While listening to music on your iPod or MP3 player, dance to it. Knock yourself out. It may be a little embarrassing if someone catches you but at least you're losing weight and exercising. <br>  Excercise a lot with a friend or someone so that you do not feel alone.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	the first thing you need to do is stop buying junk food. just like with most things children learn from what they "see" their parents doing not what the parent tells them to do. so if the adult has an unhealthy diet most likely the child will have an unhealthy diet and that will continue into adulthood and the cycle continues with their children.<br>  <br>  good and bad habits start in the home.|`|HXuQwpaNaa	they pick up the parents eating habits are you a fatty if so it being fat is all your fault and if so you are the crappers parent ever <br>  you should not give her any bad foods you buy her food you a KILLING you child if it does no lose weight it will DIE it will be the end of its life i hope you a happy you prat Get the fat cow to move its *** and do some thing find some one for it to shag that burns fat tell it  it is fat and ugly and it will die if it don't move its fat flabby *** don't feed it till it runs 3 miles if it wont get a wip and wip it <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s DOCTORS CAN HELP IT LOSE WEIGHT SAFELY AND HELP YOU ON YOUR WAY|`|UGHVDspjaa	weightwatchers I did that with my mum but never went to the meetings but kept track of the points.

zzp1o9mlaa	Here are two guidelines that I follow while I'm on this diet.<br>  <br>  1. Incorporate "super foods" into your meal plan on a daily basis.  Some examples are salmon, low-fat plain yogurt, tomatoes, spinach, mixed berries, whole oats, mixed nuts, green tean and various beans.<br>  <br>  2.Eat 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. They will help you meet your micro-nutrient needs for the day.

Work out at least 3 days per week.  Do both weight training and cardio and be patient.  It will take a few months, but you will see a difference.<br>  <br>  Your breakfast sucks.  There is no protein there.  All carbs?  No past no bread for lunch?  That's a good start, but its ok to have wheat bread every once in awhile - its a complex carb.  Complex carb = good, simple carb = bad.  Try to have protein at every meal.  Tea?  Orange and Yogurt?  Not bad I suppose.  Eat another meal before you go to bed, you don't want to starve yourself.|`|mt2FbsK6aa	well, what kind of body type are you, because if you are muscular, then its your muscle thats weighing you down, and that not something you want to lose, also when you work out stick to cardio, if you lift, youll gain muscle which will lead to more weight most of the time.  the biggest thing i could tell you is that you should stay more active, also, dont under eat, thats not healthy.
MEgAS8H4aa	You have misinformation about squats. If done correctly they will not injury your knees. Most people do not do them correctly. They only go part of the way down and lock their knees at the top. That form WILL cause knee problems. <br>  <br>  You could substitute leg press, hack squats, sissy squats or do "frogs".|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	Use the vertical jump machine.<br>  <br>  It looks like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.powernetics.com/images/super_cat_3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.powernetics.com/images/super_...</a>
deYDbVDSaa	I would really need to know exactly what you're eating to give any help. However, I'll throw this out:<br>  <br>  Are you seeing any major changes in the shape of your body? You could be adding muscle and losing fat. This would not show on a scale since your weight would be about the same, but you would see it in the way clothes fit.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose fat only, restrict your calorie count to ~1700 a day. You will lose at that amount.
ICtwYntuaa	Muscles have different types of fibers.  Simply, there's muscle that can work for a long time (endurance), and there's bulky muscle that generates force (strength).  Cardiovascular exercise primarily strengthens endurance, while slightly increasing strength.  Weight training is the opposite.  Most people mix them up, alternating or what have you.  When you weight train, it might be a good idea to do at least 5-10 min of cardio beforehand just to get warmed up first.|`|8SRjELNBaa	clue has a point.  If you want to look muscular and lean, do sprints.  If you want to look lanky and skinny do long endurance runs.|`|lSiGnVDMaa	Cardio helps with weightlifting it raises the metabolism which gives you more energy it delivers blood and oxygen to the muscles which help them grow even bigger and stronger|`|8mFvaWeBaa	Cardiovascular fitness is a fantastic way of making your muscles hypertrophy (especially the cardiac muscle). If you go running or swimming, and increase intensities and time, then you will be able to increase the strength and size or your skeletal muscles and cardiac muscle. <br>  <br>  Also, your endurance should increase, which is really good. You'll be able to participate in sporting activities for longer.<br>  <br>  Best wishes<br>  <br>  Bryony

NzR25cQAaa	Should be alright|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I wouldn't without contacting a pharmacist or doctor first.  A lot of pills can't be crushed or opened.  You should probably just switch to chews and they should have no problem changing this.  But ask before you do anything to your pill.  Me and my brothers used to have a hard time swallowing too and we used a little trick with yogurt or applesauce what you do is get a big 'ol spoon full of either and stick the pill in it and go "GUMP".  This tricks your mind into thinking your not swallowing anything but the food and you wont feel the pill like you do if you are just doing it by yourself.  Try this trick first, if no luck, again call a pharmacy and ask, if they say no request chews and go get those instead.  Good luck, I know it's hard, but if this work, you'll have the hang of it in no time!  (without any food!)|`|hgaaW8Pjaa	what are the pills for.  If there is a version that is a true pill not capsule that would be better.  Why not ask the doctor or pharmacist?|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Have the doctor prescribe liquid form of medication or else check with the doctor for a safe substitute to your problem.|`|hBcdkgzqaa	My son used to have the same problem. Eventually he started putting the pill/capsule as far back in his throat as he could then washed it down with lots of juice. If that doesn't work for you then make sure you read the information pamphlet that comes with your medication, sometimes it specifically states "do not chew or crush. Swallow whole." I would suggest speaking with your physician about the problem as well. I would think that he or she would prescribe a liquid form of the medications in the future if it is available.|`|HAYlmwdtaa	one solution i found that worked great was to crush the pills into a fine powder and then tightly wrap it in toilet paper.  this will help with the swallowing as the toilet paper dissolves very well and you don't get the discomfort of the pill.<br>  <br>  another way is to put the pill under your tongue and get a tall glass of water and drink the water moving the pill with it.  it's like swallowing ice without chewing it|`|XmWdcFeqaa	I feel yha...i can't really swallow pills either it kinda takes time to the point where the pill starts to breakup...(usually tylenol)...but sometimes i jus get a sharp knife and cut the pill down the middle and always drink orange juice or something with fruit flavor with it cause for mhe, water makes the taste come to my mouth which is another reason why i drink orange juice...hope i helped much.|`|dBNdN6gUaa	It's is ok to do it...... The capsules are only a coating for the medication. This type of coating was only invented for taste reasons. But as the song goes " A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down"..... But I would say, no messing around....Down the hatch mixed with a bit of water would be best way to do it.....|`|xrq4qKRbaa	It is only if they are NOT time release.|`|FMmncxToaa	You have to read the instructions before doing that, because there are some pills that are time released and have to be taken whole, otherwise it can be dangerous. I had the same problem until I got pregnant and had to take prenatal vitamins, my trick? Make believe you're swallowing a skittle or take it will a fulll glass of water and forget about the pill.It will become second nature.
4b9ac58e789dd7441f61926ee404111faa	Nope. There is a federal law called HIPAA, which means that no one can review your records without your written permission. Even if you were only 18 your parents would not be able to access your health records without your permission.<br>  If someone in the doctor's office did screw up and give your results to your mom, they could be fined, big time.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	No. ALl test results are confidential.|`|hfNXDCPQaa	No. You are protected by law for them not to release information without identification.
AeeX1Wnkaa	Maybe the clinic could do a titer for Hib and Hep B, meaning they can measure the concentration of the antibodies in her blood and see if they are at the correct level. If nothing else, she could have a Hep B and Hib booster in a few months, even if she did get those vaccines today. Then she will have completed that round of vaccinations.|`|ebQJsYTxaa	You can't trust your doctor anymore after that.  You'll need to find a new doctor.<br>  <br>  To be on the safe side, I would suggest NOT giving the additional Hep B or Hib.  If your baby did get the hexa for the 6 month shots, getting additional vaccines could  be dangerous.  On the other hand, your baby has an extremely low risk of hep B, because that is spread through sex and sharing needles. Hib is not very common these days.<br>  <br>  My children, ages 5 years and 21 months, never got the hep B or Hib vaccines, and they never got those diseases.  I never got the hep B or Hib vaccines, either.  Those vaccines were not available when we were kids.

Those can be severe neurological problems. Not to scare you, but it could be a tumor or cyst in the brain, or even a clot or other blockage.<br>  <br>  The bloody vomit can potentially be something minor, but can also denote a serious problem, possibly ulcers.

AeeX1Wnkaa	Yes, AIDS can be transmitted through breastmilk. Breastmilk contains less of the virus than blood, but the risk is still there so it is advised that mothers with AIDS not breastfeed their babies if the baby is not already infected.|`|wTvlreI7aa	YES...AIDS can be transmited through breast milk. If the mother was pregnant and with AIDS the baby already has the desease. If someone has HIV or AIDS it is extremely stupid to get pregnant! I hate dumb people! Why would anyone want to bring a baby into the world and have it have a deadly desease right away, give children a fresh new start! Don't just having children to fill your own needs, the baby has needs too.

Dont pull the skin tag out when you do this. Sterilize again.<br>  <br>  Get some small scissors (like eyebrow scissors) or nail clippers and cut as close to the tag as possible. Sterilize again. <br>  <br>  Remove the floss, you might experience some bleeding but it shouldnt be that bad.<br>  <br>  Put a bandaid on and voila! Gone :)

eMXIQaQlaa	Jumping jacks<br>  Lunges<br>  Squats<br>  Push ups<br>  Dips<br>  Sit ups/crunches<br>  Dance<br>  Pilates<br>  <br>  If you really hate working out then find an activity you like to do. Go hiking (when its nice out I mean) biking, run your dog, join a class for pilates/yoga/spinning/martial arts/boxing/ or even hip hop. <br>  <br>  For motivation...<br>  -listen to music that gets you pumped up (get an mp3 player or ipod)<br>  -make a list of the reasons you want to get in shape. The more personal, the better. When you dont feel like working out, read it.<br>  -get a workout buddy<br>  -when you feel like just sitting around, stretch a little and then you might feel like working out wouldn't be so bad since you're already a little warmed up.|`|VgWJ8yvwaa	It all depends on what your goal is. If you simply want to burn as much calories as possible then it is best to do exercises "in waves". That is, first take about five minutes heating up (everything here is general and can be applied to any sort of exercise) and doing just above minimum tension. Then do a little above average for 2min, then 1min your maximum, then 1min your minimum, and then repeat the cycle (without the heating up part) for as many times as you want. The last session should end with a 2-3 min at your minimum. This way you will burn calories hours after you stop exercising. For burning calories the best is rowing, swimming, running (in that order). Also, push-ups and the like can help but they are more useful for building muscle tissue. Also, you can try exercising on an empty stomach (painful, but burns fat much more effectively). If the treadmill is boring, try music or even some magazine if nothing else. Also, never start exercising without stretching, always drink at least half a liter of pure water during exercise and another half in the half hour after finishing and eat food which contains a larger number of carbohydrates|`|vKCIPNDHaa	Push ups, sit ups and, for aerobic exercise, jumping rope is awesome!|`|xrq4qKRbaa	aerobics
VWNiOxcvaa	The light recepters in the retina or the back of the eye also react to pressure along with light. Our brain then tries to interpret the signal it is getting from the eyes.<br>  <br>  Pressing on the eyeballs and rubbbing is very harmful to vision. I wouldn't doubt if conical cornea has connections to excessively hard rubbbing of the eye balls.<br>  <br>  Its much better to squeeze the eyelids and face towards the eyeballs to deal with itchy irritated or tired eyes then to press and rub, and this should only be done in short durations and may increase circulation to the eyes. If one notices colors and lights while rubbing or pressing, they are pressing too hard hard and too long.|`|1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	i get the same as you. <br>  <br>  but if im in a dark room and i do this, i can see what seems to be figures of people. dark figures like shadows. maybe its my imagination doing it. but its as if i can see people walking past me, or going about daily life.  its really weird!!!|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Me too! I thought it was just me!<br>  <br>  Its white at the edges then blue and white dots bounce around all over the place.|`|ibMFwQoMaa	I used to do this when I was about ten years old.  First of all I would see a pale yellow colour, and if I kept pressing I would see a very pretty bright gold colour.<br>  <br>  The problem was, it would hurt and the longer I pressed the more it hurt.  And I was worried that I would damage my eyes.<br>  <br>  But once I did keep pressing, just to see what happened, and after a while the gold colour faded away and I could see a street scene.  It was a suburban street with houses and people walking around.  It wasn't like I was picturing it in my head, I could actually see it.  The perspective in the picture was strange, as though the houses were very narrow.  There was a pavement in front of the houses, and another pathway behind them, but the people walking on the pathway behind the houses seemed to be almost as close as people walking on the one in front, as if the houses and the land around them were only a few feet deep.<br>  <br>  Then it started to hurt quite badly so I stopped and never did it again.  I always wondered if anyone else had done this.  It must be bad for your eyes, I suppose they could burst, so it's probably best that you don't try it for more than a few seconds!|`|XBYiHaWIaa	At first is looks like im falling down a black and white checkered building, then there's like a black sky of multicoloured tiny stars, then freaky visions and random images.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	i dunno i like my vison, so i dont want to do something stupid like pressing down on my eyeballs|`|TrXMht0eaa	i see ppl i do not know carrying on with whatever they are doing, its not at all nice sometimes it becomes real|`|HdrdLmoUaa	greeny purple circle lines
fDYxwfYwaa	No, but when I was 7 yrs I was sleeping at the foot of their bed and all of a sudden I was bouncing up and down. I sat up and my mother screamed at me to get out. I left and cried for a long time. I didn't mean to start bouncing.lol|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	..why are you snooping around your parent's room?  obviously if it's in there it's supposed to be private.  they probably wouldn't like you broadcasting their personal lives on the internet.|`|GnOKExBhaa	sorta my parents door was locked and when it finally was unlocked my mom was in her bra and underwear and there were lots of candles.|`|nGPHBK6laa	lol yeah<br>  i found some porn magazines hidden in my kitchen cabinet<br>  it was my dad's LoL<br>  but it's kinda freaky =]
nGPHBK6laa	ummm.... no girl gets their period on the exact day from last month so relax cuz the only way u can get pregnant is by having sperm inside you|`|yxqL0yLtaa	Depends. How old are you and have you had it before, even if only once?<br>  Some girls don't get their periods until the age of 18 or over.<br>  It can be quite normal.<br>  Be happy if that's the case!
eALcHp1Raa	Hungry Jacks(Aussie version of MacDonalds)<br>  Pasta(lots is better)<br>  Ice Cream(huge scoops)<br>  Family sized Pizza<br>  Big Mac<br>  Sweet deserts<br>  Don't exercise at all just sit on the couch and watch your butt get bigger|`|xqQO81Omaa	Damn idiots, you don't have to get fat to get a big butt and thighs....anyway who is to say all the extra fat won't end up going around the waist instead!<br>  <br>  What you can do is plenty of squats and lunges, these build muscle in the buttocks and thighs. Bear in mind your genetic plays a part in how much muscle you will be able to gain but this will definitely help. Also need to eat an adequate amount of protein to ensure maximum muscle gain.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|FbjduA2Saa	Why would you want that?|`|AA10460179	You can't really "get them". It's in your genes. If you gained weight, you'd gain it there too, try toning them for more definition.|`|b6Fsfbfnaa	Get fat. Lol...|`|20cft23Oaa	hey i got that and i hate it soooooo
nrTVlo8Eaa	Thanks for the two points!!<br>  <br>  I bet even if your English were perfect nobody would know how to answer this question.|`|AA11434633	Perhaps you might like to edit your question so that it at least sounds like English.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Yeah whatever you said....|`|9vNeOUBUaa	woah, i cant find one thing in this sentence that is actually correct lol.|`|nfEdqqsnaa	Wow.<br>  You're not even good at trolling.|`|CC0AC7VUaa	aha! yeah totally................wht did u say again?
4Quo7TB2aa	If you want a good natural way to cleanse your liver then you need to take a vitamin called Milk Thistle with a full glass of water everyday. I swear by it. I take ALOT of prescription and over the counter pills and used to drink alot and have always taken this vitamin and the Dr.s can not believe that my liver is in FANTASTIC condition. Honestly, you really should do this. I have heard that putting lemon wedges in you water also helps but I know for fact that the Milk Thistle works.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	A decent squeeze of fresh lemon juice in a glass of warm water first thing in the morning will assist the detox process. As will eating fruit and drinking juiced apples, cucumber, celery, and carrots. But not all at the same time (turns out muddy-looking).<br>  <br>  The lemon thing is a great instant alkaliser for the body. Another is Asparagus, long-term. You want to head your diet into about 80% alkaline-forming foods to about 20% acid-forming if you can. You body will love you for it.
