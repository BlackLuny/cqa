20090203073559AAIUGv0	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Can someone help explain The Other Boleyn Girl to me?	Hey.  So I just finished watching The Other Boleyn GIrl (I have never read the book) and was left a little confused.  How much of the film is based on fact?  Did Mary really have a relationship and a son with Henry Tudor or is that made up?  I knew he did supposedly have an illegitimate son with somebody but I didn't know that it was Ann Boleyn's sister.  Did Ann and George (her brother) actually have the whole potential night thing or is that another random hollywood addition.  Finally what was the thing with Mary and the random child (was that Elizabeth) at the end?  I can't believe how many questions I have about this film but I still really enjoyed it.  What did you think of Eric Bana as Henry?  Despite his excellent acting (as always) I just don't think he was mean enough.

20090220160146AAhN45C	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Am alternate ending worth making?	I have made an idea for an alternate ending for the classic Kubrick/King movie the Shining that I think would have been somewhat better than the original ending. I would like to make it, cheaply with actors/a corn or bush maze in the winter/a camera/and a near mansion sized home, but I don't know if anyone would even care to view it. If you saw a Youtube video for an alternate ending to the Shining and saw (the below), what would you think about it?      Two things that brought me to this that I'd explain in the beginning. One, the movie is called the Shinning, and what does the Shining power do for Danny in the end? It only scares his mother and gets the cook killed. You'd think it would have more of a point in a movie thats named after it. Also, notice (despite his otherwise phenominal work directing) that one of the few things that should have been emphasized in the movie, is how Danny maintains during extreme pressure in order to concentrate and think about the snow-footprint trick way out of the maze. If you watch the scene, it just simply cuts from one point onto Danny retracing his steps in the snow. So I tied those points together and thought of something original, bare with me please................................      Start at the scene where Danny is running into the maze and away from the axe-wielding-father Jack. Danny keeps running and hearing Jack until he gets to....a dead end, he changes paths and goes a bit until he gets to another dead end. This time though, Danny falls backwards and gets up upon realizing how hard this could be. After he hears Jack again, the scene shows how cold and scared and tired he is. Then he tries jogging down the maze a bit more before ending up in another dead end, this time he hears silence and we once again see how tired and cold he is. Then, Danny faints, falls almost flat to the ground.       Upon hearing Jack a few seconds later, Danny opens his eyes, wide and quickly! Then he gets up, and we can see that this doesn't look like the same scared, cold, tired Danny anymore. Danny runs a bit of the maze before he hears Jack's voice again, and says to himself, in the Shining voice kind of quietly, "What do we do now Danny." After looking around for a second and holding himself as if shivering, he hears Jack again. "I'm coming for you Danny, I'm right behind youuuu!".       Shining Danny then notices the footsteps and gets an idea, he turns and starts retracing his steps, with a bit of a grimace in his face while he does it. Cut to Jack getting tired but still coming at a fast walking pace. Cut to Danny continuing until (scenes later) he gets far enough back to cover his tracks and gets ready to hide. When he sees Jack coming he quickly crawls into the corn/bush wall and hides while Jack screams his name again and walks past Danny. Then (scenes later) we see Danny running back through his old steps and out of the maze with a creepy little half smile and evil eyes.       He runs up to Wendy just coming out of the hotel. He stops as she hugs him and asks nervously "Oh Danny, are you ok? Wheres Jack?" He stares blankly at her for a second and says, "We need to go now Mrs. Torrance...." She stares confused at him for a second and asks "Danny....are you ok, is it yo...". He interrupts her last word with "WE NEED TO GO NNNOW MRS. TORRANCE!" He grabs her hands and yanks her up as they both head to the snowcat and power it up and leave. Then we cut to Jack in his tiring moments, then back to the snowcat as it leaves. We see Wendy driving, and we see her look at Danny as he stares coldly ahead. She says, "Danny....I...." and is interrupted by Danny saying "Dannys really tired, and we are getting further away....", he stares ahead some more as Wendy looks more nervous. Then she looks back at him and he is staring at her with his lips smooshed together in a half smile. He then says, "Goodbye Mrs. Torrance"...and passes out.       We hear Wendy say his name twice, the second time louder as the scene cuts to outside of the snowcat. Then we cut to her at dawn, with the snowcat stopped, getting some help off the side of the road with Danny still out. She is crying and the help (2 people) try asking her questions, then suddenly, Danny awakes. He slowly looks at everyone sort of blankly, then says in his normal voice. "Mom.....what happened?" As she hugs and smiles (yada) the camera slowly cuts back a bit and looks back at an upward angle, and we cut quickly to....Jack frozen and the original last scenes.....      What do you think of it? Worth putting minimal money into?

20090203073440AA5WBMs	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What is up with Superman's intelligence?	I was at Six Flags last summer and I was waiting in line for the Superman Ride. There were several posters and bios that you could read about Superman, his allies, and villains. The Superman biography mentioned that Superman was a super-genius, had a eidetic memory, and knew every language on Earth. This was due to Superman being Kryptonian, a race thousands of years ahead of humans. Superman also has access to Kryptonian technology which is also thousands of years ahead of human technology.      This ability of Superman's is rarely mentioned in comics and cartoons that I've seen. Any comic experts care to explain? Thanks.

20090220161333AAePEhS	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Capricorns: What do you think he would do/think?	So, I'm sure if you're a contact of mine, you've seen me ask about my Capricorn friend on rare occasions. The one that was in love with me for two years, I treated him horribly, and he eventually moved on?       Well, anyway. I was driving home from Avon earlier, listening to my music, contemplating and over analyzing different past and present things.       I've recently made a new Capricorn friend (through my Libra ex), whom kind of reminds me of the first Capricorn. I think that's why I wanted to get close to him. I thought he would be the same person. I thought I could maybe replace him. But I realize he's just.. irreplaceable.       He's the only friend I've ever had that knew everything about me. Every detail, every fact -- and he never judged me. (I'm sure he did, but he kept it to himself very well.)      He was just like my guardian angel or something. He was everything I needed, but I was too young and immature to reciprocate any feeling towards him. I changed his being into a horribly depressed individual and he's told me before that I ruined his life. I broke his heart and there wasn't a shred of ******* guilt in me.      He always deserved better than me.      I sent him a message today to call me anyway, though. I missed the call, but he'll call back. He used to always do that.      I think I'm going to tell him that I want to spend the rest of my life with him. That's forward, and he's probably not even in love with me anymore, but there isn't anyone in the world like him.        I don't know whether I just miss my friend or if I genuinely love him. It's not the same as my Libra ex, believe me -- but I don't know. I just want him back in my life and I wish I could go back in time and be with him like we were supposed to be.       :(       I feel that I should ignore it. Things would be easier if I wasn't in his life, but I just can't. It's never going to get better for me.

It was during a car ride to school and the song was shuffled, so I don't think the song was very popular.)

20061211194232AAg0ORQ	Entertainment & Music;Music	I need to know what this song is, i know what it sorta sounds like, and only 2 words from the lyrics: "oh oh"	Ok. im looking for a song it sounds kinda bob-marley ish, but not really, it has a similar jamacan-ish rhythum to it,  not like Off and On rithym, its more like a flow in circles from one circle to the next, i dont know if you know what i mean      but i only know two words, they are "oh oh"       but, it sounds more like "UUUUUHHHH-OOHH" and there is not much space inbetween them when they are sung.       when its sung, the first "oh" is a higher note than the second one.    and this happens numerous times throughout the choruses of the song.       i guess its popular because lots of people know it but i couldnt figure out any of the words when we were playing it in school today..     in my movie editing class we have tons of music on the computers to add into the movies, and we were picking music, i asked what song that was and they told me, but it was some band that i havnt herd of before and i forgot the name like 20 seconds after she told me :/

I downloaded under Deftones, but I dont think that's who it is, because I cant find the lyrics for this song anywhere...      It starts off with some static and some voices from maybe a tv or something talking about a contract. "And many times they try to get....a contract...because if your...one that this is so imporant..."      And then then some guitar and drums come in.      And they yell something like "DREAMT!"      And then the lyrics go..      "To feel lost in...   Is what makes you high..   And I fail to leave this again.   If it keeps you alive."      And then they sing a lot of words I cant make out...because the vocalist is really soft and raspy.      And then after the chorus he goes...   "If it lifts you up...   then it brings me down.."      And I cant makeout any much more really.      If you think you might know what it is, I can send you the song.      Thanks!

I know that I'm going to get a lot of slack from the MJ haters, but I'm definitely willing to "risk it". I'm hoping that for every hater 10 fans will show support. Anyway, with Michael's Birthday vastly approaching, I began thinking of ways to celebrate this magnificent occasion. I came up with 2 great ideas. The 1st is to host a B-day bash at Spruce Run 1 Van Syckels Rd., Clinton, NJ (all fans are welcome to attend)...and the other is to gather enough fans to help me petition to have Michael Jackson's Birthday declared a national holiday. So, will you help me? If so, just add me as your contact or send me an email. You can also go to my yahoo groups  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ILoveMicha...    and post your message of support there. FYI, if you are a hater and attempt to leave a message on my group site it will not be posted so don't waste your time. For the rest of you, thanks in advance for your help. Keep the Faith & Keep Michaeling!

Here's one of the reason why I hate Miley:   When Cody Linley did Dancing With Stars, Cody said that Miley told him that she was going to go watch him perform. But yet, she never did. When its was Miley's birthday party, Cody went, and he told her that since he went to her thing, she needs to go to his. SHE never did. Except now she is performing, but still      So, lol sorry if that was kinda long, does that kinda make you hate Miley more? Or do you hate her for other reasons?      Sorry to ask a Miley question too, i know there are 100 of them, but i really wanted to know.      miley haters, and likers can say their opinion!!!!

20080105203709AADSaub	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Como besas segun tu signo zodiacal? coincide?	ARIES La ternura le sale sobrando, lo que esta persona tiene de sobra es energía y fuerza, así besa. Es en los más besucones del zodiaco, y no pide permiso, es decir, es lanzadisimo y todo lo hace a gran velocidad. No apto para chicas tímidas que desean ser despertadas con un tierno beso del principe azul.   TAURO   Si hay algo que caracteriza a estas personas es su egocentrismo, así que también a la hora del besuqueo suele pensar en sí mismo y no en su chica. No es muy emprendedor, es más bien lento y poco creativo. En este caso, tu tendrás que inspirarlo y ensenarle a que te de lo que tu esperas y deseas.   GéMINIS   Aunque la fidelidad y la seriedad no son su fuerte, todo se le perdona porque la verdad es que besa delicioso lo peor del caso es que lo sabe y le encata esta actividad en la que se muestra jugueton y parlachin.   CáNCER   Esta persona es más bien timida, tierna y protectora, es casi casi como apapachar a tu oso de peluche. Eso si hazte a la idea de que nunca va a ser un volcan en plena erupción.   LEO   Agárrate con esta persona!! la cosa se pone emcionante. Le gusta todo lo inusual, asi que échale creatividad y pasión porque necesitas impresionarlo y luego... adularlo!!! Sólo asi lo harás ronronear como a un minino.   VIRGO   Si hay una persona irracional y poco emocional, aquí la tienes. Así que con el te tienes que ir paso por paso para que se vaya emocionando, porque tarda en carburar. Seguramente tu tendrás que tomar la iniciativa y prenderlo. Pero una vez que agarra confianza, sus besos son de los más fogosos.   LIBRA   Esta persona se saca un diez, porque sabe perfectamente que es lo que deseas y esperas de él. Las personas tímidas e inspiradoras pierden su tiempo con él, ya que busca alguién igual de Perdido que él.   ESCORPIóN   Dominante, con un toque de machismo, así son sus besos, fogosos y venenosos como su aguijón. No le gustan las cosas fáciles, así que síguele el juego un rato y ponsela difícil, será todo un reto para él.   SAGITARIO   Esta persona es aventurera, está dispuesta y ansiosa de probar de todo, así que el surtido de tipos de besos estará de lujo: desde mordiscos tiernos hasta besos fogosos. Es apasionado y no le alta creatividad.   CAPRICORNIO   Otro más del grupo de los racionales. Es un conquistador nato, un seductor, aunque no muy exigente ni muy brillante en el besuqueo.   ACUARIO   Le sobra creatividad y le gusta echarla a andar. Es un gran besador, el único problema es que esta persona es de ojo alegre y considera que no tiene nada de malo tocar por aquí y por allá.   PISCIS   El indecisio y unos cuates, ese es su apodo.

LA DIFERENCIA ENTRE LAS NI?AS Y LAS MUJERES        Las ni?as quieren controlar al hombre en sus vidas.    Las mujeres, saben que si el hombre es realmente suyo,    no hay necesidad de control.        Las ni?as te gritan porque no las llamas.    Las mujeres están demasiado ocupadas para    darse cuenta que no las has llamado.        Las ni?as tienen miedo de estar solas.    Las mujeres lo utilizan como    tiempo para su crecimiento personal.        Las ni?as ignoran a los buenos hombres.    Las mujeres ignoran a los malos.        Las ni?as te hacen que vuelvas a casa.    Las mujeres hacen que quieras volver a casa.        Las ni?as dejan su agenda abierta y esperan    a que su hombre hable para hacer planes.    Las mujeres hacen sus planes y cari?osamente    notifican a los hombres para que ellos se    integren como mejor les convenga.        Las ni?as monopolizan el tiempo de su hombre.    Las mujeres se dan cuenta de que un poco de    espacio, hace del tiempo juntos algo mas especial.

Contestants would perform acting, singing, and dancing routines. They would then be narrowed down to finalists who would come to Burbank, California to compete in a reality show in which the winner would receive a contract to star in a Disney Channel Television Show or Feature Film.      The talent search phase could also include possible dates and locations in the UK and Canada.      Kids under 18 years of age would need a legal guardian or parents signed consent, and they would have to accompany the minor child or teen throughout the production.      seria bueno que tambien hagan audiciones para los latinoamericanos no?

Una pareja de marcianos viene de visita a la tierra y se hacen amigos de unos terrestres que los llevan a pasear por todos lados. La noche antes de regresar, después de unas copas, le proponen a los terrestres que intercambien parejas y así lo hacen.      Cuando el marciano y la terrestre se desnudan, ésta se queda mosqueada de verle el p**ene; el marciano se da cuenta y le dice "No te preocupes, jálame la oreja izquierda..." y maravilla!!! Le crece a lo largo pero ca?ón y lo mismo con la oreja derecha: hace que le crezca de grueso, pero severo... Entonces, pasan una noche de placer estupenda!!!

20081029130647AAYxf3m	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Who is right--me or my friends?	Okay, so two of my friends and this other girl want to do this group dressup thing for Halloween at school. They want to have a common theme so they picked to be heroines from comic books. They called me up and asked me if I wanted to join in, and I said okay.Then they told me that they were going to order all four of the costumes, and that I would have to be willing to pay them for my costume later on. So I said alright.      The next day at school they showed me the pictures of the costumes, and I showed them one that I was not willing to be. I told them that I'd be any of the other ones as long as I wasn't that one.      Well, finally the costumes arrived, and they tried them all on. And guess what, they ordered all the costumes extra small, and they say that they're all just "too fat" to be the one that I don't want to be and that I'm going to have to wear it, because I'm the only thin enough (which is such a joke, I mean they're all like size two and I'm not that much thinner than they are).      So I tried it on, and I really hate the way it looks and I feel uncomfortable in it because it's too revealing, but I was like "Ok, it's not their fault that they don't fit into it, I'll be nice and wear it."      Then they call me reminding me that I have to pay them and I just got hit with how unfair it seemed. When I told them that I would pay for my costume, I was thinking that I would at least have a choice of what to wear, but suddenly all my choices were taken away and I'm stuck with the one I specifically told them I did not want.      It just seems wrong to me that I'm going to have to wear something I hate and feel very uncomfortable and stupid in and then on top of it, have to PAY like $40 or $50 for it, just because they made the mistake of ordering everything too small. I feel really bad for them, since they paid for it all, but now I feel like I'm getting forced to do something I don't want to and having to give them money for it too.      So who's right, them cuz I gave them my word that I'd pay, or me?

20090203075000AAr0lCM	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why does she exclude herself from relationships?	Okay, this is my sister's chart: (Some data is obviously missing, because I didn't know her exact time of birth. But I proceeded to do the chart, without it.)      Sun Cancer 6.29   Moon Taurus 0.42   Mercury Gemini 16.28   Venus Cancer 28.40   Mars Leo 7.14   Jupiter Gemini 22.51   Saturn Capricorn 10.56 R   Uranus Capricorn 3.12 R   Neptune Capricorn 11.08 R   Pluto Scorpio 12.33 R   Lilith Libra 15.39   Asc node Aquarius 26.53      Anyway, she will not date anyone. She hasn't been hurt in the past or anything, because she won't give anyone a chance! Every once in awhile, people will chase after her, but she keeps denying them.      Even I do not really "get" her, and I've known her all my life. She doesn't open up to absolutely anyone.      Naturally, I didn't really care at first, but she's 19 now. I really think she's going to end up alone. I've told her on numerous occasions, that she's going to lead a lonely life with 27 cats, and she said that was fine.      She'll always make fun of me, when I talk about my ex, and doesn't understand what "love" is. It's really hard to explain to her, that she hurts my feelings with how blunt she is, since she's never been in love with someone.      Whenever she's interested in someone, she sets her standards way too high. She'll like the typical "jock" football player or something. It's almost like she knows it wouldn't work, so she purposely selects them.      She has a narrow minded perception of every guy being a cheater and a liar, so for the longest time, I believed she was a lesbian. I've read that some Cancers usually turn out to be. I'm not sure, though.

20090220112735AAUE8pI	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Fun, Obscure Movies You Like?	This might be aimed more at older users, but anyone can jump in.    I only say that b/c I'm not sure how many old, obscure movies today's younger people are exposed to.    Back in the day, regular network tv channels used to show these REALLY great/bad but fun to watch B-movies from the 40s thru the 70s.   Usually really late at night/wee hours.      I don't even see cable channels showing these forgotten movies now.  :(    They should create a channel JUST for these kinda films. They ranged from old horror, dramas, comedies, adventures, etc.      So anyway, if you can remember any you've seen & can find Youtube links or links from Imdb.com, that'd be fun. :)      Remember- we're talking lesser-known movies, not big blockbusters & the like. Stuff that you might see from B-list celebs or A-listers from before they got famous.      Two of many choices of mine:      "Gold" with Roger Moore. (1975)  I don't think this movie came close to being a hit, but I caught it recently on dvd.   Here's the opening sequence. At the time, Roger was in the midst of his Bond tenure so as a result, it even Looks like a Bond film...a low budget one:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJkB4bTVr...

20090220121251AACvlWw	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What's the worst injury you've ever had?	Or one with an interesting story behind it...feel free to tell in detail.         My worse injury(because I'm sure you want to know):      I believe I was 8 or 9 at the time...I was playing tag my neighbor and sister. At that time, our above ground pool hadn't had been finished...there were parts of the railing that hadn't been done yet. So, my sister and neighbor ran onto the pool...since I was "it", I had followed. They proceeded to run back out to the yard. I thought it would be faster to just jump off the pool where there was no railing. I fell awkwardly and my arm twisted as I landed on it...which broke the bones connecting to form my elbow in half. My sister and neighbor had ran out to the front yard when it happened. At that time the deck that connected to the house had also not been finished...there were no stairs. So, when I finally managed to get up the deck and inside...I found my mother. In which I spun the lower half of my arm around and said "Mom, look what I can do!". At that time I couldn't feel the pain. As we were leaving for the hospital, my neighbor and his mother argued about whether it was broken or dislocated. Not to mention, my sister whom got me clothes to take to the hospital...chose a dress that had tight sleeves(not the best choice). We decided to stop at a tiny hospital that was close to our house. They refused to help. We had to stop for gas so...by then, my arm began to hurt. Probably wasn't the best idea for me to flail it around so much. Anyways, we went to another hospital where I was rushed to the emergency room. I had surgery and spent my birthday in the hospital. They placed two metal pins to hold the bones together in my arm. While in the hospital, I played with the beds controls a lot and used the pager constantly for apple juice. I also made my family bring every stuffed animal I had to the hospital, lol. I don't think the nurse liked me very much.  The pins got infected and I had to have a second surgery...but, before that I had to see a man that had to squeeze the puss out of it. Which was gross and hurt a lot. My arm healed and the pins got taken out. End of story!

Women were awake   With lights and food. They entertained the band,   Not asking what the men had come to take   Or what strange tongue they spoke   Or why they came so suddenly through the land.      Now in the morning all the town is filled   With stories of the swift and dark invasion;   The women say that not one stranger told   A reason for his coming. The intrusion    Was not for devastation:   Peace is apparent still on hearth and field.      Yet all the city is a haunted place.   Man meeting man speaks cautiously. Old friends   Close up the candid looks upon their face.   There is no warmth in hands accepting hands;   Each ponders, 'Better hide myself in case   Those strangers have set up their homes in minds    I used to walk in. Better draw the blinds   Even if the strangers haunt in my own house'.         -----------------------------       MEANING :      The poem is about the way fear of strangers - 'the other' - erodes trust. One of the ways in which the poem conveys this so effectively is the use of time in the story-telling: the events cover only a night and a morning, and the poem ends in the uncertainty that is its subject. What could happen next? What should happen next? People who understand and practise the skills of conflict resolution would have good suggestions to make. One of the first things to attempt would be to contain the spread of the virus of fear.      The poem also draws attention to the role of women in conflict. These women (the suggestion is that these events are happening in a place and time in the past) fulfil the traditional role of serving. They provide a welcome for the 'swift', 'dark' invaders : is this the ancient law of hospitality, or the product of fear, or a practical response to defuse tension? The women don't ask their uninvited guests to explain themselves - but they do create a situation in which the strangers could, if they chose, tell the women why they have come. (The women imply that the difference in language could have been overcome.) The invaders are all men; and it's the men who have been invaded who put up the shutters and retreat into silence, no longer at ease with each other. The women, one feels, continue to communicate, even without words. Despite - or because of - their supporting role, the women are in a good position to start resisting the virus of fear. Again, what could, what should happen next?      [PLEASE COMMENT ON THE title,everything you have to say,but please be reasonable]

20090220142427AA0ijNo	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Is the music industry more about media hype than talent?	I think given what a fuss people make about some singers and rappers these days the music industry as far as making albums is more about media hype than actual talent. That must be why some people get voted over others and why some people make a splash (Beyonce) while others stumble about economically in the business (Amerie). I think the whole thing with some singers popping off the charts while others just struggle to make the top 10 in sales is because of marketing and advertising more than the quality of the singing voice or even the content of the lyrics. The people who have the best advertisers in their corner get the money while some of those even with great singing voices get looked over if they don't have effective advertising budgets. I think that is the case with everything though: the ability to impress the business bosses determines your economic success and it's a real battle getting to that point.

20090220143102AAFwZK0	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What is your favorite song by your favorite band/singer?  Are you up for this musical "game"?	First you must submit an answer, the answer should say "Edit".      After that search YOUTUBE for your favorite song by your favorite band or singer.  Post a link of the video.      Next read the answer above you and listen to THE WHOLE SONG, rate it on a scale from 1-10.  Describe the video and song in 10-15 words.      After you are finished feel free to listen to the songs of other people.  If you like their songs give them a thumbs up if you would give it a score of 6 or higher if they were above you, give a thumbs down if you would rate the song with a 5 or less.  If you decide to listen to my song give me a star.  :)      For the first answerer here is the song I picked by my favorite band, it isn't my favorite song from the band, it was too hard to choose.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...

20090220120121AAASS9c	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why do girls/women think hurting guys in the groin is a joke?	A girl in school said that she wanted to try something. I said sure and she told me to stand with my arms and legs spread and close my eyes. I did and she kicked me in the nuts! It hurt like hell. The girl and her friends just laughed at me. The teacher saw it and she just giggled. When I told my mother about it she just laughed and said that it was the oldest trick in the book and she did it to boys too when she was young. She said that young girls do this for fun and I have to be smarter to avoid it or get used to it. Is this right? Should I just accept that girls can hit guys in the balls for fun?

A couple kids at my school came up to me and started saying things like "oh you've changed so much you use to be such a good girl and now you try to act bad." That was so hypocritical of them because they have changed too. And one of them turned into a guy who does every girl he sees. I'm just so sick of being called out as a gothic girl.

20090203080327AAMt76n	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do you have a favorite, and notable, performance from a Horror movie?	Happy Tuesday!      Usually when I hear people talking about a Horror movie they just saw they talk about the more visual or technical aspects of it, like the special effects, gore or some of the "thrills" thrown in there.  But, at least to me, you really don't hear much about an actor or their performance in the film.  I guess that may be typical for a genre that has had many films that centered around a man in a white mask that groans as they walk slowly towards their next victim, but I'm sure there has to be more to it than that.      Can you think of any Horror film, past or present, where an actor's performance caught your attention and was maybe worthy of some praise?      Thanks!

20090203080259AASv4Yz	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Any ideas for this birthday present?	My best friend's birthday is on the 24th of february, and i need to come up with a nice and creative gift for her. I need to give her something as good as she gave me for my last birthday: she put all my writings, copies of my paintings, sketches, drawings and photographs into one book. Along with that, she got me a custom made silver pendant with my name engraved in it, and a pair of shoes I've had my eyes on for a while. Along with that, she planned me a completely amazing surprise party. She worked so hard 2 months before my birthday planning everything for me, and she did that all while her leg was broken! I need to show her how grateful I am for having her as my best friend, but i don't know how. I don't want to give all her material stuff, no matter how expensive, i just want something she could look at and know it was made specially for her. Any ideas please...?
