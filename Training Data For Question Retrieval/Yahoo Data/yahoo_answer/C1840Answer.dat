CT3t80suaa	I'm fairly sure that a standard external hard drive will not safely ( if at all ) plug into a standard PS2. PS2s and PCs run on different software, which are not compatible by default.
fH6Svydxaa	when you plug your samsung into the computer make sure the phone isnt on hold, then when the samsung is plugged in it should give you a selection of options on screen these are  media player, pc studio and mass storage, you can use either pc studio or mass storage.   Mass storage allows you to access the phone from 'my computer' and then copy files from your music folders, and then there is pc studio which connects it to the pc studio. i am taking it thats what you want right? so touch the pc studio option on the phone once it has been plugged in and in the top right hand corner there should be a little pc icon if so it is connected. now you can open the pc studio on the computer and on the window that opens on the pc it should say sgh-f480 connected in the bottom right hand corner.    and to tell if your computer IS transferring the little pc icon on your phone will be flashing red. thankyou.
nqbcJjHyaa	Right now over 50% of the laptops sold for college use are MacBooks. Apple has the highest rated tech support, highest reliability, & best battery life. On a MacBook you get almost all the software you need included (iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDvd, Garage Band, Quicktime, Safari, and more). The only thing you need to buy is a better word processor than the TextEdit that comes with it. MacBooks have built in wireless & webcams. You also get to not worry about the 1,000,000 windows viruses, there are no released MacOs X viruses. While Dell & Microsoft are laying off thousands of employees and closing down tech centers, Apple is selling more MacBooks than ever and making record profits. They must be doing something right!|`|2LHgmq97aa	Extremely high price..    You pay more for less Mac hardware than a PC...  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...

Linux and Vista were not hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered. Vista was next, and then Linux.  Macs are standardized with Cameras, if your Mac gets hacked, the hacker can turn on your camera with more ease.  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.  http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/so...  http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/03/2...  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...    VIRUSES  Mac OS X has viruses (and significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".  http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005  http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...  http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...    QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

Vanf51Pzaa	Setting an authorisation code is very standard.  Your problem is that you are not actually doing this!    $stip=username=$_SESSION['username'];    This line sets the username to the variable $stip or it would if you corrected it to this     $stip=$_SESSION['username'];      $query="SELECT authorization_code FROM Texts WHERE $stip;    This line instructs you to find an authorisation code based on username or would do if you corrected it to this;    $query="SELECT authorization_code FROM users WHERE username LIKE  ' " . $stip . " ' ";    I find that it is best to echo out my variables before using them in a SQL statement to make sure that I am asking what I think I am asking.    Now $result is an array so you can't set a variable from it.  You need more lines like this to extract the value    $result=mysql_query($query);            if($row = mysql_fetch_array($result))           {          $_SESSION['authorization_code'] = $row['authorization_code'];          }         else {echo "no authorisation_code found";}    You should probably bear in mind that, unless you have set things up so that it does not happen, you will have several users with the same username so this is not really going to work very well.

IPu3SN7eaa	Memory leaks.  When you run a program it uses a certain amount of memory. When you terminate the program, it should relinquish the memory it was using.  In Windows, this doesn't always happen. So, after a while there is less memory to go around, and so programs have less memory to use, and they need to share it. So, they take longer.  The best possible fix is to format your hard drive and install Linux.  Alternatively, you can set the defragger to run once a week.  You can look at your process list and see which programs suck the most memory, and try terminating them. BEWARE: explorer.exe is a memory hog, and you will want to kill it. DO NOT! If you do, you will have no desktop, no folder access, and basically, no computer.  All web browsers use a lot of memory, some more than others. Internet Explorer and Google Chrome use more than Mozilla Firefox.|`|A2ZWKTiMaa	- sounds like you have lots spyware and probably tons trojans infested your System32 and making use of your system resources.     cheap solution would be to download AVG Free Edition and something like Spyware Search & Destroy (free also) and try to get rid of whatever they picked up.    if you want something more I would suggest Nod32 $25/yr works like a charm. they also offers free 30 day full function demo which is also (free)    if you are more pc literate :), and there are nasty bugs that just wont go away go for a copy of Hijackthis (.exe) be very assure of what you are doing because it force-delete on things you tell it to : |    upgrades:    could use some ram upgrade as well. make sure you know what kind of ram your pc is using at the time. match the same type or even brand if possible.|`|3qRKJiXNaa	My guess is you have spyware that your antivirus doesn't pick up.

If you are running Windows Vista, its designed to defrag on its own and doesnt show a graphic or fragmentation visuals.      The Windows program has limiations like minimum 15% free space needed for a defrag, requires to be run manually and you have to ensure no other programs are running during the defrag.    Just ensure there is no power cut during the process.    I recommend a better defrag program like Diskeeper, which is automatic and once installed do the job in the background without needing any manual intervention. You can go about your normal PC work without any hassles even when it works. It defrags even if you have less than 15% free space and is much faster.

Disk Suite puts a range of tools at your fingertips to provide optimum system performance and improved stability and security.    Clean and Optimize  With Disk Suite you can safely Cleanup and Optimize your Windows? disks with a few simple mouse clicks. Disks can become bloated with temporary files, log files and other unnecessary data. The Cleanup and Optimize feature lets you safely remove unnecessary files and bloat from your PC without detailed knowledge of the Windows? file system. Removing bloat will not only make your PC perform better, but will also provide you with more free space to store your own files.    Disk Defrag  It's a fact that fragmented drives drain critical system resources, compromise the ability to access your files efficiently and slow down Windows? start-up.    Defragmentation is one of the best methods of boosting system performance by optimizing the way files are arranged on the disk. By reorganizing the files using the disk defrag feature, the process of accessing those files becomes more efficient, creates a greater amount of free space on the hard drive and allows you to use that space more effectively.    The defrag feature provides you with a powerful defragmentation tool that supports both NTFS and FAT file systems. Different levels of defragmentation are provided in case you just need a quick defrag or you want to schedule a complete optimization of your disk.    Backup & Restore  The Backup feature allows you to make copies of your data that can be restored in the event that files become lost, damaged or corrupted. Taking regular backup is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure you dont lose irreplaceable data and files such as photos, documents and other information.    The Backup feature in Disk Suite allows you to tailor the backup to meet your needs by selectively choosing the files to protect. It also allows you to restore files as needed, and verify your backup to ensure valuable data can be recovered as needed.    Diagnostics and Repair  Physical disk and file corruption is one of the main causes of data loss. The Repair feature allows you to actively monitor the health of your disk and file systems and where possible repair corruption and errors. It also allows you to schedule or directly run different types of disk integrity checks and identify future disk corruption so issues can be quickly discovered and resolved.    The repair feature performs integrity checks to check file system structure, surface scans to check for bad sectors and disk errors as well as repair hard drive problems. In addition the repair feature includes hard disk diagnostics and lets you review the information including the S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) status of your hard drive (if supported).    PC Tools Disk Suite Full Version Information  Current Version: 2009 (1.0.0.57)   File Size: 5,852 KB   Operating System: Designed for Windows? Vista? 32-bit, XP and 2000   Release Date: November 17, 2008   Designed to: Manage your disks for optimal performance and security.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Go with the cheapest with no bandwidth limit. The reason is throughput. They advertise 7mbps, but in reality, unless you are the ONLY person on the wire, you will have to share with others and your actual results will ALWAYS be less. How much less depends on how many users and what they are doing. I have a 256kbps DSL line and I have better performance than my 7mbps cable using neighbor! Cable modems have a problem which is built in to the topology. DSL is star topology, with the phone company acting like a giant hub with a wire going out to each user, just like a hub in your house connects several computers. Cable on the other hand is coaxial cable in which all users are on a BIG party line. The problem with a party line is first come first served and everyone waits for that person to finish before they can talk. and then the cycle repeats. The more people wanting to communicate the worse it gets for ALL on the wire. One last thing, servers. If you are doing file sharing, a peer to peer thing like Limewire, then you will quickly run afoul the restrictions on cable. MOST cable companies restrict use of servers because servers hog bandwidth, taking a disproportionate amount and making everyone else suffer. My neighbor did this, use P2P software, and within a month got a "cease and desist" notice from his ISP for running a server and hogging bandwidth. Since then, he throttles his P2P software to keep a lower profile and still share files. YMMV...

They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history".

As these High end Computers are easily exploited by Computer Manufacturers, and are ALWAYS overpriced. <br>  <br>  Lets go into the question of Building v.s. Buying Built<br>  <br>  Computer Manufacturers are good, when you need to buy a very cheap low end computer ($400-$800 dollars Computers). Its because Computer Manufacturers have parts that are not out of the market for good reason (those parts are old generation, faulty, low quality, etc). <br>  The Manufacturers are also good, when you need to buy multiple computers for a business, or for a school (more units they sell, more of the discount) As the Unit price decreases when you buy more units. It is also impossible for one person to build more than 5 computers that are exactly the same, within a couple of days. (There are exceptions, I can do it hehe). <br>  <br>  **Future-Proof**<br>  Is is never a Future proof computer, thus future proof is just meant as how long can you keep a computer before new applications or games will require you to need a faster computer. <br>  Most high end mainstream computers last 5 years.(you will need to upgrade things from time to time, but never the Motherboard, or Processor, otherwise known the essential Parts of the Computer) (If you upgrade any of those parts, its basically getting a brand new PC). <br>  <br>  Yes Technology upgrades and changes every two years or so. This is why you shouldn't go out and buy the best of the best (unless you really Really have the money and there is nothing else you can possibly think to spend the money on). <br>  <br>  Many people thus, aim for Mainstream Computers, that will last for at least 5 years, and then go out and buy/build another Mainstream Computer. Mainstream Computers range from $900-$1,800). Price is not too high, and the parts are not too cheap allowing for you to experience the new generation's technology at a fair price. (And Yes its preferred that you build your own Mainstream Computer) (exceptions include some rare deals on computers and lower Mainstream Computers) . <br>  <br>  When you build a computer, there are several benefits. You get hands on experience, and you have the sense of your blood and sweat put into it, making you care for it, and give the computer your personal quality and craftsmanship. You can easily upgrade, by switching a part or replace it with another that's new on the market. And there are parts you will recycle and reuse in your next computer build (Power Supply, Case, Hard Drives, Optical Drives, Cables, Fans, etc)  <br>  <br>  Laptops are a different story.  <br>   <br>  Hope that Helps.|`|h4mHBFONaa	There is no way to really thwart this. You have to get the latest and greatest. These days that will get you pretty far down the road. Processors and such are getting to be very fast, and system RAM is increasing. If you equip yourself with the latest components you won't be disappointed a few years down the road. Sure the parts will cost a bit more, however buying older parts won't give you the speed and reliability in future years.|`|837xgMwLaa	Do your research then build or get somebody to build it for you, i settled with Q6600, 4gb 1066mhz  ram, 8800GT & XP 64 bit. It runs any games i've tried on high (medium on Crysis - i like high fps).|`|4t0uQcUkaa	do research and find the one that is best for your needs and fits your budget|`|ZRi3hKP8aa	It's pretty much impossible to "future proof" a computer, like you said the power of computers increases very quickly. <br>  <br>  I tend to buy near top of the line, but not insanely expensive components for my computer. I try to build a system that supports the latest technology and has room for upgrading. Remember you can always upgrade to a faster video card, new processor or more memory.|`|uTFuciitaa	The trick is to not spend that much on your pc your better spending ￡700 on one and replacing it every 2-3 years rafther than buying some super moster ￡2000 rig as that way you constently have good performence. If you by really expensive pc's they get outdated so quickly that your better of not buying a very expensive one you may want to check out this web site as they have some good deals: www.dinopc.co.uk <br>  Hope this helps have a good everning <br>  The Nerd|`|XmD61yBpaa	The best things unfortunately and usually, cost the most (unless mass-produced)
uNV1NNyWaa	HP laptops are great. I've had mine for 4 years now, and no problems.|`|xdlsGvldaa	All lap tops and computers can be broken if care not taken in use and handling. Install a very good Internet Security like Norton Internet Security2009 to keep from getting virus's, malware, spyware that can damage your operating system. I prefer Toshiba Satellite lap tops, I have two and they have been trouble free, one is about 7 yrs. old the other about 2 yrs. old.<br>  Hope this helps|`|AA10003874	I would have to say that HP is a very good brand of laptops, although it depends what you want out of your laptop. Broken easily? This depends on how you take care of the laptop|`|abINltRAaa	Every person has a different preference. Me, I like HP better than toshiba. I work on computers and we have toshibas come in more often than HP needing work. You have to take care of it and not drop it and put it in a nice case. And if you are worried then get an extended warranty.|`|FZQwrrajaa	For $600 an HP would be your best bet, they are very nice computer, much better than Toshiba.|`|d20evTAwaa	i think hp's are good but sony is better|`|UgvKtDiAaa	I have always liked HP.  They have great customer support, and their computers are very reliable.  My 9 year old HP has never crashed on me, even with Windows XP.  In fact, I used it to answer this question.  In fact, thinking back, I have never had a major problem with my HP laptop.  It has lasted me through years of abuse, torture and neglect (the laptop, not me).  I would buy an HP over a Sony or Dell laptop any day, if all you wanted to know is people opinions.

Buy a new one its about time.|`|W1RUAUbPaa	First take it to bestbuy or something and figure out exactly what is wrong with it. If your hard drive crashed, then u should obviously go buy another hard drive, open your computer and pop the old one out and replace it with the new one|`|2cq46sDeaa	look up the error number on the internet - it will give you a clue as to what is wrong    or you could try booting from a linux live cd and then try running a disk check|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Yes your hard drive is dead, but the data can still be accessed via tools (which I cannot remember right now).

AA11434745	Your approach is wrong. Any idiot can clear his cache and thus defeat your efforts. Anyone with half a brain in his head is going to figure that out inside of 10 seconds.<br>  <br>  A stronger way to accomplish what you want is to record the IP address of the user and store the time of his vote in a MySQL database.

If you want the colors to really match then you should find a photo where you're wearing deeper hues or maybe tweak the profile colors to brighten them up?|`|dEyKgKs9aa	it looks good.<br>  but a little too bright for your profile.|`|0VLirxVtaa	Yea it does.

AA11434745	Nope.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You can create your own website on your own computer for completely free (except for the computer, internet connection, electricity, etc.)  <a href="http://webdingers.endoftheinternet.org/" rel="nofollow">http://webdingers.endoftheinternet.org/</a> is running on a little Acer desktop with free software (XAMPP for the server, PHP_Fusion for the CMS and <a href="http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndns/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndn...</a> for the subdomain name and port redirection.  (It's not supposed to do anything, although you can use it if you want - it's just to prove it can be done for free.)<br>  <br>  Free .com names are in the aisle with free new cars and free houses.  (That aisle is in a supermarket in another universe.)|`|AA12351337	No, you want a domain like that, you need to pay.<br>  Webs.com offers a .com for around $30 a year.<br>  <br>  To make money.  Make a site that people will want to go to.  A blog, layouts, something that will drive traffic to your page.  Then go to sites like www.linkshare.com, and www.cj.com and sign up for affiliate Cost Per Click programs.  Then whenever someone clicks on a banner, and in some cases, click then buy something (Amazon.com for example), you get a commission.<br>  Also, Google Adsense offers Cost Per Click.  Everytime someone clicks on a link, even if they don't like the page, you get paid something.<br>  <br>  To let people advertise on it.  Set up a subscription type deal through Paypal.com.  Then they sign up for the subscription, which Paypal takes care of.  Then you place the ad they provide for you on your site.<br>  Make different payment amounts.  So the more the person pays to advertise, then better the placement they get on your site.  But you still need a lot of traffic to your site.  They won't pay you if they aren't going to make any money from your site.<br>  I suggest Google Analytics (which is free), they track the traffic to your site, and where they are from in the world.  This would be the proof of the traffic to your site.|`|4OoxyWWhaa	You have no chance of getting free .com website.<br>  You can choose co.cc instead of that<br>  For example<br>  <a href="http://parkavithai.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://parkavithai.co.cc</a> instead of <a href="http://parkavithai.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://parkavithai.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Choose free web host here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/95739.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.000webhost.com/95739.html</a> is a free web host service where you can create a free website with a <br>  <br>  advantage of choosing your own domain name not sub domain.<br>  <br>  For Free domain name<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.co.cc/?id=156323" rel="nofollow">http://www.co.cc/?id=156323</a>|`|aueUxJ4Kaa	Yeah, you'll never find a free domain or a one-time-fee. However, you can go and buy your own web-server, meaning purchasing the actual hardware, if you are really that interested in it.<br>  <br>  As to $$, the easiest way is ads, and you can just pitch the companies themselves if you want. Email some publicity offices.|`|m18E3CMDaa	Domain names are not free. And the fee is not a one time fee. You sign a contract for a set number of years, then renew, if you wish, when the contract ends.<br>  <br>  As for making money, try online ad services like Google Adsense.
cyhYNEhCaa	it could be bad ram, if you have two stocks of ram, turn off the computer, take one stick out, and see if the problem persists, if it still does, swap ram sticks, and try it again... if it only does it with ram stick "a" and not "b" you found the problem... also look at the capacitors on the motherboard, there are a lot of problems with some older machines-<br>  www.badcaps.net<br>  <br>  also could be the video card drivers- my computer worked fine just like you said, unless i tried to play 2 of the games i owned, it would lock up or reboot... sounds like you may be having the same issue, like the internet is fine because it does not use advanced features from your graphics card, but when you try to edit video or movies, the video card needs to do more, so it runs into a problem-<br>  <br>  find out what kind of video card you have, go to the manufacturer's website, (probably nvidia or ATI) and download the latest drivers.  make sure you select the proper operating system.<br>  you can check which drivers you are currently running by going to start-settings-control panel-system-hardware-device manager, then click display adapter, then RIGHT CLICK the video card and click driver- (the driver version i have on the machine I am typing on now is 6.14.10.9424) <br>  <br>  good luck

AVG couldnt remove it, Avast couldnt remove it, Norton said i had to mess around with my computers registry to remove it. But when i downloaded Malwarebytes, after a 1 hour scan it removed the rogue program without any hassle. Its easily the best.|`|LThcbFoGaa	I would recommend the free version of Avast! AV. It includes resident protection, which will watch over your computer and warn you if anything tries to get in. It's not super-annoying, doesn't interfere with any other programs, and best of all: it's free! If you'd rather go with a paid program, I'd recommend Kaspersky Internet Security, which does basically the same thing.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't go with Avast, I would steer clear of Norton and McAfee. Although they will work, I've always found that they both slow down my PCs and get really annoying. AVG free edition is also an option, but I've found that it often interferes with certain programs and can cause problems on its own.|`|7OcUDAfYaa	The previous person beat me to the punch.

I wouldn't have bought it to begin with, but you can insist on either the key or your money back (or a Vista DVD with a valid key).|`|g62ATenqaa	No, definitely not and that would be highly illegal anyway. This just highlights one of the dangers of buying second user.

uJBnZWtcaa	Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, Corel and a few other big software makers belong to BSA (Business Software Alliance)....a group that gives rewards for reporting pirated software.  If you're online and open a program, the program usually communicates with its homebase....that's why the update messages popup.  In December, a 24 year old from Texas, who'd been selling since he was 19, got 3 years in federal prison, a $10,000 fine and all of his stuff seized including a $40,000 car.  You'd probably get less time if you're not selling but you'd still get a big fine.  The big boys don't like loosing $$$$$.  Pirate Bay's court case started last week.<br>  <br>  Software companies are looking for big-time losses.  They're more likely to go after Yahoo for supporting piracy than after 1 guy giving away software.....but it would depend on how much you'd given away and/or if they felt like making an example out of you to scare the others.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	yes there are ways they can find out if the computer they are on is connected at all to the internet. well how does thousands of dollars in fines and/or time in prison sound|`|xnCizA7Daa	yes they can find out and 250,000 dollar fine and five years in prison|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you sell it or advertise it publicly, of course they can find out.  What's the punishment?  Whatever they can get the judge or jury to award them.  Giving it away free costs them a sale every time you do it.  (The court assumes that anyone getting it free from you [and from them, and from them, etc.] would have bought it from them.)  A few million isn't a large settlement in these cases.<br>  <br>  Oh, and your provider may blackball you - that means no more internet for you - possibly for the rest of your life.

KFVaZSfqaa	When your computer freezes up, one of the major causes is registry errors and corrupt files.  The registry controls all the information the computer uses to communicate with software, hardware, and device drivers.  When there are errors in the system the information cannot be computed leading the CPU to freeze up or crash.  You may even see the Windows "Blue screen of death".<br>  <br>  My recommendation is to scan your computer with a top flight registry cleaner.  This is a lot easier and cheaper than bringing it to the computer repair shop.  You can get a free scan and diagnosis at <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.registry-clean-up.net/why-does-my-computer-freeze.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.registry-clean-up.net/why-doe...</a>|`|GxXpvNIwaa	The most common cause of computer freezes is a corrupt registry. The Computer registry is a database that stores all of your computer<br>  settings. The computer registry becomes more complex as you use your computer. The more programs you use the greater the chance your<br>  computer registry will develop errors and become bloated over time. Without cleaning the registry on a regular basis it is very likely that your PC will freeze.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the Windows registry improves the performance of your computer and will reduce the number of PC freezes. The Registry cleaner cleans the registry and frees up Windows registry space.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm</a><br>  Completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse|`|D4jdJl7Oaa	put computer back in oven.|`|F9XhsIj3aa	run a temp file cleaner like ccleaner, that can make things a little better|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>

There are just a few rules you need to follow:<br>  What’s allowed: Feel free to modify and enhance your text with any standard HTML (<B>, <A HREF>, <IMG SRC>, <FONT>, <TABLE>,etc.). Keep in mind that there is a character limit for each field, so make sure to leave enough room to close your tags (otherwise you might mangle the remaining code of your page).<br>  What’s not allowed: Applets, frames, layers, forms, scripts, XML, or any mouse-over events (they’ll be stripped from your code automatically). Adding elements to the page that cover Friendster advertising is also a no-no.<br>  New to HTML?<br>  Don’t worry, HTML is incredibly easy to learn. All you have to do is surround whatever text you want to modify with tags. Like this:<br>  The Very Basic Basics<br>  What You Type  What You Get<br>  <B>Men</B>  Men<br>  <I>Are</I>  Are<br>  <U>from</U>  from<br>  <S>Men are from Mars</S>  Men are from Mars<br>  You can even combine tags (just remember to next each pair of tags)<br>  <B><I><U>Mars Needs Women</U></I></B>  Mars Needs Women<br>  And That’s Not All<br>  <CENTER></CENTER>  Centers text or image.<br>  <A HREF="URL HERE"></a>  Makes whatever text/image it surrounds into a link.<br>  <IMG SRC="IMAGE URL HERE" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" />  Add an image, using optional WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes to control the sizing. Note: IMG code is stand-alone (no seperate close tag necessary).<br>  <FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="6" COLOR="green">Little Green Men</font>  Alter the size, style, and color of text.<br>  Cross-browser friendly fonts: Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, Webdings.<br>  Cross-browser friendly colors: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow. <br>  <br>  <br>  ----HTML and CSS code that you add to the Interests section of your Home page (Profile 1.0) can override the MySpace Profile Themes, but it can also conflict and produce undesirable results such as:<br>  <br>  - Your Profile page may load slowly.<br>  <br>  - Parts of your Profile may be missing or hidden.<br>  <br>  - Your Profile may be messed up: everything’s on the right or the left, or there’s a big space in the middle of your page, or everything is shifted down.<br>  <br>  - Your background image doesn’t display.<br>  <br>  <br>  Clearing existing HTML and CSS code from your Profile<br>  <br>  1.

The only thing i have against it' It uses a lot of memory. But if i had to pick between the two it would have to be bit defender over avg. But now i am talking about AVG free. I have never used the paid version of AVG. But i have used the free version. I found it to be the sorriest AV i ever had. Avg free has no real time protection. If it detects at all it will only detect it "after" it's on your hard drive. Then it's to late. A good AV doesn't let anything on your hard drive before it detects it. The job of a good AV is to slam the door shut before the virus attaches itself to your system files and does damage. I used bit defender and it worked well. But i didn't like it because of it's memory usage and because of the trouble i went through getting it to download. I didn't like the customer support because i paid for the AV and when i couldn't get it to work right they wanted to charge me 10 bucks to call them for support. There on line support is almost non existent.  I deleted it and went back to Kaspersky and have never look back since. Let no one talk you into AVG free. If they tell you that it will protect your computer there either lying' clueless or a hacker/virus writer. Norton is a memory hog that will attach it's self to your computer and when you decide to delete it it will refuse to go. It acts like a Trojan when you try to delete it. McAfee. No better. A memory hog that doesn't detect as good as advertised.|`|89PlrybAaa	Among the two AV's you've given AVG is good.

Think of the threads as separate "sub-processors" under the control of a master.|`|WKUv05hpaa	You probably have a single core. HT allows a single core to "appear" to be two cores.

IzCCoKNoaa	To Make Your Computer Play the .wav Sounds with Windows Media Player (Recommended):<br>  <br>  When you click on the sound file links in your browser, it will automatically download a short .wav file that will automatically launch your default media player.  Often the default media player is Real Player or Real Juke Box.  It is usually simpler for you to use Windows Media Player to listen to the .wav files. To make Windows Media Player your default .wav file player, follow the below instructions: (this if for Windows Media Player version 6.4.07. - Procedures for different versions may vary.)<br>  <br>  1.     Open Windows Media Player on your computer by going to Start- Programs- Accessories menu.  <br>  <br>  2.      If it is not there, then go to Start, Run, and type " mplayer2.exe" and it should pop up.  <br>  <br>  3.     In Windows Media Player go to View, options, Formats tab, and select Windows Media File and Windows Audio File.  Selecting these boxes should make the Windows Media player your default player for .wav sounds.  <br>  <br>  4)      After listening to a sound, do not close Windows Media Player because you will need it again to listen to the other sounds.  If you do close it, it will take more time for your computer to re-open the Windows Media Player the next time you want to listen to another sound.  Instead of closing it, click on the web page, and the Windows Media Player will move to the back of the web page.  You can also minimize your media player.

The only disadvantage is that you aren't really able to see when you make a semantic mistake, which becomes a pain when trying to fix problems - especially in HTML.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider downloading or purchasing more advanced text-editing software. The more advanced ones will not only include syntax highlighting, but will also help you debug. <br>  <br>  A good free program would be, for example, jEdit. If you're willing to spend money, many people use Adobe Dreamweaver, which is a great tool for new programmers. I'd also recommend you try using phpDesigner, which is a bit less expensive, and allows you to test more than just HTML - you can also test PHP and other languages if you decide to learn them.|`|2jwWYKbQaa	Nope, notepad can make sites as simple or as advanced as your skills.<br>  notepad2 <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.htm...</a> has syntax highlighting (html tags, css, and javascript are different colors) and a lot of other features.|`|pwkeo7tTaa	Nope, you can use notepad, it will come out just as good, as long as you know what you're doing.

Try to scan for virus and then try to open again the login page and even then if the page is not opening then try to install the patch of the Operating System.<br>  Am sure after this is done.. your problem will be resolved..<br>  The other reason could be with the coding of the loginpage but am sure the problem could be with the version of the browser.. check with the version once and then make an attempt.

Hibernating it today and resuming it tomorrow is the same as working continuously, which eats up memory and slows things down.<br>  <br>  2) You need to have the same amount of GBs free on your hard disk as your RAM.<br>  <br>  3) Hibernating enables you to quickly resume working the next day, however, some USB devices might not function if plugged again, and may require a restart.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and <br>  "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get<br>  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|xP1xmSeaaa	Try restarting your computer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.softwarepatch.com/network-security/flashdownload-security.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.softwarepatch.com/network-sec...</a>|`|owxFbRnNaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..<br>  <br>  you can try a different browser...<br>  <br>  these will help you...<br>  <br>  1.

They are both available at www.slysoft.com and are made to work as a team.  I have used many other programs that are much more in-depth and do both the cracking and burning, but I've decided to stick with these two for a few important reasons.<br>  <br>  First, once you've bought them you NEVER have to purchase new releases to take advantage of new features, fixes, and upgrades (I think I bought them from Slysoft during one of their specials, about $50 total).  When there's a new version, usually one every few weeks for new release cracks, slysoft sends you an email and link to the download site.  You can also set the programs to auto-update.<br>  <br>  Next, both programs are faster and easier to use than other programs.  I have slower drives but still rip and burn a movie in 10-30 minutes depending on the size of the original and the quality of my copy.  AnyDVD can be set to run all the time, and any disc (CD or DVD) you insert will be free from all copyright protection.  CloneDVD is just as user-friendly: you just select a source, remove any unwanted titles-I like to remove all previews-and click a button to move to the next page where you can remove subtitle and audio tracks if you're short on space.  Click Go a few more times and you're on your way!<br>  <br>  I do know that these programs can act goofy if you have certain types of drives (mostly off-brand stuff), but there's a really easy way to fix these issues if you do encounter them. <br>  <br>  Check out the free trials and if you have issues I'd be happy to help you!|`|f66183827939547c2210068adc4e2651aa	Try plato dvd copy or try avs dvd copy

Pretty close would be the Thinkpads with ATI HD 3470 graphics and the pink Fujitsu with Nvidia Geforce 9300M.<br>  <br>  More serious gaming needs a more powerful GPU starting with at least the Geforce Go 8600GT or ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2600.
zorYTX59aa	The famous "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER <br>  AVAILABLE" message is generally the result of any stupid<br>  software claiming that they can "accelerate" video buffering.<br>  This includes crap like GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI<br>  Fire, Diamond Fire, and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at Google and Macromedia know this, and state<br>  that in their own FAQs about "Flash". Thus, if you have any <br>  type of "accelerator"...dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a useless utility like that on your computer, <br>  there is something that's interfering with YouTube, therefore <br>  please consider these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  Flashers swear by 9.45. Think of those two as WindowsXP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE.

5imMgvHdaa	I know this looks like a scam, and there are several scam sites out there.  Try this site instead.  There have actually been a few articles on it lately in well-respected sources like Wired, NPR, CNN, The New York Times, and MSNBC. All you have to do is fulfill ONE offer (lots of free trials are available, so it doesn’t cost anything if you cancel before they start billing you.  Just make sure you get credited for it before canceling.  At the most, you'll pay a buck), and then get a few other people to do the same thing. They seem to be a real marketing company which is actually giving out the free stuff they promise.

However, that option means a proprietary card from the laptop maker.<br>  <br>  Unlike in desktop PCs there are NO retail internal graphics cards for laptops because most have no expansion option or space at all.|`|6PSZDDrHaa	if your computer is a desktop pc then you should be able to upgrade it.

Personally I prefer AMD.  If you are thinking AMD look into socket AM2, it is the newest version of the Athlon64s and is the future.  Cost and speed are compareable to socket 939 chips.

AA10146251	Save yourself alot of time and stress and remove McAfee as it is junk just like Nortons which is even worse.  <br>  <br>  Want an antivirus program that I use an is used by the Government of China, go to: www.filseclab.com  <br>  <br>  Being a clinical psychiatrist I have a moral and legal obligation to keep my pc 100% clean from all virus/spyware/malware.<br>  <br>  I tested every free and purchase antivirus system known. An I found only one that actually works 100%. Never had a virus or spyware in my system in nine years. <br>  <br>  Go to, www.filseclab.com and download thier Twister AntiTrojan Virus program. (You will have to pay a small one time fee). You will never have to pay an annual fee for updates, support or new versions. The one time fee is for life. ($29.99)<br>  <br>  The software company is located in Beijing, China. They have excellent support, frequent large signature updates an as always all new versions are free. No annual fee for anything. <br>  <br>  Comes with a real time scanner that really works. Actually I am quite amazed over the nine years how well it works. <br>  <br>  Scans memory on startup.<br>  Real time scanning in the background.<br>  Open any webpage with an embedded trojan/spyware or malware and scanner will clean on the spot. An It is really removed from your system. <br>  <br>  Download any kind of program from zips, all compressed files, software files, music, etc,etc, an if there is a hidden embedded trojan,spyware,malware, this program will stop the download and clean. An will advise you to end the download. <br>  <br>  Will even find a virus in the installer wizard, like "Wise Installer". And will stop the installation while it is being installed and clean. Plus this program always will trace back who installed the trojan. <br>  <br>  I had a trojan in and wizard installer. Twister caught the trojan and stopped the installation. I wrote the origianl company and told them the wizard installer had an embedded trojan to steal your data. The company now uses thier own installer.<br>  <br>  You can't beat this software for a one time purchase fee only. Actually I don't know of any antivirus progam that even comes close to this state of the art technology. <br>  <br>  All I can say it is worth the one time fee. Your pc cost alot of money and you don't want it destroyed. Plus your privacy is protected at all times. <br>  <br>  There is nothing in it for me to praise this program. I tell it like it is. If it is garbage then I will say so.|`|b299160bde102239fc74ef2b56c040caaa	are you sure it is disabled, mines does the same sometimes; it is black and when i open it , it is enabled.

7d0d49fcc4d156e0ad392d62698113f0aa	Hola! Tu problema debe de estar relacionado con el Service Pack 2 de Windows (en especifico con el Firewall) o con tu antivirus. <br>  <br>  En Windows ve a "Inicio"===>Panel de control, una vez aquí ve la opción "Centro de seguridad". Aquí ve hasta abajo a la opción que dice Firewall de Windows. Te aparecerá una ventanita con algunas opciones, en la parte de arriba hay una pesta?a que dice "Excepciones", da clic aquí.<br>  <br>  En esta parte se encuentran todos los programas a los cuales Windows esta permitiendo su ejecución. Muy probablemente el "Ares" no esta aquí, así que da clic en "Agregar Programa", en esta parte simplemente busca el programa (Ares), seleccionalo y da clic en aceptar y listo! Ya no debes tener mas problema. Este tipo de programas denominados "p2p" utilzan 2 protocolos principalmente los cuales son TCP y UDP. Estos 2 te permites recibir y enviar al mismo tiempo información de la red. Pero por seguridad no es bueno que permitas que todo lo que quiera entrar a tu computadora lo haga y es por esto que Windows bloquea todas las entradas hacia tu computadora para evitar que haya algún intruso dentro de tu equipo.<br>  <br>  Si esto no funciona, prueba con tu antivirus, el cual tambien debe de estar bloqueando el acceso al programa. Aquí depende mucho del Antivirus que tengas pero debes de buscar alguna opción que hable sobre Firewall o sobre acceso de programas.<br>  <br>  Ojalá y mi explocación te haya servido.<br>  <br>  Saludos!<br>  <br>  Fer G|`|KCNP51Koaa	Bajate la nueva version de ares esta buenisima, la version de ares que tienes debe ser antigua y por lotanto quedo out! bajate la nueva y listo y si tienes antivirus o algo asi procura no blokear el programa ares.<br>  Desacarga el nuevo aki: <a href="http://ares.uptodown.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ares.uptodown.com/</a><br>  Espero que te sirva mi respuesta ;)<br>  Adios!|`|3gVcXG04aa	baja la nueva version del sitio de ares, esta genial y ya funcionado... las anteriores se bloquearoin, ademas, revisa que no este bloqueadopo tu antivirus o muro de fuego
1b2b94f7d932199d15a70af9f7325dddaa	here are two ways to uninstall the Yahoo! Toolbar for Internet Explorer.<br>  <br>  Option 1: Via the toolbar()<br>  <br>  Select "Uninstall" from the Pencil button (Toolbar Settings). <br>  Click "Uninstall" on the uninstall page. <br>  Close any open IE windows. <br>  When you restart Internet Explorer, Yahoo! Toolbar will no longer be present.<br>  <br>  <br>  Option 2: Via the Control Panel<br>  <br>  Click the Windows "Start" button. <br>  Select "Control Panel" from the "Settings" menu. <br>  Double-click on "Add/Remove Programs". <br>  Scroll down and click on the "Yahoo!

Please start IE again after closing all your open IE browser windows and it will no longer be present.<br>  <br>  If you follow these steps and Yahoo! Toolbar is still present, make sure you've closed all your open IE browser windows. Due to Internet Explorer being integrated with Windows, you might need to restart your computer to fully uninstall Yahoo! Toolbar.<br>  <br>  If you like the functionality of Yahoo! Toolbar, instead of removing Yahoo! Toolbar, you can hide Yahoo! Toolbar or move Yahoo! Toolbar so that it takes up less space in your browser.|`|AA10084738	U hv four options to do this.<br>  First click on pencil near the search bar on yahoo toolbar and select uninstall.<br>  Second, follow this path.

228589e5ca66622c9bdec981d39222e2aa	It depends on how you are opening WordPerfect. Here is a possible solution.<br>  1. Right click on the wordperfect <br>  2. Click on Properties<br>  3. Check what does the "Target" field read or the "Location" field read in the property window.<br>  4. If its a shortcut then click on "Find Target".<br>  5. If it lands up in C:\ drive, it means that your Shortcut is wrong. To fix that you can go to  C:\Program Files\Wordperfect directory.<br>  Then find an exe called wordperfect.exe. Right click on it and Click "Send To" and then Select "Desktop (Create ShortCut".<br>  Go to desktop and  then try opening wordperfect.<br>  6. If the solution above doesnt work, I guess you will have to uninstall wordperfect and Re Install it.|`|bdd85ece2158f2891e3cc6046cb57b8daa	i don't have wordperfect so i can't guarantee anything i say, but I think it's the program itself that asks you "what file do u want to open with wordperfect" when it starts.

So I assumed WordPerfect acts the same way.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S.

AA10312136	The main differences are these:<br>  <br>  1) Java can be compiled to token code that can run portably across any platform that supports a Java Virtual Machine, which includes most modern computer platforms.  It can also be compiled to native code, for better flexibility.<br>  <br>  2) Java is an object based language with facilities to write and extend existing libraries.<br>  <br>  3) Java has automatic memory management built in.  <br>  <br>  All and all, Java is a very structured, object based, object oriented programming language.  On the down side, all of its advantages across many platforms can also be drawbacks in some particular situations.

You can however reinstall "over" it (you're not uninstalling it though, so there's a difference).<br>  <br>  The procedure goes this way:<br>  <br>  1. Restart your PC, and go to the BIOS setup. Look for the part there where you can select the "boot sequence", and make sure CD drive is booted first before the hard drive. Save and restart (you may now insert the installation disks).<br>  2. If you've done the first procedure corrrectly, you should see it load the Windows installation disk. From there you can follow the prompts in installing your Windows XP.<br>  <br>  Be warned though, if you have other softwares (i.e. MS Office, Adobe Photoshop, etc) who have installed certain files in the C:\WINDOWS directory (most softwares do -- in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32), then it is not safe to simply re-install. When re-installing, what Windows XP does is to delete the whole C:\WINDOWS\ folder and create a new one. However, other softwares who have installed files there are also removed (thus these softwares become useless -- meaning you have to repair their installation).<br>  <br>  You can choose to Repair Windows (to replace damaged files) instead (but this is again literally not uninstalling), or do a complete installation of Windows.<br>  <br>  A complete install though, would mean that you'll have to delete the partition, create a new partition and install (this can also be done through this installation process). Of course, if you're using other softwares, you'll have to re-install them too. But the advantage of this is you get a clean install of everything. It's like starting on a new life or something.

5Ifet5HPaa	For Developers:<br>  1) MCAD: Based on .NET 1.1. This certification is for those who develop Windows / Web applications using .NET 1.1. You can choose your programming language to be either VB.NET or C#. You will have to take both Windows Development exam and a Web Development exam in addition to an elective course (I advise you to take the SQL Server 2000 programming). A webservice and components exam is also required. <br>  <br>  2) MCSD: You can upgrade from MCAD to MCSD by taking the exam 70-310 (Analysing Requirements). I do not advise those with little development experience to take this course (or its exam) cz they will not benefit from it unless they have at least 3 years of development working experience in a corporate environment.<br>  <br>  3) MCPD: This is one of Microsoft's "new generation certifications". It is based on .NET 2.0. I advise to discard the previous two certifications, unless you want to develop applications on .NET 1.1 rather than .NET 2.0. With MCPD you can choose to be certified as a web developer OR a windows developer (the thing which was not possible in MCAD). <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|3de4445cca5e6d18da184bcc86cc680caa	Go through this link , you can find all the information regarding certifications...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sgeek.com/content/section/35/93/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgeek.com/content/section/35/...</a>

DaA0Buxtaa	What you are trying to do is known as Wireless IDS, short for Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems.  They range from the open source (ie cheap) to the ridiculously expensive.  My suggestion, on detecting when people are bringing in wireless clients or trying to slap a wireless network onto your network is to use a solution similar to the one referenced in this artcile on Tom's Hardware.  It will outline how you can hack a Linksys WRT54G wireless router, slap a copy of Snort onto it, and scan away for clients, access points, and any attacks you may want to prevent.  It's more than I can explain here and get's pretty complex pretty fast.  Either way, I hope it helps.|`|AA10553182	I think you  are freaking out, what do you mean who is trying to bring clients into your area? what are you talking about. if someone tries to break into your system, they will not log to your router so dont even bother looking at the log. the best thing you can do is just keep updates, defender and ativirus up to date, if someone wants to break in, they will and you wont even noticed, a trojan can pull all the info on your system without the need of someone logging in. the only way you can add extra security is getting a good firewall, not the windows one or the built in on your router, go ahead and spend one thousand plus in a efficient firewall and have someone qualified to configure it for you.<br>  good luck.

zGA8U8pHaa	ASP.NET stands for "Active Server Pages .NET" and is Microsoft technology that runs on the .NET platform.  Most developers use Visual Studio .NET to develop .NET applications.  Visual Studio is not free, so you would have to purchase it.  I believe there are also some alternatives to Visual Studio out there.  The nice thing about ASP.NET is that is it is basically HTML with a code behind page.  You can create the code behind page in a variety of languages (e.g. Visual Basic.NET, C#, etc.)<br>  <br>  JSP is JavaServer Pages and is Sun technology.  It is more platform independent.  A JavaServer Page may be broken down into:<br>  -static data such as HTML, <br>  -JSP directives such as the include directive, <br>  -JSP scripting elements and variables, <br>  -JSP actions, <br>  -custom tags<br>  <br>  I've only ever used .NET, but there are definitely sites out there that use JSP.  There's a lot more information about both technologies available online, if you need to know more.
tGbqQxmVaa	Your most obvious difference is that ASP.NET uses Visual Basic.NET and JSP uses Java.  Both are used to make dynamic web pages.  There is no major difference in the learning curve between them.  If you know .NET or Java, choose the corresponding language and start learning that, however, I don't think JSP is very popular anymore as a programming language.<br>  <br>  WG|`|KgYZ1Yfkaa	The choice between ASP.net and JSP.net depends upon your own personal strengths. If you have a great liking for java and java programming JSP is for you.<br>  The advantages of JSP over ASP are:<br>  I) The dynamic part in JSP is written in Java and not Visual Basic or other MS specific language. So it is more powerful to use.<br>  ii) It is portable to other operating systems and non-Microsoft Web servers.<br>  <br>  JSP's are a combination of HTML and special JSP tags. These JSP tags can contain Java Code.<br>  As far as ASP is concerened it is an ideal environment for web based commercial solutions. <br>   You don't have to learn a new language. ASP pages are written in languages such as VB Script, Jscript and Pearl Script. This allows both the web designers and application programmers to leverage their exiusting skills.

Output caching simply requires you to add a directive at the top of the pages or controls you wish to cache. When cached in this way, the .NET framework simply caches the output (the rendering markup) and serves requests from the cache instead of rendering the page & accessing the database. For more on output caching you can check:<br>  <a href="http://www.15seconds.com/issue/040518.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.15seconds.com/issue/040518.ht...</a><br>  <br>  You can also resort to the Cache API through which you can cache any object (for example Collections of data, DataTables, anything). This API supports dependencies meaning that you can mark the cache as invalid when a certain dependency (such as an XML file or SQL Server table) is modified. When the cache is invalid, the object is fetched again from its source.<br>  <a href="http://www.devx.com/dotnet/Article/27327" rel="nofollow">http://www.devx.com/dotnet/Article/27327</a><br>  <a href="http://www.beansoftware.com/ASP.NET-Tutorials/Caching-Optimization.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.beansoftware.com/ASP.NET-Tuto...</a><br>  <br>  The above two methods can be used to hide the "sins" of your data tier. However if you want to optimise your data tier, thats another issue. This is where you can resort to a multitude of strategies, starting with proper indexing, Indexed Views (in case of costly joins), FileGroups to implement different database objects on different disks...<br>  <br>  This is a very wide question. I know that my answer barely scratches the surface. Whole books have been written on enhancing performance.

GIFbERnjaa	yes they can!! <br>  The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Each computer (known as a host) on the Internet has at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from all other computers on the Internet. When you send or receive data (for example, an e-mail note or a Web page), the message gets divided into little chunks called packets. Each of these packets contains both the sender's Internet address and the receiver's address. Any packet is sent first to a gateway computer that understands a small part of the Internet. The gateway computer reads the destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent gateway that in turn reads the destination address and so forth across the Internet until one gateway recognizes the packet as belonging to a computer within its immediate neighborhood or domain. That gateway then forwards the packet directly to the computer whose address is specified.<br>  <br>  Because a message is divided into a number of packets, each packet can, if necessary, be sent by a different route across the Internet. Packets can arrive in a different order than the order they were sent in. The Internet Protocol just delivers them. It's up to another protocol, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to put them back in the right order.<br>  <br>  IP is a connectionless protocol, which means that there is no continuing connection between the end points that are communicating. Each packet that travels through the Internet is treated as an independent unit of data without any relation to any other unit of data. (The reason the packets do get put in the right order is because of TCP, the connection-oriented protocol that keeps track of the packet sequence in a message.) In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication model, IP is in layer 3, the Networking Layer.<br>  <br>  The most widely used version of IP today is Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4). However, IP Version 6 (IPv6) is also beginning to be supported. IPv6 provides for much longer addresses and therefore for the possibility of many more Internet users. IPv6 includes the capabilities of IPv4 and any server that can support IPv6 packets can also support IPv4 packets.|`|7c36c34bff08b99bebd13a6b951e7b73aa	Yes they will know since it is initiated using your sim card.

Search for "index.dat" on your computer, you will need to download Super WinSpy to view them.<br>  <br>  If a user has used advanced tools to erase usage tracks, program logs, registry history and the index.dat files, restore is more difficult.

AA10585364	The Dell Studio fills in the gap between the consumer entry level Inspiron and gamer enthusiast type XPS. The Studio takes some styling cues from XPS (for example, the slot load drive, barrel hinge, touch sensitive media buttons and fingerprint reader). The Studio also offers an option for an LED display as well as a backlit keyboard. The Studio offers the ATI HD3450 as a graphics option whereas the Inspiron only offers integrated video, only important if you like playing a few games here or there. Personally, i prefer the design of the Studio over the Inspiron. But for general use, the Inspiron is a great choice and nicely designed as well, not to mention it's lighter.
7Az7f7Vtaa	Nope. Sorry, won't run on a 512mb graphics card. The graphics look sensational but the downside is you need a mother-boarder of a graphics card to run it at full speed and really enjoy it. If you're unsure, download the demo from gamespot.com for free and see if (like mine) it gives a messgae saying "low graphics memory".    I 4 one got tired of upgrading my PC and went and got myself an XBOX 360 graphics look way better and Crysis is hopefully coming later this year.

Ahora, si tienes miedo de que tu informacion se pierda, haz una particion de respaldo, es decir, que en esa nueva paraticion pongas todos tus documentos importates y asi borrar la particion del Linux con la confiansa de que ya tienes la informacion de Windows respaldada. <br>  <br>  Si todavia tienes Kubuntu o Ubuntu descarga el programa QPARTED para que manipules las particiones que tines.

kuFqdT9maa	yes i have downgraded loads of laptops from vista to xp but i call vista to xp an upgrade. first of all put a windows xp home edition sp2 cd in your laptop and choose windows xp to install on C: drive and make sure you have a valid xp license. if you dont have one email me on johnpaulhiggins@googlemail.com and i will give you one (xp home) and after you have installed windows xp download and install the drivers. if you have trouble email me.|`|KvQmgTDNaa	You must to downgrade it. If you have a Windows XP CD, you can used that and use the product of of your windows vista to register your Windows to be a license, you need to call microsoft to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6wbC2lPEaa	Yeah, don't blame you. Vista is crap. XP Much more stable OS!!! If you have an XP installation disk, there's no reason why you can't do that!<br>  <br>   |`|BXF0RClAaa	Legally, unless your version of XP is a retail copy (comes boxed and when installed, it will not show the words OEM in  the product key under System Information [hold Windows key and tap Pause/Break key], then your copy of XP is OEM and it is "married" to the PC it came with (specifically the mobo) - for life. If it was retail then you could install it on another PC after you uninstall it from the other (only can be installed on one PC at a time w/out additional licenses. <br>  <br>  Vista is noticeable slower, but it has better disk management, and for some computers, better power management. And it will be supported longer.  I would suggest you keep Vista, but up the memory to at least 2GB. See newegg.cm for lowest prices, and look for the memory configuration and  the ratings.<br>  <br>  I myself dual boot XP and Vista, having found a legal retail copy of XP on ebay, and then partitioning the hard drive with <a href="http://partitionlogic.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://partitionlogic.org.uk</a> so i could install both. The are some other details you have to know about in order for both to boot. <br>  <br>  This is maybe more than you wanted to know, but i hope you find it helpful. <br>  <br>  May we do all in a way that honors God.|`|ZlJArosRaa	you can,t delete it vista from oyur laptop<br>  but you can have two operating system on a laptop<br>  but could cause problems<br>  like it wil get tooo slow <br>   matters about the memory<br>  go in your hardrive<br>  try deleting it from there<br>  |`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	But Vista is newer and better isnt it?|`|A0Go4lKoaa	You may install Xp and delete vista. Just be Wary or at least research your laptops drivers first. Tough drivers to get are NIC/wifi/multiport.<br>  <br>  If you have an XP OEM license from another computer, its not supposed to be able to be transferred to another computer.  Only retail can do that. Wont hurt to try though.<br>  <br>  Please be sure to create Recovery discs from your vista though. Most laptops do NOT come with recovery discs and just offer a recovery partition and the ability to make recovery discs.|`|2S297FtSaa	yes you can and more so you should.<br>  vista is just nonsense really.<br>  your laptop will function better under xp as it dosnt eat up as much resorces.<br>  just stick your xp cd in the drive and let it do the rest for you<br>  <br>  alternativly you could install xp onto another partition and have both :D|`|h9rpRENDaa	Yes you can; your laptop probably came with a recovery disc. This disc has Windows XP in it and you can use it.<br>  On the other hand, I have Vista and don't encounter any problem. That was before SP1 arrived. My suggestion is that you still stay with Vista. You should switch only if you are having problems.|`|AA10551742	YES YOU CAN. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE DRIVERS FOR YOUR LAPTOP COMPUTER ,BECAUSE XP IS CONSIDERED AS AN OLDER OP SYSTEM. MOST LAPTOP COMPUTER ARE BUILD WITH THE VISTA SYSTEM TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GOING BACK WARDS AND USING OLDER OPERATING SYSTEMS.|`|MI6IFksFaa	Ya you can do that, but you have to format the system and then have to install windows xp package. You can approach a system engineer.|`|byrZVcsjaa	if you bought your laptop and it came with vista i do not reconvened you try and switch to xp<br>  alot of the hardware is only for vista<br>  its sad<br>  but pc does use it<br>  |`|97d51a5e67321a7fb4e4e0829c37f651aa	XP is much more better than Vista.

DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, that happened to me yesterday (July 9, 2008).   Right after the security updates, I could not connect to the Internet at all.   I had to restore my PC from the last restore point (system's checkpoint) that I knew was good.  <br>  <br>  You may need to go back 2 restore points because the MS update had 3 patches which updated in 2 different software distributions.   <br>  <br>  By the way, I think the patch against  Visual Basic Scripts and Java Scripts might be at fault, but MS is not saying what the problem is.  It might have something to do with the .Net structures on some computers.|`|Xo9cnuGwaa	If the issue truly was from the Microsoft Update than the easiest way to get it back and working would be a Restore.

The Yahoo toolbar is a little bit heavier than Google, meaning it uses more system resources.  If your looking for the one that will be the most useful with the least trouble, I'd go with the Google bar and ditch Yahoo.  If you're feeling really daring today, ditch them both and just use Firefox, it's got the Google stuff built in without as much overhead as Internet Explorer.|`|c7ac7abb61776c2a1476ca801a1e4c3eaa	Those toolbars are little more than needless clutter on your screen in my personal opinion, but they should not affect your computer's speed.

For the specs you get from Alienware for 6K you can build a computer yourself for 3.5K or so.<br>  <br>  For 6K you can get Phase Change Cooling, an Intel C2Q 6700, a couple of 8800Ultras (though you really ought to wait till AMD releases something better, or nVidia releases an 8900 something), and now you can get 8GB RAM (you could get 16GB RAM with 4 4GB sticks, but that would amount to about $3K total for just the RAM). And 2 arrays of hard drives, 1 of Raptor Xs in 0+1, and the other of 1TB drives in 0+1. For something like that you'd need a full KW or 1.1KW PSU though.|`|BT0Gw0Daaa	Don't get an Alienware.

Start out with the processor, then choose a motherboard for it, and continue on with the video card, sound card, hard drive, RAM, DVD-RW drive, and a case with a power supply to power it all, and some fans.

kfGzOdReaa	To share your music with other accounts on the computer  On Mac OS X  Quit iTunes.  Locate your iTunes Music Folder. It is stored by default in ~/Music/iTunes or ~/Documents/iTunes/.  These folders cannot be accessed by other accounts on the computer. In order for other users to be able to access your music, you must move it to a publicly accessible location.    The Public folder in your home directory (~/Public), or to another folder outside your home directory that other users have access to, such as /Users/Shared.    Tip: The tilde "~" refers to your home folder. For more information see Mac OS X: Using Your Home Directory.    Drag the iTunes Music Folder to a publicly accessible location.  Important: Do not move the iTunes folder, the iTunes 4 Music Library file or the iTunes Library.xml file.    Open iTunes.  From the iTunes menu, choose Preferences.  Click Advanced.  Click the Change button.  Navigate in the Change Music Folder Location dialog to the location of your iTunes Music folder.  Click Choose.  Repeat these steps for each account that is sharing music with other users.    Note: If multiple users of a computer are storing music in one folder, duplicate song files are generated when a user imports music from CD that has already been imported by another user.    See the "To listen to another account's music files" section below.    On Windows  Quit iTunes.  Locate your iTunes Music Folder. It is stored by default:  Windows XP and Windows 2000: \Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\My Music\iTunes  Windows Vista: \Users\username\Music\iTunes  Note: By default the Windows version of iTunes does not copy all of the music you add to your library to your iTunes Music folder. You can get iTunes to copy all of the Music in your library to your iTunes Music Folder (if you have enough hard drive space) by choosing Consolidate Library from the Advanced menu.    The publicly accessible music folder is:    Windows XP and Windows 2000: \Documents and Settings\AllUsers.WINDOWS\Documents\Shar...

Important: Do not move the iTunes folder, the iTunes 4 Music Library file or the iTunes Library.xml file.    Open iTunes.  From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.  Click Advanced.  Click the Change button.  Navigate in the Change Music Folder Location dialog to the location of your iTunes Music folder.  Click OK.  Repeat these steps for each account that is sharing music with other users.    Note: If multiple users of a computer are storing music in one folder, duplicate song files are generated when a user imports music from CD that has already been imported by another user.    See the "To listen to another account's music files" section below.    To listen to another account's music files  Open iTunes.  From the iTunes menu, choose Preferences.  Click Advanced.  Deselect the "Copy files to iTunes Music folder when adding to library file" option.  Click OK.  From the File menu, choose Add File to Library.  Note: Windows users can also choose Add Folder to Library to add a folder of songs.    Navigate in the Add File To Library window to the location where the other user's music is saved (the iTunes Music folder in the case above).  Click Open.  Repeat these steps for each account that is listening to shared music.    When another user of the computer has imported new music from CD, repeat steps 6 through 8 to add the music to your library.

It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references ("links") pointing to the next and/or previous nodes. A linked list is a self-referential datatype because it contains a pointer or link to another data of the same type. Linked lists permit insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list in constant time, but do not allow random access. Several different types of linked list exist: singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, and circularly-linked lists.<br>  <br>  Linked lists can be implemented in most languages. Languages such as Lisp and Scheme have the data structure built in, along with operations to access the linked list. Procedural languages such as C, C++, and Java typically rely on mutable references to create linked lists.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Following code shows how to implement a linked list in Java:<br>  <br>  import java.util.*;<br>  <br>  public class LinkedListExample{<br>    public static void main(String[] args) {<br>      System.out.println("Linked List Example!");<br>      LinkedList <Integer>list = new LinkedList<Integer>();<br>      int num1 = 11, num2 = 22, num3 = 33, num4 = 44;<br>      int size;<br>      Iterator iterator;<br>      //Adding data in the list<br>      list.add(num1);<br>      list.add(num2);<br>      list.add(num3);<br>      list.add(num4);<br>      size = list.size();<br>      System.out.print( "Linked list data: ");

The LinkedList is a part of collection that constructs a list containing the elements of the specified collection. Iterator methods returns the values in the order in which they are stored.<br>  <br>  If you want to insert the data in the linkedList then use add() method. The hasNext() method returns true if the iterator contains more elements and the next() method returns the next element in the iteration. To insert and remove the data at first, last and specified position in the linkedList, you use the addFirst(), addLast(), add(), removeFirst(), removeLast() and remove() methods. To retrieve the element with respect to a specified position use the getFirst(), getLast() and get() methods. <br>  <br>  Here is the code of program:<br>  <br>  import java.util.*;<br>  <br>  public class LinkedListExample{<br>    public static void main(String[] args) {<br>      System.out.println("Linked List Example!");<br>      LinkedList <Integer>list = new LinkedList<Integer>();<br>      int num1 = 11, num2 = 22, num3 = 33, num4 = 44;<br>      int size;<br>      Iterator iterator;<br>      //Adding data in the list<br>      list.add(num1);<br>      list.add(num2);<br>      list.add(num3);<br>      list.add(num4);<br>      size = list.size();<br>      System.out.print( "Linked list data: ");

             // value of element<br>                  public link next;              // reference to next<br>          <br>                  // constructor<br>                  public link(int n, link ln)<br>                  {<br>                          value = n;<br>                          next = ln;<br>                  }<br>  <br>                  public static void main(String args[])<br>                  {<br>                          // initialize list head<br>                          link head = null;<br>  <br>                          // add some entries to list<br>                          for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)<br>                                  head = new link(i, head);<br>  <br>                          // dump out entries<br>                          link p = head;<br>                          while (p != null) {<br>                                  System.out.println(p.value);<br>                                  p = p.next;<br>                          }<br>                  }<br>          }<br>  <br>  Java does not have pointers, but instead uses implicit references. A line like:<br>  <br>          link next;<br>  <br>  does not actually declare an object instance of class link, but rather a reference to an object instance. The line:<br>  <br>          head = new link(i, head);<br>  <br>  creates a new element for the list, sets its value, and then sets the object reference in "next" to point at the old list head (this approach means that the last element inserted will be at the head of the list). Saying:<br>  <br>          p = p.next;<br>  <br>  simply picks up the "next" reference from the current node and makes it the current element being worked on.<br>  <br>  When we're done using this list, we can simply leave the list with all its elements lying around -- garbage collection will eventually reclaim it.<br>  <br>  If what you really want to do in a Java application is manage a list of numbers, there are higher-level techniques in the language and library (such as the Vector class) for doing so more cleanly than the approach illustrated here. This example shows some of what can be done underneath to implement the higher-level schemes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  import java.lang.*;<br>     import java.util.*;<br>  <br>     public class javalist <br>     {<br>         LinkedList list = new LinkedList();<br>      <br>         public javalist(LinkedList list){this.list = list;}<br>  <br>         void enqueue(Object o)<br>         {<br>      list.addFirst(o);<br>         }<br>  <br>         Object dequeue()<br>         {<br>             return list.removeFirst();<br>         }<br>  <br>         boolean isempty()<br>         {<br>      if (list.size() < 1)<br>          {<br>    return true;<br>                 }<br>  <br>      else<br>          {<br>       return false;<br>          }<br>         }<br>     }<br>    ========================================...<br>  <br>  PLEASE refer following sites:your linked list topic + more information you will get it

oAkhoCQ6aa	look up the album using an internet music service like Amazon.com and then click and drag the pic over to the pic slot on itunes. A little plus sign should show up beside the cursor that shows that it is ready to copy. Unclick the mouse and there's your artwork. <br>  <br>  This is the only way I do it. Takes less than a 30 seconds each song. If you have multiple songs from the same album, highlight all the songs, right click on the group and go to options and then album artwork and copy paste the pic there and you can do it for multiple sources.|`|AA10585364	<a href="http://unrealvoodoo.org/hiteck/projects/albumart/" rel="nofollow">http://unrealvoodoo.org/hiteck/projects/...</a>

AAIMeYeFaa	"In programming" doesn't help most folks. But I know what you mean ;)<br>  <br>  To your first question, interfaces are handled by "polling"<br>  <br>  What that means, is that there's a part of the program that does nothing but read through a list of instructions, over and over, forever, until you tell it to stop. A list like this is called a "function", and a function that goes over and over like this until you tell it to stop is called a "loop".<br>  <br>  Anything you put in the loop will be done one time every time the computer reads through that list of things. Computers are very fast, and can get through lists of millions of things in less than a second, so chances are, anything in the loop will happen more than once a second (!)<br>  <br>  One of the things you can put in the function is "check to see if we have new instructions". That's what "polling" is. In order for this to work, you have to tell the computer two things:<br>  <br>  The name of the interface <br>  (is this the keyboard? is this words coming from a command prompt?)<br>  <br>  What to read<br>  (should we stop where we are, ask someone to type stuff in, and then see what they typed? should we read from the middle of a file?)<br>  <br>  The computer needs one more piece of info, but there's usually ways the programmer can help the computer figure this part out for itself<br>  <br>  Did the interface change at all from last time I checked?<br>  <br>  If it didn't change, it just says "oh well", and goes on with the loop. If it did, it looks at what changed, and keeps track of what changed until you tell it to forget about it.<br>  <br>  You can do this with multiple interfaces, by polling several times on the loop. Remember, every time you poll, you can tell it to read a different interface a different way. It will check each one, in order, every time it reads through the list.<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your second question:<br>  <br>  Have you ever been in trouble in class, and had to write, over and over, "I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair"? This gets tedious after a while.<br>  <br>  But your Teacher didn't have to write "I will not put tacks on the teachers chair" a thousand times, did she? She just told you to do it.<br>  <br>  Well, let's try that with the computer.<br>  <br>  This is how you tell a computer to do the same thing<br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  int main() {<br>  ????printf("I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair");<br>  }<br>  /** by the way, did you see main() ? that's the "main loop". It's like the loops I was telling you about earlier, but it only gets read through one time (so it's really just a function). Everything between { and } is the list for the "main loop" **/<br>  /** also, did you see that /** ? that means "Hey, computer, you don't have to read this part". You tell it to start reading stuff again with **/<br>  /** that #include thing was telling the computer how to read from and print to the console. That would be like me telling you how to read from, and write on, a blackboard. **/<br>  <br>  Now, if you wanted the computer to do that a thousand times, you would not want to write<br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  int main(){<br>  ????printf("I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair");<br>  ????printf("I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair");<br>  ????printf("I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair");<br>  /** ... (repeat 997 more times) **/<br>  }<br>  <br>  No, you have better things to do. So you do this<br>  <br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  int computer_in_trouble() {<br>  ????printf("I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair");<br>  }<br>  int main() {<br>  ????int i = 0;<br>  ????while(i < 1000) {<br>  ????????computer_in_trouble();<br>  ????????i++;<br>  ????}<br>  }<br>  <br>  computer_in_trouble is a function. What this is saying, is that every time it sees<br>  <br>  computer_in_trouble()<br>  <br>  in the main loop, it does everything in the function computer_in_trouble, that we put between { and }. Right now, we only have it doing one thing, namely<br>  <br>  printf("I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair");<br>  <br>  but we could put a few hundred things in there, and it would do them all, every single time we called computer_in_trouble()<br>  <br>  there's another kind of loop we use too. It's called a "while" loop<br>  while is a function just like main and computer_in_trouble, but it's a special kind. While is a real, honest to goodness loop. While will go on forever until whatever is between ( and ) tells it to stop. If you never put anything in between there, like this<br>  <br>  while() {<br>  printf('this will print forever');<br>  }<br>  <br>  it really will print forever (!)<br>  <br>  we don't want to punish it forever, though (we weren't THAT mad about the tack), so we tell it when to stop<br>  <br>  i < 1000<br>  <br>  i is just a box that holds a number. That number starts off '0'. Every time the computer reads this<br>  <br>  i++<br>  <br>  it makes i grow by one<br>  <br>  So this is what happens in the computer<br>  <br>  "okay, we're in main. Oh! Okay. I see a while function. That means I do everything in this list until I get told to stop. When do I stop? Okay, when i is 1000 or bigger. What is i? 0? Great! Okay, let's print "I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair", and add one to i. i is one, so I keep going. print "I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair" and add one to i. i is two. so I keep going...<br>  <br>  (time passes)<br>  <br>  ...and add one to i. i is 999 so I keep going. print "I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair" and add one to i. i is 1000. WOAH! Time to stop. Well, it's time to call it a day. Boy, is my stdout tired! I could use a nap"<br>  <br>  So that's what functions are for, ways for you to tell the computer how to do things, so you don't have to explain everything every time.

ZpiQEjeuaa	hey buddy!<br>  Even if you were to add 2 different capacity RAM to the available slots, the computer(OS(Operating system)) makes use of the one that is the largest (not the two added together). It just ignores the smaller sized RAM and never uses it (0%).<br>  So, while adding additional memory, you have to always add equal sized RAM memory <br>  Eg:<br>  1.if you add 512 MB and 1GB RAM to 2 slots, the OS recognizes it as 1GB(not 1.5GB). the 512 MB RAM is wasted.<br>  2.if you add 512 MB and 512 MB RAM to 2 slots, the OS recognizes it as 1024 MB (512+512)<br>  <br>  In one sentence-"If they are equal use them all.

KJkAEKrpaa	Remote desktop will work for that, and would be the perfect solution.  If you want to go that route (and have total control of your desktop from your laptop) try TightVNC, it works really well. <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tightvnc.com/</a>  Remote desktop is essentially like using the keyboard, mouse, and screen on your laptop as the keyboard, mouse, and screen to your desktop.  If you play videos, they play on your desktop.  If you play music, it plays on your desktop.  When you move the mouse on your laptop, the mouse cursor on your desktop moves.  When you type on your laptop keyboard, it comes up on your desktop.  It's really cool and very useful, especially with your desired setup (control your desktop wirelessly with your laptop).<br>  <br>  Alternatively you could use a program like VLC that has what's known as a "web interface" but remote desktop is easier because it is just like you are sitting at your desktop.  I would highly recommend the first route.<br>  <br>  [edit] Oh yeah, a quick get started guide for TightVNC:<br>  1) Install on both computers.<br>  2) You will get a new icon [V] in your system tray.  Hover over it on your desktop to get the IP address.<br>  *Steps 3&4 are recommended for security but not required:<br>  3) Right click the icon and select "Properties"<br>  4) On the "Query" tab it's a good idea to check "Query console on incoming connections" and "Refuse" for the default action.  When you try to connect to your desktop you will have to click OK on the desktop to allow the connection.<br>  5) Dig through your laptop start menu for "TightVNC Viewer" and open it<br>  6) Type in the IP address of your desktop<br>  7) Click "Connect"<br>  8) Have fun!

b1c7aec9642ce478d83d612a46a23c4eaa	At a guess thats the numlock light on your laptop.  To turn it off look for a button near the upper right hand of the keyboard that says something along the lines of 'numlk' or something similar.|`|5fBejDceaa	That is probably the numberlock key (numlock), my computer has a 1 instead of a nine but I'm pretty sure it's the same thing.  If you can't find a key that says numlock on it it you might find the same picture, 9 in the briefcase (which I think might be a lock not a briefcase) on an F key or Scroll key under the letters or numbers in white, in a different color.  In that case just look for a key at the bottom of your laptop with the same color, it might have the letters Fn, hold that down and push the key with the lock picture on it.  That should turn it off.  I know this might sound kind of confusing but if you get confused let me know and I could try to explain it better.  Hope this helps.

I take this stand because I am willing to bet your answers will run from a solid yes through a solid no.  <br>  <br>  Before I get into that, you also need to evaluate the financial value of doing this.  If the unit is new enough to upgrade the processor as you wish, perhaps it should have been purchased that way.  Secondly what do you wish to achieve by the upgrade?  I repeatedly read requests in this forum regarding making something faster and the requester's component that he wishes to upgrade will not generate the desired result. <br>  <br>  Having said all that, this is what you need to do:<br>  <br>  1.  Go to the web site of the motherboard maker and determine exactly what processors are compatible with that motherboard.  The processor socket is not always the sole definitive determinating factor.<br>  <br>  2.  Once you have this information, check to see what sort of improvement is actually observed by users and if there are other potential problems with a processor upgrade.  This can be either a support of what you want to do, a warning of problems, or an indication of severe disappointment.  <br>  <br>  After you have this information, then you have to determine if you can proceed, if it is financially prudent to proceed, and if others who have tried support the move.|`|7d842c979bf4d9cd706084bfb2a07831aa	Hi<br>  Dual Core and Quad Core processors are Socket 775.

If your goal is to get huge then you want to break your training up into days like, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and maybe light on Saturday. You never want to weight train every day. If you do that, your muscles will be over trained and will only break down and wont grow at all. You need resting periods. So if you had to pick between the two, every other day would be best.

Secondly there was a programmer that responded to this question already and  quoted a price of 35 Dollars an hour Most programmers are worth more then that in general Programmers are college educated people  or highly skilled individuals. Therefore they make more per hour then typical auto mechanics  here in the USA anyhow auto mechanics make on average 60-65 dollars an hour plus parts.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of web designers overseas that will build sites for less then it can be built here. Most of the time their work is lacking.<br>  <br>  Also another point is that if you want any dynamic content on your pages you will need javascript at a minimum. It is a key part to DHTML. If youw ant your pages to show up the same in all the browsers you may also need DOM Scripting which is done with JavaScript. <br>  <br>  When I read that comment it did not mention that if you want a bulletin board of e-commerce solution you will need a database which means you will need someone to set up your database and use a programming language like PHP to communicate with the database. That person will also have to be familiar with the database at the MySQL or SQL level as well.<br>  <br>  Flash uses a language of its own called action scripting but it does not qualify as a programming language either.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest if you are having someone else write your site for you that you put in the agreement it work in all the mainstream browsers  and be valid HTML, XHTML, CSS as well as be a table less layout. All CSS and Scripts should be in external files. Make sure when the site is paid for you have the copyrights to all the code as well.

Did you have one in mind? <br>  If you put programming in it, it will be more expensive. Programming is indicated when you need things like Javascript or Vbscript. It can get even MORE expensive if you need custom animation using Flash. <br>  Todays programmers (I am one of them) usually demand about 35 dollars per hour for their time. There is no "per web page" amount in those circumstances. <br>  If its complicated (for example, needing database queries to facilitate the design of the page) it can take a couple of hours or 70 bucks. <br>  I would estimate that as a good base estimate "per page".<br>  Good luck.|`|pmYhX5igaa	It depends on your needs.

8vJFQUz8aa	Pick your printer based on operating system and not the computer you are connecting to. HP printers are generally still the best bet. But any new printer will work in the short term, usually up to year before problems occur. Any new printer will have support for Vista, if it doesn't say it is Vista compatable, then don't buy it, unless you have XP or Linux. Price points will also determine the durability of the printer, generally under $100 the ink costs more than the printer and you should stay away from these. $150 and up is a good price point for getting into a more durable product.

Integrated graphics usually isn't referred to as a graphics "card" since it is permanently embedded into the motherboard. Integrated graphics also use system resources, eating into your RAM and CPU resources. On the other hand, there's discrete graphics. Discrete graphics are actual cards that plug into your computer, usually through the AGP, PCI (very slow), or PCIe slot.

mckimTwBaa	Answering that kind of question requires a little work on your part, because it depends on where you live.  Companies offer different services at different prices in different areas.  Notice how many times I said different there.  <br>  <br>  You'll have to do a little research for the area you live in.  <br>  <br>  One thing I can tell you- if you always get a wireless signal in a WiFi hotspot, you can get internet for free.  You don't need to pay someone for it- the business usually offers it free for its patrons.  If you're looking for a broadband card that works anywhere, that you'll have to shell out decent money for.

AA10394789	There are two things you can do to increase speed.<br>  <br>  One is to allow incoming communications by forwarding BitTorrent through any firewall or router.<br>  The other is to make room for outgoing communications by capping upload in BitTorrent to 80% of your overall upload capacity.<br>  <br>  Since you are connecting to so many seeds and peers, you probably do not have a network issue.  So you would not have to mess with router or firewall.<br>  <br>  Capping your upload, if you have not done so already, would help.

AVG caught them all and they have a bigger program you can buy.  It is excellent. . the free one and the bigger one.  You can check in Windows to be sure your windows firewall is on.  After you get everything checked out and  you are still slow.  You have a problem that is beyond what I can tell you.  Hope this helps.  Run those things I told you about on a regular basis and have AVG scan your computer and update it everytime you plan to go on the internet because it only updates daily.  Good luck.<br>  I upgraded my internet speed and it made no difference.  I am far from whatever is important and when it gets busy, my dsl slows way down.  A bad phone line will slow you down too.

LFWWPgpQaa	If your Dad is using DSL as well then no, you cannot have two DSL services provisioned onto one single phone line.  You would need to have two seperate phone lines to have two DSL services active.  If he is using Cable (sorry dont know what AT&T run) and there is a fully land line connected to the home you could run both but you would need your DSL service moved to the line.    As one of the above posters mentioned it would be easier to share his connetion via a switch than running two (and cheaper!)    *edit* Being as you are both on AT&T if your both on DSL your service would prabably work but you couldnt have both connected still.  I know over in Australia if a mate is on the same Provider - e.g. Internode, I can use my Router at his place and it will connect with my details - he only has a modem so we use my router when we LAN game. *edit*|`|fmT3ochSaa	It won't be two separate connections, you would still be sharing the same last mile cable pairs. You would need to call the provider and have them engineer a new line to get two different services.|`|AA10594501	There are several ways to do this.    But first, your Dad must have DSL service. If so, why not just use your dad's modem.    You can use what's called Windows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS). Your dad's PC is connected to the modem and then you connect to his computer with a crossover ethernet cable. Your connectio goes through his computer. The downside of this is that both PCs need to be powered on.    A better way though is with an ethernet hub or switch. You can pick these up pretty cheap, like around $10.    The best way is with a router, but you seem to rule that out due to cost, I assume. You may be able to pick up a used router, though. Check Craigslist.org .

Sunbelt has found one which claims to require that you install Zango in order to view the site, but the requirement is easily bypassed. On other sites, the requirement is enforced. In another post, they promo a screen saver that sends the Zango home site down in flames.

See here for Real-Time Computing:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_c...    See here for Gigabytes and Kilobytes:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobytes|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Those aren't measures of time. They're measures of capacity on a hard drive or in RAM.|`|qb9V9syNaa	30 minutes per GB.  this is based on the standard for Audio CDs.|`|xdlsGvldaa	GB (gigabyte) KB (kilabyte) is not in hours.  The meaning of the words kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte change when they are used in the context of network data rates. A rate of one kilobyte per second (KBps) equals 1000 (not 1024) bytes per second. One megabyte per second (MBps) equals one million (106, not 220) bytes per second. One gigabyte per second (GBps) equals one billion (109, not 230) bytes per second.    To avoid some of this confusion, networkers typically measure data rates in bits per second (bps) rather than bytes per second (Bps) and use the terms kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte only when referring to disk space.    Examples: "This eight gigabyte disk only has 200 megabytes of free space left."    Also Known As: K, KB, M, MB, "meg," G, GB, "gig"     Hope this helps, to learn more go to: http://compnetworking.about.com|`|S4X8zOUoaa	It's a measurement of disk space. 100gb of video isn't a set of length of time, it depends on how complicated the data being stored is.

But of the two you list, stick with dual core for gaming. Most games aren't quad-core optimized, and do better on a higher clock/lower core count. This has been thoroughly established in most games.

If you like to just game and nothing else on a budget then you should get at least an E8400 (i would suggest E8500 as the E8400's are phasing out and E8500 is about as cheap as it gets)     if you like to game AND o.c. on a budget then you should get Q6600 for that. Q6600 G0 can normally get to 3.6ghz w/o breaking a sweat.    if you like to game a bit and o.c. a bit AND staying 'green' go for a Q9400 or Q9550s    if you like to game AND o.c. and budget limit is higher go for a C2Q like Q9550 or Q9650    if you like to game AND o.c. with NO budget you should put all your dough on Core i7 and X58 chipset.    gl :)

Better be sure than feel sorry in the end. Besides DVD burning softwares aren't that expensive anyway. It would cost you some bucks only compared to free but the quality isn't good.    I have tried DVD neXt Copy. Of course at first I was hesitant to grab a copy since it isn't free but they have this free trial version for you to download and try about their products. When I tried, it is worth the price. I grab a copy of DVD neXt Copy after my trial version expired. It allows you to copy DVDs to your Ipod, Zune and PSP. What else can you ask for? It is somehow a complete package you need for DVD burning.

Websites offering free downloads are not paying any copyright fees, are offering the music without proper authorization and thus the downloads are illegal.    The dangers of Limewire and what has happened to my family   ______________________________________...  Not sure how many of you are aware of Limewire that kids are using to download free music on their computers. I knew very little and still don't know all that much but it is a terrible thing to have on your computer and I want to get the word out as to what happened to us. First off, Limewire is a computer program you can download for free. This program allows you to download free songs that are illegal. It is a file sharing program which means if you have limewire and someone else has limewire, those two people can share their songs (or whatever else they download) from one computer to the next. With this being said, I knew my DD had limewire on her computer but had no idea what else you can do with this program. Come to find out, you can download ANYTHING from this Limewire, as in X-rated photos, child porn, videos ...etc.    A week ago we were woke up with 10 FBI men, 1 FBI woman and 1 sherriff banging on our door at 6 am. They had their FBI vests on, wore guns, etc. I answered the door and they asked me who was in the house, etc. They woke my DH and 2 teenagers up and we were told they had a search warrant. They had reason to believe we had someone in our house who had downloaded "something" illegal on one of our computers. We were all in shock, it felt like something out of a bad movie. They searched our house for 2 hours and they took all of our computers to investigate. I pray they don't find anything. DH and both kids have said they have done nothing wrong, I have not either. We have consulted an attorney and now we wait.    I tell you all this to educate others to get limewire off your computers. Its not worth all this for free songs ...|`|VBngSH9raa	http://www.b3ta.cr3ation.co.uk/site/musi...|`|b7w8JaWzaa	haaaah, I dont think theres a site like that for all general songs only specific.
