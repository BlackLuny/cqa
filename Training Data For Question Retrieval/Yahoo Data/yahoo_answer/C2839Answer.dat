The first answer was right on!<br>  Another idea would be to take her to Disney on Ice. It's coming March 18-22nd. That is so much fun for kids. All the Disney charecters sing and skate around, it's like a musical on ice. <br>  You could take her to the stock yards in Fort Worth eat, play the cattlepin maze and/or go horse back riding along the Trinity. My mom did that for my birthday when I was a kid and it was way cool. They did a chuckwagon dinner and the cowboys played the guitar around the campfire. <br>  You could take her to the Omni or Imax. You could go to the Palace of Wax & Ripley's Believe it Or Not. <br>  What about taking her to the Dallas Aquarium. That's pretty cool too. <br>  You could also take her to Keith and Margos Murder Mystery Dinner. That's way fun! <br>  She's lucky to have a friend like you , that's way sweet.

Dm8s3bBLaa	Everyone does the Disney/Universal thing, but I like Sea World the best.  If you're coming during the summer, you should definitely hit up the water parks.  International Drive and Lake Buena Vista are the best tourist areas in the city, and the best stuff for families.<br>  <br>  Downtown Orlando has the nightlife, especially on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  You should check out Icon on Thursdays, Wall Street on Fridays, and just about anywhere on Saturdays.  <br>  <br>  If you want to satisfy a cultural craving, Winter Park is a great place to walk around and relax.  There are classy restaurants, beautiful parks, and great shopping.  There is a market early on Saturday mornings, and there are often art shows and craft fairs in the park.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|0DdSoi4Maa	I just came back from visiting there.

They are both different animals. This is the first time I have ever seen anyone compare them. But, there is nothing wrong with your question it is just interesting.<br>  <br>  Taco Bell: salads and those mega-stuffed roll wraps. For the real cheap stuff that meat is nasty. Is it even meat?! Or is it rodent/road kill?<br>  <br>  Arby's: Beef and Cheddar. Standard Arby's sandwich fine as well. Haven't tried their chicken. The new roastburger with blue cheese was okay. Arby's is pretty good. They are both good. Both stores.|`|AA11091315	I would pick anything over Taco Bell. So, Arby's. It helps that I enjoy Arby's so there.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Taco Bell.  We enjoy the crunchy tacos, crunch wrap supremes, and the burrito supremes.  You get more bang for your buck at Taco Bell.  Plus, for fast food, their food tastes pretty good.  I don't think we have any least favorites from Taco Bell - can't think of any off hand.<br>  <br>  Arby's:  We've never eaten at.  Can't comment.|`|wRJPiIU7aa	I like them both. Taco bell has great tacos and gorditas and a yummy thing called a Crunchwrap Supreme. Plus, they have sides like the cheesy fiesta potatoes which i LOVE and they have a side of nachos which has great cheese sauce. Arbys has great chicken strips and i love their curly fries.|`|GHd84xipaa	depends on what you are in the mood for.i like Taco Bell,but if i was in a mood for roast beef i would go to Arbys.|`|PuRpsENEaa	Love Arbys. <br>  <br>  I like the arbys melt or the beef and cheddar. There sooooo good.

SqLIZQN5aa	If you're talking about Jilly's Bar and Grill it's in the Enchanted Forest Plaza. It's the center with the Safeway, Bagel Bin, Learning Center, etc.
