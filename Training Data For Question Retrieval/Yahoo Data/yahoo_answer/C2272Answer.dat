lpCXAhWiaa	shiny pokemon are EXTREMLY rare ( you have a 1/8000 chance of finding a shiny ) any pokemon can be shiny. in diamond and pearl if you use the pokeradar and the grass sparkles, it is a shiny. another way to get shinies is by breeding. i dont mean breeding a shiny with a shiny will not result in a shiny, the statistics are still the same. but i breed a snorlax with a ditto and i got a shiny munchlax.|`|pLxzgGlUaa	you have a certain chance on finding a wild pokemon that is a different color they usually have wondergaurd it makes it so that the pokemon is only affected by moves that are super effective .  if you have a sableye or Spiritomb which have no weaknesses with wondergaurd it will be undefeatable except for confusion, and poison|`|AA11991193	different color pokemon.

You have to pay the difference between yours and the new one, (yours would have gone down in price) and then you could buy the lite protectors.     OR if you dont want to do that you can look up DS screen protectors online and see if you can order it.|`|awhHIfSjaa	DS and DS lites are the same thing. the screens should be pretty much the same size.

y0ASEEBBaa	Technically the distribution of the engine is illegal because the license has expired.  However, if you're concerned about characters and copyright, it might interest you to know that Capcom and SNK both consider it "fan art".  Therefore as long as you're not charging people money you're not doing anything wrong when you use their characters.  I can't comment on the use of characters from other companies such as Midway (Mortal Kombat), Nintendo (Killer Instinct and others) etc but I'd be surprised if they'd see it as causing a problem.|`|WxQjpISKaa	Depends on the engine you use.

2eab663e76e11c4e11bf904250d8a2fcaa	Google will get you links to plenty of demos.    If you mean copies (obviously of games you own cos otherwise it'd be piracy), then Torrent sites are best.    You'd need your PSP hacked, which can only be done on a PSP with firmware 3.50 and below (so far).  You downgrade to 1.50 and then upgrade using a custom firmware.  Sounds complicated but not too bad.  Always a chance of ending up withy a brick but it's fairly safe.  I've done a few and never had a problem (touch wood!).    Of course I've only hacked PSP's to allow homebrew cos copied games would be piracy.  Did I already mention that?|`|74244b36f530ee41e96c603283aea4d4aa	Well you would have to have a homebrew on your psp which means You have to have a psp from firmware 3.50 to 1.50 to downgrade it to a 1.50 or a custom firmware which is a hack which can mess up your psp    or if you have the latest firmware 3.52 you can download game demos from     pspfanboy.com or hit a google search    One last thing if you have a lot of space you can download the whole harry potter and the order of the phoniex single player game on your psp which is about 500mb at aol games|`|lBlZthvIaa	you could go on yourpsp.com and download official demos|`|h8Qklrblaa	ok  these are steps i used    Make sure you either have an oe version psp (which is basically allowing you to play emulateors,homebrew,downloaded games,while also the actual umds    or    A 1.5 psp homebrew ,emulators,downloaded games,just no umds can be played    Then hook ur psp up with a usb cord    You will see folders come up  when you open ur psp    Make a folder called ISO    this is where you put your games    Then you simply drag your iso in there ,there you go you have the game    a emulator might be needed to play the game which is like 5mb or if you have oe you can just click game then just find ur game      Also go to pspiso.com or pspisos.com to download them a account will be needed to be made

Is that an online game? If it is, you should try Firefox instead of Internet Explorer. It is because Internet dosen't have all that you need it on. Also, the Window's Vista computer comes with the new Internet Explorer 7. Maybe it is that which is causing the problem. So I suggest you to download and use Firefox for that game if it is a download game, or an online game. I play a game too. First, on the Internet, it did not work. Once I downloaded Firefox, it worked. Maybe Window's Vista's firewall has to do something with that sight. You should turn off your firewall maybe. I think it could work. Since Windows has real good protection, maybe that sight has viruses. You should either try one of my options there. If you can't, e-mail me on (piedoodoo@yahoo.com) Then we could chat, and I could test it if it will work. Good luck!!! (also tell me if that game is working. I am a curious person.)|`|3924350b4e34c17bd414a2af1a6d1c0baa	I'd highly recommend Awakened Lands, it's a free game, no downloads. Pretty addicting game.    http://www.awakenedlands.com/register.ph...

xwuTBAlTaa	This is the hardest mission on the game, but have fun with it. Here is IGN's guide that got me past this mission:    What Goes Up    I'll be completely honest; this is the hardest mission in the game, bar none. You WILL be replaying this mission at least 3-5 times if this is the first time you've done it, as there are tons of RPG carrying LC soldiers that need to be killed, multiple LC cars doing damage to your ride, Dax drives like a retard in the second half of the mission (usually doing more damage to the car than anything else), and you have to learn how to lead a RPG shot while driving to take out a moving plane.    Follow the blue path to the airport (via the freeway) and BE CAREFUL. Any damage incurred to your ride on the freeway will worsen any chance you have to finish this mission. It doesn't help that people on the freeway get into random accidents, or that a cop may attempt to pull you over for speeding (and when I say "pull you over", what I mean is "he'll try to ram you off the freeway itself"). Either way, make sure you beat the clock to the blue marker AND keep your car's damage to an extreme minimum.    After a short conversation and a quick cinema, you'll be riding shotgun in Dax's car. Use the RPG to take out any LC cars that are following you, and after you burst through the gate, whip out your K6 assault rifle and target the RPG carrying LC on the ground AND on top of the building. Dax will veer right, and then follow around the right side of the building, which is where you need to pull out your RPG again. As soon as you see Angelo's plane, shoot it. If you lead it (i.e. have the cursor to the far left of the plane so the rocket will hit it) you should be able to land TWO solid RPG shots before Dax takes you off a ramp and over onto the streets.    Dax decides that he needs to go back into the airfield, so he blows through another gate and you have another shot at hitting the plane. If you miss, don't worry about it. Pull out your K6 Assault Rifle and aim for the LC on the right side of the roof as you hit the ramp. Don't shoot at him, but at the barrels next to him (they explode if you put enough bullets into them). After plowing through another fence the area you're looking at is the same spot where you killed the FIRST LC with a RPG (so if you missed the guy on the building, now is the time to kill him). Dax will jock the car to the left, and to the right of the ramp you took to get out on the streets is another LC with a RPG. Drop him and Dax will take a sharp right onto the airfield where you have a CLEAR shot at taking down Angelo's plane with the RPG.    Note: If you do this correctly, you can kill Angelo after you take the first jump out into the city streets, but I described the long way just in case you want to do it for cinematic flair, or if you miss with the RPG a ton.

6LJFMPLpaa	This is a really good team, except for a few little problems. Hyper beam and Blast burn are two really bad moves. It leaves a free turn open for your opponent, which can make all the difference in a battle. Another thing that you really don't have to worry about unless you get really serious with battling - double team is technically an "illegal move" but you should be fine. You should reconsider a few moves on Empoleon because his Sp. Attack is much higher than his Attack. Your Lucario looks great though. Overall this team deserves an 7.5/10. Once you fix hyper beam and Blast burn it will be really good. ^-^|`|oCWjOP37aa	this is a very good team now it just depends on the level each pokemon is if it is 80 and up extrodanary if not lv up to lv 80 and up|`|H7CVDmk7aa	Well now i dont bealive in descrimination against anytime of pokemon but I have to say that ubers like lugia and celibi and Pokemon Pearl and Diamonds Palkia And Dialga Really make the best team.Ya no if u want.

Mismaigus:A pretty leveled pokemon but having Hyper Beam will leave a free shot for the foe if you use it.Try an electric attack or a grass attack like solar beam    Lucario:Aura Sphere and Dragon Pulse are good for him but try getting rid Dark Pulse and Psychic.Instead,try teaching him Calm Mind and Earthquake.Calm Mind to raise his Special Attack And Special Defense to shield him from Fire Attacks and Earthquake to take out those Poison,Steel,Rock,Electric,and fire foes.    Staraptor:U-Turn and Brave Bird are very good for him,but I would get rid of Roost and Aerial Ace.Since he has low Defense and Sp.Defense the odds are he'll get taken out with one hit anyway.Try teaching him Fly and Close Combat.Close Combat really helps his weakness with its super effectiveness to Dark,Rock,Ice,Steel,and Normal types.    Other than that is a pretty well rounded team    Good Luck|`|e5c0b54c8b558a3baa4ec006cd42ea84aa	Staraptor is an awesome pokemon to have.  Mine has Aerial ace, Return, Fly and Defog.

I advise for you to go out of the cave, and get a Pokemon (it doesn't have to be a strong one) that knows an attack that can make Giratina go to sleep. So, when your battling, use your strong Pokemon, then, when its on red, switch with the Pokemon that knows sleep, and use the sleep attack. you should be able to catch it. But if not, then go to google and type in 'Catching Giratina Walkthrough' or something along those lines. You should find some more advice.|`|VjNFAbBdaa	There is a trick about pokeballs that makes them better than ultra balls. When the pokeball is in front of the wild pokemon immediatly press and hold the A button. DON'T LET THE A BUTTON GO UNTIL THE POKEMON GETS OUT OF THE BALL OR UNTIL IT GETS CAUGHT.(sorry about the spelling.)|`|FByd72bAaa	you need to use a pokemon that could give giratina a status problem. preferably paralysing. because sleep and freezing doesn't last long. and poison and burns will keep hurting the pokemon until it faints.  i haven't got that far yet. but i doubt you'll catch him without a status problem.  it's best to use ultra balls or DUSK BALLS because they're good on pokemon in caves...
lBesq2Mzaa	flygon-ok unless your flygon has a really good spatk then dragon pulse wont help much and dragon claw will be better on him. hyper beam probably wont be used much so you may want to take that out for something else. but flygon cant leanrs tat great moves so I guess it could work.  altaria-no offense, but 2 turns attacks suck, normal type mvoes suck, and dragon pulse is the only good attack you have. also altaria isnt that great of a pokemon. I would seriously cosider taking altaria out for a different pokemon.  electivire-the best possible moveset for an electivire would have to be thunderpunch, ice punch, earthquake, and brick break or cross chop.  magmortar-looks god but may want to take out fire punch for an ice or water attack.  glalie-not bad, but glalie isnt too great a pokemon. itll still work, but just take out blizzard and bite for other attacks of different types.  mantine-take out hydro pump and water pulse and agility. you may want to try moves like roost, calm mind, and psychic maybe.|`|6LJFMPLpaa	Ok, looks pretty leveled out...*natures would help   -The flygon looks good except for the hyper beam, that is a horrible move because it gives your opponent an extra turn to eat you alive.  -The altaria looks pretty good as well, I would drop sky attack for roost since she has pretty good defences and you already have fly.  -Electrive looks well, but from what I understand, he has little sp. attack, so drop thunderbolt and flamethrower, add ice punch and fire punch  -Magmorter, looks good, just drop fire punch for psychic and that should help.  -Gailie... well lets just say Blizzard is bad b/c of low accuracy and you already have ice beam, and bite is bad because you have crunch which is stronger, but the same concept. I don't know much about her moves, so just play around, but avoid low accuracy moves and moves that make you "recharge"  -Mantine, interesting choice, but get rid of water pulse and hydro pump, you just need surf. Teach it 2 moves that aren't water, almost anything should do as long as it is specail attack purposed.     Hope I helped. ^-^

RWVSosUeaa	The braile decoder is in the manual. If, for some reason, you don't have the manual, there's a handy dandy braille alphabet here: http://educ.queensu.ca/~fmc/may2004/imag...    As for actually getting the regis, you will need a relicanth and a wailord, and pokemon on your team with dig, fly, strength, surf and dive. Surf along the southernmost end of the fast current route near pacifidlog (route 134) until you hit a squarish patch of divable water surronded by currents. Dive here. Swim underwater south until you see a wall with an inscription - sit next to this and use dive to go up - you will appear in a cave. Go the the wall at the end and use dig, the wall will break. In the next room put relicanth at the front of your party, and wailord as the last one. Read the inscription at the room's end and 'a door opens somewhere!'    Now you can find the regis. In dex order:    Regirock: Go to the desert and go south until you see a ruin with six smaller stones around it - go inside. Read the inscription then take two steps right, two steps down and then use strength. The door to regirock will open.    Regice: Go to route 105, north of dewford and surf to the west of this route until you see some islands. Keep going north-west and you'll see another ruin-type place with six small stones around. This is the most boring one to get - go up to the inscription, read it (don't close the screen, keep the dots there) and wait for two minutes. If you stop reading, you'll have to start it again. The door to regice will mercifully open (eventually)    Registeel: Go to route 120 (where the safari zone is). From the safari zone, head west and up a slope where there's a lake and a berry patch. Head north from here through the long grass and up to the ruins. Inside, us fly in the centre of the room. (Wow, that was easy!) and go through to registeel.    As for catching the buggers, paralysing is always good, and flase swipe is brilliant for weakening pokemon without killing them (where it would normally faint the opponent it always leaves 1hp left, unless the opponent only HAS 1hp =P) Chuck ultra balls after weakening  like crazy until caught. Keep about 20 ultras with you just in case.|`|am8NL59Raa	if you get the guide book, then it shows you where you catch them and it gives you a braille decoder sheet as well.|`|X77M8DFTaa	this is tricky, first get a relicanth and a wailord, put relicanth in the front of ur party and wailord in the back of ur party. then fly to pacifidlog town and go west untill u reach a + shaped dive area dive and go down untill u reach a rock with brail, dive back up, and u will end up in sealed chamber, go to the entrance which will be sealed then use dig right in front of it it will open. go up to the brail writing and there will be an earthquake and it will say it sounds like three dorrs have opened far way. to open regirocks go in front of the entrance go right two sapces then down 2 spaces and use strength, he is in the desert. then go to to lily cove to find registeel and use fly in the middle of the cave, then go to route 105 and go to regices entrance and read the brail and wait there for about 3 min and the door will open|`|156cf14271f426dabceb88b9e231e9a0aa	... i haven't a clue.|`|nODAcMy1aa	It is REALLY complicated.

The only exceptions are the ants (one in an abandoned building in Kakariko, the other in the Graveyard), and the snails (one in the Sacred Grove, the other is in the foyer of the Temple of Time, before you enter the temple itself when you've gone through the portal).

c97884712264a19f23634b93afda8d19aa	The Sims 2 Pets is an expansion pack only, not a stand-alone game. You will need The Sims 2, The Sims 2 Holiday Edition, or The Sims 2 Deluxe Edition as the base game.    The Sims 2 Pets found on any of the consoles (e.g., Xbox, PS2, Gamecube) are definitely stand-alone games, as expansion packs are computer-only.    Maybe you're thinking of The Sims Pet Stories. Although all of The Sims Stories are stand-alone games, they are not The Sims 2.|`|c1eGlE6Yaa	You will need the sims 2.

QqkshhGKaa	Installing flight simulator x SP1 is recommended. Regarding the addon files, .bin and .cue are CD/DVD disk image files. You will need to install a virtual drive software and load the disk image and install from the virtual CD/DVD.

QqkshhGKaa	Shift + P is the pushback function, a tug will push you back to the taxi way. When you are in position to taxi, you should press Shift + P again to disengage the tug. Then you should adjust your throttle and taxi at no faster than 25 knots. Reduce speed when you are turning but don't fully stop, as you will need more throttle to make the turn from stationary. If you don't know the way to the assigned runway, you can turn on progressive taxing and yellow dotted line will lead you to the run way. If this is too complicated, next time when you choose free flight mode, make sure you make the starting point of your flight plan as the "active runway"
R9QqusZnaa	Sorry dude, there is currently not 3.51 downgrader, and to change to 3.51 m33 custom firmware you have to downgrade to version 1.5 firmware. And right now there is NO WAY to do this. And there won't be for a LONG time. And there won't be one out for a few months either, so don't get your hopes up (why did you upgrade in teh first place if you wanted to downgrade???)|`|sKXTKPaZaa	First u need to downgrade to 1.5. You need a custom firmware psp and your own. Go to http://www.qj.net/Tutorial-How-to-unbric... to get the directions you need. Then just install 3.51 m33.|`|0d420f44b42e2c428c2f0bda3c24c26eaa	Currently, there is no downgrader for 3.51. You will have to wait untill another one comes out, downgrade to 1.5, and then install the 3.51M33 firmware.  However.  M33 team's releases arent stable yet, so I would go to 3.30OE-A' or 3.40OE-A  Dark Alex may be gone, but his Custom Firmwares are still the best.

d03016c0ce92c7f681f2c0fa7afdb757aa	I would suggest going with the DS lite. The touch screen play is really incredible. New Super Mario Bros. has a lot of great mini games. There are certain packs of games that offer 2 to 4 games on one cart. It is easier to change the game on a ds as compared to the PSP.  The R4 DS also called R4 Revolution is a ds cart. that can do homebrew, and media (music, video). The R4 uses a micro sd card and media can be drag and drop, copied to it.  Right now it is the best. It can be found online for around $50.

wOsR6CKoaa	Before you throw it away, check the connection. Mine is old & sometimes you have to get the plug in the socket juuuussst right for it to work, otherwise my screen would blank out too. Double check to see if when the screen goes blank, that the red light is still on (showing that it's plugged in/connected). If it's not, then that's your problem; you have to play with the plug. If it IS on, I would say try taking it to an EB Games or something & see if they could repair it for a reasonable price. GOOD LUCK!

You could change the Java and log onto another account. 1 per server, 4 in all.

(I have nerdy friends who still play this dumb game)    Ever since Trade Limit though (my friends complain about this all the time).

ZiOZ4Qsdaa	No, there isn't anything special about January other than the specific Neopet Days, like Aisha Day on the third. There ARE monthly freebies, but those are nothing special. The month of sleeping, sharing, etc. are just fun names that are just made up.    Hope this helps!|`|z0EOBHtPaa	Nothing totally special, such as the Advent Calendar, happens in January, the Month of Sleeping.|`|xfhRBlhfaa	unfortunately you get nothing in January (month of sleeping) its just a December thing|`|SnlPbrQ6aa	thank you you too madam merry christmas and happy new year|`|AonQIAYEaa	no each month has a special name but you don't necessarily get a present each month.

(it can get really addicting.... )

gFeJR2V1aa	They should, but at the same time, it depends on how nice the manager is.  Some managers will call that consumer damaged (in other words, your fault).  Some will apologize and take it back.  Just take it back with everything and the receipt and try it.  That's all I can say.|`|GPSS4Krvaa	No i doubt it...but! theres good news...you can rent it and switch it and keep the one u rented... come back and tell them it is crack and it was already like that...they will let u rent another game 2!  PLEASE RATE BEST :D|`|RGDofHaZaa	yeah there shouldnt be any problems i dont think, as long as its for an even exchange.  just have ur recite ready and say it was like that when you opened it.|`|AA11057445	From what you say, it seems like you bought it used.  If that's the case, you have a thirty day quality guarantee, as long as you have your receipt.  Take it back in there and they are required to let you exchange it for another copy.    If you don't have your receipt, go in and explain the situation, and they might do it for you anyway.     Please don't rent games to replace your broken ones.  That's horrible, and it's stealing from the store.  And yes, sometimes they CAN tell when a customer has done that.  There was a time I rented a game when I worked there, and I know what condition it was returned in, because I returned it.  The same day, a customer came in, rented that game, and tried to return it to me two hours later with scratches all over the back, claiming it didn't work.      And it was promptly sold to him, by me, because I knew he did it.  So keep that in mind when you do dishonest things.  Not everyone who works at Blockbuster is too stupid to notice when you steal from them.    Hope this helps!
ENsvvLcfaa	I'm guessing what you mean to ask is, "How do you create a password protected room?". In order to create a room where a user needs the password to enter, you need to buy a Silver or Gold premium.

Gears is a small team based pop and stop game while Resistance is a large run and gun type game. Still both games will be great this fall for their respective consoles.|`|3a9TPnXcaa	quote...''cause PS3 seems too have slightly better graphics, but get Gears Of War 2 first."  Hmmm I have the privelage of owning both consoles(alot of overtime) and have played a few games on my ps3 the latest being starwars force unleashed and to be quite honest i have yet to see anything on the PS3 come close to Gears of War, playwise and graphic wise, and as for Resistance 2, part 1 sucked big time and the graphics are hardly worth mentioning and as for part 2 just look on youtube for gameplay and online play....close your eyes and shoot anywhere is it, this a no brainer, Gears 2 is going to be the 'have to get game' of the year and we here in N.Z get it first, you heard me we get it first, 1 whole day before the rest of the world oh and just a couple of hours b4 the aussies.

Overlord - kind of dorky, but it can be fun  Blue Dragon - I don't like it, but if you're a Final Fantasy fan I recommend this game.  But when you can buy M rated games, be sure to look into the good ones:  Gears of War (and soon GOW 2!)  Timeshift  Prey  Bioshock  The Orange Box  Halo 3 (duh)    :) Hopefully that helps.|`|ibgfT6OWaa	you should check out this site where you can get an xbox 360 for free

AA11259172	The basic answer is that you will need your Blockbuster card (or set up an account).  You will need a debit or credit card, as it's a "continuous" billing program, meaning that it automatically takes the payment from your card every month until you cancel.  Also, if you plan on renting any of the new format games (X360, PS3 or Wii), you will also need a debit or credit card on the account.  This is just in case you fail to return the game after you have canceled your Pass, they need to make sure they get the game or money back for it.  It depends on the store, as most have a sheet for you to sign saying that you understand the terms of the program, including the automatic billing process and other things, but many employees don't know these forms exist anymore, or don't know where to find them.    Hope it helps.

Hope this helps !!!  xx|`|X9Xg1m9paa	You can send them the shirt through the mail or when an animal complains that her wardrobe was really bad and had nothing to wear, you will hear this little toon right after they say that line and that means that you have the chance to go and get a shirt from somewhere, you bring it back to that animal and click on clothe yourself or something like that.  It will give you the option to give it to them.    But if they weren't looking for an outfit, you can just send it to them through the mail...    Hope this helped you?|`|ZbvEbOKAaa	You can't give animals your designs but your other animal friends can cuz you know when their talking to each other?

fvre0o9laa	At that price range, I really think you'd be better off with a used machine.      http://www.cet.com/~pennys/faq/smfaq.htm    What I want for beginners in sewing:    - a machine that doesn't scare you  - a machine that isn't balky (cheap new machines are often very    balky or need adjustments often and are rarely repairable --    just too frustrating to learn on!)  - very good straight stitch  - good zigzag (4-5 mm is fine, more than that is gravy)  - a method of making buttonholes that makes sense to you  - adjustable presser foot pressure (which helps some fabric    handling issues)  - accessory presser feet that don't cost an arm and a leg    (machines that use a "short shank foot" typically handle    generic presser feet pretty well.  Some brands of machines use    proprietary or very expensive presser feet)    If the budget stretches far enough:    - blindhem and stretch blindhem stitches  - triple zigzag (nice for elastic applications)  - a couple of decorative stitches (you won't use them nearly as    much as you think)  - electronic machine because of the needle position control and    because the stepper motors give you full "punching force" at    slow sewing speeds -- mechanical machines often will stall at    slow speeds.      Please go to the best sewing machine dealers around and ask them  to show you some machines in your price range, *especially* used  machines you can afford. You'll get a far better machine buying  used than new, and a good dealer is worth their weight in sewing  machine needles when you get a machine problem -- often they can  talk you through the problem over the phone. While you're trying  things out, try a couple of machines (sewing only, not combo  sewing-embroidery) over your price limit, just so you can see  what the difference in stitch quality and ease of use might be.  You may find you want to go for the used Cadillac. Or you might  want the new basic Chevy. Might as well try both out.    Suggested reading: John Giordano's The Sewing Machine Book  (especially for used machines), Carol Ahles' Fine Machine Sewing  (especially the first and last few chapters) and Gale Grigg  Hazen's Owner's Guide to Sewing Machines, Sergers and Knitting  Machines. All of these are likely to be available at your public  library.    Used brands I'd particularly look for: Elna, Bernina,  Viking/Husqvarna, Pfaff, Singer (pre 1970), Juki, Toyota    New "bargain brand" I'd probably pick: Janome (who also does  Kenmore).

However, I did hear it was a very good game. If you have a 360, I would definitely consider looking into it. However, if you are looking for a good PS3 game that is multiplayer, try Call of Duty 4, or Rainbow Six: Vegas.    -Knux|`|GE9zXDQhaa	like Knux said its not for ps3 and its not an online game either. to be honest its not a good game at all.
HvbFutwZaa	Xbox 360 for online play, Wii for partying with your friends, PS3 for the graphics.    I personally like the 360.|`|r8cPOJNdaa	xbox 360; it's cheaper than playstation 3, but the grayhics aren't as good and the games aren't as good.    so probably playstation 3, final answer. xD|`|G3lkvGfDaa	360:  - Up to 4 controllers maxed.  - Best online service to date (Xbox Live), but you have to pay monthly or yearly. It's like $50 a year, $8 per month, and $20 per 3 months.  - Ton of games. Best known for its shooters like Halo 3, Mass Effect, Bioshock, Gears of War, Call of Duty 4 (also on PS3), etc. (But some of these shooting games are also on PC like Gears of War, COD4, and Bioshock)  - You can play HD-DVD if you have the HD-DVD drive otherwise you can't.  - You need to buy a separate wireless adapter to go online.  - Has HDMI 1.2.  - Better graphics (not sure). It's debatable.  - Upgradeable hard drive.  - Can store music, pictures, and videos.  - High failure rate.  - Controllers have vibration. Can be wired or wireless.    PS3:  - Games come in a variety of genres. Not many good games now but they're coming.  - Supports up to 7 wireless controllers. All wireless.  - Flash card readers.  - Can store music, pictures, and videos.  - Has HDMI 1.3a.  - Built-in Wi-Fi for wireless internet connection.  - Built-in bluetooth. Therefore you can use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse so you can use it like a computer.  - Free online service/gameplay. Home coming out soon which is like a virtual world sort of like the Sims.  - Upgradeable hard drive. (Easier to do than the Xbox)  - Can interact a PSP with it.  - Can play PS2 and PS1 games. (Except for the 40GB model which can't play PS2 games.)  - Built-in blu-ray player. Games built on blu-ray which has more capacity than Xbox's DVDs.  - More powerful engine/CPU (Cell Processor), but so far no one has tapped into that power.  - SIXAXIS/Dualshock 3 controller. SIXAXIS allows you to twist and turn the controller and the game will react to it while the Dualshock 3 gives you vibration. In a way it's similar to an Xbox and Wii controller combined.    Wii:  - Up to 2 controllers max I think. Has Wii Fit, Wii Zapper, and such.  - All the controllers are wireless except for the classic one.  - Backward compatible with GC games. Even supports up to 4 GC controllers and 2 memory cards.  - Uses memory cards to store game data.  - Can go online and play games w/ others.  - Nintendo DS can interact w/ the Wii.  - Free online.|`|zuLkfD3yaa	I think that if you are a male older than 20 then playstation 3 if you are a teenage boy X box. and the Wii is for everyone.

Jk8tQFjSaa	si venga le dejo mi favorito.....  En una tranquila ciudad de Espa?a viva un reconocido torero llamado 'El Curro'. Cerca del Curro se mud un jovial chinito, quien no saba pronunciar bien la 'erre'.  Una ma?ana, se encuentran los dos y el chino le dirigi un cordial saludo:  -?'Buen da se?ol Culo'!  Por supuesto que al Curro no le haca gracia, pero lo dej pasar. Durante la siguiente semana, haba el mismo saludo.  El Curro no pudo aguantar ms y se compr dos perros 'pastor alemn' y los entren para atacar al chino.  Cuando el chino se acerc para saludarlo, el Curro le ech los  perros.  Con suma rapidez, el asitico sac dos cuchillos de los pantalones, y se par rgido en posicin de defensa, listo para enfrentar los perros.  El Curro se da cuenta que el chino va a cortar los perros, y pega un silbido. Los perros entran a la casa. Esto se repite varias veces, hasta que el chino decide poner una denuncia en la comisara.  El comisario le pregunta:-'?Cul es su problema?'  A lo que el chino responde: -'Mile se?ol comisalio, mi denuncia es polque los pelos del culo no me dejan  caminal.'El comisario se qued perplejo, pero le sigui la corriente y dijo:  -'Bueno amigo, pues crteselos'  El chino respondi: -'Eso es lo que quielo hacel, pelo cada vez que los quielo coltal, el Culo silba y los pelos se van pa la dentlo'                otro...    Dos paisas conversan y uno le dice al otro:  - Hermano , mire que voy a pedir la mano de mi novia pero, no se si los suegros me vayan a aceptar.  -?Ya s! Acomp?eme y cada cosa que yo diga usted la exagera.  Dicho y hecho, llego la noche y se fue el tipo con su amigo a pedir la mano de su novia. Llegan a la casa de los suegros y despus de la cena, el suegro le pregunta al novio de su hija:  -?Bueno, y usted tiene carro?  - S, por ah tengo un carrito.  A esta frase el amigo agrega:  -?Un carrito? Si lo que tiene es un Mercedes y un BMW de este a?o.  El suegro muy contento pregunta:  -?Y tiene tierras?  -S, se?or, tengo un lotecito.  -?Un lotecito? -responde el amigo-. Hermano, no sea modesto. Cunteles de las haciendas y las propiedades que tiene en la Costa.  Los suegros estn muertos de la dicha, con tremendo yerno, y preguntan:  - Bueno, bueno. ?Y usted como esta de salud?  - Pues... bien. -responde el novio- Por ah tengo una gripita.  -?Una gripita? -responde el amigo-.

LBeTKf5iaa	The microSD can store games, but without a device that can read the files, it's impossible to get the games to work. It's like a cable box without a television. You have the channels, but you can't watch them. So ultimately, you need to purchase an R4 to make it work on the ds. (M3 works also)

Q3Zo8iJEaa	Yes there is a call of duty world at war beta.  To get it, you should preorder it at gamestop, where you are guaranteed a spot in the beta.  You can also register at callofduty.com, but there is a very slim chance you would receive it by this method.  (If you were a member of the Call of Duty 4 website -the charlie oscar delta one, you can recover your account on Callofduty.com/points.  The beta is already out for Treyarch employees and their friends and family who they personally sent codes to.

5a47bc2648f4b8836b41ab40ec377e25aa	I find zone defense to be most effective when playing the pass, but only if you apply effective pressure on the quarterback. CPU controlled defenders are always a step or two behind when covering man, so the opposing quarterback can usually complete to them unless your CB is extremely fast and rated high.    Use a zone defense, put four lineman on the line and manually blitz a linebacker. Works best with dime or nickel (Cover 2 with Nickel and 3 Deep Safe in Dime -- from either of those defenses, you can manually blitz the LB from the side with frequent success, the LB only leaves a small hole in the middle that your safety will usually collapse on quickly if they throw to a short slant). Even if you don't get a sack, any time you hurry the QB, he'll throw an interception or bad pass. You will give up some completions on slants underneath, but usually for less than 10 yards. Be careful that you get some sort of pressure, because a danger with zone is that if the QB gets enough time and the receiver runs a streak, only a safety will be left to guard him, so you can get screwed.    The defenses that have the linemen stunt (swap rushing slots rather than pass rushing straight ahead into the linemen) usually work slightly better at hurrying the QB. Also call a line audible and spread out your linemen.    If you can't generate an adequate pass rush or  they've got some killer WR, double cover him and try man. 4-3 man always works better against the run.    Of course there's no easy answer for "all the time", which is true in real football, and part of what makes Madden such a good game.

AK-47  Mini Uzi  Semi-Auto Shotgun (Can't remember name sorry)  M60E4 (The 3rd LMG)  Dragaunov  Desert Eagle    Firstly the easiest one to get is the Golden desert eagle, to get it you need to get to level 55.    The others are unlocked by challenges, as you know there are the headshots which get you, Digital, Blue tiger, Red tiger.  Well to get gold you need to do the headshot challenges for all guns in that catergory.    For example. To get the gold mini uzi you need.  Red tiger MP5  Red tiger Skorpion  Red tiger Mini Uzi  Red tiger P90  Red tiger AK-74u    And the same for the other gun categories. Hope this helps (:|`|NfsGPniJaa	just finish the headshot challenges on each and every gun and you get one golden gun from every completed gun category.

I got the shotgun one early on, because there are only two guns in that category, once I unlocked the red camo for both of the shotguns, I unlocked gold camo for one of the shotguns.    however, it only unlocks Gold camo for one gun in each category, not every gun can get gold camo. if you get all the headshots for assault rifles, for example, then you unlock gold camo for the AK-47,    hope that helps.|`|WXS3rCOxaa	Easier said than done, trust me.      To get the Gold eagle you just have to reach level 55.    To get the golden AK 47, you must get red tiger camo for every gun in the Assault rifle category (M16,G36c,M14,G3,M4 Carbine, MP44)    That applies for for the Mini Uzi, M60E4, Dragunov, and second shotty.    Complete red tiger for each gun in Sub Machine Gun category (MP5, Skorpion, Mini Uzi, P90 and AK 74u), Light Machine Gun category (SAW, RPD, M60E4), Sniper Rifle category (M40A3, M21, Dragunov, R700, Barrett 50. cal) and Shotgun category (W1200 and M10.,.. whatever)    You get camo's by getting headshots with a gun.|`|RlyzJPlzaa	Play "cage match" 1vs.1 and just tell your opponent "headshots", and most likely he will do a headshots match, where you guys meet at a certain area of the map and get consecutive heashots, 9 for one person and 9 for the other...its a faster way of doing it, I don't recommend it, no skill in shortcuts.|`|IsSPW3QFaa	wen you get to lvl 55 you get the golden Deagle   then if you get ALL weapon  challenges completed for that kind of weapon you get the golden gun (like for a gold dragonov you have to have red tiger and ACOGs on all the snipers )|`|aoqPoUGkaa	complete all the challenges in a weapons class, eg. sniper, smg, assault.

Dso7k3sjaa	You probably got something that won't work right with the games you have.  Or, you might have ended up downloading something that is conflicting with something else.  There are hacks on MTS2 and even though I LOVE hacks (lol!) sometimes one hack will have a problem with another hack.  So, you have to "test" them out one by one.  Anyway, the easiest thing to do to try to find the problem and fix it, is to pull your Downloads folder out to your desktop.    Now go back into the game folders and make a new, empty folder named Downloads.  Then, move only two or three files into it, check to make sure your game is still working.  Move two or three more into it, check again, etc.    You can make subfolders inside of your Downloads folder as long as you have Nightlife or any later released ep.  If you only have the old, original game that was just called The Sims 2, or that game and University then you can't.  But if you can make subfolders, you might find it easier to put two or three items into a subfolder first, then check to make sure your game still works then make a new subfolder for the next two or three items, etc.  That way, when you finally notice your game is messing up, you can just pull out the last subfolder instead of trying to figure out which 3 were the last 3 files you put in.    Oh, but if you have the CEP installed, you can't put that file into a subfolder.  It won't work.  When you look at the CEP file in your Downloads folder, it is the file named:  _EnableColorOptionsGMND.package.  You can just leave this one it as it definitely wouldn't be the one causing you a problem anyway.    But in reality, that's the best way to try to find the problem -- unless you have tons of files anyway.

AQ9JxT5xaa	Custom Firmware (cfw) is basically like the official firmware, except you can run free games, apps like youtube, google earth, and a whole bunch of other stuff.    1.50 kernel lets you downgrade to the extremely hackable version 1.50.  This also gives you cfw.  I personally didn't use the kernel.  I bought a hybrid pandora battery and magic memory stick and installed cfw there.    The pandora battery is just a battery modded to boot up files in the magic memory stick.  The magic memory stick really isn't magic, and is just a regular memory stick modded to hold special files that work with the pandora battery to hack the psp.    Of course it isn't legal.  You get to download free PSP games for free.  You are also hacking the PSP.|`|WL1Tmx8Eaa	I know owning the psp is legal cuz i have 1 it is a playstation portable   sorry i dont know the others :(

Go3rS3C6aa	Animal crossing is a game where you get a town, but you are not an animal the villagers are! you are a human, the wifi is great. There is many things you can do like fishing , catching bugs and planting flowers. Its the first game that plays while you dont play ( creepy but no ). if you dont play for a while, time passes and the things in the store changes. it has a sense of time    Get The one for Wii it is better. Or The Ds one both have good wifi.    if you get either one join the animal crossing community.http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/    The sims 2 is great for pc but idk about ds , the PC one is fantastic great graphics and its like playing as god.  i think my sims would be the same but its like lil chibi characters

AA11707728	Just google warcraft private server.    Typically, you have to roll back your version to whatever the private server is using.  Then edit a file to tell the client to point at the private servers instead of the commercial ones.  And, most important of all, start the game directly by clicking on the WoW executable instead of the launcher program (it resets the server list is why).  Most private servers maintain a website that explains this.  It's really not hard.  Most private servers are free and many have interesting perks.  For example, one I know of, you start out at level 80 and have 10,000 gold.  Special vendors are stocked with nice level 70 gear and the loot tables are set to 500x normal while honor points are 100x normal.  Basically, new people spend some time gearing up and then raid with none of the hassle of leveling up a toon.    For the person who said Blizz is cracking down....there are HUNDREDS of private servers with a huge, well developed community.  Obviously Blizz is doing nothing of the sort.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Just check out WOWscape's website, all you do is make a username and password, you can figure it out and have it up and running "if WoW is already installed" in like 15 minutes.|`|MnGGEMwBaa	All you need to do is pick one of these  http://www.xtremetop100.com/world-of-war... register on the site and follow the steps.. Once registered you basically edit a notepad file and put in the code that they tell you.. Their server address... They all explain how to do it though.. Enjoy EDIT; some of them allow you to level up incredibly fast or you can start as a level 80 but if you want the normal wow experience look for servers that have blizzlike in the description.. That means they are 'like' the blizzard servers.. ie normal drops normal exp and so on|`|MctSGNiHaa	Blizzard is cracking down and closing all Private Servers. They are a violation of the EULA and ToS agreements.    People found running them can be banned from WoW indefinitely, and this has been happening for the past few months.    That being said I'm not certain what happens to people that are merely using them and not running them, so beware. If you do choose to use a private server, the other suggestions would be a good place to start.|`|RH03VxERaa	what doogle said  Thanks for the  |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)

What exactly he means by "advanced," I guess we'll have to wait and see (though personally, I think it means they may have injected it with one of the many viruses we've seen throughout the series).

uctxzjIIaa	Officially, no one, as the reason they gave her the name Unknown was because they didn't make any sort of story for her, and thus even the creators didn't know who she is. And she's never appeared in any other Tekken game.    However, since she is a rather small woman, and she always starts every round using Jun's moveset, most fan assume she is Jun who has been possessed by some sort of wolf demon. Of course, this is pure speculation, which will likely never get confirmed or denied ni future games.

Arcade Games - ranging from old school games to completely original games  3. Demos - demos of new games you may want to buy    Most games will shun gamers who don't have the latest map packs and not allow you to join all game types without them.

ysiE6IDjaa	Well, I have a lot of babies and kids in college using a hack called The Insimenator. Using The Insimenator is more or less the same as using the boolprop testing cheats. So what happens is that your Sim babies grow up on campus as they normally would in your normal Sim neighbourhood, and the school bus comes for them when they reach school age, etc. And then when they turn into teenagers they automatically become young adults and university students, which is kind of weird if their parents are still in college and young adults as well!   So what you could do is fast-forward their parents' final exams and graduations and have them move back to the original neighbourhood before their kids reach young adulthood if you want to keep things more realistic. Then have their kids go through college and reunite with the parents in the neighbourhood once they graduate as well.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	You wont be able to get them home.  They will always stay with the parents.  When they get older (such as a adult) you could then move them out (thats if you dont have the inteenimater) and if you do have the inteenimater you could move out the sims teens when they become teens and you dont  have to wait until they get to be an adult you could just move them out right then and there...but you must have the inteenimater installed in order to do that.

The best bet would be to go to a game store like gamecrazy or a CD/DVD store. They can resurface the disc for you and make it as good as new for less then $3.|`|jFM4WxR6aa	once you get the rings like that only part of the game if that will work..sucks for you dude..|`|Brca4ZVPaa	My son uses pledge to clean is scratch disc and it works.

C7mD5Y3Waa	Try other games and see if you have the same problems.  from the sound of it, it sounds like the start of a failing gamecube. after a while, the gamecube loses it's ability to read disks, so it has to be adjusted manually, have its lens replaced, or replace the gamecube altogether. If games can no longer be read, you'll need to do this to get it working: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube...|`|zIXReHyTaa	Take it back and exchange it for another one and if that also does not work you have your answer.|`|aSq7YLzEaa	if you got it used you should be able to return it and get a new one no problem or hassles. Try cleaning it before you bring it back though.|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	if all your other games work then take it back if possible.  Gamestop gives you 30 days for defective games.  If not, try using windex and a soft cloth.  If the scratches are bad you may try one of those refurbishers, but all those do is turn the big scratches into a bunch of little ones.|`|7c6hkUbTaa	Exchange it if you can. But my gamecube does something like that with my memory card it doesn't read the 16mb one and tells me to format it. The gamecube is odd. I think it's just your disc it could be scratched in a certain place where it reads the training mode. I would exchange it, if they would let you. You might have to bring the receipt for the game.|`|rdp95817aa	try to find more scratches on the game if there are a lot then you can return it or sell it or by a new one thats what happened to me|`|Hyo3BMI7aa	i think its just the game try another and if it works then u no and if it doesn't then go to a eletronics store|`|Yo2XdHPRaa	well sometimes stupid skratches can cause a game to freeze to so you can try to take you game to game stop and maybe they can help you.                   i have not tryed this yet but at family video they have a buffing machine and they use it for getting the skratches out of dvds maybe.    i no u can take dvds in there and can get them sccratches buffed out so maybe you can try that with your game disk

The puppies will take up spots, so maybe that's the problem?|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	If the dog/cat is preggo that doesnt mean tht the sim cant get preggo.  But the two that your trying to get to have a baby together must have a good relationship together or that option for "try for baby" won't show up. Or it could be because you have too many people in the house but you could always move some of those adults out...so you could make room for the incoming babies

Contrary to what GTA4s box says there is no co-op unless its referring to free play in which could only be played on live with 2 different consoles. I guess it is referring to how many people can fit in a single car lol!|`|F0d2W9Zyaa	I am pretty sure you cannot do it both ways.

If you are actually wondering how: At the start up screen where you have options like Continue, New Game, Check Wi-Fi, etc. there should be an option that says migrate pokemon close to the bottom. If you have Pokemon Emerald or Saphire in the GBA slot, all you have to do is select six pokemon from the PC boxes, and it should save. Go to the building above and talk to the park manager.

pKlKJR4qaa	At 40 strength your combat level is probably only around 50, meaning that the quests that give the highest strength xp are probably out of your range. But anyway to answer your question is While Guthix Sleeps (grandmaster quest) which can give 400000 strength, literally getting you from 40 strength to 64. Next is monkey madness which can give you 35k strength or 20k strength, With the 35k xp strength you'd go from level 40 strength to 48. Here are some quests within your level range that give strength xp or lamps that you can spend on strength xp. Scorpian Catcher, Twi Bwo Wanna whatever, Meeting History and Swept away (halloween 2008 quest, still available for members, near ardougne)|`|e5981a592b6fe7cbc15da7f992be57ebaa	Dragon slayer.

Based on another game I think its about 6 months of continuous absence from the game without subscribing. In practicality is far easier and cheaper to add more storage to their database then cull unused profiles, so unless they really need that space, its doubtful they will ever delete any profile outside extenuating circumstances.|`|lZhE9KpTaa	by blizzard -- no unless you go to the option under account management.  your account may be banned? or got hacked.

You can see the life on it so you will know when it opens. The pouch drops presents like white, red, and other colors, but it doesn't matter if you do the most damage. Anyone can pick up the presents, and after you pick 1 or 2 up, you can talk to the Maple Administrator to get a prize. The prizes aren't very good though. Last time i got a white present, and i got 15 white potions :(  Well, hope i helped! :D
yicKRgiKaa	Well, the best way to start is to go to the Internet Explorer in the PSP XMB. (cross media bar) You shouldn't be able to connect right away, so you will be able to manually find a connection. Mind you, this has to be wireless.   You will be able to choose from a list of connections within range of the PSP, and whether it has a wep key or not you can enter it in (if you know it). If it is not protected, you should just be able to name the connection, and bam! Connection. :)
f45sjVavaa	well, when i was that level, i made 300 k in a few minutes. If u just keep fighting monsters, a monster might drop a really rare item, like a maple item, which can be sold at armor/weapon shops for a lot of money. u could also fame people for money, though i think that is against the rules. also, if u join a party or a guild, people in it with u will give u money. it's easy to make money in Maplestory, u just need to keep trying.

It is:    set realmlist us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com  set patchlist us.version.worldofwarcraft.com  set portal us    Save your realmlist.  4.  Start up WoW and try to login.  It shouldn't work since you don't have a retail account.  5.  Exit out of WoW.  6.  Get the realmlist for the server you want to join.  Go into your realmlist file and delete the retail realmlist.  Copy and paste the realmlist of the server you want to join into your realmlist file.  Save.  7.  If you already registered with the server you want to join, skip to step 9.    8.  If you have not registered already, go register on that specific server's site.  9.  Start up WoW and login as the user you registered on your new server's website.  10.

hBsdAXuKaa	You don't have to spend real money in order to earn gold :). I have quite a large gold quantity and I've never used real cash to accomplish that. Buying and selling in the Marketplace is the best method I know of that doesn't require using actual funds. Simply buy things below the current market price and sell them for a reasonable profit. Prices in the Marketplace fluctuate rapidly and you can use this to your advantage.     Checking auctions for expiring items is also helpful if you find the right deal. Many times bid prices are much lower than the actual sale price allowing for a nice profit on your gold.    I've also found the aquarium pretty helpful. Currently, I make an average of 1-8k a day on items granted by the Overseer. Feed your fish daily and as your aquarium health improves, your overseer gift value will improve also.

You should change your pw immediately and steer clear of phony websites that ask for such information in exchange for neopoints.    There are lots of websites out there that you can use to help you get lots of neopoints over time. They usually include a 'daily' link where you just click around to get your daily freebies without even needing to work for it. Of course, you'll need to play some games / participate on the website to get the bulk of your np. Those websites also offer you tips on which games yield the most np and are easiest to master in.    You can find some examples in the souces below. Happy hunting, and watch out in the future!|`|t6cDAHpgaa	i have NP ... do you have a shop ? im always looking to by things ,,, add me     dark_angel305|`|YHYL8Nktaa	quit the stupid game

m2A8ohARaa	Have them check out any bowling centers in the area.  While this is typically the middle of the season, there are generally short seasons as well, with most lasting 10 weeks or so.  If no leagues are available to join at this time, consider summer leagues.  These are generally 16 weeks and they offer some benefits a full season wouldn't; for example a Have-A-Ball league where the weekly league dues pay for in part of the bowler's ball and drilling.
1abe682e26fafa5ffdfad0f635e42e45aa	The buttons themselves don't make a lot of noise but the switch you mentioned does. That is the strum bar and everytime you hit that it makes a clicking sound. If you strum on it lightly the noise is not that noticeable. Other than that the controller is pretty quiet.|`|AA10809391	it does not drown out the sound. It is a little loud.|`|aoOBEn4Raa	You can hear it but only really while you watching people. You get to "into" the music. IMO
0GIV43Fmaa	Fastpasses saves you time. Go early in the morning. You can hit a lot of rides. Go on rides during parades or shows. Bring some snacks so you don't have to pay a lot in the park: chips, candy, and even water, $1 in store beats like $3 in the park.|`|wRb4Wgj1aa	get a fast pass for a line that actually has a long wait, like people said below.  OR, if the fast pass time is coming quick, (like in the next hour or so, for example, say it's 12:00 and your return time is 1:00), get the fast pass, go do something else, and save the pass for later in the day when the ride is busy and if it has a short standby time, ride it too--especially rides like space mountain/indiana jones that you want to ride more than once.  we collect passes and use them later.  the times just can't overlap.|`|AA10214265	The Fast Pass is essentially an appointment time to return and get on the ride. Fast Pass lines are generally quicker than standby lines, but not always - depends on the size of the crowd. Fast Passes are also not offered for every attraction. You need your entry ticket in order to collect a Fast Pass.<br>  <br>  With a little planning (and a lot of walking) it is possible to hold six Fast Passes at once. You are supposed to get one Fast Pass at a time and can get a second after your appointment time or two hours after collecting your Fast Pass. So if you got a Fast Pass at 8am with an 11am return time, you could collect a second one at 10am.<br>  <br>  Pass #1: Collect a Fast Pass as soon as you enter the park. Indiana Jones or Space Mountain are good first Fast Pass attractions because they do occasionally run out.<br>  <br>  Pass #2: Roger Rabbit is on a different system, so head to ToonTown and pick up your second Pass.<br>  <br>  Pass #3: The two parks are on different systems, so hop over to California Adventure and pick up your third Fast Pass.<br>  <br>  Pass #4: Grizzly River Rapids is on a different system, so pick up your fourth Fast Pass.<br>  <br>  Pass #5 and 6: Two hours after collecting your first pass in each park, pick up another pass in each park, collecting your fifth and sixth Pass.<br>  <br>  One additional thing about Fast Passes is that they can generally be used after your appointment time.|`|PYIkyYYIaa	This site has some good tips you should check out --<br>  <a href="http://www.kidfriendlytravel.mymommycan.org/disneyland-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidfriendlytravel.mymommycan....</a>|`|Z15xtOuUaa	Well, its important to know that a lot of the time the ride lines r very long, but fast passes dont always make u go fast. I've gone faster then the fast pass line while i was in line for thunder mountain railroad. So the best thing is just to know what ride to go on when.For example go on splash mountain ( water ride ) sometime before 12: 00 pm (noon)because not many people will want to go on that early. So u just have to be really smart about what rides u go on when. Be Clever!|`|CNWIFSeZaa	a fast pass is a pass that you use to skip the long lines and instead u get into the fast pass line which goes way quicker. it works bcuz they only give out a certain number of fast passes for every time slot on the ride that u get the pass for. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|KJZ5hEChaa	you get like so many and you skip the long lines and trust me i waitied like 1 1/2 hrs for 1 ride .. you shud def. get it :)|`|c3cGQhPRaa	get fastpasses|`|WUBZrmXzaa	some good tips on page below -- definitely know how to use fastpass and get early admission if you can, makes the day SOOOO much better!|`|Y2VeMudEaa	There is a prety good list with details of tips for optimizing your Disneyland Resort experience at Disney-O-Rama.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.disneyorama.com/2008/08/optimizing-your-disneyland-resort-experience/" rel="nofollow">http://www.disneyorama.com/2008/08/optim...</a>

6ac89f4c5c098186328d1b26a2cbdee9aa	The best place to train magic is in the Grand Exchange.  Do either high alchemy if you're above lvl 55, or superheat item if you are lower (make steel bars).  If you're really low level, use Fist of Guthix like you said, or else use teleport or body rune spells as your finances allow.<br>  <br>  If you're down to body rune spells, I like shooting at the skeletons across the river in the Varok sewer.  But I find that Fist of Guthix is quicker and cheaper if you don't mind getting hitpoints.  Try to find a FOG world where there's a lot of high levels.  If you fight low level folks, it takes forever to get magic up.|`|DzjudGu2aa	Hello i am willing to trade either a lvl 78 runescape account (user:thp8999) or lvl 99 runescape account (USER:rock music5) for the lvl 78 you can trade lvl 55 up but for the lvl 99 lvl 80 up. these accounts both got about 3 days of membership left. they got good items and lots of cash lvl 99 12 MILL$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ and lvl 78 got 9.5 mill$$$$$$$$ yea i know its alot of cash i am serious those account realy got that much money they got tons of good items plz email me if u would like to trade email me for more infomation on the runescape acconts thanks for your time|`|wXGnIdkNaa	About Train Runescape Magic can be read in <a href="http://best-answer-blog.blogspot.com/?q=Train%20Runescape%20Magic" rel="nofollow">http://best-answer-blog.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>|`|X6Di5elQaa	Runescape sucks.|`|cqIeKcIWaa	a=what is you r account name add me <br>  "xhardcorex77"  ill tell you on there

An unmodified PS2 will not recognise a pirated disc as a PS2 game. In order to use the discs, you'll have to get your PS2 chipped.    It should be noted that chipped PS2's are just as illegal as those pirated discs you're asking about.    As I recall, there are two sorts of chip for the PS2, and unlike the Xbox, installing a chip in a PS2 comes with a high risk of destroying the system (just speaking of the physical chips, not the more sophisticated software sort, of which I have no experience).    ~ Carnage|`|PLv34VSTaa	i don't think so... the PS2 can detect if its pirated and it wont work...

I have to give u that.  But it is fun 4 only about 4 hours after u have beaten the campan.  Also the versus mode is only fun for about 1 hour.  Overall i would get Fallout 3 because it always keeps u occupied.  So many things to do in fallout. Definetly get Fallout u will not regret it.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	Id reccomend getting L4D and ill be glad to challenge you at some Halo :)<br>  Hey check out the Halo montage that some of my clips are in:<br>  YouTube.com "The 4th Dancetage" my clips are the double lift sticks plus the frag nade triple (at beginning), the accidental noscope plus purposful one on Valhalla (right after the "where do we take the flag" part), the 18 missed shots, and the power drain plus banshee= fail.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Fallout 3 is the best of that bunch by far. It has the most replayability and is really fun. Great graphics, story, world, gameplay... everything. There's TONS to explore and it can easily get over 100 hours if your very completist about things or replay from "good or evil" perspectives. The best bang for your buck.<br>  <br>  If you like Bethesda's work (Elder Scrolls) then you'll like this. It's an actionish-RPG and I've beaten it 3 times already if that tells you anything. A must own for any collection, you'll lose sleep over it.<br>  <br>  Street Fighter IV is a good fighting game, but thats all it is... a fighting game. I'd wait for the price to come down on a used copy before springing for that one. Also, online for that is a pain... as its been out in Japan already for over a year so you'll get ganked a lot.<br>  <br>  Dead Rising is a decent shooter, fun for the zombie aspects of it... but it's short and not very in-depth. Limited weaponry and the strategy of it is kinda weak.|`|F6gv51aiaa	My friends say that Fallout 3 is AMAZING. It has a long story line, so you won't get board. They also have lots of DLC to download.|`|28jxnTi6aa	here Left For Dead 99% street fight 4 32% and Fallout 3 98%|`|hrn7VLWvaa	i would have to go with fallout 3 cause it lasts a REALLY long time. the only thing is the story line isn't that long but u can get the expansion packs off of xbox live which gives you a new story line you can follow. i haven't played the expansion pack but ive heard its pretty good. after a while it gets kinda boring like all games do cause after you beat the storyline you are basically just going around and trying to find the secert weapons and armor. so i would have to go with fallout 3|`|v33bnxICaa	Your best bet is most definitely Fallout 3. Left 4 Dead is a very good game that has good replay value and is very fun to play with friends, the same can be said about SF4, but Fallout 3 is such a deep and addicting game that you can easily lose sleep at night because you can't get it out of your mind. The only bad thing about Fallout 3 imo is that you can only get to level 20 and after you can't level up anymore the game loses a little luster. However, even when you can't gain any more experience, the game is still very fun and has lots to do. With the main quest, all the side quests, and the upcoming dlc (which is hopefully going to be better than Anchorage) you will have many many hours of gameplay in no time. <br>  P.S<br>  Left 4 Dead and SF4 are certainly worth a look at, and eventually buying.

d0f5RJ8Jaa	you haven't mentioned what it is made of. <br>  but i guess using some sand paper over it in vertical motion will give it an aging effect. start off lightly till you get the desired result. <br>  then you can also rub in some mud/dirt or it's color-equivalent, along with some soot towards the bottom where the engines shoot off ...<br>  <br>  hope these help<br>  all the very best.|`|UtBb83Aeaa	First, start by collecting as many photos of the shuttle as you can. The weathering effects are subtle. They can probably be simulated nicely using powdered chalks. This works best if the model was painted with a satin or flat finish paint first--it won't work as well on smooth, bare plastic.<br>  <br>  If you can't find powdered chalks, get small set of pastel chalk sticks from a craft store. Rub a chalk stick on coarse sandpaper to make powder. Rub a soft, short-bristle brush in the chalk powder, then lightly streak it onto the model where you see the streaks on the real one. Start with lighter colors, like gray and tan, before using any darker ones like brown or black--this way you won't overdo it. It's also best to practice on painted plastic scraps first.<br>  <br>  When you are satisfied with the weathering effects, lightly spray the model with a clear fixative to keep it from smudging.|`|rFHw0BdTaa	Take black weathering poweder from hobby shop brush it on from the nose to the back,  shuttle do not age they brun on reentry.

If it passes through vital organs your chances of surviving shrink, with an average survival rate of 1:35000, as the power of the lightning is many orders of magnitude stronger than anything your body naturally produces to control organs.    Technically any blood along the path will get hot as for the few fractions of a second the lightning strike exists for it can reach temperatures above 20000C, but not for long enough to heat your blood throughout your body.|`|BJIcuvMpaa	I have actually watched a girl that got struck by lightening and she is still alive but I am sure a lot of people die from it to!|`|1Ar4IkdLaa	I have a cousin who was struck by lightning, and he didn't die.

e84f84d61c7a6228fd057f22fe9eea3faa	How to Earn PoE [PuzzlePirates]    Written in one day by, World Leader!     The way I became wealthy was out of luck. One my 2nd day of playing I bought in for 20poe in a no limit room. Some guy thought he was a big shot and went all in with 450 PoE. I called and so did someone else. The pot was 920 PoE. I had pocket threes. The Flop was 3 Hearts, 2 spades, and 3 Diamonds. I had won with a four-of-a-kind. I cashed out and then went into a room with 200 PoE-2,000 PoE. I had got 2 Hearts and 3 Hearts to start with. Just like the older game, someone went all in with 1,700 PoE. Another guy called with the same amount. None of them had hearts. The Flop consisted of all hearts. I had won 2,600 PoE from the main pot.     I cashed out and went into a room with 2,000 PoE-20,000PoE stakes. I cashed in with 2,000 PoE. Someone that was as rich as the gods had went all in with 65,000poe. Someone else called with 40,000 PoE. I called with 2,000 PoE. He thought I was weak, but when he saw my Aces, I guess he regretted that move. The Flop was Queen  Jack  Ten. Since he had Two Kings, he had a straight draw. The Turn, an Ace. He had a straight ace high. I needed an Ace to get a Four-of-a-kind to win. River was an ACE! I won and immediately cashed out. I decided to get to a 20,000 PoE to 200,000 PoE room. Someone bet, 300,000 PoE. Two other people called with the same amount. Pot was 920,000 PoE. I had a Straight King High!     I was so excited because I had won 920,000 PoE! I even entered a tournament with a prize of a familiar. I won it along with 150,000 PoE! Since Familiars were rare back then, I sold it for 3,000,000 PoE. Most people would buy an Estate. I instead bought a Grand Frigate and called that my home. I bought a bungalow, but was only used to store my clothes and PoE. My Row house was only used for crew meetings, parties, and friendly gatherings. Nobody suspected that I had 3,920,000 PoE in my pocket at first because I was just a greenie. My ranks were all Novices so it was hard to believe that I was rich and a Senior Officer.     My Captain also was a king. He made me a prince so that I can wear a crown and because I was loyal and supplied most of the resources. Our flag had taken over an island and I was made Governor because of my wealth. I was able to afford all the shops and what not. Now my skills are better than ever. Battle Navigating on a Grand Frigate increases your skill quickly.     Chances are that this wont happen to you. Very few people win that much in poker. So, Ill let you choose, poker or pillaging? Pillaging is my main source of wealth along with the shops on my island. I wont tell anyone my pirates name and ocean for obvious reasons. I dont want greenies and such begging me for PoE. It gets quite annoying.  NOTE: if you do become rich, hide your riches around greenies and the poorer people unless you want to get begged to death. For me, begging got to the point of me having to put my auto response to NO! because everyone asked, Can I have some PoE?
AA11539971	try wikipedia  while ur at it, look up the 106 yr old lightbulb...|`|5WBEyM36aa	Lamp (Light Bulb) Information   How well your lighting performs often depends on the bulb. Different bulbs provide different light.     Incandescent light is used most frequently in our homes; it is produced by a tungsten thread that burns slowly inside a glass bulb. This is the light we are used to. The light is slighting yellow tinged. You can also now buy slightly blue or pink tinged bulbs.     A-bulbs are the standard. That's a regular light bulb. It can have either a little base, called a C or candelabra base or a bigger base called either an E or Edison base or an M or medium base. There are also intermediate or European base sockets. (If you have one of these, go buy an adapter. A little metal ring that goes into the socket will make a C base bulb fit and then you won't have to go searching for bulbs anymore.)     Incandescent bulbs are inexpensive to buy, but they aren't as energy efficient. They use more electricity to make the light than other choices and they don't last as long. But, many fixtures are designed for them and the light from them is pleasant. It's what we're used to. A-lamps provide a comfortable light and an average life of about 750 hours.     Incandescent bulbs are also available as globes, small round bulbs like you see on some bath lighting and as decorative flame or tear drop bulbs. They can have either a C candelabra base or E Edison (M Medium) base. That is what we think of as a "regular light bulb" base.    Incandescent R Lamps, PAR Lamps, BR Lamps    If you want more control over where your light goes, you can use a reflectorized bulb that has a mirrored coating on the back of the bulb to aim the light forward. R lamps, Reflactor lamps and PAR lamps, Parabolic Reflector bulbs direct two to four times as much light forward as a regular (A lamp) light bulb.    These are what you usually see in flood lights, recessed lights and track lights. They produce a more controlled beam because the back is silvered. They spread the light or narrow it down, as a spot. These lamps are well suited for accenting and wall washing where directional control is required. Wide beam lamps can also be effectively used for general lighting. Average lamp life is about 2,000 hours MR11, MR16, Bi-pins, etc.    Low voltage incandescent lighting is especially useful for accent lighting. Operating on 12 or 24 volts, these lights require transformers (often built into the fixture) to step down the voltage from the standard 120-volt household circuit. Low voltage fixtures are relatively expensive to buy; but in general, can be energy and cost-efficient if carefully planned.     The most common are the MR bulbs. These usually operate at 12 volts and have a more tightly wound tungsten filament that aims the light better. Beam distributions range from Very Narrow to Wide flood. Average lamp life is 2,500 hours.     Halogen is usually low-voltage but may use standard line current. The popular MR-16 bulb offers a variety of beam spreads.     Halogen produces a brilliant pure white light. It provides more light per watt than incandescent and the bulbs, if properly cared for last a lot longer. They may be used in track, recessed lighting, wall sconces, torchiers, pendants, really any application.    Halogen has two disadvantages: it's higher initial cost and it's higher replacement bulb cost.|`|PgCVD4osaa	im not sure but it was invented in canada

F0K0szsUaa	I got hacked plenty of times. Okay, the person who gave you the account just scammed you. It's obvious he has recovery questions. Scammers pretend to quit Runescape and give their account to someone, then they log back in and check who's been on it (that code at the top of that message that pops up after you log in). After they know that code, they can hack any account that's been played on your computer. I don't know if he can do that, but I looked it up on the Internet and found that answer.|`|D5mKkjlLaa	Apparently he knew your password before...Lol...He couldn't log in without u logging out first so he used his account to lure u to log out...then he logged into your account....Use your recoveries to take back e account...recoveries r not for nuthin...LOL    Use a bot..If u consider that a cheat  Try this website..its good.

DE7Si9emaa	It's mandated that games are rated BEFORE release. Furthermore, developers don't really care about getting the game rated unless it has to be edited prior to release; the publisher worries about it.    According to wikipedia, "To obtain a rating for a game, a publisher sends the ESRB videotaped footage of the game's most graphic and extreme content. The publisher also fills out a questionnaire describing the game's content and encloses a check for between $2,000 and $3,000."    Note that only THREE people watch the footage any given time, and if they all agree to a rating the process moves forward. I guess then, that the process can take longer if the raters disagree or if, further along the line (after the rater's initial decision was passed onto the publisher), if the raters playing the final copy of the game decide that the previous rating was inappropiate.  Your estimate of a week doesn't sound too far off.|`|eSYX8gVwaa	how ever long it takes them 2 beat it...twice

For your Ip Address, subnet mask, gateway and etc  input the numbers that are shown where you used the CMD command on your computer. they should be listed under your ethernet connection. input those, making sure you are correctly seperating every thing.    sorry if my instructions are not clear, it is a hard thing to guide you through. if you need further help, im sure you can google it.     good luck.|`|IsPWJplGaa	You got to have a Wireless Router and broadband.|`|joqqcGbRaa	u need a wireless router i think|`|LZzgVoA5aa	First of all, u must be using a computer not relying on a wireless router to get usb to work, but i found that the usb isn't very reliable - go for a wireless router.|`|T1JehHPBaa	Is it the Official Nintendo wi-fi USB connecter? if its from another company then take that s**t back.
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You use the HDMI cable for Hi-Fi resolution.    HDMI is way better than the composite cables.    HDMI is slightly better than component cables on a 1080p TV.    HDMI is about the same as component cables on a 720p/1080i TV.|`|ysclTmCoaa	Providing you have a HDMI port on your TV, it is currently the best way to carry the digital signal between devices.    If you're using a decent quality HDMI cable, and have a reasonable HD TV, the results can be breathtaking compared to SD.|`|RpIqaCPOaa	HDMI cable if for connecting  your PS3 to a Hi Def TV. It's also well worth getting.

You can only use with an HDTV that has an HDMI port. And yes, the graphics are much better.

GNJF1e4Qaa	Go to Sandgem Town, & then go along the water route from the beach. You'll meet alot of water pokemon trainers, so stock up. Once you get to land, just go to th end of the island & there will be Pal Park.  Pal Park is a place where you can go to migrate Pokemon from GBA games like Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, & LeafGreen. You'll have to get them again through a catching show however. I never participated in one, so I really don't know for sure how that works.   Theres also a girl there who will ask to see a Snorlax, indirectly. If you show her one she'll give you a new Poketch app. Then she'll ask to see a Kecleon & give you another Poketch app when you show her one.  Hope it helps!|`|hCQGhBoSaa	you will have to fly to the town where the proffesors assistant live or the town where proffesor rowan lives and go down from the poke center to find a beach surf from there all the way down to find a huge island when you hit the end of the island go inside the house you will thenn meet proffesor oak

584b4b6200ed0a9b35d6dad654cc16a5aa	En primer lugar el loro de peluche que me regalo mi abuelo cuando yo tenia 8 a?os, todavia lo tengo y paso por un perro re nervioso q le rompio el pico, por mi perrito que le saco un adornito que tenia en su cabeza... ay amo a ese peluche, es al que mas adoracion tengo. Cuando viajo a Peru siempre va conmigo, cuando estaba en 3 o de la primaria lo llevaba a la escuela para q me de suerte... ahh lindos recuerdos con ese bicho, hasta q tuve mis loritos de verdad y se me fue un poco el afan por el porq creci, pero todavia sigo abrazando el peluche todas las noches cuando duermo. Hoy tengo 14 y en 2 meses son mis 15, medio vieja ya ando, todavia me acuerdo q el peluche me lo regalo el abuelo el mismo dia de mi cumplea?os. (11/08)    - otro juguete q me hizo feliz fue mi family game, ay por Dios que felicidad me dio ese aparatito de poca resolucion, pero tenia tanto valor para mi, me encantaba jugar al mario bross, al que le tenias q disparar a los patos, al juego del pinguino que se iba por alaska y saltaba... jajaj. Hasta que se me fundio y nunca mas en la vida tuve un juguito tan lindo como ese, despues tuve el sega genesis 3 pero no era =, no supero la adoracion q le tenia al family.

I think you should use a team of this      Blaziken    fire punch  fire kick  fire blast  strength    I chose him to start because he is good for beating up other pokemon and if they aren't very effective for fire moves use a pretty strong move such as strength      Swampert      earthquake  muddy water  dive  mega punch      He is number 2 because I used him and if he has this set (he did with me) he kicks but! it has 3 different types and unless he is fighting dragon type, should usually win. He also has good stats.        Kyogre    Ice beam  thunder  hydro pump  dive    though he has many of the same types of moves they come in handy. If he is about to get creamed by grass types than try...        Groudon    earth quake  fissure  fire blast  ancient power    he is good when kyogre isn't enough. He has different types of attacks so he can beat almost every pokemon if his level is high enough.      Rayquaza    fly  dragon claw  thunder  dragon breath      i'm very sorry for drgon breath but I forgot the moves he learns. But he is very good at his type moves such as dragon claw which, even though only does about 85 in strength, Is a SUPER reliable attack so I use dragon claw to take them out.        Aggron    rock slide  dig  iron tail  iron defense    he is last because he is sheer meaning of attack and defense. I normally don't use stat moves but iron defense raises it a huge amount. He is overall strong      I hope that helps. This is the most effort I've ever put into an answer but if it helps you like it did me than I wish you the best of luck.|`|RUAe2xXmaa	Groudon Lv. 100  Earthquake, Eruption, Fissure, Solarbeam  Charizard Lv. 100  Blast burn, Fire blast, Flamethrower, Wing Attack or Aerial Ace  Blastoise Lv. 100  Hydro Cannon, Hydro Pump, Surf, Waterfall  Venusaur Lv. 100  Frenzy Plant, Sunny Day, Solarbeam, Sludge bomb  Kyogre Lv. 100  Thunder, Water Spout, Sheer Cold, Hydro Pump  Tyranitar Lv. 100  Earthquake, Rock Slide, Outrage, Dragon Dance|`|T1JehHPBaa	If you use legendaries then you suck|`|OT6Llr70aa	Okay.  Try this.    Heracross@choice band  Ev's: 252 atk, 252 spd, adamant nature  Megahorn  Brick break  Rock slide  Pursuit    Gengar@shadow tag  Ev's 252 spd, 128 sp. atk, 128 atk, lonely nature  Subsitute  Focus punch  Psychic  Shadow ball    Skarmory@whatever  Ev's: 252 hp, 252 def, 4 atk  Roar  Spikes  Drill peck  Toxic    Blissey@leftovers  Ev's: 252 def, 192 sp def, 64 sp atk, bold nature  Calm mind  Aromatherapy  ice beam  Softboiled    Swampert  Ev's: 252 hp, 252 sp def, 4 atk, relaxed nature  Curse  Earthquake  Ice Beam  Mirror coat    Scizor@liechi berry  Silver wind  Baton pass  swords dance  Agility    Most people will not battle you if you use legendaries because they are generally too strong, so i created a non-legendary team.  Remember not to teach pokemon many moves of the same type as the person above suggests, you need moves with different types so it can be effective against many pokemon.      Also, a good place to visit is www.serebii.net to find which pokemon work well in a team.
uy0RV1jdaa	Well, they do best in contests of the same poffin they like.    Pokemon:  likes spicy food = cool contest = red poffins  likes sweet food = cute contest = pink poffins  likes bitter food = smart contest = green poffins  likes dry food = beauty contest = blue poffins  likes sour food = tough contest = yellow poffins  happily eats anything = anything, any poffin.  (You can view this on your pokemon's summary)    Also, if your pokemon's stats is high enough in one category (smart, cute, etc.) you can go to the eastern-most house in Pastoria City and the man in the house gives you a scarf that raises that stat even more.    Hope this helps! Don't forget to have fun!|`|LdPnzoRMaa	with an actio replay you can get pokemon with lots of good moves and good stats|`|XRlsdt0Zaa	I haven't won any. Ultra, I can do. Feed it a lot of poffins so its condition will be good. I usually turn my volume off during the dance competition. It just helps me for some reason. I also recommend that you get moves that link together. Like going first, and then using a move that will give bonus voltage for going first. Same thing for going last. Just keep on trying and you'll win.|`|7ef55444642c0ef3e2bad112e36f40a7aa	You have to be very lucky to win it.|`|zcyWvL8iaa	win the first and third stages.

T1JehHPBaa	The official cause of this problem, according to Nintendo, was dirty contacts on the game or in the machine. Temporary repair methods that various console owners came up with included the "isopropyl alcohol and Q-Tip" solution, the "temporarily mimicking a can of compressed air" solution, and the famous "hold reset while pressing the power button" solution (which actually didn't do anything to help this particular situation; it came about as the solution to a different problem, namely the battery backed-up RAM on cartridges being blown away on power down). But, try as one might to stave off eventual disaster, the problem would almost always get worse and worse until it would happen just about all the time, with any cartridge.|`|c935afe295a01befa388c309963b4253aa	Wow!!!

AA11823330	(1) Get a pokemon with a Flame Body ability (for example Slugma, which can be found in Stark Mountain) and keep it in your party along with your egg.  (2) Take on your bicycle and you have easy places to have a huge amount of walks   [1] Solaceon Town: from Route 210 to Route 209. You will find the way is straight from the Shop that sells the Moomoo Milk down to route 209.  [2] Cycling Road: Just enter the cycling road from the top entrance and find the way that you will drop you down straight to the exit ^__^|`|AA11991193	get a slugma or maccargo since their ability Magma Armor cuts the hatching steps in half.|`|sRhhL2MYaa	walk around alot.  or use the bike and go fast for at least 10 minutes and the egg will hatch.|`|ogX9tKj8aa	Have a Pokemon with the ability Flame Body or Magma Armor in your party, and eggs will hatch in half the number of steps. Because egg hatch time is measured in steps, the bike speeds the hatching also.|`|771sYmZoaa	use mamga armor or the other one and go to solecean town and left to the pokecenter where the light brown color starts go all the way down and up it is long and no ppl or objects to stop u. it takes less time then anywhere else|`|DfgODdW4aa	Get a pokemon with the ability flame body or magma armor and fly to solaceon town.  If u go north of the town and go up the bike ramp til u hit the trees and then all the way back down through solaceon town and down on to the route until u are stopped by more trees it is over 200 steps and really fast to do on a bike. works great.
D8BDhIGwaa	Ok, the SSID is the custom name given to your wireless conection.  The default value depends on the make of wireless router you have (i.e. "Linksys", "2wire" or "Netgear" etc.).    You can change this but all the wireless clients (PCs, consoles etc.) must also use the same SSID name if they want to connect to it.    On your PC, go to your command prompt (in Windows) and type IPCONFIG to find your Gateway IP address.  Or find out what it is from your wireless router's manual if you haven't changed it from the default.    Enter this numeric address in your internet browser to get to your Wireless Router's admin page (it'll be something like 192.168.1.1 but maybe not exactly the same).  You'll need to know the Administrator's username and password (if there is one - check your manual for the defaults).  It's best to be connected via a ethernet cable (wired access) to change WEP values because you'll be changing the wireless access (so it's best not to be using it to change it)!    When you get to WEP security for wireless, you can enter either an ASCII (a-z) or Hexadecimal (0-9-a-f) value of either 64bit or 128bit length (fill up to the maximum number of characters).  Many admin pages also generate a WEP key for you when you supply a phrase (makes it easier for you to remember).    Enter the 64bit or 128bit WEP key on each of your wireless clients.  This is the encryption key that will be used on data that will be transmitted and received from your client to the wireless router.  Just make sure you copy the same WEP key value (and not the phrase if you used one)!|`|3rgJpqjZaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equiv...    http://www.askdavetaylor.com/what_is_a_w...|`|joqqcGbRaa	yeah what is a WEP key i need to know that as well lol|`|T1JehHPBaa	Your default WEP key is a 10-digit number below a barcode under your 2Wire mode. The other number there is not 10 digits, so it's easy to tell which one it is.    If you changed the default key to something else then try going to http://192.168.1.254 . This is your gateway's admin page where you can retrieve the WEP key.    And please, don't reset your modem. That would be unnecessary extra work.    If you detect more than one wireless network like the ones on your pictures, that means one of your neighbors also have a 2Wire. The default SSID is 2WIRExxx where xxx are the last 3 digits of your gateway's serial number (also under the gatway itself).    To find your WEP key go to a computer WIRED to the gateway, go to the 'command prompt' under 'Accessories' and type IPCONFIG. This command will give you the 'default gateway' address, which should be something like 192.168.1.254 (see link above).    Now, type that IP on your browser and browse to the wireless settings page. You may need a password to access these pages. If you don't have it you will need to call your ISP or reset the gateway and use the default WEP key on the sticker under the gateway.

It is a place for Pokemon fans to hang out. Trainers who own Pokemon Diamond or Pearl will be excited to know that the forum has a section for Trading, Battling, and Chatting via WiFi on the DS. The site is a safe way to exchange friend codes and make new friends on Pokemon Diamond/Pearl.    If you are a Pokemon fan, or just looking for a place to hang out, Trainer Community is the place for you! The friendly members of the forums will help you with any questions you might have.    http://www.trainercommunity.net/    I look forward to seeing you there!|`|i2DIwQwraa	well im sory i dont have one and if someone dose it will be a hacked arceus
itnNYSvVaa	you need to have pokemon fire red in the GBA slot of your DS while playing pokemon diamond/pearl. go to Valley Windworks and search around in the grass. This is how you find elekid. Only some elekids hold electirizers. to know which ones hold them, go catch a bannette (or you can trade me; i have one; FC: Zsquad    0902 9456 9996). keep the bannette first in your party and when you find an elekid holding the electirizer it will tell you "Bannette Frisked the foe and found one Electirizer"... or something like that. hope this helped!    PS if you dont have fire red i can trade you a elekid, electabuzz, or electivire. i can get  you one. my FC is above.  if you want to trade, email me at: goteamfonzi@yahoo.com  please leave your FC on the email if you send me one.|`|d506Sgxsaa	It is only found on wild elekid. You must insert a firered gba game then go to valley windworks. there is a low chance of finding an electirizer on the elekid.|`|sY7g3ttPaa	Wild Elekid hold it occasionaly, but they are very rare (10%)    you can find them in route 204 or at the vally windworks with firered in the gameboy pack.

OT6Llr70aa	Actually, going to the forums at smogon will help a lot with choosing a team if you want.      An effective team needs offensive pokemon to kill others, and walls to stall, hinder opponents and heal the team.    Gengar is a very good pokemon when you focus on his special attack with moves like shadow ball, focus blast, thunderbolt, and ice beam.  With a moveset like this give him choice specs.      Dewgong actually has a good ability, abuse it by teaching it rain dance, surf, ice beam, and rest.  The reason everyone dislikes dewgong is because of his stats, movepool, and types are worse than a pokemon like swampert.     Luxray can be a good pokemon with a good moveset, i don't like luxray personally and i don't use it so i don't know the best way to use it.      Lucario is a great pokemon, the best endure/reversal user.  Use a moveset like this:    Lucario@Salac berry  Endure   Reversal  Close combat  Earthquake     Ambipom is pretty much useless in my opinion unless you have a baton pass set like this:    Ambipom@focus sash  Baton pass  Swords dance  Agility  Return    Infernape is also a great pokemon in physical or special sweeper form.      Physical infernape@choice band  Close combat  Flare blitz  Earthquake  Thunderpunch/stone edge    Special infernape@focus sash  Grass knot  flamethrower  nasty plot  focus blast    In addition i've listed several very powerful pokemon that can be useful on just about every team.     Salamence@choice specs  hydro pump  flamethrower  dragon pulse  draco meteor    Skarmory@leftovers  drill peck  whirlwind  spikes  roost    Weavile@focus sash  ice punch  night slash  swords dance  brick break    Milotic@leftovers  surf  ice beam  recover  hypnosis    Rhyperior@chesto berry  stone edge  earthquake  megahorn  rest    Blissey@leftovers  Calm mind  Aromatherapy  Ice beam  Softboiled    My opinion in pokemon is that your team should be prepared for everything.  Always carry two aces up your sleeve in case you opponent has one.|`|8SOFzMD9aa	who had all that time to write that last answer

eb6038b63b522b4782eede8c364b6089aa	No! OK, I actually am a Pokemon Master, unlike the other person who answered, and while species differences mean nothing since a Ditto will breed with all species that can breed, you CANNOT breed legendary Pokemon, so Mew is the problem as it cannot breed with anything. Generally legendaries cannot breed, Manaphy is an exception, and neither can Baby Pokemon. So Mew, Mewtwo, the legendary Birds, the legendary Dogs, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Celebi, Jirachi, the Regi(all 4), Latios/Latias (in spite of the fact they are male and female), Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquazza, Deoxys, Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Dialga, Palkia, Heatran, Giratina, Cresselia, Darkrai, Shaymin, Arceus, and Unowns cannot breed.|`|wsCEOGmHaa	"I am a great pokemaster so I would say no because they are not the same species  Source(s):    Pokebrains "    This person is right and wrong. No, you can't get an egg because Mew won't breed. However, you CAN breed pokemon even if they aren't the same species, like a Sneasel with a Buneary. That doesn't mean that EVERY pokemon can breed with EVER Pokemon, either (A Diglett can't breed with a Pidgey).|`|U5KZ5MFaaa	I  am  a  great  pokemaster  so  I  would  say  no because  they  are  not  the  same  species|`|VgfUAleGaa	No. The only legendary capable of breeding is manaphy, resulting in a phione egg, which will not evolve into manaphy, or at all for that matter. Anyway, you will not get a mew egg.|`|37BF52svaa	First of all, Bipra K is wrong. Ditto can breed with any none legendary.

d1a4aa035ceea1345ae9e7197d7e41cdaa	Ok dude, look, it all depends on what kind of games you like.  no thug games, that cuts alot of game possibilities man.  youll mostly find those games are for ps3 and xbox360. but overall,   "X-BOX360" has the best online feature, and its games are fun and they look good, on the other hand their overall system lacks a variety in games and has mostly racing/action/gun-games.  "PS3" most definetily has the best graphics and it has a preety good online system, but it lacks the simplist of things like a rumble faeture and portability, alot of their games are fantasy/racing/gun/action/thug games.  "Wii",(my personal favorite), has an overall new and improved system with the wiimote and nunchuck,                (motion sensored.....sweet....), it also has downloadable acsses to games that came out for all other nintendo systems, but dont expect any relly intense action or fighting games, wii has all varietys!!!  All in All,  Wii = Fun and Innovative  Xbox360 = Hardcore and Advanced  PlayStation3 = Best Graphics, nuff said|`|AA11594419	Buy Xbox 360  I'm not telling you because i have Xbox 360 but I'm telling you because of some games, even I was thinking of buying PS3 but than I found some good games that will not come out for PS3 like Alan Wake. But still its your choice. Both systems are on the same level. Dont worry about three light of death.|`|yquJqpBdaa	i would have a wii, maybe that's because i'm a nintendo fan, but i want one (not that i have one *sob*) but i've heard the ps3 and the xbox 360 are also good.  however i still think that the wii is best, as it is the most interactive one, and most fun =]|`|8a28ed60ad8bc258641c9d32bcd68e9baa	Xbox 360. The game library is amazing. Check the list out of up comming games.|`|AA11157156	Look, there isn't a best gaming console. It depends which ones you LIKE to use. I only play games that are specifically made for that game console or play that game on whichever console I like to play it on when it's a platformer, meaning it's a game that is made for every game system like Spider-man 3. As for me, I'd get all three of them because there are games in Wii that I like to play because Xbox 360 and PS3 doesn't have that game. There's no best gaming console, it's which console you like. I like all thee of them and plan to get all three of them.|`|I3bPh90Baa	Wii- More interactive  PS3- No Good games right now  Xbox Halo is it's best game but shooting games and fantasy ( mainly violence games) are the best for it. Basically what u like best|`|L6Oqs4Vgaa	ps3-dont buy it. way too much money and now many games right now for it.  xbox 360-same for ps3. its better than ps3 and like 200 bucks cheaper, but its going to be getting the gta series soon.  wii-buy it. cheapest and doesnt have those thug games. its got pretty good graphics and everything is cheaper.

I taught my torterra seed bomb instead of wood hammer because i hated the recoil damage.  Seed bomb 80 power, 100 accuracy. You can teach it seed bomb by breeding it with an exeggutor/bulbasaur. Seed bomb does good damage and has no recoil.  Trust me go with seed bomb.      oh yeah consider adding stone edge/rock slide, that will cover your ice,flying,fire, and bug weaknesses (all of your weakness) all with one move.    torterra should breed with exegg, i bred my torterra with a bulbasaur(learns seed bomb at 37)|`|485Oy3cjaa	id say either razor leaf or frenzy plant|`|dqvvTlYtaa	teach it frenzy plant at the move tutor

However, there are various attempts. One attempt is to beat Bandit Keith and getting 3 slot machines in a row at the graveyard slots.     After you one blue eyed white dragon...you can attempt to obtain the blue eyes ULTIMATE dragon which requires 3 blue eyed white dragons at level 2.     The easy way to duplicate your creatures and get 3 is to get one (as I mentioned above) and then replicate it if you have two unique save files. They have to be named differently and the monster you want to save has to be in YOUR stock. Once you do that, you can go to battle mode and pin one players vs. 2nd player, allow a defeat, and take over the creature (ie: dragon) that lost in battle. Now you have two. Repeat the process for a third. If you check the source link, Gamefaq's describes the process in a more simplistic straightforward way with more help.

d6b1255ecb8bddd1bfac3e30116c34ecaa	Any game out there?  Wow that's a list and then some but if I were you I'd go to gamefaqs or gamespot and check out some of the reviews that people have put up over the selected genre that your feeling for the moment.    As I'm a increbidly avid gamer that has almost every console ever made I would advise the lastest of the godfather games for the Wii or the PS2.  It's a gta feel but at least you have different ways of making people do it your way.  Plus they try so hard to keep it to the basic story of the movie so if you liked the movie I would for sure pick up this game.    Secondly I would state for rpg the largest of the large would be the latest of the elder scroll series oblivian.  You could play this game for weeks and still probably wouldn't be done with the game.    If you want something fun and brain numbing may I advise some Guitar hero.  If you got a ps2 I would get it because the 80's guitar hero just came out.  Tons of fun for anyone.      Oh if your a fan of the gta series there is also Bully.  It was also made by rockstar.  Very intersting story line there.      As for hand helds for the D.S. I'd get lunar knights. Great little rpg and I'm a hard core fan of the lunar series ever  since it came out for the pc many years ago.    If you are a gta fan you can also pick up liberty stories.  It's gta 3 with a twist.    Like I said just go to the sources I'm posting and just check out the reviews before you pick it up.  Gamespot is a great start for yourself for someone that likes that many different genres.  Good hunting to ya.|`|AA12056854	Ratchet and Clank - it's a series of 3, with one PSP game.   Jak and Daxter - also a series of 3, with one PSP game.  They're much the same, with different plots. Jak 2 and 3 lean more towards racing. Overall, they run around and shoot stuff. Much like Zelda, but a different setting/plot/characters.    Lost Magic for DS. Tons of fun, and more of an RPG game than anything... It's intresting, and a lot of fun with they stylus.   Pheonix Wright for DS (Either the original or Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney). Really addictive, a mystery game where you have to solve the puzzle in court. Great fun, but probably not what you're quiet intrested in - after all, it is more of a puzzle game than any of the three you prefer.    Other than that, I suggest simply looking through the racks in game stores and in the game sections of places like Walmart. If it catches your eye you'll probably like it.    Happy gaming.|`|T1JehHPBaa	Crackdown for the Xbox 360    it was my first game for the 360.|`|cf68aaae79b891d07ba948087587edbaaa	You buy tony hawk the latest version!!

Also if you have Windows Media Center, you can stream the music and videos to your 360 easily.  Installation is easy if both are connected to the internet.  I dont know what file the 360 plays.  I could be wrong on the above info, but the easiest way is to try it yourself if you already own a xbox 360.|`|AXWqgPRkaa	there is a usb to plug the psp into but its a sony product it wont work (trust me my friend and i tried) just put take your songs from your hardware and stick it on the computer.

He is in a house near the top left of the city.    To unlock Sootopolis gym doors, you just have to step on all of the squares of ice without restepping on any one of them. You also have to end at the opening of the stairs. If there were a picture of them, I could draw the path for you. :[ It's fairly easy once you understand the concept, so good luck.    Oops, sorry. I thought you meant once you get inside the gym. To unlock the outside doors of the gym, go to Team Aqua's underwater cavern located near Ever Grande and Sootopolis.

LtfGrOp5aa	Yes you can you need a wireless adaptor or link cable. In leafgreen after you beat the Elite 4, you have to have 60 pokemon caught, once you do, go talk to prof. Oak he will upgrage your pokedex. Then, go to Island 1. Go to the pokecenter and talk to that guy near the big machine, he will ask you if you could help him find the ruby, Then go to the mountain just after island 1. there you will find the ruby. After you take the ruby to him he will ask you to find the saphire. Go to island 4 and help lorely fight team rocket members. Then go to island six. To the south there will be a door with braille on it talk to the scientist, leave and come back here. After he is gone, use cut. When you find the saphire, he will steal it. Use the 2 passwords that team rocket members gave you and go to island 5 there is the rocket warehouse after you beat the scientist, give the saphire to the guy in the island 1 pokecenter and he will upgrade the machine, then you will be able to trade to emerald from leafgreen|`|yGtgEzIhaa	get your national pokedex on emerald|`|KPqdTqdxaa	You can by using a Link Cable.
Rys4Zc7Uaa	The metal one is more durable being able to hold more weight with out breaking.    As the normal dance mat can only hold I believe 200-300lbs as the metal ones can hold up to 600.     The metal one being better if you have friends that like to mess around.    The metal ones can cost up to 300 dollars. But there are cheaper versions.|`|bf21744950a0e70ac2f2fa2a6a3f0708aa	Basically a metal pad is better, but if your new to the game I reccomend using a soft pad. Soft pads are cheap (money wise) and are a good start for learning the game. A metal pad is for serious players that want good scores on hard fast paced songs.     The difference is that a metal pad is more pricey, more responsive to fast arrows, better control, and more heavier (so it won't move around as much.) Yeah, a metal pad is better than a soft pad. (that's why they cost so much ;))|`|vBE4jJ3Gaa	metal one is BETTER ^_^ in every way

If youve never played such a gaming title in the past, you could be forgiven for     feeling more than a little overawed. Youre suddenly surrounded by thousands of gamers, all of which seem to know exactly what to do, and precisely whats going to need to be     done to beat the game. So taking into account the cost of the initial purchase, plus the required monthly subscription, most seem happy to continue getting their multiplayer     action on their home consoles.     But here comes Guild Wars from NCsoft. Now Guild Wars is quite a different beast from the likes of World of Warcraft or Everquest. While these games rely on monthly     subscriptions to cover all kinds of costs, with Guild Wars you never pay anything more than the initial purchase in your local gaming emporium. Again, where the other big     hitters in the genre require incredible numbers of hours put in, in order to get to any kind of decent in game level, Guild Wars requires you to display your intelligence and     skill. With the in game level cap set at 20, which is reachable in quite speedy time, your own skill is required if your going to beat the game.  hope the site can help u    http://www.guild-wars-online.com|`|Z3kEVNpNaa	guild wars is really a huge game, you must pay much time on it, and at the sametime you should pay for it.if you want to find some of these website ,there are some. hope it is useful.     http://guildwars.igsky.com/    http://www.igsky.com    http://www.igsky.com/blog/    http://forum.igsky.com/    http://igsky.eu

Maybe this is your  auction and you're trying to generate interest?|`|CHopIAbOaa	i think you should all my friends have it and say it is too much fun!|`|K9SBfkmvaa	no, you have to pay 20 dollars extra, and if you bought it in store it would be around 280 the tax is included , but its your choice|`|18ubrNuaaa	ye you should because i would its one of the cheapest game systems at the moment so take a bid while you have the chance!|`|AjaELqJQaa	I would say 'no.' I paid $249 plus tax for mine in the store brand new. It was hard to find and took some perseverance to get it, but still cheaper. Second, shipping on that console is $20. That auction is going to cost you $300+ when all is said and done.    However, If you really want a Wii that bad, Ebay may be the easiest route to getting one.

To use daemon tools after install right click on the red thunderbolt in your system tray go to emulation and click All options on then go to virtual cd/dvd rom then to device 0 then click mount image and click on the .cue/.iso/.mds  Then you probably have to install a crack that came with it.

z39F3fI9aa	It will look as nice as your TV will let it be.  The PS3 is capable of dishing out 1080p.  Unless you have a state of the art TV, the graphics will be limited based on what you're watching it on.    I highly recommend HDTV for either PS3 or 360, but if you're not lucky enough to have one, it will still look nice, just not amazing.|`|43nIYWmcaa	Sure it looks fine.

AA10841525	Out of the ones released for PS2, I'd recommend the 2nd one.     The 4th one wasnt very good IMO, and the 3rd one makes more sense only if youve played the original for PS1.  The 2nd is a nice stand-alone title, and the first time I played it there were parts in there that creeped me out way more than I thought it would.    Actually, if you havent played any of them, i'd recommend trying to find the original PS1 Silent Hill (unless youre fixated on graphics - those dont compare well to recent titles at all if thats the sort of thing that matters to you).|`|56365ccf12a9d3741995e9c3c1032fdbaa	I'd go for Silent Hill 3. XD  I love that game.  Well, people send negative stuff about Silent Hill 4, but it's a pretty good game.  Not too scary but at least the storyline makes sense.  That and Silent Hill 2.    For Silent Hill 3, you need to know about the original Silent Hill game to see what's going on.      Silent Hill 1, 2 and 4 all have male main characters and Silent Hill 3 has a female as the main character so it's pretty interesting.      They're all great games, but I recommend Silent Hill 3.|`|43nIYWmcaa	Either 2 or 3. 2 is my favorite but 3 is pretty great too. Stay away from 4, it sucked. If you want a game that'll really scare you, get any of the fatal frames too. Scariest games ever.

(lol). well there are a few legends you can catch, such as cresselia, giriantina, regigigas, and heatran. or you can raise a wifi team to battle people all over the place.    cresselia: go to the town where you can go to iron island and such (bottomish left of map), and go to the house of the sailor. his son will be in bed and if you talk to the sailor he will take you to crescent island where you meet cresselia. she will fly off and you catch her like how you catch mesprit.    giriantina: you go to below veilstone, there will be a new opening and near the back over this lake there will be a cave called turnback cave. it is completely random to get through, but when you reach girantina it is really dificult to catch!    regigigas: at snowpoint there is a temple that you can go into, regigigas will awaken if you have all three other regis.    there are plenty of things you can do after the battle area and such|`|mFlVmQKZaa	just muck around, evolve all ur pokemon, breed those eevees, catch tons of pokemon, battle at the fancy restauraunt with fancy people who think themselves too fancy too battle alone. and just run around and get lotsa ribbons.
t6yLkxv2aa	get an action replay and the have all pokemon in pokedex|`|i2DIwQwraa	naaa
XqOPDb83aa	Beat your rival and receive the Cut HM from the captain then you can leave.
2x2dy2ygaa	enter from Hearthorne City. just go to Hearthorne City and go down then all the way left. follow the path and keep going have until you can't go high no more.and bring you strongest pokemon because your going to have to fight a Lot of people. hope it helps.|`|OZ0DgzrJaa	Enter from Heathorne (which it sounds like you did.) and through a combination of surf and rock climb, you can make it to the snowy peak.  Look for places to rock climb to proceed.  You'll end up back inside the mountain, then outside again where you have to rock-climb again and find another entrance.  From there it is a straight run to the top.  When you get to the room with a small set of stairs to the left and right, and a large set of stairs going north SAVE!!!    Make sure you bring your most powerful Pokemon, because you'll face one double battle, and then one major boss battle.  You'll want many powerful healing agents, and some revives.  If you want to save your Master Ball for someone else you will also want a LOT of Ultra Balls.  Save after beating the two galactic battles, because you only have ONE shoot at this.    I captured the Pearl equivalent with a team with to HIGH 40s and a bunch of 30~40s as cannon fodder.  It took me three ultra balls to catch him after he was weakened, but I went through three KOs and two too weak to fight before doing it.|`|hCQGhBoSaa	yes it got me too and you have to look realy closely somwhere there you can use rock climb and then to the side not striaght up
iNGOFZ3laa	well in oreburogh city go to the old man's house he gives u a explorer kit go underground with it and on the map above if u see all these stars go to them and click on touch screen u see these thing in wall if theres loads of stars theres bound to be 1. u have to mine with a hmmer or pickaxe (use hammer) dont hammer too much or the wall collapses and if your lucky, you may see a roundish 1 with little dots and spikes with a jagged edge which is the skull fossil (for cranidos) and a long curved 1 (for lileep) and a yellow/orange oval shaped amber fossil (for aerodactyl). good luck!!!!|`|IsPWJplGaa	You go Underground and dig for them. You need to use your Explorer Kit that you get from Eterna City, and then dig. They aren't very common so good luck.|`|dvqzPoNdaa	you go undergrund  but you need an explorer kit from eterna than go to your bag use that and under ground on the map theres yellow starz or something go to them and tap the screen with your stylus and press a next to da wall|`|vYhAmCguaa	you go under ground and till you find one|`|BHzLKI8paa	U have to have the explorer kit in you key items. Then you go underground using the kit.     Run around and tap the touch screen until you see a flash. Then go over to it and press A. Then use the hammer and chizzl to uncover spheres, fossils, and stones.     Fossils are rare so u probably will need to repeat digging many times.
M2fKo2xXaa	what i do is practice in practice mode on each speed,once you can play it on one speed, amp it up and keep on playing|`|vv2jTDnEaa	Practice ur hammer-on and pull-off's they are vital to playing on Hard and Expert modes.|`|xhnlkqWIaa	hammer-ons and pull-offs.

No, i don't, because it makes me come across as an idiot. Now i'm not ruling out the possibility of me being an idiot, and you not being one, but just to clarify, what do you mean by 'it'?|`|hCQGhBoSaa	what cost i can help|`|bbro66BOaa	How much does what cost..?|`|oCWjOP37aa	$1,000,000|`|hKMTFdBKaa	999$ in canada

(sniff...I am so helpful...)|`|lG81tZhkaa	There is no legit way to get one yet, simply because Nintendo has not released the Azure Flute at a Nintendo Event, which is used to summon a staircase at the top of Mt Coronet. People have hacked themselves an Azure Flute and climbed the staircase and caught Arceus. The videos can be found on YouTube

S0jKow5Taa	Heavenly Sword has gotten many great reviews, so I would definitely suggest that.  Very soon Call of Duty 4 is coming out, whether you like to play by yourself or online against others this will be a great game for both.  Also coming out in about a month is Assassins Creed it has awesome reviews and the game looks insane...check it out. http://youtube.com/watch?v=mFuaO6qjzUw|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Heavenly Sword.  Great looking game, but it is a little too short.  It got great reviews, but the game probably would have gotten better reviews if it was just a little bit longer.|`|FB343u63aa	Play Resistance:Fall of Man. It is the highest selling game for the ps3. It is a FPS. It has got rave reviews.|`|51MJ8jG1aa	I have a few games and i would reccomend either call of duty 3 as it is great to play online or motorstorm for the amazing graphics.  I think Grand theft auto 4 is coming out soon, you should wate for that|`|OKqPrmcUaa	Rainbow 6 Vegas is really good.|`|oUv4NJzkaa	Heavenly Sowrd is a game containing amazing graphics and is also fun to play. Yes, the game could be a little longer but it containsa good story, amazing graphics, and can be played in Hell Mode once you complete the game in regular mode. It is worth the money.
V5u8Or4Saa	Got this from a walkthrough, hope it helps. I havent played it on chuunin yet, only genin. Good luck  Mission 17:  Player: Naruto  Opponent: Orochimaru  Mission (Genin): Defeat Orochimaru with Rasengan.  Mission (Chunin): Defeat Orochimaru with a 2-hit combo ending with Rasengan.  Mission (Jonin): Defeat Orochimaru with a 4 or more hit combo ending with  Rasengan.  On Genin, this mission is a snap.   *On chunin, just use Weak, Weak, Special.   *On Jonin, use Forward-Weak, Weak, then two more weak attacks before  Orochimaru lands, then Rasengan.
XyL3o6m3aa	Hmmm..  Well try going to the map and then moving the Reindeer into another room.  I also have a Reindeer and have no problems with it.

CdP95AVFaa	Clean it.  Use alcohol, a game doctor, or see if your local game retailer will clean it for you.  See also that the problem isn't your playstation.|`|sY7g3ttPaa	TAKE IT OUT OF THE FREEZER!    ...or use firaga, or fira+ a mushu card, or enter wisdom form    and WHATEVER U DO, DONT USE BLIZAGGA!|`|2Z692vlyaa	buy a new one it is clearly scratched up and u need a new one or if it isnt scratched up then buy a disk skipper cleaner it cleans your disk so it stops skipping or freezing.|`|AA11859505	use the cleaners made for cds and dvds. you can find it at walmart that comes with a thing you put it in, and the cleaner pad . looks like a cd player. that always works for me. hope that made sense. i think the brand that i have has a pelican on it.  alcohol (rubbing) is actually bad for the disk, it starts to wear down on it, if you use it alot.
nfVcUff8aa	Get a CD ROM cleaner disk.   Most of the time when a drive stops identifying a disk, that's the trouble.  You can pick one up at WalMart or BestBuy for under $10.  Wouldn't hurt to pick up a can of air as well to blow out the drive first.  A can of air is about $5.

Hvd82Owiaa	Powerleveling (paying somebody to level your character) is against Blizzards TOS. They have gotten very good at catching this and will ban your account. Not only would this cause you not to be able to access any character on the account, but it would also waste the money you had spent.    If for some reason Blizzard doesnt catch you, the powerleveling company could outright steal your account or hack it at a later time. The sites that facilitate this sort of thing are often loaded with keyloggers so even just visiting them could have negative results. No powerleveling company is safe.    If you value your account, I would refrain from this activity. You might also read this statement from Blizzard:    http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basi...|`|LzVBT80Qaa	there are sites where you can pay to have your character leveled up or pay to get gold but its a big risk and blizzard cracks down on it, just level up like normal nerds do.|`|FVu24hZxaa	No. Scams. Don't buy gold or "cheats". Just mine and skin like everyone else.|`|6dC9T40Baa	Well not too sure about the powerleveling but there are definitely websites online that you can purchase gold from for about 45 bucks per 1k gp.|`|AA10809391	Don't do that mine and skin or if you use alchemy sell potions.|`|pJfgNwWnaa	All scams. They take your account info then hack you a month after you pay them for the gold.    Just play the damn game.

They might not give you a free one(unless of course you have a warranty you could take it back for a new one) but they will give you one at a discount price for about $80.
VqJrKA8caa	Nope. Not worth your time. Runescape is all about spending endless hours leveling up. Even if you have millions, you'll still (for example) spend 120-140 hours or so to get from level 59 to 99. Better websites are....    http://tip.it/runescape/  and  http://runescape.salmoneus.net/      There is also runevillage and runehq - but runevillage isn't updated as often or as well as tip it... and runehq takes too long to load, and has ads for "cheating" on rs. Which doesn't work at all.... any sort of "cheat" that requires you to give someone your password and username is a scam... they're just trying to get control of your account. I'll admit there have been some glitches, but everyone that finds and uses the big glitches like to clone items gets caught - and often banned. Hope this helps.|`|lYxSZK6baa	Here is a pretty good money making guide broken down by free players and member skills.  http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Money_Ma...|`|7AV6UkQCaa	no.. the guide is years old, and the methods on it can no longer be used because of recent updates (merchanting)  also, if you want, you can download the exact same guides from limewire, although.. .they won't help a single bit|`|sY7g3ttPaa	I guess...that is if you can't afford the billions guide...                                        ...noob|`|BmACCPVzaa	the guide is pretty old...so there for theres no use.

nTD6NyKJaa	They're all balanced -.- One isn't better than the other. They all have strong points and weak points, it's just opinion. If they weren't balanced, the game would be completely one sided and no one would play.|`|Ox2yM7Noaa	In burning crusade, the Draenai and the Blood Elves both have what look like awesome racials, for PvE and PvP respectively. A Draenai Palladin would really rock, as their aura's would stack, and a Blood Elf rouge would rock for PvP because they would be able to sneek up behind a caster, start messing them up, counter their spells and then finish them.    Currently, it depends what you want to do with your class/race. I really like Gnome/Rouge for the simple fact that the escape racial just feels right in PvP. Humans have a good advantage too with sword spec, but that assumes you want to make a sword rogue. Orc Hunters are very good for fairly obvious reasons, and Night Elves benefit on the whole by having an extra 1 percent dodge. Tauren Warriors are pretty spiffy too.    EDIT: A lot of this is largely irellevant to me, because I play a NE druid. NE is the default choice because an elf that turns into a cat seems far less absurd then a cow that turns into a lion.|`|AA10809391	Blood elf. hunter|`|CYcV3TSkaa	there is no class or race thats best all of them are equal you just have to learn how to play the class and stick to it!|`|aJ37Igcuaa	Ok well first it depends what faction you want to play as Horde or Allience, Allience i think that a hunter is the bomb they are the eaziest to level i have a level 26 Dwarf hunter and i love him doesent matter what race Night elv or Dwarf there both Great. If your looking for power and wicked armour then the Warrior is Awsome!. For the Horde also A hunter si the way to go but the best race for hunter is the orc because the orc has ranged attack power ups that come along with his race also Horde Shamens are also a very good class but for both Factions my answers would have to be any race and the class hunter|`|gAjLGlJXaa	First hordes  the best any way the best chars are Orc and troll hunter. if an orc go beats mastery cuz they get increased pet racial and fastest to level. also they can make them grow twice there size and alot of other crazy stuff. if a troll ....marksmen heres why one ranged and two they get a racial called berserker which raises attack and is just wow so yeah best GO HORDE|`|mJ9FQEFmaa	i like horde  i like spell casting/healing  the only one i know that can do that besides pally...druids  since i like horde, i went drood and resto and turen      see spot, see spot run, sit spot, good boy|`|tM60dtgLaa	Shaman's are very over powered.    I love my 60 Shammy but sometimes I don't think it's enough challenge for me.
xFmHltRWaa	You violated the Blizzard ToS(Terms of Service) by using an outside service.  You signed a contract with Blizzard when you clicked "I accept"  They have no responsibility to provide service to you now that you voided that contract.      With that said your best course of action would be to contact blizzard technical support, however you will most likely not get anywhere.  The best case scenario I see is that you get your account un-banned but all your characters will be deleted.|`|cJNUdJWEaa	Well you should be more careful on World Of Warcraft.|`|NK8ZmfgTaa	Call the Blizzard technical support @ 1-949-955-1382. They can probably help you. Although I would say you wasted your life no matter what the case. I played that game for about 2 years and since I stopped I have had such a better life.|`|lYQ60IhCaa	only way is to contact blizzard but getting banned permanently is kind of rare unless you did something incredibly racist or offensive.  Was it your trash talking?|`|Hvd82Owiaa	You can protest your ban, but if you powerleveled I would doubt they will overturn it. To protest the ban you can contact Account Administration, they are the only way you could possibly get your rogue back. I would say since you admit that you powerleveled the chance is very very slim. Here's the info should you decide to try:    You may use the webform:     http://us.blizzard.com/support/webform-u...     Or contact them via email:     Wowaccountadmin@blizzard.com     Note: It is extremely important that you contact Account Administration exclusively from the email address that is registered to your account. They are unable to accept contact from any other source.|`|AA11295478	As the guy above me said the only thing they MIGHT give you back is your account WITHOUT the rogue and that is if you are lucky.     So fight for your account and NOT your Rogue and as a first time offender you MIGHT get lucky.|`|AA10809391	Try to call blizzard and ask why you got banned|`|Cz4T0Fn0aa	What did you do to get perma-banned? That's not exactly easy to do......|`|hdt3jSCoaa	It seems like you've done something really bad.    Contact the company in any way to plead for your case.
Q3Zo8iJEaa	The answer is probably no, but you need to rephrase the question.  What accessory are you talking about?
