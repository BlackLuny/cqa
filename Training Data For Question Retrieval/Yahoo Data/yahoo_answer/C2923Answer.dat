That means that in North Carolina, say, the forests can grow to 6000 feet or more, but in New Hampshire the temperate tree line is more like 4000 feet. <br>  <br>  Temperate forests need water, but the amount of water varies a lot depending on the temperature.

But when we do settle on one or a few technologies to replace the conventional gas engine. I think there will be a transitional period where new cars will have the new technology but we will still have the infrastructure for gas engines, it could take decades to phase out the older cars.<br>  <br>  Here in CA we have tougher emissions laws, so if you have an older car you could get an exemption for not passing emissions, it was a program that let just the oldest cars be exempt, then every few years they let a few more years be exempt. Now all the cars that were sold after the date the laws went into effect have to pass smog, if you didn't buy the car in CA then you will need to get a catalytic converter put on it to pass. Millions of cars are junked each year, when you turn in an old clunker when you buy a new car they are often sold for scrap and they are taken off the road.

This would make 2009 warmer than the year just gone and the warmest since 2005.<br>  <br>  During La Ni?a, cold waters rise to the surface to cool the ocean and land surface temperatures. The 2009 forecast includes an updated decadal forecast using a Met Office climate model. This indicates a rapid return of global temperature to the long-term warming trend, with an increasing probability of record temperatures after 2009.<br>  <br>  Professor Chris Folland from the Met Office Hadley Centre said: "Phenomena such as El Ni?o and La Ni?a have a significant influence on global surface temperature. Warmer conditions in 2009 are expected because the strong cooling influence of the recent powerful La Ni?a has given way to a weaker La Ni?a. Further warming to record levels is likely once a moderate El Ni?o develops."<br>  <br>  These cyclical influences can mask underlying warming trends as Professor Phil Jones, Director of the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, explains: "The fact that 2009, like 2008, will not break records does not mean that global warming has gone away. What matters is the underlying rate of warming - the period 2001-2007, with an average of 14.44 °C, was 0.21 °C warmer than corresponding values for the period 1991-2000."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20081230.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pr...</a><br>  <br>  The graph you linked to in your question has many dips in global temperature of equal or greater magnitude than the one at the end of the graph, and yet it's very clear that there is a substantial long-term warming trend which continues regardless of these dips.

The # 8's did create a bad attitude.|`|sSvPEf97aa	Sounds like Obama's economic stimulus program.|`|aeVz0lrBaa	Panurge. do YOU think that by using BLOCK capitals YOUR point WILL be MORE poignant ?  perhaps rather than being offensive to others, you could offer up some serious suggestions and move the debate forward.<br>  <br>  regarding the question posed.    <br>  <br>  No, I don't think that 'climate change' will have that type of effect and I think that statement is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Although I do like the statement that   ''The unemployed Chefs... should be cooking my dinner every night''|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	No food = Migration <br>  <br>  Migration = Mixing of people<br>  <br>  And you know how that goes! <br>  <br>  I don't think World War, but I am sure there will be clashes and ethnic strains. Kind of like what happened in South Africa when the foreigners were blamed on the woes of the country.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1oxBCtmZaa	There are already many prolonged military conflicts. <br>  <br>  Perhaps they will now be blamed on global warming.|`|AA11932246	It's unlikely that we'll have a large scale world war due to the risk of escalation to a nuke fight (which no one who is sane wants, and there are enough sane people in the nuclear powers to back off when it comes to that point).<br>  <br>  A series of proxy wars might end up being fought in the future but it's more likely to be an ideological difference than because of global warming.<br>  <br>  Some have speculated that resource wars might occur, but it's more likely that improved technology would make the resource war pointless (i.e. why fight for water when you can just build a desalination plant or buy water from your neighbour's desalination plant?).<br>  <br>  As for what the unemployed builders should be doing, insulating all houses probably isn't what I'd have them do (instead have them build new houses, the economy will pick up again), besides, most houses already do have some insulation simply because it lowers energy bills (though subsidies to help those on low incomes pay for it might be worthwhile).<br>  <br>  EDIT: It should be noted that efficiency is not the cheapest way to cut greenhouse gases since it often results in higher emissions (due to increased energy usage made possible by the increased efficiency allowing new uses of energy).<br>  <br>  Relying on energy efficiency to save us is actually something we should not be doing, instead we should be relying on more advanced technology that can generate the power we need without emitting CO2.<br>  <br>  Efficiency is good for the economy though (and a good economy is going to be needed to solve or mitigate global warming), so we should still be doing it, we just have to acknowledge Jevons paradox and accept that efficiency isn't the solution (or even a solution) to global warming.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	The craigslist.org climate forum just posted an interesting comment and link, tying in mass emigrations to wars. Whether they will be the cause of an "extended world war" is another matter. <br>  <br>  Given the state of our knowledge, I feel safer siding with the "Chicken Littles" of the world, rather than with the "ostriches" burying their heads in the sand and claiming that we should all join them.|`|t1zlbOURaa	No, climate change won't cause anything (except for cold due to lack of sunspots.)<br>  <br>  The next world war will start within the next four years, as a result of a power vacuum in the world caused by an essentially leaderless USA. All the bad guys in the world know that B Hussein Obama won't use the military, especially for any new stuff so small innocent nations are on sale! Invade one, get one free.
0KmJwYunaa	Synthetic jet fuel, just like WWII Germany, South Africa, and the current US Airforce.   Traditionally it's been made from either coal or natural gas but it can also be made from biomass (garbage) and the DoD contracted for several units to do just that.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it'll be made directly from Sunlight, CO2 and water just like Sandia Labs does with their CR5 reactor which produces 2.5 gallons per day.<br>  <br>  It's not the fuel that's bad, just where that fuel is from.   If we get it from biomass, then the fuel is considered to be carbon negative..|`|fp9bOiVFaa	What people need to understand is that we're not going to run out of oil, we're going to run out of CHEAP oil. We've probably only used up about half the world's oil reserves, but the problem is the reserves we've used are the easier ones to get. It's getting harder and harder to get oil, so it's going to get more expensive. Planes will still have fuel to run on, it just might not be affordable to the average Joe.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Batteries will have to get a whole lot stronger and lighter to run an electric airplane for any kind of range.  Turbine engines can probably be adapted to run on biodiesel, and can definitely run on alcohol, and probably on coal-gas.  Rocket engines run on hydrogen.  During WWII, Germany was running planes on alcohol.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	Wake up.. Mother nature is continually recycling the CO2 to O2 but the plant keeps the C for food. When the plant dies the C will break down into oil& gas. We will never run out of oil. The more CO2 the plants the better it is for them.|`|AA11932246	If oil runs out so will natural gas so I doubt methane is going to be replacing Jet A (besides, we can convert anything with carbon and hydrogen into any hydrocarbon fuel we want, it just takes energy, so if we had natural gas but wanted Jet A we could make it).<br>  <br>  I highly doubt we're going to be getting batteries that would be able to power an aircraft for long (running the instruments, yes, but not providing propulsion) while also allowing that aircraft to get off the ground.<br>  <br>  Nuclear propulsion for aircraft is possible (a jet engine did run on nuclear power, but not at the thrust levels needed for flight, although it was only a test and could be scaled up) but probably won't happen (though nuclear will probably be the preferred source of energy for synthetic hydrocarbon factories).|`|AA11571284	Are you kidding???    There's enough oil  in the State of Texas to last for 500 years ....even at a projected rate!!!<br>  The Govt doesn't want you to know.|`|eIwj9a3yaa	by the time we run out of oil, we'll probably have anti gravity devices which will rend air planes obsolete|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Nuclear jet engines have been designed and tested already.   Not sure if any have flown yet.
