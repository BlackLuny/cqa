051b543e3068815cbc69f7717166c9d9aa	If possible I would wait for your W-2. Your final pay stub will not show your earnings in the correct format for income tax filing. If you had any pre-tax deductions (such as 401k or health insurance deductions), they do not show up in certain boxes of your W-2 (401k contributions are exempt from federal tax and do not show up in Box 1 - S125 premiums do not show up in boxes 1, 3, or 5.) Your pay stub will just show your *total gross earnings* for the year and your *total deduction amounts* for the year. It won't be as nice and simple as a W-2 will be. If you use the wrong figures when filing - you could be overstating your income and end up paying more tax. Make sure you either had no deductions or know how to put the pay stub information into the right format before proceeding. No one wants to pay too much tax! :)|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	You need to wait until you get your W-2 but    https://www.taxactonline.com/s_online_ta...|`|3f1f035d9a4df340140499469fde266aaa	Yes it is possible and you can but will have to submit w2 when you get it from your employer.

If the closing was done, you should have received a "settlement statement" and it will show the name and address of the title insurance company.  That title insurance company will issue you a title policy that insures your title and states if there are existing liens on the property.  If you bought land that had been foreclosed, it is quite possible that the prior liens and taxes were satisfied in the foreclosure process, but if you have any questions, call the title insurance company and ask for an appointment to discuss the transaction with a title officer.  That person will take time to explain all the facts concerning your purchase, including any possible obligations to pay liens that were not satisfied.    If the settlement statement does not indicate a title insurance company, the title should be insured to protect you and any future owners.  It is not an expensive process and a title officer at any title insurance company in your county will handle the matter for you.|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	Are you speaking of a mobile home?

What I am asking you is when did you buy the house, where, how much, and how do you define loss?    In other words.  If you bought a house ten years ago for $150,000 and a year ago it was worth $300,000. but now you can only sell it for $250,000--I would say there is no loss there--would you?|`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	Not enough information.

But then it would depend on if you bought at the top or not.

AA11683895	Eviction is the only way to do it legally.  They need to get attorney advice and file the necessary paperwork for the eviction, and try to make sure that no damage is being done to the property in the meantime, which means frequent visits with 24 hours prior notice, and at the first glimpse of damage, a call to the police to fill out a formal complaint for each and every occurrence.  It is a process, but the only one they can go with to keep themselves from being a defendant in a lawsuit or counterclaim.

AA10464818	YES grants are real - but there are many scammers out there    The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.    Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.    There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.    You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	Which one?|`|19f038c651a2b78d2c6a4c16153c1be6aa	They are just scams to get your money.

This web site below will actually show you the valuable info which we all know is  3 above.

Then you need to decide your objective or goal, and how much risk you are prepared to take to get it. Only then can you start looking at investment options.    If you want very low risk then you need to put your money into cash deposits, savings account, state and government bonds etc. The returns will be relatively low, but always positive and always predictable.  If you want a higher level of return, then you need to take a higher risk and look at equities or shares. Mutual funds are a good way to invest because the risk is spread over lots of shares.  The highest level of return you can get on your money is probably to invest it in your own business or invest it your own education.

Basically you can't break the lease without loosing your deposit.

Then explain that you have found a place and are willing to move sooner if that will help her.

RF06NFJpaa	well other countries do make a lot of products that the united states copy off. for example china makes a lot of video games such of that for nintendo. the united states then buys the game to sell on their markets and the country that originally created it will gain a boost in their economy.     i also saw this commercial recently and i think that those visa card "swapping stations" are still not at a lot of places. for example credit cards came into style rather than carrying cash and 10 years later fast food restraunts such as mcdonalds also accepts credit cards now. pretty soon those visa card swipes will expand to other credit card companies and more stores will have these "swapping stations". also mcdonalds did originate in california, usa and expand to other countries. so i think different technology and creations begin in certain countries and they get better and diffuse into other countries.    so as a final statement i will say that china may be ahead of us on that subject of having these visa quick swaps but the usa has other technologies such as nuclear weapons that were created and later made in other countries mirroring the united state's example.|`|999c6b858291cfd96bef89202a8ed91caa	While I agree that we are a little behind in some areas, it's not always a bad thing. Credit is the worst and most costly technological advancement in this country. It allows people to buy and buy when they have nothing to pay with and everyone pays for it. Default on credit payments is at an all time high in this country because people are brainless and buy things such as bagels and papers with it. Some technology is better kept in the slow lane.

CHDfnRdtaa	The key to the successful use of a communication plan is to start it before the implementation of the final solution or change in the process.    Start with a realistic evaluation of the the people and groups that have or could have an influence on the outcome of the project.    Look at both people and groups.  The end user group is one that should be considered.    Break them down into Positive, Negative or Neutral groups about the project or solution.  Then evaluate them by their level of impact.  In this case you see the end users are at best neutral and they have a high level of impact.  Take any group that is Neutral or Negative and has a Medium to High level of potential impact and develop your communication plan for each.    From that point it is a sales job.  Take the WIIFM approach.  What's in it for me.  What are the end users going to get out of the improvement?  Then constantly communicate the status, involve them in the solution and communicate all wins back them to build support.
xVEOuPikaa	Well you're in luck because both an LLC and a C Corp can minimize your liability and your tax exposure.    As far as using an entity as an umbrella, this is usually not a good idea.  You don't want unnecessary risk exposure and doing several different activities under one company can do exactly that.  You should keep each activity separate; and sometimes that means forming multiple activities.  Any good lawyer will tell you to keep your business activities separate because a lawsuit under one activity; example: consulting, may put your entire company (which is also engaged in real estate investing) at risk.  Keep all activities separate.      Both an LLC and a C Corp, if all rules and guidelines are followed correctly, will shield you from your business liabilities.  Neither will save you if you are grossly negligent or doing fraudulent activities---not saying you are or will.    The nice aspect of an LLC is that you can choose how it will be taxed under federal law.  An LLC can be taxed as a sole proprietorship, which is default if there is only one member, a corporation; C or S or a partnership.  If you are starting out as a one man show and you have potential risk exposure, you may want to consider forming an LLC and file your taxes as a sole proprietorship.  It will not give you tax savings but your personal assets will be safe from business activities, if you follow the guidelines.      I know you hate to hear this, but the rules of liability exposure, the fact that it can be covered by the "corporate veil", tax advantages and disadvantages and everything else there is to discuss on this topic could be discussed for several hours.  I strongly recommend that you sit down with a lawyer and a tax professional before you start one of these entities.  You won't regret it.  Yes, I did read your post, but I would be doing you a disservice if I did not mention that.    Hope that helps.

That's a felony. <br>  <br>  If your un-reimbursed medical bills are more than 7.5% of your income, you can deduct the portion of the bill over 7.5% when you file your taxes.  If you need more info on that, the IRS has a phone number you can call to ask questions. You can also get more info on their web site: www.irs.gov. <br>  <br>  You can speak with the benefits administrator of your health plan (at your work.   I assume the insurance is provided through an employer). They should be able to give you some guidance on what is and is not covered under your health plan. <br>  <br>  I would assume the visit was coded as non-emergency because your injury/illness was not life threatening. But that's just a guess.  You really need to speak with someone familiar with your specific health plan.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	That was definitely not an emergency.

eJfRfJ2iaa	Stocks are actually small -pieces of a corporation. Stocks are bought and sold at a location to earn money for that corporation.     Brokers are the middle people. Brokers bring the Buyers [BUlls] and the Sellers [BEars] together. Do you see how the terms are related? If not, BEars are SEllers and BUlls are BUyers.    How did they get those names?   When a bull defends itself it throws its head up. Buyers cause stock prices and currency prices to rise or go up.  .When a bear defends itself, it moves its paws down. Bears cause stock prices and currency prices to decline or go down.    Using their money, the Bulls are betting a stocks price or a currencys price will go up.   This is known as being Bullish.     Using their money, the Bears are betting a stocks price or a currencys price will go down..   This is known as being Bearish.     When a Bull and a Bear agree on a price for a certain stock or currency, the brokers job is to put the Bull and the Bear together.    Money is paid for the stock or the currency. THEN that Bull owns that small piece of that corporation or that small amount of currency. AND that Bear has the money from that Bull.     Sometimes a Bull will buy a stock or currency with the intention of having the price go up, but the price goes down and the Bull loses money.  Sometimes a Bear will buy a stock or currency with the intention of having the price go down, but the price goes up and the Bear loses money.    At one time or another, they ALL make money. They make money going up; they make money going down; they make money going sideways ["consolidating"].    Any person [known as a "trader"] trading in the market, MUST have patience AND the ability to believe the position he or she buys or is in will have a return on that trader's money ["investment"].    Any person trading in the market MUST ALSO KNOW AND HAVE a limit as to how much of a loss they will accept - without allowing the account to go broke or almost go down to $0.    Here are some market sayings and expressions:    "Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get fat. Hogs [greedy traders] get slaughtered."    "There are no gifts on Wall Street."    "I am trading people. I am not trading stocks, bonds, options, currency, commodities or any other security or equity."    "V.I.C.P.I.E.: Volume Is the Cause; Price Is the Effect."    "Plan the trade. Trade the plan."    There are many, many others.    Thank you for asking your question. I enjoyed taking the time to answer your question. You did a great job - not only for your information, but for every other person interested in reading my answer. Thanks to everyone for reading my answer.    I wish you well.    VTY,  Ron Berue  Yes, that is my real last name.|`|82HVPj5kaa	If you're on about the stockmarket (stocks & shares), then basically it works as thus:    There are several types of companies that can be created. The biggest ones are usually public limited companies. This when a company who decide the best way to raise capital (money) is to sell of parts of the company, or "shares" to members of the public. Anyone can buy shares in a PLC, contrasting with the other three types of company where you must be invited to be a part of the company.    The place where anyone can buy these shares is called a "stock market", and the price of a share (part of a company) runs off the principle of demand and supply, ie; the more people that demand a company's shares the higher the price. Therefore the price of the company's shares will go up if there is higher demand for a company's shares and down if there is less demand.    So, to make money, one  would try to "buy low and sell high". So you would buy shares in a company which has not had much interest lately, but you think will have soon. You will buy the shares in the company low, and sell them high. However this is hard to tell in the long run whether shares will increase in value, so people have to try and predict from graphs and trends that you can find on any business site.    You have to have an extremely good understanding of the news to be able to make money on the stock markets.    The currency exchange is slightly more complicated. Currencies again opeate on the principle of supply and demand. Let's say the US had high interest rates (therefore it is good to SAVE and bad to BORROW in the US). People will demand more dollars and so the price of the dollar will go up against other currencies.    Again you have to try and "buy low sell high" to make a profit on such a venture, but it is very difficult because the interest rates are only one factor in the currency market and they are very hard to predict.    Also, currencies only fluctuate by tiny amounts because there is so much money in circulation, so you'd have to invest a massive amount of money to make a profit on the currency markets.

AA10162240	Best bet is to check the Secretary of States web site. Generally, the fees you have list will be due after your first year and each year thereafter.    You create your Corporation in the state as a C corp. Then you go to the IRS to elect the Sub Chapter S option. You can do this online at irs.gov.|`|xVEOuPikaa	Florida has an annual report that every corporation must file and the minimum fee is $150 regardless of revenue or profits.  Also, your county may send you a business property tax assessment; its purpose is to charge tax on the value of your business assets.    The corporate election to be taxed as an S corporation is made through the IRS with form 2553.  You must fill out this form and send it to the IRS within 89 days after either: the corporation began doing business, the corporation had assets or the corporation had shareholders.  If none of these events has occurred, you have time to make the election for 2007.      Please see a professional to fill out this form; it is worth it to do this right to guarantee your S status.  I've seen this go wrong for so many people trying to do it on their own.  Once the form is filed, you should receive a confirmation letter from the IRS stating that the form to file for the tax year is form 1120S.  Also, the letter will advise you that if you provide services for your corporation, the corporation needs to pay you a "reasonable salary".  Again, you should see a professional about this.  The IRS is beginning to ramp up efforts to crack down on closely held S Corps running their businesses as sole proprietorships---undocumented loans, co-mingling of funds, uncharacterized and improper profit distributions.      Your best investment at this point is sound tax and legal advice.  Good luck.

I recieved grants for college because I came from a low income family that couldn't afford to pay for college, so they gave me grants to help pay for college.

It seems to be working well for a few people, I know one or two people in real life, and have had real conversations with a number of people online who have received grants using these products - the nice thing about the online ones is that they're usually free, you just end up paying shipping.<br>  <br>  I actually bought a grants book back in the day and used to to help me apply for a business grant - got $20k for my carpentry business back in Detroit. Of course, I had to report to the gov't what I did with that money in this case, but not all the grants require that.

ZeDjn4cVaa	In general the partnership need to obtain its own extension for the  Michigan Business Tax.  If the partnership is liable for Michigan Business Tax, then an extension under the tax number of the partnership needs to be submitted,  If the partnership is not liable for Michigan Business Tax, then no extension for the partnership is needed.      It is unlikely that you will file your personal return by April (if the partnership return is not completed by then) then you will need to file a federal extension for your personal individual taxes. The federally filed extension automatically applies to Michigan.    Finally, many towns in Michigan have a partnership tax return which is a variant of the 1065 form.  These taxes are due typically April 30.  An extension request may be needed for your town as well.%0
jw8Pwe1Naa	Even though you may be financially responsible, lots of banks/institutions would consider anybody 18-25 as financially vulnerable, and will easily hand you out a credit card just do get you into some debt, resulting in interest profits for them. If you and your future spouse have a good income source, then it would be beneficial to get a credit card. Pay off as much as you can each month, and for your sanity's sakes, DO NOT get any cash advances. You can apply online or at a local bank/credit union.

My first suggestion would have been to do neighborhood work, but you said you couldn't do those things. One thing you can consider is selling candy at school. You can go to the store and find candy bars for about $0.50 each and sell it at school for $1. It actually works and people will buy from you. Other than that, you can try doing surveys on the internet. It doesn't make a whole lot but it still gets you something.     http://cashlep2s.notlong.com

If your broker does, then you can simply direct the broker to open a checking, savings, CD or whatever account and put your money in that. If your broker does not offer an account that you want, then tell the broker to return your available cash and then open an account at an institution that has the types of accounts that you want.        ======================================...    SEE THE FIRST SENTENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Better yet, go to your local bank and explain to them that you want to get this money back and put it in CD's.  I am sure someone there will help you retrieve your money.    If you recently opened a brokerage account and are wanting to pull your money out already, then something doesn't seem quite right to you.  this is one of those "go with your gut feeling" instances.  Get some trustworthy help to try and retrieve your money.  Be prepared though, that whoever you gave your money to to invest is going to charge you a fee.  Hopefully the fee will not be that much and you can cut your losses.  Be grateful if you can get back a large portion of your money and someone didn't swindle you out of it.  I wish you well, be careful, and get the assistance of a trustworthy source to help you!!

AGbusTqGaa	babysitting, get a job if you're old enough, its not really that easy to just "raise money" it usually requires some kind of work|`|tNaqdyhtaa	Hi,    After you have read enough emails, website sales copy, e-books, and email courses, some ideas begin to stick in your head. You may not be able to use them all, but with a little effort, you can pick out the best of those ideas and turn them into money in the bank. Ideas to earn money are not always free, but if you keep an eye out for them, they may appear from the most unlikely places.    Idea number 1 - Broker Web Hosting Service    This is a combination of online and off-line marketing and I am told it works very well. There is a lot of competition on the Intern these days so I do not recommend that you market this business online for the time being unless you have a big marketing budget. The best way to do this is to register as a reseller with a hosting company such as gator host.    Divide up this space into smaller accounts and then sell this to local small businesses owners near you who do not have a website. It is easier to target small business owners because they will see the value of having their own website and domain name rather quickly.    To make this work, you may have to throw in some incentive such as website design, monetization of the sites, and perhaps some other incentives such as automatic submission of each site to directories and search engines. Do not forget that you could also buy the domain name on behalf of each client, and later on you can sell that same domain name back to each client, especially when the domain gets some traffic and back links.    Idea number 2 - Become a Ghost Writer for Other Marketers    There are many online entrepreneurs like myself who need fresh and unique articles on a variety of subjects on a regular basis. Consider writing articles for people like me and sell them on the Internet. Visit digital point forum for ideas. There are several ways to do this. You could write a bunch of articles and sell to a limited number of people, say around 50 people and each person would pay you a discounted price for a bunch of articles. For example, you may charge around $25.00 for a bunch of 10 articles on a particular subject.

Sou9Yk59aa	Para determinar una decisin de inversin, una empresa utiliza el valor presente neto (VPN) del ingreso futuro proveniente de la inversin. Para calcularlo, la empresa utiliza el valor presente descontado (VPD) del flujo de rendimientos netos (futuros ingresos del proyecto) tomando en cuenta una tasa de inters, y lo compara contra la inversin realizada. Si el valor presente descontado es mayor que la inversin, el valor presente neto ser positivo y la empresa aceptar el proyecto; si el valor presente descontado fuera menor que la inversin la empresa lo rechazara.    El procedimiento tcnico para computar el valor actual de una empresa es semejante al que se emplea para computar el valor actual de una inversin en bonos u obligaciones.    Los factores que deben emplearse al computar el valor actual de una empresa son :    1.- Importe de las actividades futuras.    2.- Tiempo o fecha de las actividades futuras.    3.- Importe de los desembolsos futuros.    4.- Tiempo o fecha de los desembolsos futuros.    5.- Tasa de descuento.    Los administradores computan el valor actual descontado para evaluar los proyectos de operaciones dentro de la empresa y las posibles compras de otras empresas. En ciertos casos, el calculo puede servir para valorar equipos especiales, aunque solamente cuando la ganancia prevista provenga de ellos y pueda determinarse y medirse en dinero.    El valor presente neto es el valor actual de los flujos de caja netos menos la inversin inicial.

Es decir, la retribucin econmica causada y pagada no es reinvertida, por cuanto, el monto del inters es calculado sobre la misma base.     Inters simple, es tambin la ganancia slo del Capital (principal, stock inicial de efectivo) a la tasa de inters por unidad de tiempo, durante todo el perodo de transaccin comercial.

Obviously your job is not holding your interest.  I suggest you try to find (or even create) a job/career that allows you to do the things that interest you.  It helps when you are working in a field that sparks your interest (for me, that's healthcare) and for a company that you believe in.    In the interim, think about some specific things that would be interesting for you to do with your current employer and ask if you could do some of those things.  A good employer can appreciate your having that kind of initiative.  If that doesn't work, find the nearest coffeemaker (when at the job) and look for a better job (when you're away from work).|`|AA12381087	not really, everyone has their days.

AA11057445	You're absolutely correct.  If you want to rent, say, Pineapple Express when it comes out, go on and put it at the very top of your queue NOW.  Then, the second it comes out, you've got dibs because it's going to be sent to you as soon as you return your item(s).      If it says "Long Wait" or something of that nature, move it to the top so that the next time it's available and you return something, it will automatically be sent to you.  I've been doing that for years as a subscriber of both services.  It seems I always want some random old movie that three other people have heard of.. And all three of them have it out at the same time.  :)    Hope this helps!|`|QYHvh5ngaa	It literally takes one business day to get them. I use NetFlix and most of the time if I put it in the mailbox before they pick up I'll get my new DVD the next day.

4MypYVHYaa	There are a few things that can happen, but normally if you have reached this stage of the approval, you would normally be ok.    You should and have the responsibility to stay abreast of the procedures as they unfold. So you should get the telephone numbers or all the professionals involved in your transaction. The title company, escrow closing agent, loan consultant, real estate agent, insurance agent and any other you have had contact with.    Make sure that if there are things needed from you, make sure you get them to the requesting party immediately. This will prevent unnecessary delays in your Transaction.     Always ask if things are going ok and if there is anything necessary for you to do. Find out when the loan docs are to be prepared and ready for your signature.    Make sure when you do sign loan docs you have spoke with your loan consultant to find out the interest, length of the mortgage, monthly mortgage payment, late penalty.    Now when you sign your loan docs they should match exactly what you and your loan consultant discussed. If not please don not sign the loan docs, call your loan consultant and discuss t his discrepancy with him/her.    Signing the loan docs will lock you into the mortgage with no way out. So make sure everything is correct on the loan docs.    Once the loan docs have been signed you should find out when the loan will fund that this the day the lender will wire the mortgage to the title company.    You should make sure you are in contact with with your closing agent to set up a date and time for your closing.    The main thing is to stay in constant contact with those that are helping you and not wait for them to call you. They are working for you and you are paying them in the form of fees and points.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.

Next time you go to the bank, ask the teller if you can deposit this check you found into your checking.  Keep in mind that if the check bouces at their bank, you will get a small returned check fee.  If you are a curious bug.  Look up the 800 number of the check and call their automate service.

Every state is different, but you don't want it to go to a collection agency. Communication is the best answer.  Talk to them, tell them your problem, embellish if needed, but offer to make very small payments, showing goodwill on your part. If your making payments, even 5 or 10 bucks a month, it will stall them from closing the account and sending it to a collection agency.  Bad credit takes 7 years to clear your record, so try as hard as possible to make any type of payment.  I waited too long and now my credit is affected, but, the companies are very willing to negotiate the amount of debt I have. They are willing to let me pay 40% of my total debt.You don't know unless you ask them though. Do what you can, but don't let a 1000 dollar debt hang over your shoulders and ruin your days, it will work out in the end, just do what you can now...

16vMIGPiaa	If you're in the US, you could research this project by going to your local Small Business Administration office and interviewing one of the advisors.  You can find the SBA in the phone book or at http://www.SBA.gov  You'll need to put together a business concept, a mock Business Plan, an estimate of startup expenses, a cash flow projection, an advertising strategy, staffing plans, etc.  You'll have to demonstrate knowledge of licensing laws and Health Department requirements and inspections.  You'll have to include words talking about food safety, proper handling and storage, ...    Another great little book I recommend frequently is Michael Barber's "The E Myth".  Under $20 on Amazon or Barnes and Noble.  The book is directed at small business owners who want to succeed (95% of small businesses fail within the first five years) but would give you good information about business development strategy that could be included in your mock Business Plan.

CW43Obifaa	A Roth IRA is a type of account. It is a retirement account where you pay taxes upfront but none with qulified withdrawals (59.5 years of age and you must have had the account open under your name for at least 5 years). You can open one up at a bank, brokerage firm, mutual fund company, etc.    You can have a Roth IRA at bank A and another Roth IRA at broker B. You can have as many as you want however all of them together form one retirement account in the eyes of the IRS. What this means is that for 2009 since the maximum individual contribution limit is $5500 for people under 50 years of age you can contribute up to $5500 between the accounts in bank A and broker B not $5500 per account.    A Roth is just an account like a savings account but it has different rules i.e. contribution limits and eligibility (i.e. high income earners, six figures, cannot open one) and withdrawal criteria. It is an "umbrella" where you can invest in securities, earn interest, earn dividends, etc. without paying taxes on those profits. A Roth IRA does not carry an interest rate itself.    Now what you do in a Roth IRA is where the creativity lies. A bank may only offer CDs in its Roth IRA whereas in a broker Roth IRA you can invest in stocks, options, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, etc.    I personally have a Roth IRA at a mutual fund company and at a brokerage firm.    It sounds like you are a new investor therefore I would suggest opening up a Roth IRA account at a mutual fund company like Vanguard and buy a low cost (expense ratio     My $0.02|`|AA10472839	Banks and insurance companies are the last place to go for ROTH IRA products...... especially if you've got 10 years or more till retirement.

Rowe Price  Dodge & Cox  Vanguard  Charles Schwab  Fidelity Investments|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	No they aren't the same. Some have fees and a ROTH is just a tax word not a type of account. A ROTH means you can save already taxed money forever with no tax on the profits. You can buy almost anything with a ROTH, I have mine in shares of companies and mutual funds at my broker. You can open in a no load fund family like Vanguard and buy about anything they sell or any brokerage or bank. The banks are about the worst choice they only sell CDs and Money market funds that are insured so not good for retirement savings. Some or offering brokerage products but I wouldn't want them handling mine.  If you can't decide just put it in the bank CD for a year then next year you will have 2008-2009-2010 at up to 5K a year so 15K to get started on investing not just saving.

dvevk1qbaa	What exactly are you doing? That is important to know, also how much money are you talking?

For example, when you are in high school to help pay for the cost of the yearbooks, the yearbook staff must go find sponsors. They go anywhere! Maybe you have an aunt who has a restaurant. Go talk to her. Offer her ad space. If you have no personal connections you have to branch out and get a little uncomfortable.

With the job market such as it is it will be difficult, the jobs that use to be in the realm of teens and retirees are now being taken by adults trying to support their families.   The hours a minor can work legally are limited and it is much easier to hire an adult.     Businesses such as Publix, Kroger's, Food Lion, Sonic, Chic-Fil-A, McDonald's, Winn-Dixie, Krystal's, Dairy Queen, and Burger King along with smaller local businesses that are in the same genre tend to hire those your age.     Fast-food and grocery stores are willing and able to train new employees but........................  Minors tend to have many issues that affect their ability to work such as tardiness, absenteeism, and numerous schedule requests, poor work-ethic etcetera.  I am NOT implying you will have those issues but the fact that many your age do makes it more difficult for you to get an opportunity to prove your worth.  Because of this you must be able to show through words and actions that you are reliable, dependable, punctual, detail oriented, trainable, coachable, punctual, mature and team oriented. You will also need great references since you don't have work experience. Talk to teachers, counselors, clergy, coaches, club sponsors, and directors of places you have volunteered or people you have done casual labor for and ask them about giving you a reference. Get accurate, current contact information for them and ask them to be ready to get calls for references from potential employers.    Remember:  Most businesses are individually owned and operated so it is the owners policy and past experience with minors that will determine if they will hire you. Apply everywhere you can, the worse that can happen is they don't hire you.

oZY3QiZqaa	You have to do a little research, read about companies and their management, etc. There are a few good books that I can recommend you to read and they are easy to understand for beginners and they show you step by step how to invest and in which companies to invest and which ones to avoid.    Try to follow and read books about Warren Buffet, if you havent heard about him; he is the richest man in the world; he passed Bill gates who was number one for 13 years. Warren Buffet is an investor, he is not a trader, traders lose money because they are gambling with the stock market fluctuations. He invest long term. You can learn a lot from him.    Buddy, Just dont let anybody give you tips to invest in companies, you do your own research on the companies you want to invest. Look for companies with the great balance sheet, great management, with no or not too much debt, a lot of free cash flow, destroying all competition like Warren Buffet says and youll be alright. Ah! He also says to invest in business that you understand and are familiar with.    Also don't let any professional financial advisers, broker, CPA, money managers, fund managers, those so called "experts" on tv, tell you where to invest; and don't let them make you believe that you can't do it alone.      IRA is a retirement account, but Roth IRA is better because you pay taxes at the beginning and all of the gains you have from that investment don't pay taxes.  In the IRA you don't pay taxes at the beginning but you pay taxer from your gains. The returns of bonds compared to stocks is way less, and mutual funds depends if it is managed ( with managers that run the fund) with a lot of fees, maintenance fee, upfront charges, it is a mess or unmanaged (like index funds) with no manager and it the expense or fees of the latter are way cheaper than the first.

I remember when I got my first job; I was just as nervous about what was expected of me.  In regard to your question, no employer will expect you to learn all of your job duties on the first day, let alone the first week.  You will likely be paired up with a mentor who will show you what you are supposed to do.  Believe me when I say that your first day on the job will go by quick, so you shouldn't have a problem with not having anything to do.    The best thing you can do is get to know everyone that you will be working with because they are the people you will be relying upon when you need an answer to a question.  Pay attention to what your mentor has to say and don't be afraid to ask questions.    Also, when given an opportunity to do work outside of your job duties, do it.  It will reflect well on your work ethic and will be remembered during your reviews in which pay raises are usually determined.    Alas, only experience will teach you all the things that you need to know.  Remember that honest is the best policy;  when in doubt, err on the side of caution; and if you make a mistake, correct it and learn from it.    On a more important note, is this a job you intend to work at for an extended period of time?  If so, mention to your supervisor that you are possibly interested in a career.  That is important information for managers to know when they decide who is bested suited for advancement.  Managers aren't likely to promote someone who only intends to work for a company for a few months nor do they promote someone who has shown no interest in career advancement.|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	Congratulations!!  This is a moment to celebrate :)    My guess is that you'll be told who to go to when you've finished unpacking the boxes on your cart.  Depending on the size of the store, it's quite possible you won't get through all of the stuff to be unloaded.    Or maybe they'll have other work for you to do, like stacking and bundling the empty cartons for recycling, moving stock off the dock, etc.  Don't worry, they won't let you sit with nothing to do.    Enjoy your first paycheck!|`|1607553ae73b3448ecce266fdd1e5d8eaa	Don't worry too much about your first day. They will assign you to work with someone. If they don't tell you anything, you can go to the manager in charge and ask him/her what needs to be done or what they want you to start with. and, putting items in the right place is a job that is never done until the store closes, customers come in to the store all day long and move the items around, it is your job to make sure the store looks presentable. Good luck and enjoy.

Mais il faut toujours insister pour prendre une assurance autre que celle de la banque pour les raisons suivantes :   1) EN matire de succession, si l'emprunteur dcde, si l'assurance est celle de la banque, le prt se trouve aussit?t rembours et le bien figure dans l'actif de succession, donc est imposable. Si il y a une assurance indpendance, celle ci va rembourser le prt, mais lors de la succession, le bien figurera dans l'actif de la succession et le prt dans le passif, donc il y aura diminution de la masse taxable pour les droits de succession.  2) Si l'assurance est indpendante du prt, les chances vont diminuer au fur et  mesure que le prt se rembourse puisque le capital  rgler diminue. Alors que si l'assurance est celle de la banque, les mensualits resteront fixes, d'o un co?t plus lev.  En pratique, il faut se diriger vers une compagnie d'assurance et dlivrer une attestation  la banque|`|4a27b82bf4e1c6eb1c0397cc13792b8aaa	l'assurance vie peut etre faite ou on veut donc il est possible de l'avoir peut etre sans examen . ce qui est courant c'est un examen apres un certain age car le pret dure un bon moment et si tu es plus ag le terme sera a la pension ou plus|`|97f977bab2e91f0a2bf9c679d391a919aa	C'est un prt immobilier donc oui l'assurance dcs invalidit est obligatoire.

Par la suite et en fonction des rponses fournies, l'assureur peut :  1. refuser de te garantir  2. Accepter mais en augmentant les cotisations prvues  l'origine du devis  3. Accepter mais en supprimmant des garanties (quoi que peu ralisables car les garanties sont : Dcs et ITT).  Si la banque refuse de te couvrir, il te reste toujours les courtiers comme April.

One of the best things you can do is get your full credit report history and bring it with you when you go to meet landlords to explain to them why you might have some blemishes on your report.
