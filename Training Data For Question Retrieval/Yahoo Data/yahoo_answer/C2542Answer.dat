39WRk789aa	If your replacing the stock radio head unit everything will still work, if your going aftermarket radio you need to ask your audio store for an adapter that will connect your unit to the factory volume and channel steering switches, and may depend on what radio you purchase, may have to buy a more expensive unit to work with an adapter to keep your steering wheel controls.  But your heads up display and driver info center should all still work just fine as long as you don't cut any extra wires while behind the dash!|`|YtcmXVpWaa	Put a new head unit in my GTP and the steering wheel controls do not work. Heads up display etc are fine. The new radio came with a remote so it does not bother me. A reputable Radio place may be able to help you out. I see no reason for hacking away at wire packs because the industry have been so much more user freindly with crossover kits. Good luck.
AA10297143	If there are three lanes to choose from, I typically am in the middle lane.  If there is only two lanes, I am normally in the slow lane because the passing lane is just that, for passing.  If I am in a hurry, give me the fast lane and stay out of my way.|`|IMENWksEaa	The lane that is moving along the best, or if on a closely packed street, the lane that is furthest away from the parked cars on the right side is the safest. Example; PCH in Laguna Beach Ca., streets are way too narrow for the busy high traffic volume, and distracted, or "sleepy" people suddenly opening their parked car door in traffic, or stopping without a signal in the busy road. I have been able to contain the urge to have road rage. It gets easier with time, effort and self control.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I stay in the middle lane. Not really .|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I would normally stay in the middle lane and use the fast lane to pass. When my pass is complete and there's a large gap in the middle lane, I'll get back over. Cops normally look for speeders in the fast lane, so staying out of the fast lane as much as possible reduces my chances of getting a ticket. No, I wouldn't consider myself as an aggressive driver. I normally would go with the flow of traffic. If the flow of traffic is moving less than 10 miles over the speed limit, then I'll be going faster than the flow if the fast lane was open. If there's some slow poke in the fast lane, that's when I might drive aggressive by trying to pass in another lane and changing lanes quickly. If slow drivers would get out of the fast lane, than aggressive driving wouldn't be an issue. Drivers in the fast lane should be passing cars to it's right middle lane. Regardless of the speed limit, nobody should be in the fast lane unless passing cars in the middle lanes. Drivers that drive in the fast lane along side of traffic in the middle lanes are the ones that cause road rage and aggressive driving. It's safer for speeders to pass in one lane instead of weaving in and out of traffic because of slow or those going just 5-10 over in the fast lane. Drivers that are not passing in the fast lane need to either speed up and pass or find a gap to move over to the middle lane. If drivers did that, there wouldn't be any aggressive driving.|`|3urQfMffaa	I drive in the fast lane, mostly due to road rage.

I'm most comfortable when moving along 2-5 mph above the speed limit.  <br>  <br>  I also use cruise control a lot, so i tend to be in the lane with least amount of obstructive traffic.<br>  <br>  My driving depends on the drivers around me.  When they are driving rather safely, going right at the speed limit, i drive aggressively.  When I am surrounded by maniacs going 10+ over the speed limit i tend to drive defensively.<br>  <br>  It's all situational.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	the lane that's open.<br>  <br>  this is because i drive faster than everyone else. the 'fast lane' is filled with vehicles travelling slower than my target speed, which is basically infinity.<br>  <br>  as contradictory as it may sound, i am not 'aggressive'. i simply manuever between slower traffic. i don't honk the horn, ride peoples' tail ends, etc. i simply go around them.|`|M03NxWlPaa	I tend to drive in the right lane, which is also thee slow lane when I am able to drive (I have my permit!)<br>  <br>  I am definatly not an aggressive driver unless I am in a hurry somewhere, so nope! ! !|`|AA10757357	I tend to drive in the middle.

mR5ZtjqWaa	Depends if you're active or a backup pilot, you could be flying a few short flights a week or a few flights a month. <br>  You could start as low as between 20,000 and 30,000 with regional airliner with small turboprops and RJs. When you get a few years as FO, around 60,000 seems common. When you finally make captain, you pay jumps up to 100,000 give or take a 10,000. Finally, when you get some seniority, and work international routes, you can even reach over 200,000 if you're lucky.<br>  <br>  if you don't go airforce, you better have really rich parents or be willing to work work work. You get the money you need one way or another to get your PPL, and then your CPL, get your ratings, and fly. Fly for hours, you'll take anything that pays and even some that don't. No airline is going to even consider you if you have less than 1000 hours. A college degree is also a must if you want to make it into a big airline.|`|WE2Njwr9aa	Guardian your figures are off quite a bit the salary you refer to would have been average probably in the early 90s but is almost unheard of now. to make 80,000 a year you would have to first be at a major airline and have several years of seniority as a captain. you would typically expect for a first year's pay for an airline other than major (which is hard to pull off anyways) about 18,000 with increases depending on experience and seniority. <br>  <br>  And we often fly about 1500 flight hours a year.  some airlines pay by the hour and that pay is depending on the aircraft the heavier more complex the higher the pay. and other airlines pay per diem or by day|`|vZkyAmoGaa	when you go on an airline you typicaly will start out makin 80,000 a year and eventually after or 7 years ur salary could go up to 120,000 a year<br>  you would have to go to a flight school or academy if ur in new jersey i would reccomend century flight academy or air fleet training systems school (academies cost more but if u have the money go for it)

Do you think the cost is the same across the entire country (if you live in the US or Canada)? Labor rates vary regionally as do the cost of the fluids that would be used.     Usually you can have that done at a place that specializes in those quick oil changes. They have a variety of services related to automotive fluids. See this site:    http://www.jiffylube.com/autoservices/au...    If you do you will note that there are no prices quoted. That is so the local outlet can have a standard rate for each service but can occasionally offer promotions to increase business. Find a local outlet like this (or similar) and call them.

The trans. will be the most expensive part.|`|5193f1efcd6be58503e419f249203831aa	Depends on what kind of vehicle and where you're at but probably $300-500.  Get estimates from two or three places.  Many shops/dealerships have preset, discounted prices on scheduled maintenance.|`|uomYVsiLaa	I would figure around a grand, rotors calipers pads (front brakes) , drums wheel cylinders shoes(rear brakes) , possible new fuel lines if they are rotting out,1 hr min. for brake line flush plus fluid,anti freeze flush plus new anti freeze make sure system is pressure tested.You have have to add in disposal fees for fluids, brake and anti freeze.transmission filter flush and new fluids. Rotor vary from 40 to 100 bucks each , pads about 50 bucks a set same as the drums and shoes,transmission filter any where from 20 to 60 bucks could be more.Oil change is about 25 bucks, don't forget to rotate your tires while your at it.highly recommend the brakes are done properly surfacing rotors and drums are possible but most shops will suggest replacing them to avoid warping and other possible problems that can ac-cure and will save you money in the long run.

RTBvQJHbaa	Ok..... First I want you to take a deeeppp breath.  The leak in your coolant, sounds like they may have used straps on the tow truck to toe you??? if so they could have had a miss hap and not known, or just not told you.  Find out what the shop says it is, short of a blown head gasket talk to the tow shop, tell them what has happened and if they don't take care of you call the brs (bureau of regulatory services)  They will make them take care of your complaint or fine them big time if it's they're fault  (it would be alot cheaper for them to pay for the fix;).  If your car has been doing that off and on it sounds like whom ever has done the most recent "fix" needs to go back over it and find the CAUSE to fix your COMPLAINT.  If they aren't willing to refer back the BRS, they will really help you out in this Problem they may move alittle slow, but when they do shops shake in there boots and the rear ends get really tight ;)  You may have a bad valve body or something similar.  To find out what the problem is take it to a dealer, or atleast call the to find out if it has any (TSB) or technical service bulletins if so inform the shop that touched it last, they may through a new trans in it if your a big enough pain.  JUST DON'T BE RUDE!!!  A calm assertive manor is always best and if you feel they are tring to take you for a ride call around,  if they are jerks Tell them your going to cal the BRS that will or atleast should change there attitude.  Alot of shops keep in minds most people call the BBB (better business bureau)  I hope I helped you out ....  See some techs are nice;)|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Possibly the alternator. Ask around to get some names of mechanics other people (friends, family or co-workers) trust & then consider having one of these mechanics check out your car instead of whomever you currently use. An honest mechanic is worth their weight in gold.  My alternator died on one of my former vehicles. The car drove slower & slower until it just stopped. It wouldn't turn over, either. I purchased a rebuilt alternator & the vehicle was fine after that.|`|5193f1efcd6be58503e419f249203831aa	To be brutally honest...it's because it's a Neon.

ytgjFFq6aa	If it is a Floor shifter and you want just the knob off, there should be a very small allen head screw on the side below the parking release button, loosen that screw which holds pressure to the actual shifter, once you loosen it, it should come right on off. if you want to take the whole shifter out, then take the center console out and you will see a plate at the bottom of the shifter with four bolts, take the bolts out and your shifter should come out with no problem|`|NPfmdsg8aa	Bucket seats? shifters in the center between the seats? it's not a real hard job accessing the shifter, but it's the only way your going to fix it, you have to remove the center counsel and you see once you get down there where all the screws are located to remove it, once you've got that removed you'll have total access to the shifter, it's pretty much self explanatory once you get the counsel out of the way, but you will however have to replace the shifter. good luck
mqMdbAyQaa	The 4.3 V6 has the exact same bore and stroke as the 5.7(350) it is basicly the same motor with two cylinders cut off the back, I think the only problem you might run into is the bolt pattern where the trans and engine mate together, you have to remember that not all engines have the same bolt pattern on the back of the block, but its worth a shot, I also think you might be able to buy an adapter kit for it, but you would have to do some research. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Ya, no problem. Get a specialist to install it if your not confident about doing it yourself.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	Yes and no. <br>  <br>  The trans will fit under the truck, if you use a long shaft th-350, even the driveshaft will be the right lenght. <br>  <br>  The trans will bolt up to your engine, etc.. <br>  <br>  But heres what the other people is over looking. <br>  <br>  You have the 4l60E trans not the 700r4.

v8TWvtQgaa	Find a new machine shop ASAP. <br>  <br>  Theres no combo in this world that will put a 355 with flat top 4 VR pistons and 64cc heads at 10.7:1. <br>  <br>  That sounds like compression figures for a flat topped 383 stroker, not a 355 <br>  <br>  Now if you are in fact building a 383 (4.030 bore, 3.75 stroke)  Then shop is right. The flat top 4vr will give you too much compression for pump fuel and iron heads, and the dish will work best<br>  <br>  A flat top 4vr piston will cc in at 7.5 to 9cc based on piston brand, etc. <br>  <br>  On a 355 With a 0 decked block, .038" (thinnest you can run with 0 deck height) head gaskets, with a 4.040" bore in gaskets, 64cc heads you get....<br>  <br>  10.095:1 with a 7.5cc piston <br>  9.928:1 with a 9cc piston <br>  <br>  Do not use the dish pistons on your 355. Those dish pistons you have are forged replacments noted for "Original equipment style replacement for passenger car engine"<br>  <br>  The are around a -20 to -25cc dish vol and will drop your compression down to 8.5:1 or so <br>  <br>  I'm running wiseco 5.4cc 2VR flat tops in my 355, 4.030" over, stock .025" deck, 4.100"x.015" gaskets, 64cc brodix heads..  My compression is 10.34:1 <br>  <br>  Before this combo I ran same bore, stroke, gasket, deck height but a 4VR flat top piston and 62cc 462 double hump heads.  I had 10.18:1 compression <br>  <br>  Now to answer your question. Cam does not play a role in amount of compression ratio, but cam does change the cyl pressure, DCR and if X compression can run on pump fuel. <br>  <br>  The only things that changes the compression ratio is the.. <br>  Bore size<br>  Stroke lenght<br>  deck height <br>  head gasket bore and thickness<br>  Piston dish/dome vol. <br>  Head chamber CC vol. <br>  <br>  Now where the cam comes into play is with cyl pressure (amount you would see on a gauge if you done a compression test) <br>  <br>  If you have alot of overlap, high duration, wide LSA,  then you tend to bleed off cyl pressure. <br>  <br>  That can be good and bad. Bleed off too much and you have a dog untill 4000 rpms or so. <br>  <br>  Don't bleed off enough and you have an engine that pings it's self to death on pump fuel. <br>  <br>  That's why pickng the right cam is such a big deal. <br>  <br>  For most people 180-190 psi cyl pressure is max for pump 93 octane fuel.  <br>  <br>  If you know how to tune an engine and have everything setup right you can get away with 200, 215, 220 psi on 93 octane but I don't recommed that to the avg person. <br>  <br>  On my old combo I ran a 218/230* @.050" cam, 112 LSA (small cam really) to gain the cyl pressure. I had 212-218 psi. <br>  <br>  On my new combo I have a 249/252* @.050" cam, 106 LSA, 220-225 psi cyl pressure. <br>  <br>  Both runs on pump 93 octane but I have to limit timing, jet it pig rich, feed it nothing but outside air, etc etc|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	No cam has no effect on the compression, just deck height, piston height and head volume.  Your heads may have been decked before so they may be slightly lower volume than a factory set, making higher compression

The mileage is stored in the gauge cluster, but on most newer vehicles (of which you do not state yours), the vehicle security system must be reflashed or the vehicle does not even start up.

If you have vehicle emission testing where you live the mileage is listed on the emissions report. You should be able to check the previous test mileage to see if it was more than the odometer now reads.  You can also go to a dealer, they can run the vin number and trace a vehicle to where it was sold and pull maintenance records for mileage verification.  You sound more like a shister that is trying to set back an odometer.

Says using a helmet makes you 37% less likely to die than someone injured in a wreck without wearing a helmet.  Sounds about right.  Riding a bike is just a better experience when you are wearing a full face helmet.  That said, there is no one more agianst big brother telling me I have to wear one.    Personally I don't think protective clothing is ever going to save you if you are going to die anyway.  Leathers work wonderfully on the track where everyone is going the same direction and you can just slide away on some nice soft dirt when you wreck.  In the real world there are things like parked cars, fire hydrants, signposts, and trucks coming the other direction.      Still a good idea to not offer up your unprotected skin as hamburger.  A friend almost wrecked two summers ago, just brushed a concrete divider at about 50mph, in shorts, sanded away his skin all the way to the fat, very ugly, very painful, very expensive.|`|48eb2dbb79fba479784347026d54127daa	ABATE has a lot of those statistics.

Those guys are out to make money off you and me.  They know what increases or decreases the risk of their having to pay out on a policy and they give discounts to low risk people.   Car drivers are given a discount for not smoking as smokers are slightly riskier drivers.  They give discounts  for having a record of not crashing, for having a record of not being cited by law enforcement, for being "older and wiser", for having taken a driver safety course.  They give motorcyclists Discounts for having attended the MSF basic rider course and for their choice of motorcycle.  They do not give a discount for wearing a helmet or protective gear.  Why not?    edit:    The pro-gear people constantly state that wearing a helmet decreases your risk of death by some large percentage, in the below case, 37%.  IF this were true, then the states with mandatory helmet usage would show a significant decrease in fatalities per accident.  The truth is that they show an insignificant increase.

Guess its all in how you look at it.     You are really just straightening the small bends to the blades edge with the leather. You're not taking any metal away. Regardless, leather is durable and can be worked easily as well as in great abundance at low cost.

When you make anything smooth or sharp you start out with some kind of coarse abrasive finishing up with extreenly fine sandpaper or poliching compound. As it turns our old fashoned stiff leather straps in barbershops have been used for years to "fine hone" and smooth out the fine grind serrations which actually makes the blade more sharp.

hkLY035raa	Twenty years ago I would've shouted "Japanese!" and gone on to something else.  Anymore, not so much.    Frankly, all the manufacturers have their problems.  I don't know why but German cars have this air of superiority, and an understanding that goes with that that they require lots of constant maintenance.  And if you need actual repairs, God help you and your wallet.    Japanese cars used to be very reliable, in part because they had nothing much going on: metal box, tires, engine, tranny, seats.  That was it.  And as sound as they would be mechanically, you could almost hear them rusting away in the driveway.    American cars were sort of the opposite: bodies carved out of plate steel, gigantic solid engines that might or might not start.  Crude, durable, chancy after 100,000 miles.    French cars are weird.  Generally beautiful, but weird.    Italian cars are sold with the understanding that you love the smell of engine grease and will be able to fix it when it breaks.  Note I say "when," not "if."  Because if nothing else, you must understand that the works of Man are ultimately temporary.  Everything breaks eventually.    But today the question is which is better, American vs. Foreign.  Well, I can't tell you one vs. the other.  If I were in the market right now, I'd buy American to help further the domestic economy.   It's going to be a pretty good buy no matter who you buy from.    World-beating speed and handling: you know the foreign names: McLaren, Lamborghini, Ferrari.  If you want to stay American, the Cadillac XLR (get yours today, they're discontinuing it) and Corvette are both fabulously fast and cling to the road like they love it.    Practical transportation: Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Chevy Malibu and Impala, Ford Fusion and Taurus.  All good cars.  None are exciting, unless you get really worked up over efficiency and practicality.    Trucks: Ford F-series, Chevy full-size, Dodge full-size.  The Japanese bring some new stuff to this game, but forget it.  If you're getting a truck, shop from the country that made trucks great in the first place.    Econobox: unfortunately, we don't have any domestic econoboxes.  The closest we get is the Ford Focus which is an excellent car.  If you want smaller, shop from a country that is smaller and doesn't ask people to stuff themselves into such a tiny space for a really long ride.  Don't buy a Suzuki anything.  I know too many people who've been stranded by one.    I drive Japanese, but they're both old.  If I were shopping today I'd skip the Japanese dealers.  The reputation for quality and reliability is still there, but recent reports over the last few years indicate that that reputation isn't as deserved as it used to be...and the American reputation for falling apart and being cheap junk is also no longer accurate.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Technically, there are no "American made" cars anymore.  Not a single model is entirely built in America.    So far as reliability the top of the charts are still dominated by offshore manufacturers.  Last year Consumer Reports for example published a list of 10 best and 10 worst cars for long-term reliability.  All 10 cars on the best list were made by Toyota and Honda.  The worst list was dominated by European makes.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Foreign.    Higher resale value=Better made cars.

Also, many car companies are exporting labour intensive processes to other countries due to cheaper wage rates (e.g. gearboxes). Toyota, Suzuki etc are all reliable Japanese cars so it's hard to compare.|`|AA12198082	Depends what you are looking for. For horse power and with large trucks I would go with a Chevy or Ford....and maybe a Dodge.    Also American car (for the money) are a great deal.

VEIkVDtIaa	The answer is simple...you have engaged the power window lock-out button on the driver's side window switch panel.  if you look to the upper left of the switch there should be a button with the icon of a window. (it may be on the upper right of the switch, I don't remember).  press the button.  if its pressed in it should pop up.  if its up it should press down.  push the button and your other three windows will work.    Edit  if only the driver's window works and the three others stopped working at the same time then the switch is the problem.  If the switch is open circuited then power is cut to the windows other than the driver's window.  if there is no change when you press the switch one way or another then the switch is burnt out and will have to be replaced.    if your car has under 36000 miles then your car is under warranty and it won't cost you anything to replace the switch if you take the car to a dealer.    and I don't think you're stupid; too many times people take their cars to get detailed and the cruise control switches and the power window switches get engaged and disengaged when the detailers wipe off the interiors.  Most people don't think to look in the owners manual nor do they even know they have the switch because they never use it.    the reason the button is there is so you can disable the other windows if you have kids sitting in those seats so they can't open them while driving and climb out.  Isn't that wonderful?    most of the time the button gets pushed by accident either when cleaning the inside of the car or resting a cup of coffee on it while holding it.  I'm sure you'll be able to "fix" it in 2 seconds.    hope that helps|`|HUluAQM3aa	Double check your owner's manual to make sure you are doing it correctly.

They were practicing long-range missions, something Long-Range Aviation hasn't had a chance to do for many years.  There was never any question of selling/transferring to the Venezuelans.

Letting someone else drive a stick does not seem unreasonable to me. I believe the company can be forced for safety reasons to reconsider their position on this.  I base this on the following info:  An employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to the known disability of a qualified applicant or employee if it would not impose an "undue hardship" on the operation of the employer's business. Undue hardship is defined as an action requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of factors such as an employer's size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.    An employer is not required to lower quality or production standards to make an accommodation; nor is an employer obligated to provide personal use items such as glasses or hearing aids.

WO68RZdIaa	First, and most importantly- I'm glad that both did survive the collision. This can be very stressful, so I hope you are also holding up OK.<br>  <br>  As Ucantcme has stated, front airbags only deploy on frontal crashes. <br>  <br>  Since the semi hit mainly on the driver's side of the S10 instead of head on, airbag deployment may have caused more injuries than it prevented simply from the direction the body travels in a side impact collision.<br>  <br>  In a head on collision the body tends to pitch forward & the risk is your head striking the steering wheel, windshield dashboard & occasionally the A-pillar*. The deployment of the airbag along with correct wearing of the vehicles safety harness will assist in preventing serious injuries when your body is pitched forward in these types of collisions.<br>  <br>  In a T-bone collision (which is more similar to your Dad's collision) the body is pitched sideways instead of in a whiplash (front-to-back) manner. Head injuries are likely if the vehicle does not have side curtain airbags & the head strikes the door frame, window & in a pickup sometimes the B-pillar* area, and unless it is an extended cab truck- the area of the rear window. Deployment of a frontal airbag in a T-bone collision could possibly result in the head being snapped backwards resulting in more injuries, possibly even very severe or life threatening.<br>  <br>  Being hit from the side or off at an angle more on the side than front of the vehicle, most likely the sensors would not have been triggered that are used to deploy the front airbags.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  * If you are unsure about what I am meaning when I was referencing the A & B pillars- The vertical "pillars" on vehicles are lettered A, B, C starting at the windshield going towards the rear of the vehicle. "A" being the post at the windshield, "B" will be the one behind the front seats, and on sedans, "C" would be the post at the rear window.|`|wpgRMjgraa	"It hit the front left and side of his truck".<br>  <br>  Airbags deploy only when they might be needed to prevent serious injury. <br>  <br>  Frontal driver and passenger airbags are designed to inflate in moderate to severe "frontal crashes" equivalent to hitting a solid barrier at 10-12 mph. <br>  <br>  Some manufacturers use different inflation thresholds depending on whether people are using their safety belts. <br>  <br>  Thresholds of 10-12 mph typically are used for unbelted occupants, but thresholds are higher — about 16 mph — for belted occupants because the belts alone are likely to provide adequate protection up to these moderate speeds.|`|apLKMToZaa	first of all, i'm glad that they survived, and i hope that your dad makes a full recovery, this must be very upsetting and stressful.<br>  <br>  i hate to sound like a jerk, but this is often just what happens when a larger/higher up vehicle hits a lower vehicle (pickup or suv hitting car, or in this case a semi hitting a truck), and the smaller vehicle has no Side Curtain Airbags to protect the heads of the people inside from going through the window and hitting the actual hood, grill, or bumper of the higher up vehicle that hit the small vehicle.  <br>  <br>  you could always get your insurance company to inspect and investigate the car<br>  <br>  good luck|`|xYMjXqhZaa	My first question would be did your Dad buy the truck new, and if not have it checked to see if it has a dummy airbag installed instead of the real thing. Some shyster body shops will do that if it was ever in an accident to save the cost of replacing it.<br>  <br>       As far as the bag not going off, it is entirely possible that the sensor was not in the area that was hit. I don't know about the 02 models, but the earlier ones only had three sensors. One in the center of the bumper, one on the firewall and another under the dash. Even so, if he was hit at an angle it's possible that the impact actually missed the sensor.<br>  <br>       Have a GM mechanic check it out.
SOfbIOzUaa	I think your car has oversize tires on it. The stock size should be the 195/60R15 tires. So if anything, putting that size on will correct any inaccuracy on your odometer.<br>  <br>  It has been my experience that may speedometers read slightly higher than the speed you are actually going with the recommended tire size but the odometers tend to be more accurate.<br>  <br>  I have a 96 Accord LX Wagon and the stock size for my car is the 195/60/15s but I too have 205/60R15s on the car.  Check the sticker on the drivers door pillar for the correct size or the owner's manual if you have one.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Nevermind the stock size for your car is the 205/60R15 size because it is a V6. <br>  <br>  Anyway there is about a 2% difference between the sizes so for every 100,000 miles you drive the odometer will show 102,000 miles and if you are going 65 mph your speedometer will say 66.3 mph.|`|VEIkVDtIaa	the speedometer will not be affected very much as the tire profile is largely the same. the 60 in the tire size means that the sidewall height is 60% of the tread width.  for a tire with a 205mm width the sidewall height would be 123mm.  a tire with a treadwidth of 195mm has a sidewall of 117mm.  so your difference in the diameter is 10mm (there are two sidewalls to add together when you draw a diameter across the tire)  that means your 195 tire will rotate more frequently than the 205 tire and the speedometer will read that the car is going a little faster than it really is.  the speedomter error won't be that great, may be 1 mph or so high.  I wouldn't worry about it at all.<br>  <br>  hope that helps

Trying to bump start with some help from two or three people might work.|`|76cAAPfBaa	If it seized up because of no or very low oil, it might have permanent damage. However, it's possible it'll be drivable again after it cools down, and the seized parts let go of each other. That can take several hours. <br>  <br>  I've had seized engines free up after several hours, so it's possible..|`|24kFbAdsaa	What told you it was low on oil?  You don't say you looked at the dipstick.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you have a maintenance issue.  Could be ignition, computer, or fuel pump.  You'll need to get it to a garage to have it checked.  Too little info in your question to diagnose specifics.
XrZbqY4Vaa	I think you are being ripped off.  A good garage would have pressure tested the system to identify the coolant leak.  They should then advise you of what is damaged and get your go ahead to repair it.  You should make this fact very clear when you take the car in.  <br>  <br>  If the radiator hoses were looking a bit perished, it is generally a good idea to replace them at the same time as the radiator.<br>  <br>  Odds on radiator and water pump failing at the same time is remote.  Same can be said for the thermostat.<br>  <br>  It sounds as if they are incompetent and went looking to cure the problem by replacing item by item until they found the guilty culprit.  Backyard mechanic style - but can be very expensive.<br>  <br>  The car is fitted with a timing chain, there again I think you were ripped off.  You probably have to strip more of the car to replace a chain than a belt.  If it was a belt then I would agree that it needed to be replaced regularly.<br>  <br>  I think in hindsight you know you were ripped off and I would have to agree with you.<br>  <br>  In closing, in taking a car to a garage, it is best to let them identify the problem and give you a quote for fixing it before they go ahead with a repair.  Many garages don't like to do this, but if they are honest then they generally accept it.  Also tell them you want the old parts that they have replaced - this also assists in stopping a garage  ripping you off.<br>  <br>  With regard to whether you have broken a piston rod.  My money is on it that YOU HAVE NOT.  With a broken piston rod you will hear it slapping the side of the cylinder as soon as you start the car.  I doubt that you will be able to get it to idle.<br>  <br>  It is probably because the chain has not been fitted properly and making a noise.|`|DyEIc0K8aa	"Rayvin" said it all.

Wiring-Ground.the motor must have both power as well as a good ground connection. To check this run a wire from the positive post on the battery to wire on fan motor, then run another wire to a good ground or negative battery post to the fan motor housing. fan not works then motor bad--fan works then trouble is in the thermostat or relay. The Town and Country van  has two cooling fans.  One is controlled by the thermostat and the other goes on to increase cooling  when the air conditioner is on.  You can actually avoid overheating of the engine in mild weather by turning the air conditioner on which turns on the fan on the right side of the radiator.

(What you are seeing is often the very first symptom of a blown headgasket problem.)<br>  <br>  Try starting the car with the radiator cap removed.  Have someone stomp on the gas pedal to very quickly but briefly bring the engine RPM up to near redline.  You have a problem if your coolant bubbles while this happens.  But be careful; if the problem is bad, the coolant will blow out like a geyser!

Hhx21tU4aa	I would recommend three things:<br>  1.  Pull a CarFax report on it.  Do not depend entirely on what it says, but use it as one source when considering whether or not the car is a good value.  Remember that CarFax can only show information that has been reported to it, and may not give you a true picture of the car's history.  It is a useful tool, but don't rely on it exclusively.<br>  <br>  2.  The Kelley Blue Book is good but a much better source for pricing is Edmunds True Market Value.  Kelley Blue Book gives the national average retail asking price for a vehicle.  Edmunds TMV will instead give you what cars in your area have actually sold for.  It's like retail (asking) price (Kelley) vs. actual selling  price (Edmunds TMV)<br>  <br>  3.  By all means get a mechanic to inspect it.  It would definitely be worth every penny and can save you thousands.  If you don't know one locally you can always use some of the nationwide services.  I personally have used Northeast Auto Inspection but if you do a Google I'm sure there will be others from which to choose.  The $100 or so fee is a small amount to pay to avoid buying a lemon.  Good Luck!|`|9d73b9faab05a54464dbbdea67ca0847aa	The average mileage per year for most drivers is 12,000.  So it is reasonable to expect a 2 year old car to have 24,000 miles.  40,000 sounds like high mileage to me but the price makes up for it.  <br>  I'd recommend going to Kelly Blue Book to check what they say the asking price should be and then you know if $9500 is too much.  See the link below (redo the analysis because your zip code will give results based on where you live).  I put it in as an 07 with 40,000miles.

km9cQNAXaa	Contact a local flying school to find one of their students who has recently qualified. You could buy their training manuals from them at about half the new cost and they should still be up to date. <br>  <br>  Ian M|`|EVHr4VpCaa	The previous posters present a lot of good ideas.  My students mostly self study for their written.  Then I ask them to go to Sporty's Pilot Shop's URL and use their 'study buddy'.  It simulates the private pilot written exam.  <br>  <br>  Another poster talked about training frequently.  That is so important.  When we walk away from a flight lesson, we start to forget almost immediately.  It's not so bad if training is a couple of times a week.  However those folks who fly once a month or less really have this problem.  So it is best if you save up for a while before beginning your training.  It will acutally cost  you less in the long run.|`|OXljAxooaa	Many smaller flight schools endorse home study, such that you can avoid having to pay for lots of ground school.  However, you'll have to work hard to learn all the material on your own and some of the home study products out there that you'll need to study for the written exam and checkride exam can be pretty expensive in their own right (such as King Schools or Sporty's private pilot courses).  I tried doing it almost all on my own with just the Jeppesen Private Pilot textbook, but it wasn't enough and I ended up paying $250 or so for the King Schools course (and ended up getting 100% on the written exam as a result).<br>  <br>  Another way to save some $$$ is to do your training in as inexpensive an aircraft as possible (Cessna 150 or 152), and find a flight instructor who charges a reasonable rate.  You'll have better luck finding cheaper rates at smaller airports well away from major metropolitan areas.  If you can find an airplane and an instructor that together total $100/hour, you've found a real bargain. In many locations (particularly near big cities), you'll have to pay at least double that.<br>  <br>  As mentioned by the previous poster, flying regularly will help tremendously (twice per week is ideal) because it is far more efficient and you are not always trying to relearn something that you have already learned, compared to flying once every two or three weeks.<br>  <br>  A lot of the ultimate cost of your private pilot's license will be determined by your own natural learning rate/style and and how quickly you become comfortable with the airplane.  Some pilots who are quick learners or "naturals" get their licenses shortly after attaining 40 hours of total flight time, while some are much slower to learn and may take 100 hours or more to become comfortable enough to get their license.  Obviously, the more time you are spending to rent and airplane for instruction and hire an instructor, the more expenseive the whole deal is going to become.  National average is somewhere around 60 hours, though, before you get a license.|`|z3BxHrMpaa	You can self study for the written exam, but your instructor will have to endorse that you are ready to take the test. That's the method I used for my private, and I aced the written.  <br>     The way to save money on the practical part of the license (the flying!) is to try and complete it in a reasonably short period of time.  If you only fly once in a while half of each lesson will be relearning some of the previous lesson. If you can fly at least twice a week, if not more, you will learn in fewer total hours.  Also, check what the typical weather is for where you live, and start your training when you have the best chance of avoiding long periods of bad weather. Not flying for 2 weeks because of poor weather will set back your training|`|HvSPJZHnaa	Try the ebook on this page <a href="http://www.learning-to-fly.com/ebooks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.learning-to-fly.com/ebooks.ht...</a> The one listed at number two is the one I'm referring to.

e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa	I would use Mobile 1 or Castrol Edge.  VW has a specific rating ( I believe it's 502.00 ) that they require. Castrol makes an oil that says "european car formula" on the bottle. That is the one you want. Make sure it's 5w30 or 5w40 as the manual says is required.|`|WlFSaOpQaa	I dont really think that the brand matters but with the GTI you will want to use a full synthetic oil because turbocharged engines function better with full synthetic oils because they can get into all of the places better then conventional oil. Also it is best to let your car idle for about 30 seconds to a minute before shutting it off to ensure that the oil will not burn off. the easiest way to ensure this is to get a turbo timer which will leave the car running for a predetermined time after shutting the car off. this is especially true if you had been operating the car under boost before shutting it off.|`|0Mj9b0Aoaa	The VW dealership I worked at used Castrol Syntec and Castrol SLX synthetic oils in all the 08 models.  The SLX was good for both gas and diesels while the Syntec was only good enough for the gas models.  I cannot remember the VW Oil Standard designation (something like 505 01 for diesels) but check the back of the bottle for a VW oil rating and you should be ok.  VW strictly requires synthetics in all the new model vehicles.
AA10720479	You wouldn't be able to see the damage unless you took the head off. I have a 98 GST eclipse, and the timing belt went, witch broke off the bottom of two valves and jammed them into the piston, the head also got damaged. I had to replace the head, pistons, turbo,(don't know why it went bad), rod bearings, oil pump, cam shafts, spark plugs got pulverized, so I had to replace them too, I also eliminated the balance shafts(that was the reason for the belt breaking). I guess for a quick Reference you could take the spark plugs out and see if they are smashed. More than likely you will have to rebuild.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	You can't really assess the damage just by peeking under the valve cover. If there is damage, it will be in the form of broken valves and (worst case) a valve punching through the top of a piston. In that case, the engine is pretty much done and the cost of the repairs will probably exceed the value of the car.    Depending on the car, the water pump also may run off the timing belt. In that case, you may need a new water pump.    I would take it to a trusted mechanic to get an estimate. Next time, change the timing belt before it's due! It's not an option.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	A timing belt can break without doing damage, there's only one way to find out though.

Nothing will look bad when the valve cover is removed unless the belt broke at high rpms and the valves bent severly. In that case the valve stem height will not be the same when the rocker shafts are removed.  Just plan on doing a valve job and timing belt, along with the tensioner and any pulleys that feel dry when spun by hand. I'd also replace the water pump while you're at it.|`|19b7bd1dd32149738cfd8fca874ffda8aa	If your car is a 4 cylinder you may be ok. If it is a 6 cylinder there is a 99.99% probability you have bent at least three valves. I am sure you have already been advised that there is probably valve damage or you wouldn't be asking. The manual recommends the timing belt, water pump, and timing belt tensioner be changed every 60,000 miles.|`|HTRR0NhJaa	if your engine have a super low compression then you may be fine but it will depend on how high the engine rpm rate was when the timing belt broke, if it was above 3500rpms then you definatly broke somthing. you can only find out after you install a new t belt (take the car to an A or B level thechs) to do this. good lock
km9cQNAXaa	Depends on the specification of the prop. In general engines driving a propeller quote power in Horse Power. In good condition an O-200 produces a nominal 100 HP. That was when new. A Cessna150 engine could be over 40 years old so I doubt you will get even that much.<br>  <br>  Trying to convert HP to static thrust is virtually impossible as the aircraft are to slow for sensible answers. To give an example a WWII Spitfire flying a 300 mph at low level. The 1500 HP engine produced about 3000 pounds of thrust. Scale that down and your O-200 would produce about 200 pounds but only if you could get your C150 up to 300 MPH, obviously impossible. At a more realistic 100 MPH you might get 60 to 70 pounds of thrust.<br>  <br>  Ian M

And it is unlikely that a vessel that size could realistically run on coal these days.    BTW, the Titanic DID have the proper number of life boats - they actually exceeded the number required by the board of trade! It was the law that was flawed. Even then, the concept was that the  boats would only be needed to ferry people to a rescuing ship - the idea that everyone on board would need to be accomodated in the lifeboats at the same time did not occur. It was assumed that with wireless, and with the ability to stay afloat for a long period (She was never claimed to be unsinkable) the scenario of all hands abandoning ship would never arise.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Do you mean if someone wanted to build a replica without using the lifeboats specified when it was first built?

First, technology is the big one. The bridge would be outfitted with all the modern electronics to protect the ship, the crew, and the passengers. GPS, radio, radar, satellite links, weather, and computer enhancements.    Second, the watertight bulkheads would truly be watertight. Bring them all the way to the top, and seal them against water.    Third, there were enough lifeboats, they just didn't load them heavy enough. Steerage passengers were not allowed to evacuate onto deck, much less get in the lifeboats.    Fourth, the engines would be diesel and not steam. Most likely only two as opposed to the three on the original.    Edit: Oh yeah, I forgot the anti-roll wings and the thrusters.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	Don't let the Irish near it!!

If you think your alternator is bad then you can check it. Either disconnect the battery while the car is running or crank the car up and let it run for about 15 mins or less and if the car dies then you have a bad alternator.

AA10297143	Yes, the prison bus is equipped with an emergency exit, but it is controlled by the driver/guard and cannot be accessed solely by a prisoner.  If you have ever been in the back of a cruiser then you know that you cannot open the door without the policeman's assistance.  It is known as childproof doors and can actually be done with most domestic cars and some foreign cars.  Safety is a consideration but escaping prisoners is also, therefore, the emergency exit must be controlled by the authorities.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Yes they do. I have told you this at least 3 times.|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	I'm sure they do, but they could be "secured." Or maybe they're like regular emergency exits since the cons are cuffed and guarded. Whether they do or do not, I'll bet it's okay since there's probably a required number of guards on the bus. There are probably laws that specifically address this|`|4103214ae323fee3ba7c568366950e64aa	Yes they do.  They also have bars on the windows and a gate between the drivers and inmates.  Not only that, but some of the busses have a small cage, also near the front of the buss for a guard to be securely locked into with a special radio so he can call for assistance when needed.<br>  <br>  To insure that not only the guards (hacks or turnkeys as they are also called) are safe but the inmates are safe as well.  The inmates are shackled to special eyelets welded to the busses floor by a foot.  The way this works is, the inmate has a shackle called a bellyband that goes around their waist and is secured by a set of hand cuffs that cuffs the inmate to the bellyband by the wrists. <br>  <br>   In other words, the inmate’s hands are cuffed together and the chain from the cuffs goes thru the bellyband securing the inmates hands at his/her waist and they have almost no movement. There is also a long chain running from the bellyband to the inmates ankles where another set of cuffs are interlocked to the chain from the belly band to each ankle and then to the eyelets in the floor.<br>  <br>  From past incidents the leg iron that supports the inmate foot to the eyelet is secured by a single chain that is secured at the front of the bus.  In an emergency the chain can be quickly released and pulled thru the eyelets freeing the inmates legs from the floor of the buss.  Their mobility is still very confined and movement at best is extremely slow.|`|WfYfF8CLaa	Only on odd days of the week.|`|15nnW3aLaa	YES.|`|QI36SaLhaa	Yea of course they do but of course they wouldn't be able to be open by the prisoners especially if they are cuffed in both arms and legs most likely a guard would be the only one able to open it so good luck buddy on escaping =D|`|pYWCv8KCaa	Any state vehicle, regardless who it transports, has to adhere to Department of Transportation guidelines.

d9ECb7N8aa	I would choose the 700R4 over the TH350 99% of the time!<br>  <br>  The R4 is just like a 350 with an OD gear. The R4 has a bad rep because nobody keeps the TV cable adjusted correctly and they burn them up.<br>  <br>  Think about it, you get the R4. You can run a lower axle ratio (if you choose), so it will be a better towing rig because of the lower ratio. Then on top of that you have overdrive, gaining back the cruising speed that was lost because of the lower axle ratio. <br>  <br>  Make sure the TV cable is adjusted correctly, and you will wear a big smile. <br>  <br>  Newer model 700R4 had an electronic lockup torque converter. Do a search online, you can find electronic controllers than will automatically lock up the TC, or you can run an electric switch into the cab and manually lock it (remember to unlock when you stop or it will stall the motor like a manual trans truck). I would get the controller every time, but the manual switch could be very helpful while pulling the trailer in the hills (to cut down on heat buildup in the trans).<br>  <br>  The tail housing will need to be swapped to accept the transfer case, so it will need a 4wd tail housing. The cross member will need to be modified, but a little fabrication on the existing member will make it work just fine. <br>  <br>  No kit that I'm aware of, it is too easy of a swap.|`|0121d8647606cbb9b32d47930389737caa	the 700 will give you overdrive and be more fuel efficient. it will be fine to use for towing, but you will still have to drive it in 3rd gear when towing, so to save yourself the extra money of converting your set up to a overdrive 700, just stick with the 350.|`|0275b74f45cb3dfa49234fdf0217ff03aa	The 700r is junk, stick with the old TH350, those transmissions are bullet proof.

AXNkmdbKaa	I have cruiser alloys on my 08 Silverado.  20X10 with that offset.  Tires are 285/50R20.  They rub slightly at full turn and make a hell of a noise when they do but it is not bothering me.  The outside edge of the tire hits the rear of the inner wheel well which is plastic.  No offset or maybe 20X9 with 275/50R20 might have been a better choice but I am happy with mine as is.

The alternator must have at least 20% more amperage power than the entire vehicle and sound system combined for a cap to be of benefit which is ironically the same requirements for an amp to be efficient. A cap does it's best to keep the voltage at a certain level, but if the voltage changes so will the cap voltage. The cap just makes the change smoother. The diming light syndrome isn't a voltage issue but rather a current (amperage) drop. The voltage simply follows what the current does. A cap does not help this situation at all.

lc1Fm7zJaa	Model Year? Really need to know that...But generally speaking you can remove and clean the IAC valve rather easily.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Locate your throttle body, clean it. somewhere on the throttle body, there will be an idle air control valve. It has a wiring harness on it. Unscrew it from the v body, clean it with Gum-out spray, and re-install it. Use "Power Tune", if you can get it (Mercury boat stores have it). Locate your engine temperature sensor. Replace it with a Borg Warner unit. Go to a power wash, and clean the entire engine bay, especially the space between the radiator and the A/C condenser. To get things working even better, install a set of Bosch Platinum single oints, or Nippondenso Iridium spark plugs. These units are 50% more efficient than the factory plugs, and will increase power and MPG's. Good Luck!!|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	What?<br>  <br>  "the rpms will this a bitget really low "<br>  <br>  I would agree with you.  You've answered your own question.
cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	yes you can unplug it and your car will be fine, the only thing is you won't have overdrive and it will use more gas, actually the converter itself isn't bad it's the switch that the wires plug into that is bad, usually you can pull the tranny pan down and get to the switch to replace it.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you might be able to unhook it. if it is bad then your check engine light should be on. if you light is,nt on then change the gas filter, check for vacuum leaks and run a test on your fuel pump before unhooking it.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	You should first try to clean out your throttle body, idle air control valve, and PCV hose.

lc1Fm7zJaa	Well, first off, spark plugs, Gumout and motor oil or "smaller tires" will not, and cannot increase Horsepower and Torque!

Use only Mobil One or ELF oil.

XLXncQu9aa	Well, there is a difference in the cop telling or suggesting that you need to go to driving school and him actually ordering it.  Either way whether he ordered it or not you need to go back.  The purpose of driving school is to enhance your skills as a driver and to learn all there is to learn about driving in general.  Obviously you weren't paying attention during the courses or you were just careless when it came to your driving habits.  I would recommend that you go back.  You need to re-enforce what you learned and get what you missed.  If you were that careless with your driving that sends everyone a message that you either didn't learn, or you don't care, or both.  There are some instances when you will be ordered to go back to driving school if you have certain offenses like driving drunk.  However if this is your first ticket it does not mean you "have" to go back.  But it does mean you should.  Take the cops advice and go back because it will better help you to make decisions in the future.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Short and too the point...take the class !!!!!|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Don't listen to your friend, as it doesn't matter if it is your first ticket or not. To be speeding is bad enough, but to be talking on a cell phone compounds your problem - not paying attention to your driving.  You were driving 15mph over the limit, which is enough to give you points and raise your insurance rates.  By completing the driving school, you can avoid any points plus notification to your insurance company (with a copy of completion) will help not raise your rates.|`|gTWgbpNFaa	you need to inform your insurance company it makes your insurance invalid if you don't|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Just do what the cop tells you and learn from your first experience.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Listen to the cop. I'm sure he knows your local laws better than your friend.|`|tnVrODt3aa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points put on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|acn2YbtTaa	I would do the driving school to keep your ins rates down.

MEOjwPCNaa	"A little snug" is relative. They do need to fit closely in order to be safe: if you have a bad crash (heaven forbid) and your head bounces around inside the lid due to a bad fit, it won't do nearly as much to protect you.    "A little snug" is what I look for. The best way to test this: put the helmet on, strap it down comfortably, and have a friend/salesman grab the chin bar and gently rock the helmet up and down, side-to-side. The helmet should take your head with it as it moves; if the helmet moves significantly more than your head, it is definitely too loose.     As for a helmet being too tight, go with how you feel. And as noted above, it may feel ok in the shop or on short rides and become a real headache (literally) on longer rides. If you think it's too tight, it probably is. You reallllllly need to try them on, especially if it's an unfamiliar brand because they all fit differently! I buy Arai helmets because they fit my head shape better than any other brand I've tried. I would love to wear cheaper helmets, but I've never found one as comfortable. Your mileage will vary; go to a dealer with a good selection and try as many as you like.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	Ouch, bad idea.    It's really important that your helmet fits correctly.    The question now is whether you can get used to it and it settles in for you or not.  The padding may flatten a little and it end up fine....but then maybe not.    My husband bought a helmet a few years ago and he was sensible enough to get one from a shop and it appeared to fit fine.....a few days later though he found it was pressing into the back of his head some and starting to hurt.  It only showed up when he wore it for some time so it needed a long journey before we found out...short trips it was fine.    Luckily it fitted me perfectly.    You need to know if yours will be like that, if so...then send it back.    Or give it to your wife.|`|6e36b9837420adb6b906ae01a1e722d4aa	I'd return it,,,& get a better fit.  helmets dont "break in" & loosen up very much at all.    On many folks,,,helmet is looser in cold weather,,,and tighter in hot weather.  Sounds goofy but but the Fit does change a little seasonally.  It's not the Helment changing---it's the human head.    People tend to feel more secure with a Tight Fit,,so many helmets are fitted actually too snug.    A little looser fit,,like "1/4th ~1/8th size"---a LITTLE loose,,,is always more comfortable and is a proper fit.|`|25d1e53426ca36986391435a6e313b38aa	try returning directly to agv. consider arai.. they are considered the most comfortable helmets around.( i have one)

They are some what costly, but get the job done.   ABC  Wear House carries these speakers. A lot of certain speakers work.... and my friend Kailee is obsessed with butts :D
puHPA4v4aa	Pioneer, MTX or Alpine are really good but are pricey. If you are just using your stereo then go with Sony or Dual but go for the higher wattage ones. Hope this helps. My recommendation would Be PIONEER Premiers They produce good bass and all around mids lows and highs. Good speakers and can be found fairly cheap on ebay brand new.    For a Head Unit go With Pioneer or Alpine depending on what you need or want it can run 100-300 bucks best bet search around for that. If you want really good bass go with a Rockford Fosgate or alpine amp and you will want your subs to be or equivalent to what the amp produces (watt Wise) so if you get a 1000W amp get 2 500W subs. Pioneer is best bet for SUbs and can be found for about 60 bucks a piece. speakers will run about 65-80 for back and 45-60 for the front and the head unit like I said 100-300 and the amp will be around 150-200|`|iZypM5jtaa	hey nips pioneer is horribleee... mtx is OK? and alpine kicks total A$S    not only becasue i have them but i compared them to others. the alpine type r's will shake your town with the right wattage. and there head units are amazing.    there speakers are good to. but there subs are very good    you could get 1 alpine type r or even a type E and put good wattage and wires to it and itll sound really nice      sony xplods are good for there price. 100 bucks gets you a 12 inch sub|`|LJ5MykpVaa	For great speakers get either pioneer or alpine but if your getting subs get pioneer because they don't have tons of bass but have really good mid to high end response.MTX isn't that great.Pioneer or Alpine for headunit.Alpine has good subs but so do pioneer but i would recommend pioneer premier and to stay under 500 you should go with the premier.For amps  you should find something that is cea-2006 compliant.|`|LIJ6Ti4yaa	i think creative is better fore an arero

A rim is the thin piece of metal that goes around the wheel, and creates a lip to hold the tire on.  Unless you refer to your car as a "bumper".  3. Your car is going to look like  Hot Wheels car.

The radio went, the heat/ac contol unit went, one of the door window motors went. Also, the sunroof had a serious design flaw. After it would rain, water would sit on top of the sunroof instead of running off like the vast majority of cars. If you opened the sunroof after a rain storm, the water that sat on it would then pour into the car.     Other than the sunroof and the electrical problems, it was a decent car. It had a nice ride, decent power, and decent fuel economy for a car its size. It was by no means a sports car, but it was a good people mover.

The only way I would really upgrade that system is to put a 1.5 farad or ferret cap on there.  The cap basically is a bank for your battery/ alternator.  The alternator is putting power in the battery for everything in your car to run, the cap pulls or skims some off the top so the amp doesn't drain your battery to fast and keep your alternator running full tilt, which will burn one up fast.  The bigger the cap the more chance the alternator has to rest, and ergo the longer it should last.  I hope some one certified answering your question has helped more then a teenie bopper|`|gstBWswfaa	1st off the capacitor... completely unessecary.  and 2nd off  Rockfords subs suck they are cheap chinese makes that really dont power handle like they should  rockford does amps  right.... thats abt it.  God these answers are retarded   1 your L7's were in a shitty box because L7's are louder than Fi BL series as proven in DB competetions.  and burning your wires? any 2 gauge kit can handel that power no problem LMFAO  Oh and big kitty how will that cap put some power in his sound?  A capacitor is simply there to smooth out the voltage... it does not add power it smooths the transisition. if you dont have the power already... the capacitor isnt going to help at all.  It will not help him in any sense.      The thing is, people get confused in the real purpose of a cap. It is not used to cure or prevent dimming lights nor will it change the way the system sounds (both misconceptions).    To undertsand the purpose you need to understand how they work.    A cap does it's best to keep the voltage at a certain level, but if the voltage changes so will the cap voltage. The cap just makes the change smoother. The diming light syndrome isn't a voltage issue but rather a current (amperage) drop. The voltage simply follows what the current does. A cap does not help this situation at all. A cap doesn't provide more power nor does it try to correct it.    A cap is perfect for a noisy voltage line or if the car has fast, erratic voltage spikes/drops. This is why caps are used in AC to DC power supplies as they are used to smooth out the DC ripple for a more smooth DC output.    The ONLY cure for dimming lights is a more hefty amperage source, a bigger alternator or at the very least the Big 3 (for better current flow) - that is to replace (or add to) the power wire between the battery and alternator, the ground from the battery to the chassis and the ground strap from the engine/tranny to the chassis.    The REAL powerplant of the car is the alternator. The ONLY purpose of the battery is to start the car and run the accessories with the engine off, nothing else.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	a dual head unit|`|plZFYzlZaa	uhhhh...yeahhh.

RjUhISEIaa	For the amount you are looking to spend you are looking more than likely at a used boat.    Here are some of the things you'll want to ask of the owner and consider having done before finalizing the deal:    1. how many hours are on the engine?  2. is there a service log for the work done on her?  3. why are you selling? know this one sounds dumb but it'll give you a possible reason for bartering the price  4.ask the owner if there is anything wrong with her? If yes, have him/her point them out and note whether they are going to be fixed by him/her or you on the contract  5. TEST DRIVE THE BOAT. If you don't you could be asking for serious trouble  6. Look for rust on the engine. Some might be expected but a lot could spell trouble   7. Consider having a marine surveyor go over the boat before buying her. It'll be at your cost but well worth it if anything is determined to be a problem  8. Did I mention TEST DRIVE THE BOAT?  9. Trailer - in good working order? Make certain for there's nothing worse than towing the boat to the water and having the trailer die on you. Same holds true after being out all day.   10. Don't forget to TEST DRIVE THE BOAT!  11. TAKE A SAFE BOATING CLASS    Anyone else want to add to the 11 reasons given?|`|wG8Oaxhmaa	I totally agree with "boating in va" on the process of buying a boat but I do not believe that for $15,000 you can buy any of the brands you have mentioned even used. they are good brands and if well maintained even an older model would command a much higher price. If it's not well maintained you don't want it, it would cost to much to get it back in condition to use as a ski boat.   It would be better in this instance if they are available to rent one when you want one. No maintenance, Insurance (high speed boat people on end of rope lot of fun high risk), storage and trailering.  Better to rent or find a friend with a boat contribute for gas and other expenses until you either grow tired of skiing, he grow tired of skiing and you buy the boat from him, you'll know the history of the boat, or you have enough for a boat that won't be headaches and a major expense.|`|hvrZH2D8aa	I know of a dealer that has a few boats in your price range.  I stopped and asked what he had and he said there is a few rinkers and a really used ski boat on the lot that needs allot of work. The one that needs a lot of work you might be able to buy it and put the rest of your budget into working on it.  Go to www.freedommarinecenter.com and fill out the form he will contact you from there.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Never buy a new boat!  You lose 20% the instant they put it on your hitch.    You can always find a good, practically unused boat for that amount of money.  You might have to drive to get it, but the savings is substantial.    You should try for something other than a ski boat because they charge a premium for them.  Any boat 18' to 21' with a V-8 engine can easily do what a ski boat will do for the average user.    Unless you are pro, or going pro, get the regular open cockpit fun boat and save yourself a ton of money.  Used, you should be able to find a very nice boat a year or two old.|`|EDOI3Wnzaa	Rinker is not a ski boat!  There is a huge difference between a run about and a competition ski boat. The comp ski boat has a lot more torque which pulls up the skier easier and it tows better. The comp ski boat has a inboard with a direct or v drive. This makes all the difference in the world. I run about has a inboard out board. good for cruising, bad for skiing

TJMpKqFNaa	Sorry, but the shop ripped you off.  Don't feel bad though - they do it to (far too many) people all the time.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd trust the oil life monitor.  Changing oil every 3000 miles in a modern car for no reason is just a waste of oil and your money.  Modern engines and modern oil can safely go much farther than 3000 miles between changes - a fact that is clearly supported by your oil life monitor telling you that the oil had 60% of it's "life" remaining after 3000 miles of driving.  <br>  <br>  Next time I'd wait quite a bit longer before changing the oil and I'd also steer clear of the shop that convinced you to change your oil with 60% of its life remaining because they're just ripping you off.|`|wPtjtLycaa	You could have waited. Your car will tell you when it needs an oil change based on driving habits and mileage driven .|`|1SnI86BIaa	change every 5 k<br>  3k was 30 years ago,|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it should have been changed because heat is what breaks the oil down and after awhile it can,t lubricate the moving parts as good as it should.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The local oil change places like to advertise the "every 3 months, or 3,000 miles" stuff because it makes people change their oil more often.<br>  <br>  Technology of both the engines and the oil has advanced in leaps and bounds in the past 10 years or so. Most cars can go 5,000 miles, and I've even heard of some that only need an oil change every 15,000 miles when you use the right oil. <br>  <br>  If you use synthetic oil or partially synthetic oil, its perfectly safe to go about 5,000 between oil changes if you aren't driving in severe conditions.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	You could have waited. If you are smart enough to use a premium synthetic oil in whatever car this is, you only need to change it when it becomes dark or thick. Check it once or twice a year. All cars these days have extended oil change intervals. If you use synthetic, you can usually double the frequency. Good Luck!!|`|8HDQMkSBaa	you are ok.....most vehicles such as yours (GM) will indicate the oil change intervals...My Mercedes is around every 13,000 mile|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Both guys above me are right
C2vtv5OKaa	I would do whatever I could to stay away from the Chinese imports - I have owned two so far and both engines fried after about 3,000 miles.      Go for a brand name scooter, it may cost more now, but it will last much longer and it is much cheaper in the long run, I promise.    Here are some ones to look for: Vespas are still the best, Piaggio and Aprillia are very nice but expensive, Yamaha and Hondas are your best bet for price and quality, and if you have to go for a cheap import, I would recommend e-ton, they have proven to be the most reliable so far.    Check out eBay motors (in powersports) for some great deals - it is a great time to buy being the off-season.  Also try craigslist!

mR5ZtjqWaa	777, 747s, new 737s, and a number of other planes do not have tail de-ice/anti-ice systems.<br>  <br>  wind tunnel and flight testing proves that any ice formed there would break off before there is a problem. It just doesn't cause a problem.<br>  wing anti-ice is also not-that-often used.<br>  There is certainly a number of accidents attributed to tailplane icing, but mostly to small and private aircraft. I'm not sure about '47s either but no next gen 737 or 777 has ever crashed due to icing anywhere.<br>  here's an interesting article about wing, and tail ice on the embraer 170, which is smaller than 747/777 etc.<br>  <a href="http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/tech_ops/read.main/241347/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums...</a>|`|bgQP1Aquaa	this is no lift from the empionnage of a large jet.there is a different profile from the wings.i.e. its the same on opposite surfaces.<br>  these are control surfaces and i suppose the thinking is that its likely that any icing would be equal and therefore have little effect on the efficiency of them.|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	Simply put, it was not found to be necessary.|`|t1zlbOURaa	I wish I had the manual with me to check this. I would be surprised if there is no anti-ice system on the tail. <br>  <br>  That said, there are a couple of factors involved. Most large jets spend only small amounts of time in icing conditions. <br>  <br>  There's the four-thousand foot rule... if you change your altitude by four thousand feet you're almost certain to depart icing conditions. As transport category jets are easily able to climb and descend at 1500 fpm, that would require less than two minutes spent in icing conditions.<br>  <br>  The heat from the inboard engines probably would be effective at reducing tailplane icing on 747s.<br>  <br>  Rules for heavy aircraft are differen than for lighter aircraft for icing.<br>  <br>  You should also be aware that 747's have been flying for nearly 40 years, and there's no case of one of them crashing for any kind of icing event.

It will involve removing the box and........no just don`t bother!|`|vmNHuAKjaa	most after the trans pan is off you need to remove the trans filter and then you can see it, a steel clip holds it in place.but some will have 1 to 4 solenoids. hope it helps|`|2cbe1bba8389a009e6f7e731cb983e90aa	Shift solenoids are on the valve body behind trans pan and filter, there are atleast three and are easy to change but you have to know which one is bad also, if it is a shifting problem it may not be solenoids at all, could be wiring or even computer failure and some sensors on engine control shift

This is the round valve located just to the left (when facing the vehicle) of your a/c charge port on the front of the car.  It's round in shape and has two openings, a small opening for a vacuum line and a larger hose-sized opening.  Does your car also make a 'hooting' noise when the turbo kicks in?  If so, this is likely your culprit.  Here's a link: <a href="http://www.eeuroparts.com/Main/PartDetail.aspx?id=4441895A" rel="nofollow">http://www.eeuroparts.com/Main/PartDetai...</a><br>  <br>  This is a $40 repair and if it doesn't work, then you may be replacing your boost control valve (BPC valve) to correct the problem.  It's far more expensive, so I'd try the turbo bypass valve first!|`|c06049564b1c190f2370b97673d712afaa	turbos do not kick in

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It will take it's toll on the dog clutches - these are the small gears that the syncro assemblies engage - and continually pulling them apart when they are engaged or have a load on them will ultimately result in excessive wear and eventually no engagement.|`|0yZhygM1aa	yeah it is|`|AA10789216	It's not at all bad for the clutch, but very, very bad for the transmission.  You may break the mechanism that holds it in gear.  Then it will always pop out of that gear by itself.  Then you'll need to get the transmission rebuilt.  <br>  <br>  BTW, forcing it into gear without the clutch fully released will wear the synchronizers.  Too much of this will wear out the synchronizers.  Then the gears will always grind.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	It won't hurt anything if you only do this once in a while. You are just taxing the synchronizer gears a little. If the engine speed and the trans gear are matched, the shifter will "pop" out easily and will not do any harm. If it grinds, don't do it anymore!
AA12265870	Yes,G80 is for limited slip.Trouble is,an actual posi unit is no more.It is called "Limited Slip" for the reason that it limits the amount of spinning one tire before it locks the clutch pack to spin both wheels.Usually one of two things do or will happen.If in mud or snow,the one tire is already spinning and your not going anywhere,then the clutch pack locks up and the rear of the truck kicks sideways and you have to let off the throttle to keep it out of the ditch.Secondly,everytime this clutch pack locks up,thats hard on it and the rest of the drivetrain.Honestly,its a piss poor set up.Its going to lock up one too many times and its going to break.<br>  The mechanism that locks the unit works at a 100 rpm difference.Which means,the first tire to spin,has to turn more than 100 rpm faster than the other tire before it locks up the unit.Wouldn't you think 10 rpms is enough.<br>  Back in the day,everyone that said the word "POSI",knew what they had.The clutch packs were spring loaded and both wheels spun at the same speed unless enough force broke the clutches loose.Example would be to turn a corner,one wheel has to turn slower.The pressure difference broke loose the clutches so you could turn.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|8QMvsIfKaa	Jack it up and spin one wheel to see if they both turn forward, I have never personally done it but I guess if they turn the same way it has a posi. Or just get on something slick and see if when you gas it it leaves two tracks or one. If it has a posi it kicks in when one of the wheels spin to get traction.
PlQ4N2Hxaa	25-50k miles if you are not too hard on it.

Try checking for an oil sticker (my dad caught someone who'd rolled the mileage back that way).  If it appears legit, it may be reasonable.

It only has 9 HP and cannot go faster than 45MPH.<br>  <br>  Power came from a 236 cc (14.4 in3) 9.5 hp (7.1 kW) two cylinder two-stroke motorcycle engine. The engine was started by a combination generator-starter known as Dynastart. A manual gearbox provided four forward speeds and reverse. A chain drive connected the gearbox to a solid rear axle with a pair of closely-spaced 10-inch rear wheels. The first prototypes had one wheel at the rear but this made the car prone to roll-overs, so they placed two rear wheels 19 inches (480 mm) apart from each other. This narrow track eliminated the need for a differential. The front axle was a modified version of a Dubonnet independent front suspension. The Isetta took over 30 seconds to reach 30 mph (50 km/h) from rest. Top speed was only about 45 mph (75 km/h). The fuel tank held only 13 litres (3.5 gallons). However, the Isetta would get somewhere between 50 to 70 miles per gallon of gas depending on how it was driven.|`|AA10788612	Yugo. It was a real piece of crap sold back in the late 80's.

gstBWswfaa	kaezoo is wrong, it more than likely has a performance sound system where a small factory amplifier is wired in...  it makes your speakers sound better the only - is its very weak  no the amplifier would not be located in the headunit...  but if you were to replace you headunit you could get one with an preamp that supplies more power to your speakers than the factory amplifier|`|daw140ceaa	It probably does not have a stock amp.  It's not unusual, however, for the GM speaker to have a separate connection for the tweeter.  In this case, a tweeter connection with an in-line passive filter is split from the main rear speaker wiring.    When replacing the speakers, you should identify which two wires are connected to the stock woofer, and use those wires for your replacement speaker.  These wires should have the full audio range.  If you use the wires connected to the stock tweeter, your new speakers won't have any bass.  Don't try to use both sets of wires.    I've never seen a Cavalier with an upgrade sound system that uses a factory amplifier.    P.S.  I'm quite familiar with the type of factory amplifiers that Patrick is talking about.  I've just never seen them used in a Cavalier.    Many GM audio systems use four wires at each rear speaker.  Not all of them are factory-amplified systems.  Nor do all the factory amplified systems use four-wire rear speakers.

mwu6aJuyaa	An o2 sensor simply reads the content of oxygen in your exhaust gases. The idea is that it sends the information to the computer and the computer will adjust fuel to the engine to lean it out or make it richer depending on the o2 gas in the exhaust. The o2 sensor doesn't burn anything. it's just a sensor.  If you have alot of smoke or even residue from burning the antifreeze, it could muck up the o2 sensor.

Let me guess, you never showed up?    The reason, you did not show up, is that you needed to pay him a retainer for his services;;;;;;;and sign a contract.   When a lawyer files an answer to a complaint which you have, someone is suing you, they file (lawyer) that you have retained them  to represent you in this lawsuit.   With no contract, how can they represent you?   The lawyer has never met you, has no info on the suit to file his defense.   The fact that you left numerous messages means nothing;;;;;;;;;;  How is he going to defend you, unless he meets with you in person?  The fact is , that if you have to be in court in 4 days, means, you had at least 20 or more days notice of this hearing, but you choose to wait and call many lawyers and hope they will just show up?  There is a saying my husband said, that the worst thing is a lawyer not knowing where the court is and looking like a fool, which makes his client in a bad spot.  A lawyer can get the facts, info and tell you what your rights are.  Also, most lawyers will give you (1) free consulatation on your rights and you can decide if you need a lawyer or not.  Wake up, if you are being sued, contact a lawyer and show up for an appointment so they can determine if your suit is valid or not.|`|XgpuXjwtaa	If this is an auto claim, send the summons and complaint to your insurance company.  They will have their attorneys defend you.  The costs involved are included under the terms of your policy.      If the other party is suing you for damage which exceed your policy limits, you may need to retain personal counsel.|`|N28zLxtpaa	Look in the phone book for Legal Aid or free lawyer services.  Contact some government agencies if you are on a low income and cannot afford a lawyer.  If you make too much money you will not be eligible for legal aid.  I think it's around the poverty level.  Depending on where you live.|`|Um209a7raa	omg what did you do?  well hope all goes well for you  i'll pray for you kayla :D
mwu6aJuyaa	Pro's (assuming you do it right...which costs big money) You will get more power, prestige, more efficient power than going to a larger engine displacement.    Cons. Your engine wasn't built for it, so it's alot of extra wear on the parts. You have to upgrade Cam, exhaust, intake(obviously), computer, wires, entire fuel system, seals (to be able to take the pressure) and you should basically rebuild the engine with better pistons to take the higher temp and pressure. Your oil system will need to be upgraded to lub the turbo and you'll need to do oil changes much more frequently as turbos kill oil life. you'll need to let your car idol before turning it off to let the turbo cool off. If you do it wrong you can blow your engine apart and own a nice paper weight. You'll need to run high octane gas from now on as well. The cost of doing it right is incredible! the cost of doing it wrong is worse!    For the money, i would recoment that you just buy a car with a turbo, that way you know the engine is designed for a turbo.    P.S if your running alot of boost you would also need to upgrade your drivetrain in order to handel the extra power your making, otherwise your just going to burn up your clutch or tranny.|`|HTRR0NhJaa	dont wast your time doing it, get you a turboed car from FACTORY it is way too expensive to do a turbo on a car that didnt come with turbo and all you will be doint is killing the already dead enging|`|DXz9RCwPaa	first it is not a DSM.  a DSM the 1g and depending on who you ask 2g eclipses with the 4G63 engine, not the 420a.  the 420a is a chrysler engine not one built jointly between mitsubishi and chrysler.      pros.  not many, more power but will prob still get beat by a stock gst.    cons. worse gas milage, very unreliable, hard parts to source, not a very popular engine.  it is only front wheel drive.  weak transmissions.  several of the things mentioned in other post do NOT need to be upgrade but some do. i am not going to get into what parts you need you asked about pros cons.      in my opinion NOT worth it.  i would use it as a daily driver and buy something else to work on.
n7jXAQFWaa	Kudos to redundancy and saying the same thing two different ways in a row. Try Google Search. It's amazing what they do with computers these days.
DyEIc0K8aa	It would be in your best interest if you did pay it.|`|AA11914369	That depends.  If you don't, eventually there will be a warrant issued for your arrest, and they may also revoke your license.  The next time you're stopped, that comes up, you get a free trip to the county jail and I (or one of my friends) gets to tow and impound your car.  Then you get to pay the bail bondsman, the fine, and the towing company to get your car back.  So, if you want to help the economy for courts, bail bondsmen, and towing companies, ignore it, and thanks for the help.
NgIb1odlaa	You need to let it warm up before you rev it, if you dont it wont rev for one, and your oil will be too cold to flow well and you run a risk of wearing out your crank bearings, and piston rings faster. so give it about 5 or 10 mins of idle before you drive away.|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well:according to "Motor  Cycles  it is because that needs an tuneup  also very important thing with Cars & Transportation "  so please take your Sach to An certifide motorcycle mechanic
aIXeSThOaa	i dont know how much your aying but for a cheap system that will really pound id go alpine type R 12"s   http://cgi.ebay.com/2-ALPINE-SWR-1242D-1...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_xu8FrXj...  besides that kenwood is a good brand|`|XEUYgiU6aa	It all depends on what kind of car you have and how you plan on powering the subs. go to crutchfield.com and enter your car details and they are really good at letting you know if something will fit or not. and also it depends on if you want your system to hit hard beat down the block or just sound good.
xKEbJkfaaa	I recall that the dealer is not equipped to overhaul or even disassemble the manual turbo transmission. They can only remove and replace. It makes sense that the gaskets would not be available. I think there are some independent trans shops that can handle it.<br>  <br>  You don't say where the leak is, but a tiptronic with a pan gasket leak, I would make my own gasket.|`|5jinI2yhaa	Anything other than the pan gasket and there is a lot of work pulling the tranny apart. I would try and get a second opinion if possible.|`|soerAzoMaa	Tiptronic or stick?
10if4QTjaa	yea, they would, however i wouldnt recommend it, jimNys are lighter in weight and differently structured, therefore the guys @ suzuki put different wheels on them as supposed to the thicker ones we find on the grand vitara, never-the-less, if your planning on making a change u should get a away from the stock parts
