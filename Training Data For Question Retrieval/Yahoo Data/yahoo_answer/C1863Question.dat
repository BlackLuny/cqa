20090305102748AAVErbY	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	How do I add a second sata internal drive to my Dell Dimensions 8400?	Okay, so I've searched, and I've searched and have tried to set this up any way I could think, but I'm having problems getting my computer to recognize both of my internal hard drives!       I have a Dell Dimensions 8400 with 1 x 80 GB - Standard - Serial ATA-150 - 7200 rpm (what it originally came with), and I recently installed a 320GB WDC WD3200AAKS-00L9A0 ATA drive.      Problem is, I can't seem to get my computer to read both drives at the same time!!! My cable leading from the power supply has two connectors. I've tested them both and they are working fine.       I've tried the both of my "drive to motherboard" cables individually connecting each to either one of the hard drives to the master slot and they are also fine.       The hard drives are also working properly when I connect either to the master port.       What am I missing here!!!!!!!!      And in case this is important, I've also installed Vista on the new drive, using the entire drive for the partition, and used 15GB of the old drive to create an XP partition, leaving roughly 70 GB free.      Thanks to anyone who can help me solve this!!!!
20090305103637AAfoFh6	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Question about image DPI?	I drew some line art into Photoshop at 72 DPI. A friend asked if there was any way I could increase it to 300 DPI because "it would be easier to color a larger image." I managed to increase the resolution but the image appears to be the same size and quality. Will the difference be more obvious if she prints this out? Like, if she had printed the old 72 DPI, would it be more choppy and coarse than this new 300 DPI? I cannot think why else she would have had me do that.   Any info would be helpful. Sorry if this is difficult to understand.

20090305110809AAOc0A7	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	I have HDTV as computer monitor and the screen randomly blacks out, why?	I have a custom build PC, with a Nvidia GTX 9800+ graphics card and have recently purchased a Sharp Aquos LCD-42D64U and am using it as a computer monitor. I have it connected through a HDMI cable that is plugged into the back of my PC through a HDMI to DVI converter. Every thing works fine for a while and then seemingly randomly my screen goes blank. When this happens my TV becomes unresponsive. Any buttons I press, input volume channel power, nothing happens. If I unplug my computer from the TV it then becomes responsive again but as soon as I plug the computer back into the TV the same thing happens. If I leave everything off for about 10 minutes or so it works fine for a little while again. Sorry if this is kinda a run on, but any tips would be appreciated.       Specs on computer are:   Intel Quad Core Extreme 2.66Ghz   4 Gig ram at 1066Mhz   2x300G 10k rpm HDD   1xNvidia 9800 GTX+   Running windows 7, but have used Ubuntu, XP and Vista with the same issues.

20090227041821AA4jPR0	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help with this c program please?	1. Write a c program that will allow the user to input the following data using the keyboard, the names of three friends, the distance each lives from COSTAATT, and whether or not they drive a car to school. Print out a formatted list of this data.      Each name is a string of at most 12 characters, with no blank characters in the name.   The distance is an integer, no more than 3 digits, measured in kilometers.   The third data item is a string, either a Yes or No.      Example: For the data    James    23    Yes    Gordon    1    No    Poorna    129    Yes   The printed list would look exactly like:      Name           K  Drive   James          23  Yes   Gordon          1  No   Poorna        129  Yes      You will need to reference to the text to get the proper alignment of the output. In particular, find out how to print strings at the left of a fixed   number of positions.   Save the program as P1Lab2      I DID THIS PROGRAM IT RUNS BUT NOT GETTIGN THE OUTPUT AS REQUIRED....      #include    #include    int main ()   {   clrscr();   char name1[13],name2[13],name3[13];   char transpt1[4],transpt2[4],transpt3[4];   int dis1,dis2,dis3;   printf("Please enter first name\n");   scanf("%s",&name1);   printf("Please enter distance\n");   scanf("%d",&dis1);   printf("Individual drives to school?\n");   scanf("%s",&transpt1);   printf("Please enter second name\n");   scanf("%s",&name2);   printf("Please enter distance\n");   scanf("%d",&dis2);   printf("Individual drives to school?\n");   scanf("%s",&transpt2);   printf("Please enter third name\n");   scanf("%s",&name3);   printf("Please enter distance\n");   scanf("%d",&dis3);   printf("Individual drives to school?\n");   scanf("%s",&transpt3);      printf("Name\t\tK\tDrive\n");   printf("%s %12d %6s\n",name1,dis1,transpt1);   printf("%s %12d %6s\n",name2,dis2,transpt2);   printf("%s %12d %6s\n",name3,dis3,transpt3);      getch();   return 0;   }

Sometimes when  i'm either in a word document or an email in yahoo or outlook express , I finish what i'm writting then I go back to edit something in or correct a mistake , so I put the curser somewhere that I need it , hit the backspace to take out a word and then write a new one , but instead of it spacing out the rest of the text (moving it forward) it obsorbs the next few words deleteing them.  If I kept typeing  or hitting the space bar it would literaly keep deleting every word ahead of it ,   it's so weird it happens only sometimes , then I restart my computer and it stops doing that for awhile but then acts up again , hope i'm explaining it well , anyone have this happen or know what the cause may be?

20070905053426AA4itiJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	Collegamento Pc a monitor TV?	Ciao a tutti   volevo chiedervi un aiuto informatico.   Da qualche giorno provo a collegare il pc allo schermo del mio televisore con opzione PC come monitor.   Il pc sembra collegarsi perfettamente fino alla schermata di avvio di windows, ma poi una volta aperto W. (nella pagina dove inserire la password) sparisce l'immagine sullo schermo TV.      Qualcuno riesce a spiegarmi come devo fare per collegarmi correttamente?
20071202130337AArspUn	Computers & Internet;Security	Virus or not ? Please Help me !?	Voilà j'ai deux problèmes, j'utilise Firefox comme navigateur :     - Peu importe le site sur lequel je vais, et même avec la barre Google et la protection déjà présente de Firefox, j'ai énormément de pop up, même sur google.fr, où il n'y en a pas; j'en déduit que le problème viens de mon PC.    - Sur tous les sites où je vais, je ne vois pas le fond du site, pas de bannière flash, pas de couleur, sauf les images; tous les sites sont blancs et noirs. Je ne vois que les images, le texte et les boutons (et encore, ils sont blancs les boutons).      Je pense que ces deux problèmes sont liés, mais je ne sais pas d'où ils peuvent bien arriver, ni surtout comment les résoudre !   J'ai fait un scan au démarrage d'avast, il me met aucun virus, mais il me dit autre chose : "Erreur 42146 {Archive d′installeur est corrompu.} " pour plein de fichiers.      Aidez-moi, et je vous donnerai 10 points !!!      Mon PC est un Fujitsu Siemens Scaleo H.

But it is very slow and expensive also.  now i want to take BSNL broadband as it is cheap in comparison of all other.       But i don't have a land line connection of BSNL (bfone). i want to take a landline connection with incoming calls facility only.  for broadband purpose only.   As i have 3 mobiles i would not intend to use landline for outgoing calls.      if anybody have idea about such schemes of BSNL, please give your suggestions.
