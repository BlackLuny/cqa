A collections company called Luebke Baker and Associates bought the debt and is trying to collect on it. They are now reporting it as negative to his credit report also.. BUT instead of the old date of 2005 (when Chase charged off the debt) it is showing a new date, of 7/2008 for the account being opened. We didn't open an account with them, and this debt certainly shouldn't have a 2008 date attached to it. Is it legal for them to do that?   This company has already gotten into trouble for harassing, cursing at and threatening us. So we know they can't be trusted.

I bought a house in Phoenix, AZ in '06 with my now ex-husband using my VA loan. He is listed as a co-signer in the paperwork. When we divorced, he insisted on staying in the house, and I didn't put up a fight because at the time he was making more money than I was, and I just wanted out of there because I couldn't stand to live with him. I never signed a quitclaim deed or refinanced or anything (refinance is out of the question for either of us) but I did specify in the divorce papers that, along with a car and the furniture, the house was his. Now the tables have turned financially: He is unemployed and about two months away from not being able to make a payment, and I am making more than enough to take over the payments. Do I legally have the right to take over the house and force him to move out? If so, does that change if he later is able to make payments again?

I bought a house several years ago and before signing all the papers and completing the sale, the town (who is in charge of the water utilities) came out to the property and did a reading on the water meter. Everything was fine and paid up to date by the previous home-owners.       A year after the house was bought, the town comes out to read the water meter again and declares that the meter was broken, and the previous owners had a water debt of $5000+.      This debt was not included in the original sale and is not my debt. I have been paying for my bills but the town is getting very aggressive and threatening to shut off the water every other week. They said that the water is a lien on the property and that I am responsible for the debt. They have been adding interest and fees making the debt now over $7000. I have been paying my bills on my water usage but the town has just told me that I have not paid a single bill because they have been adding the payments to the oldest outstanding bill.

I dont know how i am going to pay for rent soon if i cant get a job, and i have no place to live. this is stressing me out so much that the past few nights i've been up till 2am crying.    What is wrong with me? why is it that morons can get a job but I cant?   Oh, and to make matters worse, my fiancee has a job that pays 14/hr working in a lab. he didnt even need any training or even to apply because his dad is friends with the boss. Couldnt get me in though because i dont qualify for a work study (basically that means i cant get a job there because my PARENTS  make too much money, though not enough to pay my rent each month not that i'd ask).    Why cant i get  hired?
20090203163035AAUWPqW	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I change jobs? Details follow!?	I currently work for magnificent hotel as a concierge but there is an administrative assistant position open at another property under the same brand. I'm finishing my BBA (one night class, 3 online classes) in Hospitality and Tourism. I want to enjoy my job and be able to live off what I'm making. I like admin positions, I'm just not into 9-5's in a back room with the same people everyday. But the pay security is enticing.   The concierge position is awesome. The pay is cool and the tips are great. Can't beat the "concierge" perks (restaurant invites, club invites, VIP treatment). I love the opportunity for growth and expansion (front desk, banquets, phone rep). Cons: Hours are cut drastically(or sent home early) when business slows. Can't count on steady pay. 12mi commute (not too bad).   The admin position offers a higher base pay, a set schedule, guaranteed 40hrs, and weekends off. It is also closer to home. However, no tip potential, no vip status at rest. and clubs. Can't have a weekday off without losing hours (sometimes I just need a personal business day with no crowds at the doctor/dentist, bank, mall, etc...)

I owe ￡1442 to Natwest, for an overdraft in 2007,they have been chasing me up,and are now taking it to court,they will stop court proceedings if i pay ￡346 in 48 hours,and then pay payments of ￡50pw,which I don't have.   I was also over-payed ￡490 housing benefit, and ￡496 tax-credits.   I don't know what the **** to do.   I get ￡117 maternity allowance a week and ￡20 child benefit.all this money goes on food and rent and bills ,which leaves me with about ￡5 spare a week.   Tax-credits said they will take a third of my maternity allowance(￡39) pw, to pay off the debt.Which no way can I afford.they said that's the government national rate,unless I can prove otherwise that I cant afford it.   Which I cant as I live with my partner.We split the bills 50/50, and he gets the same amount each week in wages.so he couldn't help with the money either.   I have a 11 week old baby, and am shitting myself,Any advise,please.

20090203162208AAxJ2TC	Business & Finance;Credit	Plz help: I'm thinking of calling my cc companies to inquire about possible payment restructuring. Advice?	Thanks for reading my post.      I have about $16,000 of credit card debt on four different cards with APRs ranging from about 9 to 14%. I am not working now but have a job overseas waiting for me starting in late March.       I've described my current situation previously at this forum, and several have recommended that I call my credit card companies directly and inquire about restructuring my monthly payments.  The truth is, I have been always made my payment on time and should be able to continue to do so but, of course, it would be nice to have lower monthly payments if the overall amount is not increased (in other words, if I could pay the amount owed over a longer period of time.)        Is this even possible with these companies?  If so I assume it would hurt my credit.  To what degree do you think such restructuring would hurt my credit?  How likely is it that they would do this (according to my credit report I have a very good credit score)?        If you think I might have success acquiring some assistance, how should I ask this question?  In other words, what should be my posture and strategy?  Should I just tell them the facts, the absolute truth, and ask for the best option they could give me?      Thanks for your help.

While many people might not agree with Obama's plan of construction of roads and bridges that we may never use just to create jobs. One thing is for sure.      Some companies and industries are going to make a lot of money with all these government contracts being handed out.      So I want invest my money in some of these publicly traded companies  and sectors that will be heavily involved in with Barack's plan. I figure companies that make concrete will do pretty good.      So what other companies and sectors out there will prosper? If you can give me specific examples of companies and their symbols that would be great.

I was duped into renting a place that is currently in the process of being foreclosed. I signed nothing at the request of the owner stating he did this with the last occupant. The next day after I give him the money and move in this guy appears. Says he is from the bank and needs to change the locks. So I call this kid and demand my money back. He ignores me for a while and then plays dumb.  Then admits that the house is behind funds he can not afford to pay. So I decide that if he is not going to give me back my money I will stay until I have enough to move out. With the current economy and being in sales I now have limited funds. I did not pay last month and have not yet this month. Now he is trying to tell me there is an offer on the place and to get out. Says he is going to bring me to court. What should I do?

He passed away last November and of course the rent was paid in full by the end of November.        I told the landlord that my father passed away immediately.  And I took all my father's things out from the garage.  And I told her that I might consider to rent the garage for myself, but it wasn't definite, no lease signed, nothing was decided.  Meanwhile, I was extremely busy and completely forgot about the garage. Well, I didn't need to rent it anyway.      Now it has been almost 3 months, suddenly the landlord asked me to pay for the past 3 months, $300! she sent a Collection letter saying she will bring this up to the court if I don't pay.       What?      I never had any contract with her except saying I MIGHT want to rent it later on!  And I don't have to pay for my father's lease!      Am I wrong here??

He contacted me frequently, but when i said i couldnt get the money he hung up on me and didnt call again.      All three of these "companys" were from different countrys.

He had been an employee of the school district for 9 years.     On February 10 of 2007 Dawkins was fired from his job. His principal, Kenneth Kane, claimed that Dawkins had violated the schools anti-racism policy in his classes, by separating the white and black boys during gym classes. According to Kane, he received complaints from students and parents about this practice, and had ordered Dawkins twice-in 2005 and 2006 to end it. And on October 20, 2006 Kane formally reprimanded Dawkins, in writing. Finally, after learning that Dawkins was continuing his “policy of segregation,” Kane fired him. The superintendent of the school district, and school board, supported Kane’s decision.    Dawkins insists that he did nothing wrong. He points out that the school district’s anti-racism policy, which “prohibits discriminatory or unfair treatment of any student based on race,” gave him the latitude to separate student based on ability, which is what he says he did. He admits that his class teams were, often times, all-black or all-white, but that this was done because of the students’ abilities, not because of race. He further argues that very few students or parents, ever complained about this practice, which had continued for nearly nine years.     Dawkins insists filed suit in Centralia Superior court, alleging unfair he was unfairly fired publicly humiliated, and made a public spectacle. He claims that his wife and two children, aged 15 & 16, have suffered embarrassment and harassment because of continuing debate, in the newspaper and throughout the town, over his firing. He asked that he be reinstated at the school, awarded back pay, and award $2 million in actual damages and $ 5 million in punitive damages.     The student parents and residents are deeply divided over Dawkins’ firing, and many are prepared to testify, either for Dawkins or for the school district.    The jury – citizens of Centralia will be asked to determine whether, in this case Dawkins was unlawfully fired from his job.

I wasn't able to make payments and it was eventually sent to a credit collection company. I worked with my collector for close to a year making monthly payments. I wanted to pay it off quickly and we agreed on a settlement amount, which was about 75% of the original balance. I paid this off in three monthly payments with automatic debit from my bank account. This was three years ago, since then my account information has been sold by Capitol One four or five times to different collection agencies. I fought this with the first three companies, calling them, mailing them, calling Capitol One, then faxing. It was constant and futile. Every time I called Capitol One I had to close my account AGAIN. And every time they assure me that my account has been paid off and I do not owe anything. I have disputed the charge on my credit report and I have the bank statements showing the deductions to the collection company. The calls and the letters do not stop coming. They are harassing me and I don't know how to make it stop. I have run out of ideas. Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I'm at the end of my rope.

For example, if my parents have a gold card, and i applied for the same gold card but was declined because I'm a student with no income. But with my parents they would be responsible for the balance.       I'm not trying to mooch of my rents, I just hate having to pay for car rental insurance, and with a gold card I wouldn't have to, which would save me some dough. I already have a regular credit card so I wouldn't use their card unless I have too. I currently do the same thing with my parents costco Amex card, but it isn't a gold card.
20090304183929AABrYCf	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Question about claiming property taxes on Tax return?	We bought our house in Feb 08, and we of course paid property taxes as part of our closing costs.  It is listed as a credit to the seller that we paid.       So, when I am doing my taxes, I include those taxes as well?  Even though I don't have a statement like I do the summer taxes?  Is the paperwork from closing enough documentation?      I have a form from our mortgage company, but it only includes taxes we paid from escrow-just the summer taxes, so it does have the ones we paid at closing either.  Thanks!       I'm in MI btw...not sure if that makes a difference.

20090304184120AAxvZKk	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Bankruptcy/foreclosure/reposse…	I work for a small business that is in serious financial trouble.  The owner has just about all the assets in his name and the company's name.  It is a corporation... if that makes any difference, I want to know as we deal with the issues, what if any, our options are.  The owner owns his home and our office building.  He is going to have to stop paying on one, if not both.  What do we face when that happens?  How long does foreclosure take?  The owner also has 2 vehicles that he has financed. He doesn't need both and wants to turn one in, or have it repossessed.   How long does that take and what kind of damage will he do to his credit report? Should he file for bankruptcy?  He still wants to have the same general contracting business.  He wants to do whatever he can to keep the company open.  Ideas, suggestions, info very appreciated.

I'm a full time college student. Had 3 jobs this year. 2 seasonal jobs and work-study. I made about 10,000 altogether. My tax refund was slated to be more then 500 which I could of course use but then I did the W2 for work study. I made more then 4,000 last year there. Tax withheld was 13 dollars but when I entered the W2 my refund went from upwards of 500 all the way down to about 130. Is this a mistake and should I take my taxes to get done somewhere else?

I live in Texas and was recently laid off due to drop in profits at a large offshore drilling company. I have been applying at different jobs, but I am getting "Are you bilingual (English/Spanish)" alot. I have completed 3 years of Spanish, but I was taught "proper" spanish...NOT the dialect spanish that is used in Mexico. So, I can't understand some of it and I refuse to pretend like I do. I just feel like I am at a dead end...what should I do? College classes only teach proper spanish and I don't have everyday conversations with those who speak spanish with a Mexican dialect to teach me. Anyone else having this problem? Any suggestions because I am getting passed on job offers for not being bilingual.

I used one the other day and for an easy example this is what they did:   Purchase: $100   After 20% discount:  $80   6% sales tax (on $80 purchase):  $4.80   My total (as I would have figured):  $84.80      But Lowes charged me 6% sales tax on the $100 dollars = $6.00   Total $86.00      Is it legal to charge sales tax on the extra $20 that I was discounted for my coupon?  I am spending about 8000 dollars at lowes and this makes a pretty big difference.
20090304190635AAng6nw	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	What would the purchasing power of the dollar be if it had never devaluated?	Supposedly the dollar has devauated by 96% since we abandoned the gold standard 94 years ago. Suppose we never abandoned it and were still currently using the gold stardard to control the value of the dollar... what would the purchasing power of a single dollar equate to? Now suppose on top of that that the banks never loaned more money than they had in reserve... about how much less would the price of goods and services be? In a system that upheld the gold standard and didn't loan our more money than they had in reserve would the interest tacked on to loans provided by the banks have any long term effects?... or would slowly overtime devalue the dollar?

But its just an excuse to throw a party xD   Everyone has to be 15 or older for this party.   And there will be screamo and rock bands preforming..   So what type of contracts would we need: we need one stating we arent held responsible for any injuries and one stating that if they are photographed or filmed we are not held responsible.      Because since all these bands are local bands they will want some pics from the event up on their pages. This event will have anywhere from 150-200 people...

I can admit, I had never really been aware of how badly my credit score affected my future ventures. I have many hospital bills on my report, and I feel overwhelmed because of it.  I also have a college bill (NOT a student loan) that I am paying $200 a month on.  I have a credit card that is in good standing.  Will using that card more often and paying it in full each month help raise my credit score even though I have many negative accounts?  And since my debt is around $5000 in hospital bills, what do you think is a good monthly payment in order to help raise my score?  And is it true paying past due accounts in full hurts your score?  Okay, sorry for so many questions...I am just very confused with all of this but very eager and ready to get this matter under control.  Thanks for any advice you can give! =)

I set up a seperate bank account for donations and ONLY donations.  I later gave away the money to different institutions, like a skate park that's being built, an acting group in the summer, a community development center, a seperate group from the hospital to support single mothers and cooking meals for their children and the school as bursaries.      My friends mom is doing my taxes on her computer.  However, they all ask, as donations or gifts, that these places give us their charity number.  None of them are official charities, but have all have given me receipt, several with "for income tax purposes"  How can I use them if I don't know where to put them!?!  It's just proving how I was right in doing things on my own, avoiding beaurocratic bullshit, and how its so hard to do a good thing!        So is there any way I can get something back from all this hard work?        Few details:        Canadian, raised over $3000, receipts for all, was not connected with work or employment in anyway.
