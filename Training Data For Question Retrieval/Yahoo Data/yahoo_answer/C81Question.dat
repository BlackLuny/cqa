20090505121401AAnyfMi	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	10 points people. Could I be in trouble?	My father in law served me with eviction papers because my husband filed for a divorce. Long story..he was butting in a fight my husband and I had about him going to school in another state and about him not resting. Anyway, so I was suppose to go to court on the eviction notice which I did on the date I was suppose to go but I found out that court was canceled but it was documented that I did show. I was told I would get a new court date via mail. It never came I am going to assume. And yesterday my husband and I were talking and he asked me how did court go..I said, "what court? I didn't have to go to court". He said I did because his dad and mom went. My husband thought I knew and he said he asked his dad when we had to go to court and his dad wouldn't tell him because he knew my husband and I still spoke. So I was a no show in court yesterday for a civil matter. He didn't ask for money he just asked for posession. Could that show that I had an eviction pending on my background check/credit report? Since he didn't ask for money I don't think it will be but I need an opinion. Also could the judge fine me or hold me in contempt for not showing? I am looking for my case number but I can't find it and the courts here won't gimme any info unless I have the case number. I am living place to place so stuff is getting misplaced. :( Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

20060711165832AAikKrq	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why do we (Americans) tend to blame others instead of ourselves for society issues?	We are so easy to blame others for everything that is wrong with society:      1.)  Overweight people blame fast food companies for "making" them fat.  Didn't all these people CHOOSE to eat this food?      2.)  Parents tend to blame violent video games, TV or culture/society in general whenever their kids misbehave and get into trouble at school or with the law.  Why don't parents take responsibility for their children and spend more time with them?        3.)  While it's true that schools are more under-funded than ever before, shouldn't parents take a more active role in their children's education, as opposed to blaming the school for record setting low scores at today's schools?  How many parents today make sure their kids get to school on time or have all their homework done each night?      Why do you think these things occur?            p.s.  If you're going to respond to this question, please have an opinion (one way or another) as opposed to simply "flaming" the question.  --Thank you.

I loaned "a friend" money, she paid for awhile (we have a signed contract), but then quit paying.  I need to add that I loaned it to her to secure her sick father a bed in a nursing home.  I did it for all the right reasons!  But I won't do it again.  Needless to say, we're not friends anymore.  Trying to sue her, but think she might have filed for bankruptcy or home is in foreclosure.  What do I do now?

20090227140258AArIwxL	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How much should my daughter be offered?	My 18 year old daughter was in a one car, roll over crash on Halloween. The girl that was driving is her college roommate and they are best friends. The roommate is fighting the C&I ticket she received as a result of the accident because she really believes (as do we) that the accident was just a freak accident that could not have been prevented.      My daughter had moderate injuries as did all four occupants of the car. Air bags saved their lives! They were all taken by ambulance to the hospital but they are all basically okay now.       My daughter hit her head and had to have stitches in the middle of her forehead. She had some severe bruises and aches and pains for a few days afterward and some anxiety when she got in a car again but she is basically fine now. She will have a small scar on her forehead that won't ever go away but it could have been so much worse and we are so thankful they all walked away.      So, we really don't want to hire a lawyer. Not only do we not want to sue the roommate, but we know the lawyer would get about half of any settlement she received from the roommates insurance company and we don't anticipate it being worth it to get a lawyer.       We are wondering what a fair settlement might be? We are in Missouri if that makes a difference. $1000? $5000? I really have no idea but my daughter's roommate  got a call earlier this week saying they will let my daughter know soon what they are going to offer her.      Thanks!

Around 4 months ago, we sold 120 locks to a motel in Winter Haven, FL. As we agreed, 33% payment before shipping, 33% CoD, another 33% will need to be paid after the installation. So we send our installers to the property and found out the property does not meet our installation requirements. So we offered him a full refund, travel expense for our installers as our lost. We have been waiting for the motel to return those locks for over 3 months now, they want to get a refund before shipping the locks back. And I think for any company before they give a refund they need to have their products back first. So now the owner of the property is neither willing to send the locks back to us nor pay the rest of the balance.

20070501154444AAFdduw	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Judgement case?	After 17 years my ex is taking me to court for 13,500 that was stated he receive upon sale of home. The home was never sold only refied .No attorneys were used and he signed a quit claim on the deed of trust.He's also requesting interest on the money,even though he never once mentioned this in the seventeen years since the divorce.  neither did he ever tell the children he felt he was entitled to any money.  I borrowed money from relatives in order to keep the home out of foreclosure in which case there would not have been any division of equity.  I insisted they place a lien on the property to ensure the repayment of said loan and felt that was why he would agree to sign off the deed to ensure his children would continue to have the benefit of childhood home.  Is ajudge likely to rule against me?  Should I now hire an attorney to protect my interest ?  Please help as I have little time to prepare my defense,  which is very hard to produce given the lenght of time that has elasped .

I stopped behind the truck and walked up to the woman. I introduced myself and asked the woamn for identification. I asked her what she was doing. She said she just met a guy in the bar and he didnt know where his keys were.

20090227140923AAPJXiL	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	What do you think of my speech?	I am addressing today a major issue among our beautiful nation’s people. There are those who believe so strongly in lessons they have learned that they deny the rights of others who have not had, or do not compromise to these lessons. The issue I am addressing today is the denial of gay rights.       Marriage is a ceremony to be shared. It is a binding of one loving soul to another, and any extremist who denies this has their eyes clouded by prejudiced, and darkened by ignorance. If they consider the unity of two lovers a sin, then they should consider this: In the Bible, it states that homosexuality is a sin. It also states that premarital sex is a sin. Would not God want a unification of anyone before sex, instead of someone committing both of these sins? Homosexuality is not a greater sin in the book of God. It is not one of the divine commandments, and has never been. Any man who interprets the word of God and considers himself a Christian is hypocritical, and falsely labeled. I talk to you today via a religious stand point to prove to you the open-mindedness that I hold, for I do not believe in a God. I am open minded enough to accept that many people are Christians, Muslims, Jews, Islam, Buddhists, and any other religion, and I will not try to convince them otherwise. They are entitled to their beliefs, just as I am entitled to mine. I will however correct them on their interpretation, for if they believe in the omniscient gods, why would they question them?       I also would like to address the fear that the young, and old people are going through just because of their sexual orientation. There are too many hate crimes in our great nation against the homosexual community, and it is scary. The gays, bisexuals, lesbians, and transvestites are afraid to come out and be proud of themselves, because of the hate in our great nation. I will not stand by idly and let the good people of our nation hide in fear in a nonexistent closet. I say I because I am proud. I am proud to be able to hold my head high, and be able to state that I am gay. I am proud to be able to say that I am myself, and I will do my best to help others develop their well-deserved pride. To quote Harvey Milk, “All men are created equal. No matter how hard you try, you can never erase those words.” We are created equal, and we will be treated equal. The sum of a man and woman is no greater than, or less than that of a man and a man, or a woman and a woman. We are equal. I, and all other members of this great society will one day be able to stand with their hand over their heart and say, “With liberty, and justice for all,” without feeling the blackness of a terrible lie slip between their lips. To quote Harvey Milk one more time, “you and you and you, you have to give people hope.” I have hope. I have a drive. This nation will be driven. Equality is finally being noticed.

Ashley Todd, 20-year-old college student from Texas, admitted Friday that the story was false, including the claim that the "B” stood for "Barack," said Maurita Bryant, the assistant chief of the police department’s investigations division.

It is not my fault that democratic congressmen did not oversee the mortgage industry and gave loans to low-income families who couldn't pay for them.  When my parent's didn't have enough money they rented an apartment and saved to buy one, they didn't buy one knowing they couldn't afford it.  I wasn't born priveledged but America allowed me to make something of myself.  I did not ask America for help but I used American values to better myself.  Maybe you should do so as well and not expect government handouts to pay your way through life.

20081105043758AAHFiYJ	Politics & Government;Elections	Why would america vote in barak?	ok so where does america gett off in voting a guy in whose middle name is hussein? his last name rhymes with osama and is a muslim.  i wouldnt be suprised if he sudenly tried to take over america.  ok but to the more important facts, he promises lowered taxes, (like all polititions) he promises to fix the war in iraq, and theres all this talk about fixing gas prices.  ok lets look at the facts, you cannot lower taxes to the average american and highten the rich persons taxes,  wanna know why THOSE RICH PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BUSINESS OWNERS IF YOU TAX THEM THEY HIGHTEN THEIR PRICES!!! DERRH.  ok secondly you cannot pull the troops out of iraq, if you do that the mr obama bin laden is going to spend money helping iraq.  he promises michiganders that he will bring them back their gm and other auto traders THOSE JOBS ARE GONE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON .  and you cant lower gas prices, somewhere along the line its going to bite you in the butt.  i was listining to the radio, a women was on saying she was so happy (in tears) that barak was voted in because she wouldnt have to fight for gas anymore.  umm no lady that wont happen, if barak tries to do all that, its gonna backfire <--- truth.  in general why would america do this if he was such a bad candidate,  o btw he ran a racist campaign,  if you dont agree look into it things likes this were said (he said he would help the african community <- uh what about whites???)  just think about how this is,,,, they say 15% of his voters voted for him because they did not want to be racist.  so please tell me if you agree and tell me why. and all BARAK OSAMA HUSSIEN BIN LADEN SUPPORTERS OUT THERE, PLEASE BUTT OUT

20081107011405AAHzeAl	Politics & Government;Elections	Did the Republicans play to lose deliberately?	Don't get me wrong - I'm very glad the Democrats won!  However, a few things puzzle me.  Didn't the GOP side have ANY likely candidate younger than McCain - his age was certainly a factor that counted against him.  Palin may have lobbied heavily for the VP role, but heavens - she's like a supermarket check-out chick, hardly someone to run the country.  Most women cringe at her ignorance.  Then there is the money the GOP team DIDN'T put in to the campaign.  Did they decide they really did not want government this time around and so played to ensure they'd lose?  I would not be at all surprised - they knew the chances of winning were extremely low, so why waste a valuable future candidate in a losing fight - save him/her for another day.  Why waste the money - save it for next time.  Palin was a terrible choice, how she the Govenor of a state astounds me, let alone be considered a possible president.

En este post en mi blog hay mas info:  http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-SsnmfMU8e...       Los pedorristas lloriquean que el incremento en el 5% de las gasolinas será el acabose del país como lo conocemos, sin embargo, ninguno de estos "valientes" defensores del pueblo ha abierto su boquita para hablar de la obligatoriedad de implementar un sistema tipo LoJack en los modelos 2008 en adelante.      Veamos los números,que siempre son proporcionales: en mi camionetota de rico maldito, pago 650 pesos de gasolina cada 10 dias. El 5% de la gasolina serán alrededor de 1,200 pesos al a?o.      El costo del LoJack para mi camionetota es de 11,000 pesos al a?o. Hembra-rd, siempre trabajando para los ricos (de LoJack en este caso) pondrá una medida que es 850% mas caro que la del gobierno federal. Y los costos son PRO-POR-CIO-NA-LES.

I understand what the electoral votes are and how is it calculated, but I don't feel that its fair. For one, if you didn't vote the same as the majority of the state you live in, then it doesn't count. And for the states with fewer electoral votes on the west side of the US, they don't even count. The presidency was decided before some states even had their polls closed. I just find it unfair and rediculus.

If you or a loved one needs a serious surgery, do you seek out the most inexperienced, incompetent doctor you can find?      This is exactly the approach the democrats/liberals are attempting this year for the election.  Obama has virtually zero experience to qualify him to be President of the United States of America.      I know a lot of people are just like:  "I don't care as long as it's not Bush".  Well, I can understand the frustration with Bush, however replacing one incompetent surgeon with another is just going to leave you saying "I don't care as long as it's not Obama" 4 years later.      I know people are going to attack me and claim that I'm a McCain supporter, but I really am not.  McCain is a liberal buffoon.  Unfortunately, the conservatives were so overpowered with their Mormonphobia/Baptistphobia, they saw fit to nominate McCain, a liberal.      Now all Americans are in the position where they must choose to elect an incompetent and experienced candidate (with many questionable past relationships and present comments and agendas) or an experienced, semi-competent buffoon with liberal tendencies.      I ask again:  If you or a loved one needs a serious surgery, do you seek out the most inexperienced, incompetent doctor?  America is already injured and does not need the incompetence that the left is trying to push.

20081015222957AAQJk8p	Politics & Government;Politics	Test your knowledge/10 points!?	What is an example of the restriction of the use of public funds in religious schools?    Paying parochial teachers' salaries.    Providing textbooks for students in parochial schools.    Providing computers for parochial schools.    Supplying lunches for parochial schools.    Supplementing bus and other transportation back and forth from parochial school and the students' homes       In Schenck v. United States (1919), Justice Holmes said that speech can be restricted when it:    provokes "a clear and present danger" to people.    is expressed on private property.    advocates the violent overthrow of the United States.    is spoken rather than non-verbal or symbolic.    is unpublished.          Obscenity is:    not included in the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.    protected by the First Amendment.    clearly defined as it pertains to freedom of press and speech.    a matter of federal standards rather than state or local standards.    always protected except when children are involved.          Time and time again, the Supreme Court has protected freedom of the press by:    striking down prior restraint.    relaxing due process procedures.    refusing to allow the subpoena of reporters.    ruling in favor of strict libel laws.    not allowing shield laws to be created          Which of the following has received the greatest amount of regulation by the federal government?    Commercial speech.    Symbolic speech.    Television news.    Newspapers.    School publications.          What does the Telecommunications Act of 1996 require?    That cable television scramble or block channels with sexually oriented material when children are likely to be viewing.    That cable channels require blocks on home sets so that children cannot see inappropriate material.    That federal free speech guarantees do not apply on private property or cable channels.    That obscenity on cable is subject to the same rules as if it were a general broadcast.    That stations are required to devote a percentage of their shows to children's programming and news.          Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination means that:    you cannot be forced to be a witness against yourself.    as a defendant you have a right to counsel.    you can be granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for your testimony.    you have a right to confront witnesses against you.    you have a right to see a search warrant.          Most cases are settled through:    plea bargaining.    judicial tribunals.    trial by jury.    pauper's petitions.    deliberation          The Constitution:    does not specify the size of a jury.    sets jury size at twelve.    sets jury size according to the type of crime.    sets jury size according to the type of court.    does not mention the idea of a jury trial at all.          The exclusionary rule, which was applied to state governments as well as the federal government in Mapp v. Ohio (1961), meant that:    unlawfully obtained evidence could not be used in court.    exceptions could be made for acting in "good faith."    probable cause must be established prior to arrest.    searches by police could not be made without a legal search warrant.    defendants must be read their rights before an arrest occurs.             The Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a right to a lawyer was extended to state courts by the Supreme Court case of:    Gideon v. Wainwright (1963).    Miranda v. Arizona (1966).    Mapp v. Ohio (1961).    Gregg v. Georgia (1976).    NAACP v. Alabama (1958).          In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the Supreme Court for the first time:    articulated the right to privacy.    guaranteed the right to life.    ruled in favor of abortion rights.    suggested the right to die.    called the death penalty "cruel and unusual punishment."             In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Supreme Court:    forbade state regulation of abortion during the first trimester.    permitted states to allow abortion in the second trimester only to protect a mother's health.    permitted states to forbid abortions in the third trimester.    forbade states to forbid abortions in the third trimester when the mother's life or health was in danger.    All of the above are correct.          Which of these was a ruling that successfully limited abortion rights?    Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989).    Sternberg v. Carhart (2000).    Griswold v. Connecticut (1965).    Roe v. Wade (1973).    All of the answers are examples of rulings which restricted abortion rights.

20080906075740AARixvZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	UK - Regarding Importing Japanese Samurai Swords (10 PTS!!!)?	I know that in April 2008 a law was passed which banned the import of Japanese samurai swords, but I heard there were a few exceptions:      1. Religious reasons   2. Theatrical, museum, re-enactment and traditional dance purposes   3. "hand forged" or "traditionally made" swords   4. antique swords made before the 2nd world war      The sword I want to buy from eBay is HAND FORGED and made out of high-quality carbon steel. Does this give me an exception, and the USA-based seller can ship me the item without problems?      I was thinking of calling Customs and having a long talk with them about exemptions to this rule just to make sure there wouldn't be any problems, but I'd rather not go through that whole process and hopefully someone here can answer my question.      Serious answers only please.

20081014171847AAlGVvN	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	What criminal acts happened to me?	1)The old quip was that a neoconservative was a liberal who had been mugged. Well, let me tell you about my night on Monday...      I was walking home from the underground station at about 10:30, on my usual route through a small park right across the street from the station. Five "yoots" were standing about 60 yards inside the park. I had just passed them, when one of them said, "What are you looking at foo?"      (An aside: Just what is it with these ghetto kids and being "looked at"? I mean, it's certainly not a "black thing" -- my two housemates from Ghana never freaked out when I looked at them, nor did any of my reggae bandmates over a decade, nor have I ever met any black professional who got the heebie-jeebies when glanced at. And the kids who grow up in the projects -- that's council flats, Brits -- seem to have the same desire that others avert their gaze as the black kids do.)      Well, I just hate the idea that all decent people need to move through life cowering from thugs, so I turned around and said, "Well, I was looking at you guys. But that's only because you're standing in the sidewalk, and I didn't want to run into you."      "Well, don't look at anyone when you go through this park."      "Look guys, I look at the tree there and that fence too -- it's not to dis them, but so I don't walk right into them."      Now, I can imagine that, after a minute or so of this, these chaps were thinking, "We're going to have to kick this  boy's *** or he's never going to shut up." But, in fact, I said good night, and turned to walk away, and it seemed they were going to let me go. But then I made what, in retrospect, I see was I made a terrible mistake. My cell phone buzzed, and I took it out of my pocket to see who was calling(it was my uncle and grandpa)      One thought must have crossed my friends' minds (such as they are) at that moment:   1) we can steal his cell phone      The next thing I knew, I felt a tremendous blow to my head. One of them had kicked me there! I fell over onto the grass, and both of them began kicking me as I lay there. I struggled to my feet, and was kicked in the head again.      Here, I must note some admiration for these yoots athleticism. It's not easy to kick someone in the head who is 5'10" and is standing. I imagine the British school system must have given them lots of training in football , to "keep them out of trouble."      Luckily for me, another train had just come into the station. No doubt worried that others would be passing through the park soon, the lads demanded my money, stole my cell phone, and took off running.      2) AN IPOD THIEF was nabbed shortly after he and a gang of young thugs pounced on a man jogging in Central Park and stole his popular music-playing device, police said.      The 14-year-old attacker was part of a gang of six to 10 young men who attacked Benjamin Kim as he listened to his iPod while jogging Thursday night in the northern section of the park, cops said.      Kim, 25, told investigators he had been running along the park's East Drive about 8:15 p.m. when he was approached by the group of teenagers near E. 108th St.      The teens stopped him in his tracks and began to taunt him, he said.      The harassment then turned violent as several members of the gang jumped him and started punching him in the face and chest, he told police.      One of the teens ripped the iPod's telltale white earphones from Kim's head and then the group fled, running through the park's heavily wooded northern edge to escape.      A witness followed one teen for several blocks and called the cops when the 14-year-old ducked into a storefront on upper Fifth Ave.      That teenager, who lives in Harlem, was arrested but his name was not released due to his age.      He was being questioned by detectives yesterday in the hope that he would identify his accomplices, a police source said. Charges were pending.      Kim suffered a black eye and several cuts in the attack. He gave cops a description of his attackers but refused medical assistance, officials said.      His iPod was not recovered, police said.      The trendy music players, which can cost several hundred dollars, have become a favorite target of muggers, particularly teenage thieves.      IPod thefts have skyrocketed in recent months and are believed to be a large reason behind a recent surge in subway crime - underground thefts were up nearly 20% through mid-March, according to police statistics.      IPodders also have been targeted above ground, typically at bus stops, police sources said.      "IPods are an easy target, whether you're on the train or, in this case, jogging through the park," said a police source.      "People should always be aware, but especially when they've got white headphones dangling from their ears."
20081015220710AAlh6XY	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Fail drug test, what happens?	I've been cited for having alcohol as a minor and my lawyer recommended me taking alcohol classes. I've signed up for the classes, but before I can start I have to take an assessment. I asked the guy what the "assessment" involved and he said it was a series of questions about alcohol and drugs.      So I assume I will be drug tested and will fail. What would happen after a positive drug test? I honestly have only smoked 3 times in my life, but 1 was recent. Is it likely that I will be required to take a drug class as well as my alcohol one or can it be forgiven? Will it be reported to the police or could it ruin my chances of getting my minor in possession of alcohol dismissed?      God, I screwed up so much in the past month...

20081024215601AAgonBA	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	How should I feel about my chances at this police department?	Earlier this year I applied to be a police officer at a department. Before the polygraph they asked if I ever knew anyone in a gang and I told them I knew people when I was younger that later joined a gang.  They also asked if I ever drove under the influence, and I told them how I had drove after having a glass of wine and a margarita for dinner one time but I wasn't drunk and was not over the legal limit, and that there was a similar occasion a year earlier. Also I told them that I tried marijuana 8-10 different times. They "pumped the brakes" on my application for all three of these reasons and the investigator said that since he thinks I would make a good cop that he would rather give me the option to withdraw my application instead of their department rejecting me. He had to talk me into letting them withdraw my application instead of rejecting; and he said a rejected application follows you like bad credit, and that if I were rejected they would have to disclose all information to other departments and if I withdrew then they wouldn't tell them anything.......      Now to my question      I am now in the hiring process with another department, and I told them that I withdrew my application from the other one because I had a lack of interest(but didn't go into further details), This department didn't ask if I ever knew anyone that was in a gang, but they asked if I ever drove intoxicated and I answered no because I thought driving under the influence and driving intoxicated is two different things.  I also told him that I have done marijuana 5 times.         When the investigator at this department called me, he told me that he went to mesquite and he knows that I knew gang members in my lifetime. He mentioned that he knew I drove after having a glass of wine and a margarita as late as july, and that I put that I smoked 8 times on the other application.       My response was that yea I did know gang members before they joined, and I drove after having glasses of wine but i was unaware that dui and dwi were two different things.  Also my marijuana usage I said 5 of those times I smoked it as if it was a cigarette and 3 times i just took a hit of it once.  He told me to write him an email responding to his questions and why there was different answers on the two applications.       How worried should I be about the application process. I never meant to deceive him, and the folks at the first department did give me the option to withdraw instead of rejecting me, but its true they didn't want to hire me for some answers that I gave them.  Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated

Io sottoscritto Giovanni Consoli vuole sottoporre alla vostra cortese attenzione la mia vicenda personale,che umanamente parlando,mi sta portando alla disperazione.Quello di cui voglio parlarvi è di una ingiustizia subita,che mi ha portato a scoprire sulla mia pelle di quanto sia malato questo nostro Paese italico,di quanto possa essere potente quella cortina oscura che riesce sempre a penalizzare la gente onesta,a favore di briganti che godono alte protezioni,forti del loro potere economico e di alte conoscenze nei posti giusti.Vengo all'antefatto della mia lunga e penosa odissea,che inizia nel settembre 2003,anno in cui fui licenziato senza alcuna giusta causa dalla ditta S.P.E.(attuale GESAM srl).A seguito di questo,presentai un ricorso al Tribunale del Lavoro di Roma,che presa visione dell'accaduto condannè la S.P.E. all'immediato reintegro del sottoscritto nonchè al relativo risarcimento del danno subito(questo accadde nel 2005).Quando sembrava tutto risolto a mio favore,mi accorsi che sarebbe continuato il mio caldario,in quanto la ditta S.P.E. aveva ceduto il ramo d'azienda alla subentrante GESAM SRL,cambiando ragione sociale,ma mantenendo gli stessi dipendenti della precedente gestione ,e di conseguenza disconoscendo il mio rientro.Ho provato a far valere i miei diritti presso il tribunale di Velletri,ma ormai sono passati 3 anni da allora riconosciuta sentenza delle mie ragioni e dei miei diritti,senza però nessun esito positivo.Attualmente ho presentato l'ennesimo esposto al Tribunale Civile del Lavoro di Roma,ma credo che di tempo ne passerà ancora tanto,senza che nessuno riesca a far valere i miei diritti.faccio presente che ho 51 anni,ho 2 figli,di conseguenza la mia disperazione cresce di giorno in giorno,in quanto non so più come mantenerli.Finora ho avuto aiuti da parte dei miei suoceri per poter sopravvivere,è un pò arrangiandomi con lavoretti saltuari.Trovo conforto,nonostante le mie condizioni,ad aiutare il prossimo con la Protezione Civile,in quanto volontario di un'associazione nel mio comune,perchè ancora credo in certi valori,benchè tradito da una giustizia che non sa far rispettare gli abusi.Mi auguro che questo mi possa servire almeno in parte a far conoscere certe situazioni,che a volte possono esplodere in veri drammi,ma forse l'attenzione pubblica mette a conoscenza dei media soltanto quando è troppo tardi ed io non vorrei arrivare a questo.   Con la preghiera che chiunque ha il potere di aiutarmi mi contatti su questo numero telefonico:3391112018. Oppure su msn:vanni-gio57@hotmail.it grazie

20081103213808AApj9tZ	Politics & Government;Government	County court decisions?	In march of 2007 I had a county court judgement against me for arrears on a car loan. I agreed to pay a certain amount each month to a solicitor who was acting as an agent for the car company.      I have just received a letter from the car company stating that they will no longer be using the solicitor as an agent and they have requested payment direct to them.      BAck in April of this year I asked the solicitor for a statement as they were not sending me receipts for my money. They stated at that point that i owed X amount of money. No payments have been missed and I have bank statements to back this up.      The problem I have is that the car company are now saying that I owe Y amount of money which is ￡2200 more than the X amount of money the solicitors ay I owe.      I have written to both parties asking for an explanation.       Either the solicitors have got it wrong with their figures if so can I go back to the court and make them pay the difference or the car company are trying a fast one again can I go back to the court to ask for a resolution in the matter.      After all the figure I m repaying each month was agreed through the court so surely the car company cannot add any extras on top.      Please if there is any one out there that has gone through similar circumstances or knows the law relating to this I would be grateful for any advice

20090307065645AASOWzD	Politics & Government;Politics	Would free market defense be preferable to government?	Assuming that we have a Revolution in the coming years and need to establish a new society, why not try out Anarcho-Capitalism, which is the form of society where everything is privatized, including defense services and other "public goods."  Many "right-wing" economists have advocated this type of society as preferable to the status quo, among them Murray Rothbard and David Friedman (the son of the great Milton Friedman).      Considering the inability to maintain limited government, wouldn't we be better off at least attempting anarchism?  Afterall, isn't the worst that can happen that we would end up with a return to the status quo after a failed experiment?  So isn't it true that we have everything to gain and nothing to lose (because we'd permanently be free of big government tyranny if we're successful)?      more information:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-cap...

I must admit that I have got quite a few laughs out of the crazed republican base here on YA...I've never come here as often as I have since Tuesday...but to hear you say you are bashing Obama because people bashed BUSH for the last 8 years?  You must be crazy if you think that argument holds any water.  A recent poll shows that Bush had a 20% approval rating.  A FOX poll shows him at 28%.  We have had a president for the last 8 years who ends his tenure with a 25% approval rating and the way he has been treated validates bashing Obama?  Apparently around half of our nations REPUBLICANS disapprove of Bush.  He is an idiot.  And that cannot be denied...Republicans themselves has been bashing the guy.  You guys are such sore losers.  It's honestly pathetic.      Obama will soon be sworn in as your president...and if you love your country as you should you should give him a chance.  Will you at least consider giving him a chance?

The librarian was BRIEFLY let go of her job by Palin but that was completely UNRELATED to the book censoring questions. Palin gave the librarian her job back later on.

As I'm going right now, my future isn't looking all that bright. Granted I have no problems what so ever, I just haven't the slightest idea of what I want to be or do with my life. But, since I was about 18, I've had a thought in the back of my head about joining the army/air force.       My questions are:       Since the only thing I can really see myself doing is the Special Forces, what exactly do I need to do? I went to Barnes and Noble today and looked at the ASVAB test and it said in order to get into the SF I need a General Tech score of 110? What exactly is the GT score? I understand there is the 18x candidacy? Is that a recommended choice if I want to bypass the regular requirements? Or should I do the regular requirements?       I've talked to my dad, who is in the Army Reserves, and he has said that the Air Forces would be a wise decision in today’s day and age. What does their SF's pertain to?      I guess, for me, I’m just a little lost in all the ways of the military. I’ve never completely thought about joining until a few days ago when my dad recommended it to me over a long talk of my future endeavors.       But, if any info about joining is available, please shed some light on it; especially the SF’s.      And, also, on a side note, I’m aware that one of the main aspects of getting through the training is one's mental capacity. I, for one, consider myself very strong willed. What exactly goes on during training? I.e. the whole part of training that is.      Thanks for the info.

We've known each other since December, and have become the best of friends. She was the only one who I could talk to about things that I would normally bottle up. We would even at times say how we both wish we could go to boot camp together, but we can't.(I'm 17, and she's 19)      I even had a dream last night that I was going to a normal day of PT and just broke down crying. It was like I was hysterically crying. When I woke up, I felt even more upset. I promised her I would call her today before she leaves, but I'm scared to because I don't want to cry and make her emotional again.       I've already started writing her a letter. I'm leaving out all of that "omg I wish I could see you again" and just giving her encouragement. I'm just so upset right now. And I know for a fact, if any of the recruiters at the office asked me if I was alright, I would be a mess. I know she'll be back, but I'm just so sad right now.       Also, I am going to call her, but what should I say to make her less nervous, even if its for a few minutes? I don't want her to be sad or scared before she goes because I really want to make sure she's strong before going.   She gave me the address to write her, so when should I send the letter?

Details A woman came in and complaint of a migraine. There wasn't anything unusual she just wanted something for pain and nausea. She had a Gentleman with her who she said was her boyfriend and that he brought to the hospital and was DRIVING her back home. I asked her twice if this man was driving and she said yes both times. So, I order a shot for pain (narcotic) and an anti nausea. When I came back to check on her she was sleeping and the gentleman told me that she would wake with a re bound and that she normally leaves with 4 Lortab. So, I gave them the Lortab with their discharge instructions. I looked at the chart and everything I did is what she normally gets. Well, on there way home they get into an accident. It turns out the boyfriend doesn't drive she was driving. I'm not sure of the details, all I know is that the police wanted blood work and it came back positive for opioid. I told the police that she was just here and I told them that she got the medication legally. Apparently, I should not have let her have the narcotic is what the police told me. That they are checking with the DA, but I could be facing charges. The cop told me this after he being told that patient records are confidential and I need a court order to show them. The woman also told the nurse that she wasn't driving. Do I have anything to worry about?

Now I'm going to move to a new apartment after this academic quarter and I want to narc on my roommate and bust him right before the end of the quarter. He smokes and sells weed btw.       1. A week before the narc, I move out all my belongings so I can narc & run easily.    2. Within this week, I'll wait until my roommate has another weed smoking session and when he does (he does it in the bathroom), I'll lock him in there using the heavy drawers to block the door so he doesn't escape.   3. I'll call the police and inform them that my roommate is in the middle of a weed smoking session and tell them to do a urine sample on my roommate (to provide one of the links of the weed to him).   4. I'll leave the apartment and never come back again.      So with this plan I'll establish 3 links that prove and connect my roommate to the weed:      - Him being in the middle of a weed smoking session is ample proof already.      - His urine test      - The smell of the weed      Give me some feedback on this plan please. I need to make this plan fool-proof so I can bust this lawbreaker. I'm doing society a favor by busting low-life drug dealers like him.      This question is not for weed smoking low-lives. Stop breaking the law and obey it like every other citizen.

20081114170416AAucKqW	Politics & Government;Military	Is my friend committing Fraudulent enlistment?	One of my friends is currently trying to get into the army. He has already spoken to some recruiters. He told me that when the recruiters Pre-qualified him, he lied about having taken adderall, having smoked Marijuana and having therapy. He also lied about not being allowed to contract into ROTC because of his apparant learning  disabilities. He is not taking any meds right now but he has only stopped taking them for a month. Also, he did not mention that he was thrown out of college earlier this year because of a violent myspace page. It's clear to me that he does have some bad learning challenges that he is covering up to gain enlistment. Has my friend already committed a felony by lying to the recruiter. Also, if my friend has his lie discovered at MEPS or in DEP, can he still be charged even if he doesn't gain enlistment.

Her mom then messaged me on facebook saying i hope you never ever come close to my daughter again and i said aright, and i hope you realize your a 45 yr old phsyco mother messaging me on facebook bye=] and it went on from that for about 3 more messages but i said nothing harrassing. then the daughter emailed me asking me why i said that to her mom and i said because she came at me and i didnt do anything wrong and i called her a snitch. a  couple days later i found out the girl was talking about me to a bunch of people so i simply told her to stop running her mouth. i don't remember saying anything that i'm going to hit her or anything threatening unless saying if i were you id stop running my mouth is threatening. i have court in 2 weeks and i don't know if i'm going to get into trouble? she also got a temporary order for me to stay away from her and her whole family which isn't a problem for me at all.       anyone have any idea? thankyou

20081116230616AAy9qHk	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can someone be arrested for willfully wanting to drop charges against someone?	This involves an incident which occurred between a friend of mine and his Mother. She called police claiming that her son had forged a check from her checking account in the amount of $420. Even though he had co-mingled his money which he made from selling his house($240,000!) with her through that same account for over two years. During which time she would give him signed checks to him for whatever bills he needed paid. After having him arrested, and seeing the trumped up charges that were actually filed against him(petty theft, receiving stolen property, embezzlement, and here's the real kicker....elder abuse!), she realized that she should have handled the situation differently! All those charges stemming from just ONE allegedly forged check! Which was out of his OWN money! She now feels, and was led to believe(by the arresting officer), that if she drops the charges, that SHE might be arrested. The only reason I can see why they would is for making alleged false statements? But wouldn't that require her son to file charges against her? Bottom line is that she wants to drop all the charges, but fears being arrested if she does. Any and ALL comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance to all!

20081119040438AA75TT9	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	She thought the guy who hit her was honest and would pay, but he did not.  Now what?	My girlfriend was involved in a car accident about a month ago.  Someone veered into her car while changing lanes on the highway.  This was her first car accident and she was very naive in the way she handled it.  She did not call the police because the guy said he would pay for all damages.  Following the advice of her also naive brother, she  did not report the accident to her insurance company because "he was going to pay".  She did take down his name, address, and insurance information, which turned out to be all true.  The estimate came to $3000 in damage.  After about a month of playing phone tag with this guy saying "I'll pay I'll call you back tomorrow, we'll meet up" he called yesterday saying "I'm not paying screw you".  I told her this was going to happen, and that he basically doesn't have to pay at all now legally.  It's my opinion that nothing can be proven.  Anything she could say he could also say.  There are no known witnesses.  What are her options?

20090307104828AAHDg34	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I be harassed like this illegally?	I would really appreciate if someone could give me some advice or positive feedback on my situation. I have a relative who I have not seen in approximately 3 years. We reside in different states and are only cousins. We do speak on occasions but are not close. The relative financed a vehicle through Chase and has missed some payments. I was never listed as a reference or relative in the agreement. My relative has never known any of my addresses Ive had and I only been in contact with the relative through other relatives that reside in their state. Ive not lived in that state since 1995 and my last visit to the state was around 2005 year. My husband and I bought our first home in 2007. Prior to that we were both military and stayed in military housing. I started getting phone calls in Dec 08 from Chase Auto Finance about the relativ's vehicle. I explained to them that I dont know the relative address other than the city and state. I do not have any contact information for the relative other than a cell phone giving to me by another relative of ours. I even gave them the cell number and asked them not to call me again. I thought it was over but I was so wrong. Over the next 3 months Ive continued getting calls atleast 3 times a day every single day up until yesterday. I must also state that during all of this Ive sent 3 certified letters to the address that the collections agent gave me stating not to contact me please. I will not ignore any calls from them because its my phone and I have nothing to hide. Yesterday a repo  man was sitting in my driveway blocking my garage. I asked him what he wanted and he at first was very rude. He said I had to give him the car. I said what car. He asked if I was the relative. I said no. I had neighbors outside as well because we going to bbq. I opened my garage for him because he said I had to legally, so I did and no car was in there. Ive never financed a vehicle before and dont know the law. He was very shocked that the vehicle wasnt actually there. Then he sad he was so sorry that I had being going through this and told me that he would personally call Chase about this matter. I asked the repo guy how they were getting my information and he stated that it looked like they were probably searching all of my cousin's relatives to find the vehicle. I received another phone call this morning at 8am from the same collections agent and once again asked her how did she get my information. She stated that a call was place from my home regarding the vehicle and they traced it. I said traced? and she said yes. I said that couldnt be true because I have my phone records and only 2 calls have been called to the Chase number and both calls were me calling back trying to explain this. She then stated it wasnt her problem and that they are going to keep calling me and coming to my house until the vehicle is found. Ive contacted the relative also through another relative and found out they had did this to 3 other family members in that state as well. Those relatives and me all shared the same last name at one point of time. How can I stop this? I dont have money in my budget for a lawyer at this time. Please help me someone because my husband and I are going crazy over this. Ive recorded all the calls since January and my husband and I have security cameras (for my child's safety) in the front of my home that recorded the entire incident.

20090307111425AAJmDfn	Politics & Government;Elections	Can a member of the U.S.Houseof Representatives be taken seriously as a candidate for either Pres or Vice Pres?	Senators have no executive experience, and they've been taken seriously.      Why not a U.S. Representative?
20090307111637AAF9pTj	Politics & Government;Politics	Do we need a new liberal grading system for schools?	I mean how is it fair that some students receive "A's" in school while others receive "C's" or worse?        It really shouldn't matter that generally the "A" students are smarter and/or work harder than the "C" students.        Heaven forbid that the "A" students were at home studying while their friends were out playing outside or playing video games.       I think its apparent that the "A" students must have done something dishonest or perhaps used the "C" students in order to get their "A's".      Only reasonable solution is for the "A" students give one letter grade to all the "C" students.  That way everyone will have "B's" and it will be fair, right?

20090307111259AAit6mv	Politics & Government;Elections	Why do  you blame Obama after 2 mths when the republicans knew we were sinking and did notta?	Bush created this hole we are in. It didnt come about in two months. Obama is trying to repair the damage. The stimulus package has HALF OF THE PORK AND COST OF THE STIMULUS PACKAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN OF THE PAST. So it makes no sense to blame him. Plus he wants healthcare for all instead of thousands dying without it. I do not understand the criticism at all at all.

He basically kicked me out of the house, and some of my things were left behind. He forbid me from coming on his property, and when I contacted him about my things, I was simply ignored. The other day I finally recieved an email response from his gf- stating that I wasn' to contact them anymore and that the had either given away or disposed of my things. My question is can and should I take him to court? or does he just get away with this?
