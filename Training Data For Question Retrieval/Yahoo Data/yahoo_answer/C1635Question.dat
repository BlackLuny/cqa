Ho 18 anni (ho frequentato le superiori ma senza conseguire l' esame di quinta, per dei problemi personali), ho un ottima conoscenza dell'inglese e lavoro nel campo delle assicurazioni. Sto mettendo da parte un bel gruzzoletto perchè ho sempre sognato di vivere negli Stati Uniti, ma adesso informandomi ho scoperto a malincuore che le restrizioni e quindi le difficoltà sono numerose.Ma non sono una tipa che si arrende facilmente, e vorrei tanto riuscire a trasferirmi lì.   Evitando le solite risposte scontate, qualcuno saprebbe dirmi se è possibile trovare un lavoro(anche come cameriera) dall'Italia(magari cercando lavoro online, so che esistono dei siti dove si possono fare richieste di lavoro) e quindi arrivati negli Stati Uniti poter lavorare?E' possibile lavorare negli Stati Uniti se pur con un semplice visto da turista?Insomma esiste un maledettissimo modo per trasferirsi li anche facendo un lavoro non molto appagante come la cameriera?Non mi importa di dover fare una vita modesta, per me sarebbe già meraviglioso realizzare il mio sogno. Vi prego se conoscete un modo, qualunque modo(legale) per vivere lì consigliatemelo. Conosco ogni dettaglio riguardo la greencard, ma mi risulta che sia un processo troppo lungo e oneroso, per cui consigliatemi altro vi pregooooo!!

20090307183145AAI1f8n	Travel;New Zealand;Auckland	CHEAP AIRFARE..NEWZEALAND(AUCKLAND) TO JAPAN?	Im planning on going to japan around May for 2-3weeks and I've looked up on the internet for the airfares and they were all between $1700-2200 new zealand dollars.I heard that May-June was suppose to be the cheapest months to buy ticket as it is the rain season in japan,and I also thought that airfares went down a lot since 1months ago due to less oil charges...My friends has purchased her ticket this month for only $1100 all included.(she has already left)   My partner said,maybe it is still too early to be looking at the cost now as prices always changes.   What do you think would be the best thing to do for me?   Should I wait untill May before purchasing the ticket?   And also,if you know a cheap way to fly to japan,please let me know!!   Many thanks:)

20090307223841AAX4Ce5	Travel;United States;Phoenix	Do you like Arizona     ?	I love Arizona. It's an awesome place. I'm really missing it right now. I went there when I was 13 in February 2006. My family drove through it, and took a plane ride over the Grand Canyon. I loved it. I want to go back. It's the greatest place ever. But my family is probably never going back, and I doubt I'll ever have enough money to go there. So I guess I'll never see Arizona again. I'm forever stranded in Massachusetts.

Is it a better deal to go through a site like Expedia and book the flights and cruise at the same time, or use the cruise ships own websites?      We're looking at one that leaves from Cape Canaveral, Fla.      TIA!

20081005131803AA7V741	Travel;United States;Los Angeles	Where should I live/work-LA (Pleasanton),LA (Irvine near Orange County),Boston(Cambridge),New York (Madison Av?	Hi All,      I have a job offer to work in US with the preference of the following cities/location:   1. Los Angeles (Pleasanton)   2. Los Angeles (Irivine, near orange county)   3. Boston (Cambridge) - heard the weather can be unpredictable   4. New York (Madison Ave)      I'd like to find out which one I should choose as I'm very open but would like to weigh the pros and cons about each location.       The easiest way to answer would be - If you were me, Where would you go and why?      To give you a quick guideline of Whys, For each location :   - Weather (incl ave temperature)   - Living cost (rough estimate for sharing with another person or 1 bedroom flat)   - Driving wise (can i get away with no car) and how disjointed each major facitilies (airport, shopping centre, theatres, etc) from the central downtown   - How safe it is?   - Quality of living (Food, multiculturalism, things to do, stereotypes e.g. Boston's huge in their sport i.e. red sox while New york has so many things to do and expensive)      Thanks in advanced... :) - I'm looking forward to experience living/working in USA!!

I wanna take bus and subway transportation in LA without a car day, night, and late night. I know they have nice weather in LA

20090308005344AAwtXxP	Travel;United States;New York City	I'm currently thinking about moving to NYC but need some advice?	Sorry if this is a little long but its really important and im going to try and paint a picture of my life right now. I'm 27 years old and I currently live in central NJ. All of my friends have moved to either brooklyn or NYC and im really the only one that is still here. Currently I'm unemployed but I got offered a GREAT deal in NYC (1400 a month for 70s and columbus area, really nice place) and I don't want it to pass by. I have a little money that would let me move comfortably for a couple months. I currently collect roughly 1700 dollars a month for unemployment. I just feel as though in the town I live in now there is NO OPPURTUNITY whatsoever and I can't look for a job in NYC while living here since im an hour and a half away from the city and its just a hassle. I feel that if I move to the city, I can find a job much easier and I can be able to network a lot more and meet new people which opens up new doors. Where I live now there is NOTHING going on and I'm just wasting away. I figured it out on paper and with all my bills and everything, if I took this place in the city, I would need clear 8-900 a week in order to live ok. I know most people will say get the job first before you move but its really hard when you live where I live and I just get lazy. I feel I would move my butt more and find a job quicker and be driven more and have more confidence if I had a place in the city. Anyone got any advice for me? This is really important and I don't want to lose out on this apartment offer and kick myself later. Moving to the city has ALWAYS been my dream and I would love to finally do it. What do you guys think? Should I move there and then look for a job? If I don't I could lose out on the place. Are there any jobs I could do there and collect unemployment at the same time? I'm just trying to get my life straightened out because its been a mess lately and I feel this would help a lot... 5 points to the best answer. Thanks so much!

But genuinely want to move to either USA and Canada. As its been my dream to live there since i was knee high.      I've been at Welsh & Latvian Premier league clubs. I've trialed at English & Scottish premier league clubs, and have genuine offers in Latvia, Finland and Egypt but don't want to move there.      My big dream move would be any of the leagues in USA & Canada (Semi pro & pro).      I am a goalkeeper but can play in defence.      I was wondering if any of you know any genuine agents that have contacts in USA and Canada. ( I am willing initially to show my ability to agents.)      As my previous experiences with agents went pear-shaped having signed for 'newly opened Millwall academy based in Madrid,' which turned out to be nothing but a 5th tier Spanish club looking to sell you on.      I am open to emails and private messages(For requests of Resume etc.)
