30e2f4e6cd266acd7c8c2fe390002d7caa	The answer you are looking for can be found in a book called "A History of Pi" by Petr Beckmann, a mathematician from Czechoslovakia.  Here's the passage:     In 1936, a tablet was excavated some 200 miles from Babylon.  Here one   should make the interjection that the Sumerians were first to make one of   man's greatest inventions, namely, writing; through written communication,   knowledge could be passed from one person to others, and from one   generation to the next and future ones.  They impressed their cuneiform   (wedge-shaped) script on soft clay tablets with a stylus, and the tablets  were then hardened in the sun.  The mentioned tablet, whose translation   was partially published only in 1950, is devoted to various geometrical   figures, and states that the ratio of the perimeter of a regular hexagon   to the circumference of the circumscribed circle equals a number which in   modern notation is given by 57/60 + 36/(60^2) (the Babylonians used the  sexagesimal system, i.e., their base was 60 rather than 10).      The Babylonians knew, of course, that the perimeter of a  hexagon is exactly equal to six times the radius of the circumscribed circle, in fact that was evidently the reason why they chose to divide the circle into 360 degrees (and we are still burdened with that figure to this day). The   tablet, therefore, gives ... Pi = 25/8 = 3.125.     So that's who gave us the 360 degrees in the circle.  See, assignment of degree-measure to angles is somewhat arbitrary.  Some choices are more natural than others, though, and when you're working in base 60, 6x60 is a pretty natural choice.|`|ce1189d9abf1feba5e2aae3b9fbfd663aa	Because if it was 240 degrees it would be a C|`|413e6dded62be6aa983c3ae23622bb44aa	Suzanne *'s answer is most likely correct.  For other perspectives, see:  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/sets...    There are other systems of measuring circles, like 400 gradients to a circle, or the radian system.  The good news is that 360 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 20, which makes it extremely easy to work with (at times) because it has so many factors.  It's easy to calculate the number of degrees in some useful sizes like 1/2 a circle, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6 etc.|`|e92e869e98edcf7e6af91bc36e193cc3aa	The same people who invented the wheel five or six thousand years ago (the Mesopotamians) also fancied the number sixty, basing their entire number system on it. No one seems to know exactly why--it might even have been related to trade: for commercial purposes, it's helpful to use a number that has many factors, and sixty has twelve of them, more than any other manageable number.... Whatever the reason, the Babylonians picked the system up and passed it on to the Egyptians, who used it to divide the circle into 360 degrees (6 x 60) and who also gave us the symbol for degrees. The Egyptians divided spheres into 360 degrees as well, assigning the first latitude and longitude lines to the earth. This ancient system for dividing the circle has persisted to the present. Each degree of the circle is divided into 60 minutes (60') and each minute into 60 seconds (60").

Maybe your template is GC-rich or has some secondary structure.  Is your template very long?If so make sure you let the polymerase is working at the elongating temperature for enough time (1min/kb)    If you are using plasmid template try not to use too much. Don't put more than 30-40ng DNA in a reaction.     Check your primers:  -can they form a dimer?  -can they anneal at more than one site on the template DNA with a only few mismatches?  -is the difference in the Tm of the two primers more than 6 C (it shouldn't;ideally they should be the same and I try not to exceed a difference of 4)?  -do your primers end in more than 3  c or g in a row?  -what's their Tm and GC content?Tm should not be very low (I design my primers at 56-61) and GC 40-60%.    The most strigent conditions are using as annealing temperature 2 C below the lowest Tm of the two primers. Try lower temperatures.    You can try different enzymes Taq, Pfu, Pwo, etc, even mixtures. Not all enzymes have the same processivity.    You can try different Mg+2 concentrations.    There are a lot of control experiments you can do depending on your template and primers. Eg if you have a library in a  plasmid that has sites for universal primers you can use one such primer and the other respective primer you designed in order to check if there is something wrong with the quality of your primers.     If everything is perfectly designed and you've tried evreything but still get a very faint (but of correct size) band, gel purify it and use it as a template for a new PCR. In this case you'll have a very high chance of getting mutations so you'll need to use a high fidelity enzyme like Pwo or Pfu turbo and of course sequence a lot till you get a correct clone.|`|AA12240505	It's spelled CPR, dummy.

If you still have no luck, take another look at your primers, watch for primer-dimer, and make sure that if you designed the primer off of other species that it is degenerate or highly conserved enough to bind to your species of interest.

Since Hummingbirds are so small, they have smaller wing span and also thinner wings than other birds. As a result since they have such speed in flapping their wings, it becomes easier for them to fly in all directions including backwards.Comparatively, larger birds have larger wing skeletons so they are unable to fly backwards. A small trivia for your interest : Even Dragonfly can fly backwards.

Time is involved in wave frequencies,  kinetic energy, space/time etc. Time may well be indeterminate at the nuclear level and at the horizon of a black hole.  Time at the limits is not explained by the standard model.  4 dimensions are hard to wrap your head around.

'Time' is a human creation to help with keeping track of when things happen- such as the summer or winter equinox...  'time' doesn't stop at light speed, only for the particles or photons moving at that speed- 'time' still goes on.  For example: if you travel at the speed of light for one light year, you would have aged only one year- but everything around you would have aged many more.  Cause and effect apply to everything.  I don't know where you got the idea that cause and effect don't apply to subatomic particles.  You can't predict where one particle goes to because it moves in a random fashion.  An electron in an atom can't be found in one place at a time because they move at the speed of light- no technology has been created to 'find' an electron in one place at a time yet- I feel it is only a few years away though.

8b0ca29e09f5244facb2a33f0dbf23b7aa	Everybody yawns — from unborn babies to the oldest great-grandparent. Animals do it, too. But why, exactly, do people and animals yawn? No one knows for sure. But there are many theories (ideas) about why people yawn. <br>  <br>  One is that when we are bored or tired, we just don't breathe as deeply as we usually do. As this theory goes, our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed. Therefore, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood.<br>  <br>  Yawning, then, would be an involuntary reflex (something we can't really control) to help us control our oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Sounds good, but other studies have shown that breathing more oxygen does not decrease yawning. Likewise, breathing more carbon dioxide does not increase yawning. Hmmm. Now what?<br>  <br>  Another theory is that yawning stretches the lungs and lung tissue. Stretching and yawning may be a way to flex muscles and joints, increase heart rate, and feel more awake.<br>  <br>  Other people believe that yawning is a protective reflex to redistribute the oil-like substance called surfactant (say: sur-fak-tunt) that helps keep lungs lubricated inside and keeps them from collapsing. So, if we didn't yawn, according to this theory, taking a deep breath would become harder and harder — and that would not be good!<br>  <br>  But there is one idea about yawning that everyone knows to be true. It seems contagious. If you yawn in class, you'll probably notice a few other people will start yawning, too. Even thinking about yawning can get you yawning. How many times have you yawned while reading this article? We hope not many!|`|451489c80e7c34b80a4410272e810cf5aa	its really just because we arent getting enough oxygen|`|guWvLQvgaa	Most people yawn when they are sleepy. And another theory of why people yawn is because when a person is sleepy, less oxygen is getting to the brain. So yawning is a way your body keeps itself awake by involuntarily giving your body more oxygen.|`|llZSgJQZaa	I read in a book once that yawning is a reaction our bodies do when we are tired to simply wake ourselves up but that there is no scientific reason for it. It also said that it is contagious because when humans went to battle if someone in the line was tired they would yawn. The people around them would also yawn: therefore the yawn would travel down the line and let everyone know that someone in the group was tired.

0bb3752ef2d29c29ce2dac726d49f14baa	Adding to Gervald's good answer, there are a couple crucial things that I think should be mentioned here. Most importantly, I'm going to tailor the answer to the (most likely) level of the asker.<br>  <br>  Question One:<br>  <br>  There are three bonds between the two nitrogen atoms. One sigma bond, bonded end-to-end between two p-orbitals:<br>  <br>  O N O ---- O N O<br>  <br>  and two pi bonds, bonded adjacently, one each between the two remaining p-orbitals:<br>  <br>  O ` , | ` , O ` , ` , ` ,<br>  N ` , ` , ` N ` , ` , x2<br>  O ` , | ` , O ` , ` , ` ,<br>  <br>  ** forgive the noisy drawing... I had to include the ` , ` , ` , as filler.<br>  <br>  Each bond contributes a certain amount of electron density to the space between the nitrogen atoms. Because there are three bonds (rare in nature) there is a very high electron density between the two Nitrogen atoms, and thus, a correspondingly high negative charge.<br>  <br>  Coulomb's law indicates that there is a great attraction between the highly negative center (I say "center" because, although it's technically attracted to the electrons no matter where they are, these electrons are only important for our discussion when they occur between the two N atoms, which is statistically most common), and protons of the N nuclei. It looks like this:<br>  <br>  N+  { - }  +N<br>  <br>  This attraction decreases the bond length, and increases the amount of energy required to break the bond (called the "bond enthalpy").<br>  <br>  Also, it should be noted that the entire nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond is non-polar, because neither nitrogen pulls *more* on the electrons than the other nitrogen.<br>  <br>  As far as the second question, I think Gervald answered it well enough!<br>  <br>  Happy Chem'ing :o)<br>  <br>  Romi Strub, University of Waterloo - 2A Nanotechnology Engineering|`|c30e2cd4342816ffab5be22eb14c292caa	N2 has the highest bond enthalpy of any bond, and this is responsible for the fact that we still, after millions of years, have 80% N2 in the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  AlF3 is best considered ionic, with a high melting point.

8367819719b33c265f8eaefe443cd0dfaa	I think Sean M got confused - Fish and reptiles do have backbones (and vertebrae, which make them vertebreates).   <br>  Reptiles, Fish and Invetebrates like insects and mollucks and worms etc are ectothermic or 'cold blooded'.  Being so allows them to save energy - generating heat is very costly, and endothermic ('warm blooded') animals must consume vast amounts of food often to maintain their temperatures.  Cold blooded creatures can attain much smaller sizes because they run less risk  of losing body heat, especially since they acquire and regulate their heat using their environment/habitat. <br>  Birds and Mammals utilise a warm blooded approach to exploit different niches.  it is more costly to be warm blooded, and is therefore not as common as being cold blooded.  Warm blooded vertebrates evolved from cold blooded ones, but it is unclear what driving forces were behind this.  At present, warm blooded vertebrates exploit energy rich or sustainable habitats, and can attain much larger sizes than ectotherms. Obviously, this was not always the case, as dinosaurs attained massive sizes and were ectothermic for most/all of their history.  However, with current climates and fluctuations, it is the endotherms that can sustain large sizes.  The largest animal on earth, the Blue Whale, is a warm-blooded mammal.|`|wLIxlsGNaa	that statement is not entirely true... not all vertebrates are warm blooded. for instance, reptiles and fish do not have backbones.<br>  <br>  the development of a backbone through evoultion came before the development of heat generation. here is how the evolutionary tree works there:<br>  <br>  -first life forms<br>    -invertebrates (cold blooded)<br>      -vertebrates (cold blooded)<br>        -vertebrates (warm blooded)

Ad esempio se partisse DA A per arrivare a Z ci obbligherebbe a passare per tutte Le lettere nell'ordine senza possibilità alcuna di variare. Questo è IL destino anche secondo gli antichi  Greci che un semplice starnuto lo vedevano come parte del loro destino. Personalmente preferisco credere nel fato, che  anche se parte  DA A per arrivare a Z  l'ordine e per quali lettere passare lo decido IO. Il famoso libero arbitrio. Fare una scelta determina una chiara volontà di ritenere quell'opzione giusta. Lasciarsi andare al proprio destino è una forma di disinteresse per Le proprie scelte e quindi per la propria vita. Il non voler essere coscienti di ciò che is fà MI sembra solo un modo per poter affermare la propria estraneità sulle conseguenze dell'accaduto.|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Dimentichi una piccola cosa : il principio di indeterminazione di Heisenberg.<br>  <br>  I soliti preti, che non qualifico,stanno infilando in teologia il principio di indeterminazione (fatti un giretto con un motore di ricerca).<br>  <br>  Comunque la tua impostazione sarebbe meccanicistica e il meccanicismo è stato dichiarato morto nel 1927 proprio da Heisenberg.<br>  <br>  Chiedi pure per e-mail !!!|`|bBAAriY6aa	Il destino della tua persona te lo fai tu stesso.|`|hLC0Zozvaa	certo potrebbe essere un'ipotesi... io ancora nn so cosa pensare riguardo al destino ma tornando al  discorso dell'universo, ho letto che l'universo si sta allargando e quando sarà arrivato alla sua espansione massima poi si restringerà fino ad esplodere in un secondo big bang... oppure preferisci big ben? hihihihi.... inoltre dicono che prima ancora del big bang che noi conosciamo ci fosse una civiltà evoluta quanto la nostra... sarebbe bello scoprirlo....|`|1UGJTAWRaa	Anche se questa affermazione potrebbe sembrare vera, sicuramente non lo è nei Big Bang successivi in quanto da una stessa situazione, seguendo le leggi del caos, ci possono essere diversi sviluppi (metti in una scatola alcune palline rosse ed alcune gialle in un ordine ben preciso, agita la scatola ed annota la nuova posizione.

AA10899505	FOREIGN CHEMISTS<br>  <br>  Emil Abderhalden - a Swiss biochemist and physiologist. He was born in Oberuzwil in the Canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland. Emil Abderhalden studied medicine at the University of Basel and received his doctorate in 1902. He then studied in the laboratory of Emil Fischer and worked at the University of Berlin. In 1911 he moved to the University of Halle and taught physiology in the medical school. From 1931 to 1950, he was president of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina. During World War I, he established a children's hospital and organized the removal of malnourished children to Switzerland. Subsequently, he resumed his research into physiological chemistry and began to study metabolism and food chemistry.<br>  <br>  Richard Abegg- a German chemist and pioneer of valence theory. Because of his research he proposed that the difference of the maximum positive and negative valence of an element tends to be eight. This has become to be called Abegg's rule. He was a gas balloon enthusiast and this is what caused his death at the age of 41 when he crashed in his balloon Schlesien.rom 1901, Abegg was active with an electrochemistry journal as editor.Abegg introduced the concept of the electro-affinity into chemistry and made the basis for the handbook of the inorganic chemistry (1905–1939). In 1904, Abegg formulated the valence rule, after which the highest positive and highest negative electro-valence of an element yields 8 altogether. This is called called Abegg's rule.<br>  <br>  Amedeo Avogadro-Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, Count of Quaregna and Cerreto (August 9, 1776–July 9, 1856) was an Italian savant chemist, most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight. As a tribute to him, the number of atoms of one mole of a substance, 6.02 \times 10 ^ {23} is known as Avogadro's number.<br>  <br>  Johannes Nicolaus Br?nsted- a Danish physical chemist. He received a degree in chemical engineering in 1899 and his Ph. D. in 1908 from the University of Copenhagen. He was immediately appointed professor of inorganic and physical chemistry at Copenhagen. In 1906 he published his first of many papers on electron affinity. In 1923 he introduced the protonic theory of acid-base reactions, simultaneously with the English chemist Thomas Martin Lowry. The same year, the electronic theory was proposed by Gilbert N. Lewis, but both theories are commonly used.He became known as an authority on catalysis by acids and bases. He has the Br?nsted catalysis equation named after him. He also came up with the highly used theory of the proton donor along with Lowry. Br?nsted theorised that as a hydrogen atom (always found in an acid) is ionized once dissolved in water, it loses its electron and becomes a proton donor. The hydroxide ion, which occurs when an alkali is formed when a substance is dissolved in water is called a proton receiver. This leads to a neutralization reaction where the ions combine creating hydrogen hydroxide, otherwise known as water. The pH scale may be interpreted as "power of hydrogen", and the definition is based on the work of Br?nsted and Lowry.<br>  <br>  Robert Bunsen-a German chemist. His laboratory assistant, Peter Desaga perfected the burner that was later named after Bunsen, which was originally invented by British chemist/physicist Michael Faraday. He also worked on emission spectroscopy of heated elements. Together, he and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered the elements cesium and rubidium. He is considered the founder of modern gasanalytical methods.<br>  <br>  Melvin Calvin-a chemist most famed for discovering the Calvin cycle (along with Andrew Benson), for which he was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He spent virtually all of his five-decade career at the University of California, Berkeley.<br>  <br>  Robert Boyle-n Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor, and early gentleman scientist, noted for his work in physics and chemistry. He is best known for the formulation of Boyle's law. Although his research and personal philosophy clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, he is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist. He is very famous in the science world for being the first scientist that kept accurate experiment logs. Among his works, The Sceptical Chymist is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry.<br>  <br>  Marie Curie-aka Madame Curie; November 7, 1867 – July 4, 1934) was a Polish-French physicist and chemist. She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the first twice-honored Nobel laureate (and still today the only laureate in two different sciences), and the first female professor at the Sorbonne.<br>  <br>  Henry Cavendish-a British scientist noted for his discovery of hydrogen or what he called "inflammable air". He described the density of inflammable air, which formed water on combustion, in a 1766 paper "On Factitious Airs". Antoine Lavoisier later reproduced Cavendish's experiment and gave the element its name.<br>  <br>  John Dalton-an English chemist and physicist, born at Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth in Cumbria. He is best known for his advocacy of the atomic theory and his research into colour blindness (sometimes referred to as Daltonism, in his honour).<br>  <br>  Around 1790 Dalton seems to have considered taking up law or medicine, but his projects were not met with encouragement from his relatives, and he remained at Kendal until, in the spring of 1793, moving to Manchester. Mainly through John Gough, a blind philosopher to whom he owed much of his scientific knowledge, Dalton was appointed teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at the Manchester Academy. He remained in that position until the college's relocation to York in 1803, when he became a public and private teacher of mathematics and chemistry.<br>  <br>  FILIPINO CHEMISTS<br>  <br>  Daniel Dingel- For more than three decades now, Daniel Dingel has been claiming that his car can run with water as fuel. An article from the Philippine Daily Inquirer said that Dingle built his engine as early as 1969. Dingel built a car reactor that uses electricity from a 12-volt car battery to split the ordinary tap water into hydrogen and oxygen components. The hydrogen can then be used to power the car engine. Dingel said that a number of foreign car companies have expressed interest in his invention. The officials of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) have dismissed Dingel's water-powered car as a hoax. In return, Dingel accused them of conspiring with oil producing countries. Dingel, however, was the not the only man on earth who is testing water as an alternative fuel. American inventors Rudolf Gunnerman and Stanley Meyer and the researchers of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory have been pursuing similar experiments.<br>  <br>  Dr. Abelardo Aguilar- A Filipino scientist reportedly discovered erythromycin in 1949. He was Dr. Abelardo Aguilar who died in 1993 without being recognized and rewarded for his discovery. Reports said Aguilar discovered the antibiotic from the Aspergillus species of fungi in 1949 and sent samples to Indiana-based pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly Co. The drug firm allegedly registered the propriety name Iloson for the antibiotic in honor of Iloilo province where Aguilar discovered it. In 1952, Eli Lilly Co. began the commercial distribution of Iloson, which was sold as an alternative to penicillin. Erythromycin, the generic name of Iloson, was reportedly the first successful macrolide antibiotic introduced in the US.<br>  <br>   Edgardo Vazquez- Edgardo Vazquez won a World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) gold medal in 1995 for developing a modular housing system. Such a system called Vazbuilt is reportedly capable of building within weeks a house with prefabricated materials that can withstand typhoons and earthquakes. Ironically, Vasquez is not getting enough support from the Philippine government to propagate his technology, which could help provide shelter to some five million Filipino families without their own homes. Vazquez is the national president of the Filipino Inventors Society.<br>  <br>  Rudy Lantano Sr.- In 1996, Rudy Lantano Sr., a scientist from the Philippine Department of Science and Technology (DOST), won the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) gold medal for developing Super Bunker Formula-L, a revolutionary fuel half-composed of water. The mix burns faster and emits pollutants, 95 percent less than those released to the air by traditional fuel products. The inventor said his invention is a result of blending new ingredients and additives with ordinary oil products through agitation and mixing, which is a very safe process. The initial plan was to commercially produce two million liters of Alco-Diesel, two million liters of Lan-Gas and an unlimited quantity of Super Bunker Formula-L each day for customers in Luzon.<br>  <br>   Dr. Virgilio Malang- Dr. Virgilio Malang won a gold medal for his invention "Psidium Guajava Effervescing Gynecological Insert", a silver medal for his "Patient Side-Turning Hospital Bed", and three bonze medals for his inventions "external vaginal cleanser", "light refracting earpick", and "broom's way of hanging" at the Seoul International Fair in held South Korea in December 2002. There were 385 inventions from 30 countries that joined the competitions.<br>  <br>  Ruperta David- Contrary to popular belief, there was no fish sauce or Patis yet during the Spanish occupation. Patis began to become a part of most Filipinos' diet only after the Japanese occupation. Here is an account of how an enterprising lady discovered the fermentation of Patis. Immediately after the war, the family of Ruperta David or Aling Tentay started a dried fish business. One day, Aling Tentay stored in jars some salted fish that turned into fragments even before they dried. While in jars, the fish fragments turned into a liquid substance that tasted like our Patis today. Thus the beginning of the thriving Patis business of Aling Tentay, which was officially registered in 1949 and is known today as Tentay Food and Sauces Inc.

Sie bleibt wohl auch noch einige Zeit unbeantwortet. Aber wir k?nnen die Frage wissenschftlich betrachten und behandeln:<br>  <br>  Um diesen Fall zu untersuchen wird gerne und oft die Green-Bank- Formel benutzt. Aus ihr ergibt sich die Zahl N der kommunikationsf?higen Zivilisationen wie folgt:<br>  <br>  N=R Sterne*F Plan*N ?ko*F entw*F intell*F tech*L Zivil<br>  <br>  mit:<br>  <br>  R Sterne = Entstehungsrate Sonnen?hnlicher Sterne 0,5 -15J<br>  F Plan = Sterne mit Planetensystem 0,1 - 0,3<br>  N ?ko = Anzahl der Planeten in der ?kosph?re 0,5 - 2<br>  F entw = davon mit entwickeltem Leben 0,01 - 0,5<br>  F intell = davon mit intelligentem Leben 0,01 - 0,1<br>  F techn = davon mit entwickelter Technik 0,01 -0,1<br>  L Zivil = Lebensdauer einer technischen Zivilisation 100 - 1 Mio. J.<br>  <br>  wobei die erste Zahl eine pessimistische und die zweite eine optimistische Zahl ist. Damit ein Stern eine ?kosph?re besitzt muss er ein gewisses Alter haben (>1 Mrd. Jahre) und andererseits hei? genug sein. Damit kommen nur Sterne zwischen 0,5 und 1,5 Sonnenmassen in Frage. Setzt man nun die Werte ein so erh?lt man als Optimist 45 000 kommunikationsf?hige Zivilisationen. Als Pessimist müsste man 400 000 gleichartige Galaxien aufsuchen um ein kom. f?hige Ziv. zu finden. <br>  <br>  War etwas theoretisch aber diese Betrachtungsweise ist durchaus in der Fachwelt der Physiker vertreten.<br>  <br>  Aus einer anderen Betrachtungsweise, die die Voraussetzungen für Leben einbezieht, also z. B. stabile Strahlung der Heimatsonne, stabile Umlaufbahn des Planeten, mindestalter des Systems usw. l?sst sich folgends berechnen:<br>  12% aller Strernensysteme besitzen einen Planeten der niederes Leben beherbergt.<br>  6% aller Systeme einen Planeten besitzen der h?heres Leben beherbergt.<br>  Die Wahrscheinlichkeit für intelligentes Leben ist verschwindent gering und bleibt an dieser Stelle unerw?hnt.<br>  Ich hoffe es hat ein wenig weitergeholfen. Diese Frage ist eigentlich nur sehr schwer wissenschaftlich zu beantworten und die Angaben resultieren rein aus theoretischen Annahemen. Aber sie liefern dennoch ein akzeptables Ergebnis, nach meiner Meinung. Es ist jedoch nicht damit zu rechnen, dass wir in den n?chsten Jahren auf auserirdisches Leben sto?en werden. Aber es besteht die M?glichkeit, dass wir einestages ein elektromagnetisches Signal einer entfernten Kultur aufschnappen und mit dieser über eine Zeitspanne von mehreren Jahrzehnten telefonieren k?nnten.

AA11803740	Reynolds makes a 4130 called Reynolds 525. It's a general all-purpose tube - less expensive than 853.  The 4130 is a code of the American Iron & Steel Institute and defines the approximate chemical composition of the steel.    The "41" denotes a low alloy steel containing nominally 1 percent chromium and 0.2 percent molybdenum (hence the nickname "chromoly"). The "30" denotes a carbon content of 0.30 percent. In addition, as normal constituents of plain carbon and low alloy steels, there will be around 0.2-0.5 percent silicon, 0.5-1.0 percent manganese, and well under 0.1 percent of each of a dozen or so other elements whose presence is unavoidable, in a few cases deliberate, and generally not harmful. The remaining 97-98 percent is iron (Fe).    There are many tens, perhaps hundreds, of different steels defined by that AISI 4-digit code system. The code does not specify any particular mechanical properties, only approximate chemical composition. For any particular grade (composition) (AISI number) of steel, the mechanical properties depend on what heat treatment has been applied, and what (if any) cold work has subsequently been done.     UTS: 48 - 58 Tsi, 100 - 130 Ksi,  700 - 900 MPa   4130 steel (AKA  Chromoly) - yield strength of about 75,000 psi .  FACTOR OF SAFETY: 2.7|`|c70c279348ae81164fc165dab4b5b6bcaa	Factor of safety depends entirely upon the nature of the loading. Generally, the factor of safety would be the strength of the steel divided by the in-service stress. It is up to the engineer to decide if ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, or fatigue limits are appropriate for the numerator, and it is often difficult to accurately determine the stress for the denominator, especially in cyclic or variable loading conditions.    A material does not have a "factor of safety" by itself. It is a function of the material properties, the design of the component, and the loading on the component.

t2LOcPkLaa	if you passed the first semester but not the second, then you only have to retake the second (at least that's how it is at my school). to get into a university, you can't have any F's or D's (even though D's are passing marks in high school, universities won't accept them). i'm not sure whether a university can see on your transcripts that you failed a course and then re-took it, i think it depends on your school policies.|`|DkYGl11naa	If you take it over and pass it with a good grade then it should not be a problem. Further in regard to the college if your GPA and entrance exam scores are good then repeating 1 course should not hurt you. However, if you have repeated several then it will reflect in your GPA and hurt you status in regard to applying to certain colleges (in particular the 4 years colleges). As well as some 2 yrs colleges. The biggest thing in my opinion it to repeat the course and obtain the best grade you can / passing of course. Then work your hardest to take and pass the course the first time with good grades and avoiding this type of pitfall from this point on. It is not about the mistake you make but the lesson you can learn from it to keep you from repeating it.

YIy9yu4qaa	I don't think either is true.   Individual faith can stand without proof or sight.   Likewise, sight does not necessarily make someone believe or become faithful to something.   Look at the chosen people led out of Egypt by Moses. They saw the miracles first hand, heck God picked up billions of gallons of water and moved it out of their way. Then, as soon as they start to settle down, and Moses climbs the mountain to talk to God in person, they make a golden cow and start worshiping it.   Its human nature. You can show someone something and prove it, but it doesn't mean they are going to believe it.     My conclusion, the seeing and believing are completely separate entities.|`|iUE6K5HQaa	I think that when talking about paranormal things, believing is seeing.  People generally would like to believe things like their dead relatives can come back or that we are not alone in this universe.  I think that what they experience is something else entirely, yet they explain it as paranormal.  As a magician, I know first hand how one everyday, completely natural movement/thing can appear as an act or use of paranormal powers.  Truth of the matter?  Nothing is paranormal.  Everything can be explained.|`|cHaRg3fkaa	You do not have to see to believe.  You can't see the wind but you know it exists as you feel it.  Same with God - you cannot see Him (if you did you would die as He is pure light and the brilliance/radiance would kill you) - but you can see Him in the beauty of all that He has created.  Intelligent design implies an intelligent creator.    Can go deeper with this.  You have 5 senses and you can use one or more of the other four, excluding in the case of the wind example, namely sight, to believe what you cannot see. So you feel the wind,   smell the food, hear the crash and thunder of waves pounding the shore, etc. without having to see.     There is a sixth sense, and that is the spirit of God in you.  It is ignited by your faith and faith fans the fire of the spirit into flames.  As that happens, your sense of God in everything around you, and belief in HIs power and love, will grow exponentially or even faster.    In physics it ihas been proven that we only see what we have experienced or want to experience.  It's like we don't allow what we have not experienced register in our brain.  If you open your spiritual eyes you will see things you would never have believed.|`|fb0OkczJaa	Believing is the hope or faith of unseen things|`|Ed8LtPLiaa	I think belief comes through understanding.. so in a way seeing is believing because only through understanding and reading theories, to see, how the universe began without a god in these theories backed by the sight of science is what I believe.|`|jg3bbxR8aa	it can be both- when you believe to see, you have hope. when you see to believe you may just be curious- if you believe in something without any theroys you have hope and faith in what may be. between the two, i would choose believing to see.|`|WxWLC9yDaa	I think seeing is believing. Even though I had read about paranormal things I did not believe it until I saw it.    Believing before you see leads to impressions.

zddIYf9vaa	The human eye is the organ which gives us the sense of sight, allowing us to observe and learn more about the surrounding world than we do with any of the other four senses.  We use our eyes in almost every activity we perform, whether reading, working, watching television, writing a letter, driving a car, and in countless other ways.  Most people probably would agree that sight is the sense they value more than all the rest.    The eye allows us to see and interpret the shapes, colors, and dimensions of objects in the world by processing the light they reflect or emit.  The eye is able to detect bright light or dim light, but it cannot sense objects when light is absent.|`|2LrB58M7aa	Eyes are things you see with. You are using them now.
n0pUrcotaa	Sorry, but what you want doesn't exist.    In your price range, the only telescopes you should be considering are Dobsonian telescopes.    They're Newtonian reflector telescopes on a very simple mount.  (they use mirrors)    It's easy and inexpensive to make a stable Dobsonian mount, and the Newtonian reflector gives the most bang for the buck.    Anything else in your price range is apt to be frustrating to use.  They'll be hard to aim, they'll vibrate in a gentle breeze or while you're trying to focus, and refractors in your price range don't gather much light, or focus all colors in the same place, so bright objects will have a purple halo around them.    Here's a 6" Dobsonian from a reputable dealer:    http://www.astronomics.com/main/product.... >    For about $50 less you could get a 4.5" one - but it's well worth the extra money to get a bigger mirror, because it'll gather 78% more light.    For about $400 you could get a 6" Dobsonian with an electronic system that will help you find things.  Here's a link:    http://www.astronomics.com/main/product.... >    They don't offer the 4.5" one with intelliscope.      Real telescopes aren't sold in discount stores, warehouse clubs, or at the Mall.      Few of us live near a real telescope store - so we end up buying on line, or driving a healthy distance to a store that specializes in telescopes.      I encourage you to look for a local astronomy club. Many of the members will own telescopes, and odds are incredible they'll be happy to have you share the views.  This will give you time to save more money, and you'll get a chance to see what you think of their telescopes so you can make a better decision about what you'll enjoy.|`|f1beDbKIaa	While $200 will buy you a functional telescope with a steady mount that fits in any car and is easy to set up, $300 will not buy a computerized one.    "Hooking a telescope to a laptop" could mean two things.  First, it might be so that the computer knows where the telescope is pointed, or so that the computer can tell the telescope where to go.  Second, it could be used to get image data from a camera.  In astrophotography, both are often done at the same time.  But astrophotography isn't something you get into with $300.  That hardly buys a camera.    My advice is to visit or join a local astronomy club. Most clubs have public events every month where you can look through their scopes for free.  With this you get someone who has found an object of interest for you in a reasonable telescope so that you can build your expectations properly.  Many clubs have loaner scopes for memebers.  I borrowed a series of scopes from my club for five years before purchasing one.  It was the right way to do it.    http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community...    I have a $700 telescope.  It has a computer.  The computer lets me find objects in the sky quickly.  There is a port that allows me to hook it up to a laptop, but all the laptop can do is find out where i'm pointing.  I haven't come up with a good use for this capability.  I have done some astrophotography.  But it's not very serious.  My scope doesn't track the sky, so i'm limited to short exposures.  That limits me to very bright objects.  I have a solar filter, so i've taken pictures of the Sun.  I've also taken pictures of the Moon, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.  Polaris doesn't move much, so i took an 8 second exposure at high magnification that shows Polaris B - a dim companion to the pole star.  That's getting close to what i can do.  Mostly i look through the eyepiece.|`|5al0K3N0aa	Yeah. I don't mean to sound boring, and a computerised telescope looks cool. But if you don't know how to properly use it and if you dont know how the sky moves and telescopes move then it may be an annoying waste of money.    Maybe you've already used telescopes so I don't know. Maybe if there are any astronomy clubs around where you are, you could go along and have a look. Many of the members will bring their telescopes and you can have alook at loads of different ones then.|`|bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	Almost all of the "electronic" telescopes in the price range you are specifying really aren't worth buying.

[Watch this space]|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	From your question, it's clear you don't know much about telescopes. I'd strongly recommend that you do some reading and research before spending any money, or you'll be sorry.

You'll get the greatest value for your money with a Newtonian reflector on a Dobsonian mount, such as these:  http://www.telescope.com/control/categor...  http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtin...    Buy from a store which specializes in telescopes and astronomy, either locally or online; don't buy from department stores, discount stores or eBay as mostly what they sell is junk. Find your local astronomy club and try out different telescopes at one of their star parties:  http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community...    A $300 computerized telescope will have all the money in the computer, but none in the optics. It may point your telescope at things in the sky, but won't show them to you in any detail. People have used telescopes for 400 years without electronics, so don't spend your money on frills.    Like others, I'm not sure what you intend by hooking a telescope up to a laptop. I'm a very experienced telescope user and a very experienced computer user, but I _never_ hook up my telescope to my computer. It's just too complicated.|`|phXFUgA2aa	teleprathy is best telescop
A0uqbBTiaa	Yes    "...it is chemically closely enough related to amphetamines that recent MDMA users will test positive in both amphetamines (a common test) and methamphetamines (a somewhat newer and less common test). Because of this, the detection periods for MDMA are very similar to those for amphetamines. Also, many tablets of street ecstasy are not pure MDMA and frequently includes amphetamines (and may also contain DXM, caffeine, MDA, MDE, ephedrine etc) which may trigger drug tests."

My guess....think of the US as a flat sheet of paper. You can drive from NY to LA along the surface, or 'bend' the surface so that LA and NY touch. Everything in between is still there, you have just taken a trip through another dimension. But so far, we can't access that dimension.

Like other elementary particles, the electron is subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, and exhibits both particle-like and wave-like properties. Formally, the quantum state of a particular electron is defined by its wavefunction, a complex-valued function of space and time. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a particular electron is both "nowhere at all" and "everywhere all at once" until an act of measurement causes it to be detected. The probability that the act of measurement will detect the electron at a particular point in space is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the wavefunction at that point.    Electrons are able to jump from one energy level to another by emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon. Because of the Pauli exclusion principle, no more than two electrons may exist in a given atomic orbital; therefore an electron may only leap to another orbital if there is a vacancy there.    Knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms helps us understand the structure of the periodic table of elements. The concept is also useful for describing the chemical bonds that hold molecules together. And in a macro sense this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.|`|AA11219424	It is the no of electrons in each shell of the atom (and in each sub shell of a shell of n atom).    example:  Electron config. for sodium i.e Na is:2,8,1 OR:      K (2)                   L(8)        M(1)  (1S-2)       (2S-2, 2P- 6)    (3S-1)
YjvTQntAaa	The hemoglobin of both humans and apes are made of proteins, or chains of amino acids. Theirs and our DNA serve as codes for the making of these amino acids chains, which then fold and combine to make proteins. DNA is a big, complex molecule. The DNA is often copied so that cells can divide, allowing an organism to grow, heal, and reproduce. Sometimes natural circumstances, like chemicals, radiation, or copying errors change the DNA. Sometimes this change gets passed down to offspring, it's random and without purpose. However, if the offspring can survive, or even survive better due to this random change, they will have further offspring with this change, called a mutation. Way back in history, human's and apes had a common ancestor. After our two species began to diverge from this ancestor, one or more mutations have occurred to at least one of our species so that our codes for our hemoglobin are not the same.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	A point mutation at some time in our past, ... or theirs.|`|qrB0QxN8aa	The difference in our genes makes us mutate (they might have said evolve but I believe they mean the same thing) more rapidly than apes.|`|ZadhXFkHaa	A mutation.|`|2LrB58M7aa	EVOLUTION DIDNT HAPPEN.

CYtMRC4eaa	The ductus arteriosus is a small connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery.  It's normal for a fetus to have it.  Since the lungs are not used during fetal life, it's not important that blood go to the lungs, so basically, the lungs are bypassed.  When a baby is born, the ductus normally closes off quickly, and the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation become separate.  The ductus degenerates into a small ligament.

4Qgmvpdhaa	MAGNETIC FIELDS deflect COSMIC rays, otherwise--galactic, solar, extragalactic, ultra high energy, and anamolous rays--would bombard us. An ATMOSPHERE on the other hand, blocks out ultraviolet, gamma and x-rays.    Geodynamos and superconducting magnetic rings can produce magnetic fields on Mars and other moons.  Rare earth magnets such as Samarium Cobalt, between 1 to 2 Tesla, can be imbedded 5' under a compressed dome to protect about 50 inhabitants from radiation. Elongated bar magnets strapped onto spacesuits can act as radiation "umbrellas" shielding us as we walk and work.    You'll need to have a Superconducting Magnet that meets these specifications: variable ramping up from 2 to 14 Tesla; quench recovery; ability to sustain a "persistent current" indefinitely; backup and failure protection; 24/7 monitoring system. On Earth, the magnetic field on the SURFACE is only 0.5 gauss, while near the core, it's approximately 100,000 gauss, or 10 Tesla. That's because magnetic flux varies as the Inverse CUBE of the distance, R. Use a magnetometer to measure the magnetic field.    An ATMOSPHERE can be grown simply by building bakeries, farms and restaurants on any moon or Mars. This is due to the fact that water vapor and CO2 are the 2 primary byproducts of COMBUSTION and Aerobic Respiration. In other words, the more we cook, eat and the more active we are, the more water vapor, CO2 and methane gas we add to a planet's atmosphere, 24/7. So pretty soon, it'll be raining and flooding on the moons and Mars. Methane is 25x more potent at warming an atmosphere than CO2.

1khVEE6oaa	The earth has gone through cycles of magnetic reversal long before the issue of man-made global warming was ever suggested.  There is evidence of these magnetic reversals recorded in the basalt of the ocean floor.  The earth has also concurrently gone through cycles of global warming and cooling.  They have not been linked to one another, and these natural climate changes are completely different than the Global Warming theory being pushed by the liberal media, Democrats, and Al Gore.    The evidence suggests that earth's temperatures have actually remained fairly constant for the past couple hundred years, but if anything, the earth's temperatures are actually cooling right now.    Magnetic reverals happen, but scientists haven't been able to link those with global climate change.  The most likely factor for the cycles of climate change is solar activity.|`|pRF5LLloaa	First, you have to believe that there IS global Warming.

But unless the earth gets smacked really hard by something really big and fast, like another small planet. it will keep on spinning pretty much the same as it has for a very long time.    Now, since the magnetic field does protect the earth from ions, perhaps there could be a bit of protection against heating that comes from the field, but the amount of energy protection provided by the field, and thus the change in energy that would happen if the field got weaker or stronger, is way less than the amount of energy that enters as light, so the effects are not very likely to matter.|`|RvEnbEJcaa	the more appropriate question is "are WE causing Global Warming?"    and that is "YES".

dvA6ISqLaa	You also have to consider how you are going to express the gene for this handy protein. You would need to clone it under the control of an easily inducible or constitutive promotor that would ensure high volume mRNA production. There are several plasmid vectors out there that allow for the production of recombinant proteins in this way.    You would also need to consider the fact that this sounds like a eukaryotic gene, and plasmids are usually cloned into bacteria, which are prokaryotes. The prokaryotic cellular machinery doesn't process eukaryotic genes well, since these usually include introns that need to be spliced out of the maturing mRNA molecule before translation can proceed. This problem can be overcome by cloning the gene in a form that already has the introns removed. This can be achieved by isolating the anti-aneurysm mRNA from the original organism and converting that to DNA. This process requires an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, also known as a reverse transcriptase. Once the complementary DNA (cDNA) has been synthesized, this can be cloned into your plasmid expression vector of choice. It should then be pretty straight-forward to simply transform a strain of bacteria with this recombinant plasmid, allow them to express your desired protein, and purify it.

Its the only moon of Neptune massive enough to be spherical, and has a radius of 1353 km.    In 1821, observations of the orbit of Uranus revealed its orbit to deviate from its expected position.  Astronomer Alexis Bouvard hypothesized an unknown planet was affecting Uranus.  In 1843, John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of a hypothesized eighth planet that would account for Uranus's motion.  And in 1845, Le Verrier developed his own calculations.  He urged astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the unknown planet  But the very evening that Le Verrier's letter was received on September 23, 1846, Neptune was discovered within 1 degree of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 12 degrees from Adams' prediction.     Gas giant simply means a big (giant) planet composed mostly of gas (as opposed to rock as in terrestrial or rocky planets).
4BqjVDxaaa	1. Increased slightly, you're basically converting energy from the stirring device into the kinetic energy of the water molecules through friction. (This experiment is very similar to one conducted by James Prescott Joule)    2. Heat is the flow of energy, not a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules (which is temperature).     3. Water needs to absorb more energy before it turns into it's gaseous form, this energy comes from the surrounding environment (the energy required is the latent heat of vaporization)    4. I'm not sure about this one but I'll take a stab at it. Water has a very high specific heat capacity, which means that it stores energy very well. The mist around the plants would basically keep the plants warm during the night. This is the same idea when it rains. If you've ever noticed, the air is a little warmer when it rains. This is because the energy stored in the water is released when it precipitates, which is the reverse process of  3.    5. The metal rod conducts the energy through vibrations of its molecules.    6.

oWbUA0UMaa	Respiratory surface could mean one or 2 things, it could simply meaning the mitochondria, which is the main respiratory machinery within a cell, or a respiratory system, which include the epidermis and stoma.     The epidermis is the outer multi-layered group of cells covering the leaf. It forms the boundary separating the plant's inner cells from the external world. The epidermis serves several functions: protection against water loss, regulation of gas exchange, secretion of metabolic compounds, and (in some species) absorption of water. Most leaves show dorsoventral anatomy: the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions.    The epidermis is usually transparent (epidermal cells lack chloroplasts) and coated on the outer side with a waxy cuticle that prevents water loss. The cuticle is in some cases thinner on the lower epidermis than on the upper epidermis, and is thicker on leaves from dry climates as compared with those from wet climates.    The epidermis tissue includes several differentiated cell types: epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (trichomes). The epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized. These are typically more elongated in the leaves of monocots than in those of dicots.    The epidermis is covered with pores called stomata, part of a stoma complex consisting of a pore surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing guard cells, and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts. The stoma complex regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. Typically, the stomata are more numerous over the abaxial (lower) epidermis than the adaxial (upper) epidermis.    Hope that helps! :)

In this particular problem, the key to getting the right answer, unless you have unusually strong powers of visualization, is to actually look at two books on a shelf and think about exactly where the worm would start and finish.

Hay alrededor de 200 volcanes post-glaciares, de los cuales al menos 30 han hecho erupcin desde que el pas fue establecido en el siglo IX d.C. En promedio una erupcin tiene lugar cada cinco a?os.    El ms famoso volcn islands es el Hekla conocido en el mundo cristiano de la Edad Media como la morada de los condenados. Desde su primer erupcin registrada en 1104, la que destruy vastas reas, incluyendo el poblado de Tjrsrdalur, Hekla ha entrado en erupcin 17 veces causando gran da?o en la campi?a circundante. Al comienzo de su erupcin en marzo de 1947 la columna de fuego y cenizas ascendi a 30.000 m y hubo nuevas erupciones en 1980 y 1981.    La ms reciente y dramtica erupcin tuvo lugar durante la noche del 23 de enero de 1973 en la nica isla habitada del grupo Westman, Heimaey. El toral de la poblacin de unas 5.300 personas fue evacuada hacia el continente en cuestin de horas sin ningn accidente, en una asombrosa operacin. La erupcin dur hasta mayo y la mitad de la ciudad fue sepultada por la lava mientras que el resto era cubierto por espesas capas de cenizas. El puerto y la ms importante planta procesadora de pescado fueron salvadas por cientficos islandeses quienes, audazmente, recurrieron al uso de aguas del mar para enfriar la lava en movimiento logrando luego detenerla.    La ltima erupcin submarina, cerca de las islas Westman, comenz visiblemente el 14 de noviembre de 1963, formando tres islas; una de las cuales ha resistido el paso el tiempo y fue denominada Surtsey con una superficie de casi 4 km2.

ifNr13kfaa	A black hole a singularity.  When a start dies it can turn into 3 different types of residual stars.  White dwarfs, black stars, or neutron stars.    For a star to actually turn into a black whole, means that it has to be a Type 3 to Type 1a based off of Yerkes Luminosity classes.  Meaning the star will be roughly 3 times the size of our sun or larger.  When it dies it will die slowly and become a white dwarf until eventually the core becomes too dense and the gravitational force eventually becomes so powerful that it becomes stronger then the electron repulsion in the individual atoms.  At this point it devours itself and turns into the theoretical size of a single atom with the equivalent weight and gravitation force of the matter it devoured.    The reason it's called a black hole, is because it's gravitational pull is so great that no light can escape it.  The reason we know they are there, is because they give off x-ray radiation.|`|NbD5L7BZaa	It is when a star, greater than the size of the sun, dies.

We actually have one in the center of our galaxy. Pretty trippy huh?

eUgwHzeqaa	MRI doesn't detect nerve damage, per se.  What MRI is very good at detecting is the difference in density of different tissues.  You have to interpret the image to understand what you're looking at.  Scar tissue looks different from the normal tissue surrounding it, and damaged nerves can look different too, depending on what the reason is for the damage and how long it's been since the injury occurred.    MRI is often used to look at nerves and at the brain, and if you have scar tissue or damage at S1-4 then the radiologist should be able to see something on MRI there.  But even without an MRI, a neurologist should be able to give you a pretty good idea where your problem is originating from just from your symptoms.    I don't know what your medical situation is, but if someone is suggesting MRI they may be trying to work out possible treatment for you?

vSkqJ813aa	Within Newtonian mechanics, gravity is described by a central conservative force field of the form: -    F = -dV/dr    The negative sign indicates that the force of gravity is an attractive one - towards the centre! Thus, the negative sign is a 'sign convention'!!!    Thus, Newton found the equation of universal gravitational attraction to be: -    F(r) = -G.m.M/r2    Hence, by integration we can find the gravitational potential at a point V(r) as: -    V(r) = -G.m.M/r    It can also be shown that for a uniform sphere of mass 'M' and radius 'R', that at a distance 'r', from the centre, the potential V(r) is given by: -    V(r) = -G.m.M.(3.R2 - r2)/(2.R3)    Thus, the gravitational potential energy always has a negative sign within Newtonian theory and has a maximum value at the centre of a gravitating sphere of mass 'M' (see Reference 1).      However, Newton has not had the last 'word' upon gravitational theory!    After publishing his General Theory of Relativity in 1915, Einstein explored the consequences of his gravitational field equation.    G = 8T    In a paper titled 'Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativitatsctheorie' (Cosmological Considerations on the General Theory of Relativity) published in 1917, Einstein  found that to model a steady state universe, which was the then favoured model, he had to bastardise his field equation into the parameterised form: -     G() - g() = -(T() - ?g()T)    Where the constant(?) '' is the cosmological constant or a 'fudge factor' that Einstein introduced to make his field equation work for a steady state universe. When Edwin Hubble discovered, in 1925, that the universe was expanding, Einstein commented that this constant was the greatest blunder of his life. It seems that Einstein ignored the implications, implicit, within his field equation that the universe is expanding (see Reference 2) !      However, a modern interpretation of this constant is that it represents a repulsive aspect to the gravitational force. The repulse force could be viewed as anti-gravity!    Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia comments, 'In 1998, observations of type Ia supernovae ("one-A") by the Supernova Cosmology Project at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the High-z Supernova Search Team suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating'. this acceleration is attributed to the presence of 'dark energy'. However, Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia further comments, 'The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is simply the "cost of having space": that is, a volume of space has some intrinsic, fundamental energy. This is the cosmological constant, sometimes called Lambda (hence Lambda-CDM model) after the Greek letter , the symbol used to mathematically represent this quantity. Since energy and mass are related by E = mc2, Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that it will have a gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a vacuum energy because it is the energy density of empty vacuum.....The cosmological constant has negative pressure equal to its energy density and so causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate.'     By Newtonian analogy, a repulsive form of gravity must have a positive potential value!      I hope this is of some help!|`|20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	Whether it is positive or negative depends upon what is taken as reference point. Consider a stone of mass m on earth of mass M. Assume that there is nothing else in the world. Where ever I take it,  there will be some finite force acting on it due to earth towards its centre. I will have to do some work for taking it to infinite distance or very large distance from earth. If that hypotetical point is taken as zero for potential energy. Then it is obvious that the object will lose potential energy as it comes to any distance from earth, say r. The objectwill gain kineic energy equal to the loss of potential energy. Because that point is taken as zero the potential energy of the stone at distance r will be -GMm/r.

All the videos I have seen, from all six moon landings, the flag was motionless except when being handled by the astronauts.  Do not confuse wrinkles in a still photograph for motion.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGMEn0FFQ...    They did see stars.  The stars did not appear on photographs, for the simple aperature and shutter speed settings, something they teach anyone in the first week of any basic photography class.  In order to image stars, you would have had to severly overexposed everything on the lunar surface...  a big white blob with stars wouldn't sit too well with the people back on earth.|`|VjBciucZaa	i cant believe people think thats a hoax     WE BEAT THE RUSSIANS IN THE SPACE RACE   GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS|`|AA10758468	Yes, we did go to the moon. To answer your two issues though. The flag fluttered because of vibration in the aluminum support rod it was attached to. Watch the video and it's clearly visible. The astronauts could see stars. The stars didn't show in photos because the photos were properly exposed for the bright scenes they were trying to capture. The limited dynamic range of film and the exposure set to capture the bright lunar surface means the dim starlight would not show up.|`|LRH9Em0yaa	YES!|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Answer this question and you will know the answer: Which technology is at least needed for going to the moon?    The theory of "Filmed in the Nevada Desert", is complete nonsense, because this can not explain what you see in photographs and TV streams from the moon. Just look at the fact, that on Earth, all distant objects disappear in atmospheric haze. How can you remove this haze? By removing the atmosphere.    Did the flag flutter in the wind? Sure not. Just compare the photographs:    http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40...  http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40...    And in which building except the huge NASA wind tunnel could you get so much wind at all to make a flag flutter? Also, how can you make the flag flutter by wind, and remove the atmosphere in a 5 km diameter vacuum chamber to make sure the atmospheric haze does not appear in the photographs? If your government can do magic for filming the moon landings in the Nevada Desert, wouldn't it have been simpler to just land on the moon? And as we are talking about magic: Why did NASA land more than once there? You have six landings, and one failed attempt. You have four missions, which tested the hardware and of which also two went to the moon before the first landing.    And can you see stars, if you are standing at the window of your brightly lit room at night? Sure not. It is too bright for your eyes to see it. Obviously, there is no reason to assume, you have to see stars on the moon. The lunar surface is very bright - just look how much light arrives on Earth during full moon.     Your reasoning is based on stupidity. It might not be your own stupidity, but you adopted it. You have listened to people, who are not interested into making you wiser afterwards, but who want to turn you into even bigger idiots than they are, so you buy their books and their DVDs.|`|zTQaREymaa	They did.|`|B4aB5XMaaa	goood thought.. but i got no clue|`|QMhl2DGQaa	yes it did and took pictures as well the people were neil armstrong and buzz aldrin and because there's no gravity things float so basically th flag is floating|`|XZqn21c8aa	Yes.  It really happened.  They even took pictures.  Then they came home with rocks and Moon soil.  If you search the web you can find out about the hoax about the Moon trips being hoaxes.|`|AA10870669	We will just have to find out when the 2012 or 2018 exploration happens. The flag thing would of been various things such as the propulsion systems that would have to operate to keep the equipment grounded creating wind. The equipment cameras probably had special lenses to protect the film form uv rays and other harmful rays the sun produces out of our atmosphere also preventing the starts from been visible. Do remember I am not against the theory that perhaps no one has landed in the moon, but I am not for it either. Who knows I know we will find out one day when men do go to the moon and I we can see it for our self.|`|d5880549f430ad6bada9c98bed624dcdaa	Don't be an idiot!|`|AA10576963	i dunno what documentary you watched, but i'd be willing to bet it either wasn't on a discovery network, or it was a documentary on hoaxes... if you get a decently powerful backyard telescope (i dunno, maybe a refraction tele. about 2-4 feet long) you can see the landers sitting right there on the moon! 3of them , i believe have the moon buggys parked right next to them.    if you ever get a chance to take a field trip to an observatory, i'm sure they can show you the rovers we've sent to mars.    if you want to see a bunch of great pictures and video from space, go to www.jpl.nasa.gov|`|pRF5LLloaa	Believe  what you learn in school, not the crap that you hear on the Internet.    The major proof is a laser reflector that MAN left on the moon.      Astronomers shoot a Laser Range Finder at the moon to find out the EXACT distance to the moon.  But a laser shot at the moon from Earth would not bounce off the moon, it would be absorbed by the moon's surface (dust) and never come back, making it impossible to measure the distance to the moon.    But during one of the moon landings, a MAN installed a Laser Reflector, a special device with mirrors, on the surface of the moon.  The ONLY way this device could have been installed and aimed the correct direction was if a MAN put it there.    The flag on the moon waves because it has a wire installed in the top to hold it straight.  The IS gravity on the moon, and it causes the wire to wobble, making the flag appear to wave.    If the Moon Landing was "faked" in the North Nevada Desert, why can't you see stars?  As you admit, you CAN see stars from earth, and to make the film it must have been made at night.  So why are no start visible in the film if it was made in Nevada?    There are no stars in the picture because the cameras exposure setting was too low to receive them.  Since there is no air on the moon, the sunlight (basically, just as strong as that on earth) is BRIGHTER on the moon than on earth because there is no atmosphere to spread it.  Because of this, the exposure setting on camera must be "stopped back" to prevent the film from overloading.  At this setting the stars are too weak to be picked up by the camera.  Pretty much the same reason you cant take pictures of stars in the daytime on earth.|`|p4aHF69aaa	Of course they did silly.|`|7kG5leXYaa	did they go to the moon?...ehhh perhaps|`|1g5O3eqbaa	Who cares?|`|JzJ7hAw6aa	yes|`|vIcGZ4h7aa	The only time that the flag actually flutters in the wind is when another astronaut is holding the flag to stretch it out as it is being planted. The reason you can no see stars is from 2 factors... firstly, in the 1969's camera equipment is extremely low quality even compared to the things that we consider low quality these days ... so the picture is extremely low quality, combine with the fact that they are on the sunny side of the moon. More light is being absorbed through the lens than the stars. Essentially is is the same as taking a picture of the stars, in the middle of a lighted parking lot at night, your camera is going to absorb the most powerful, and closest source of light, no matter where you are pointing (unless you can effectively block the light from your lens).|`|EQTBIsg0aa	There is a Mythbuster episode all dedicated to this question. They proof with some good tests the photo's taken on the moon are real and that movements shown by some astronauts on the moon couldn't be duplicated on earth. Consider even this: The Russians didn't deny it also. If they would believe the moonlanding was an hoax, they would send their own spaceship to locate the American Flag and Moonbuggy, still there on the moon.|`|UcwkohL5aa	Yes, we landed on the Moon.  Aside from the voluminous amount of scientific evidence, tracking data from around the world (including the USSR), the fact that 400,000 people worked on the Apollo program and not a single one has confessed that it was a hoax in the 40 years since, the entire program was conducted in the full visibility of the press, amateur astronomers watching the burns taking place at the Moon, films and photographs which stand up to microscopic scrutiny, eyewitness testimony of twenty-seven honorable men who went to the Moon, moonrocks which have been analyzed by geologists around the world and subjected to tests that didn't even exist in 1969, the fact that Apollo technology was adapted into the Space Shuttle and is being adapted into Constellation, the availability of blueprints, memoirs, test footage, and actual hardware, and the fact that every bit of the conspiracy theorists' ridiculous "evidence" has been thoroughly debunked over and over again, aside from all that, I personally correspond regularly with people who worked on the Apollo program who are working arduously to make sure the tremendous work they did for ten years is recorded for posterity, I have personally seen leftover Apollo hardware which would have gone to the Moon on Apollo 18 had the mission not been canceled, including a command/service module which was recently dismantled so that engineers working on the new Constellation program could study the electrical umbilical, I have observed an Apollo moonrock, and, best of all, I have met many of the surviving Moonwalkers.  I have looked into the eyes of Buzz Aldrin, Alan Bean, Edgar Mitchell, Dave Scott, Charlie Duke, John Young, and Gene Cernan; these guys are NOT lying, I promise you.  I've gotten to know Edgar Mitchell and had many wonderful opportunities to speak to him; trust me, he went to the Moon and the experience changed his life forever.    But don't take my word for it, the evidence is out there for all to see.  Even a little bit of research reveals how prepostrous the hoax claims are.  I mean, who believes we went to the Moon?  Geologists around the world, the most brilliant scientists alive, everyone involved in the aeronautical and astronautical field, engineers who understand space flight, many of whom I know.  Who believes the Moon landings were faked?  A handful of idiots who think stars are going to show up in a daylit snapshot.   As Gene Cernan said, "Truth needs no defense.  Nobody can take those footsteps that I made on the Moon away from me."

Feces are mostly shades of brown or yellow because they are also made up of an orange-yellow substance called bilirubin that is present throughout the body and particularly in the intestine. When iron combines with bilirubin, it gives it a brown color. The iron-influenced bilirubin then combines with the feces and turns it brown.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	When erythrocytes are destroyed, the iron in the hemoglobin is recycled.

UFteXlqwaa	Botht the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Belgian Congo) and the Republic of Congo (a.k.a. Congo Brazzaville) are tropical countries and under the effect of tropical storms that are responsible for the so-called rain forest.    Like anywhere else on earth, a low pressure is the result of rising air that then condenses as cloud and precipitations. High pressure, on the other hand, occurs when the air sinks and clouds evaporate by adiabatic warming.    But seafarers know that the wind expected after the passing of a storm, when the pressure rises again, my be more fiercy, shifting in force and direction in the unstable air masses of a cold front.    In the tropics, low pressures and associated bad weather usually form during the day when the sunlight heats the ground. To start with, the sky will be clear but soon, when reaching dew point temperature elevation, cumulus clouds will form as rising air must eventually condense since it cools down adiabatically; pretty much like the gas in you refrigerator, when it is released through a nozzle.    Your observation is not special for Congo or any place on earth, really. It is a matter of when you observe what.

If you have a standard 1-2 floor dwelling you will usually have what's called a strip, or wide strip foundation...that means your foundation only streaches 300-1000 mm wide beyond any load bearing walls.....  that means what you're chipping away at would be a floor slab, and then maybe hardcore..... problem is, you'll be tearing your radon barrier, DPC and insulation.....and digging out a hole the size of a basement would be very dangerous. I would suggest you get a contractor.     The easiest rout would be to get an above ground extension. if you want to build something sou-terrain... it would be a lot less expensive to have it beside, rather than underneath your house...    Adding a basement to an already built house would not be an easy job, and near impossible if you have any sort of floating foundation. It would require the changing of existing foundations, the adding of a new floor slab, barriers etc, and perhaps the adding of some sort of sou-terrain floating foundation to support your floor/walls/weight of the earth on either side of the basement...    In short... you might as well move to a house with a basement...

5H7Wgaknaa	The Earth is closest to the Sun at the beginning of January. This year, it happened on January 4th, when the Sun was overhead at latitude 22.7o south. So you need to find the highest mountain at or near that particular latitude.  Edit:  Cerro Zapaleri in the Andes might be a candidate: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapaleri  Further investigation using this map http://saexplorers.org/zen/images/Andes.... reveals other peaks a couple of hundred metres higher, but thay are a degree or so in latitude away from the critical 22.7o S. A degree offset is equivalent to about 1000m farther distance from the Sun, so I would say Zapaleri is the one.  A day after the Earth's closest approach to the Sun, it's distance has increased by about 400 km, but the sub-solar point has only moved north to 22.6 o S, so it's got to be a mountain at this particular latitude.|`|FT4mVJMzaa	Mount Everest is the highest mountain above sea level, but the peak most distant from the Earth's centre is Chimborazo, Ecuador.

b28dce44c19424e1c19b140399cfd48eaa	The best electrolyte is probably sulfuric acid. But it's way to dangerous to play around with it.  Sodium Bicarbonate will work if you use stainless steel as electrodes.  NaOH or KOH work better but can also be dangerous if it gets into the eyes. You should wear safety goggles.  However electrolysis is very slow.  A much faster way is to simply put aluminium foil into NaOH. NaOH is the main component of many drain cleaners. So just search for a drain cleaner that says "sodium hydroxide" on the package and mix that with water and aluminium foil. It can get quite hot so be careful and don't forget the goggles.

5H7Wgaknaa	On the face of it, this doesn't seem all that straightforward. The main requirement is to know the distance of Mercury from the Earth during a transit. Because Mercury's orbit is fairly elliptical, there is about a 20% difference in this value, depending on whether you are considering a May or November transit. It also wouldn't be particularly accurate to take Mercury's mean distance from the Sun and subtract it from the Earth's mean distance from the Sun.  Since you're looking for the maximum possible parallax, you would need to consider a typical May transit, which is closer than a November one. There was such a transit on 7th May 2003 and a trawl for an ephemeris of Mercury has turned up this document: http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/TYPE/mercur...  which gives Mercury's distance on that date as 0.560 AU. This converts to 83.8 million km. Divide your baseline by this amount to give the angle in radians, then multiply by 206,265 to convert to arcseconds.

It orbits the Earth just like the Earth orbits the sun.  Some days, you can see the moon in different phases, and some nights you can see the moon in different phases.  It all depends where the moon is in its orbit around the Earth.|`|vxSXsn59aa	Only at new moon.

YrOTZsjtaa	It takes 27.3 days for the moon to make one complete orbit around the earth. Since the earth rotates once in 24 hours, because of the timing, sometimes the daylight side of the earth will face the moon.

Sometimes we don't see it because its on the other side of the Earth from us, or it appears so close to the sun that the sunlight drowns out the moon.  But early in the morning during last quarter you can see the moon quite well (every month).|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The Moon is in orbit around the Earth, and takes 29 days to complete its circle. This means that it passes the Sun in the sky once every 29 days (called New Moon) and then moves slowly away from the Sun until it's exactly opposite the Sun at Full Moon, two weeks later. At any point in these two weeks, you can see the Sun and the Moon in the afternoon sky at the same time. At Full Moon, the Moon rises in the east at exactly the same time as the Sun sets in the west, and that's the _only_ night in the whole month when the Moon is in the night sky all night long. After Full Moon, the Moon continues in its orbit, moving slowly towards the Sun on the opposite side, and again Sun and Moon can be seen at the same time in the morning sky. After another two weeks, the Moon approaches the Sun closely, and is lost in the Sun's glare for a few days. So, basically, having both the Sun and the Moon in the sky simultaneously is the normal thing, almost every day of the month, while having the Moon only in the night sky happens only one night a month.    The fact that so few people have observed the Moon and Sun in the sky at the same time merely confirms that most people rarely if ever look at the sky.

Gmvldblraa	Thrust - the forward force  Drag - frictional resistance - drag starts of quite small a low velocity so thrust is larger and makes the plane accelerate in the horizontal direction.    Weight - the fixed size force of gravity yjsy is trying to keep the plane on the ground.    Lift - the differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wings. The wings are shaped so that the air pressure is greatest on the underside of the wings and so an upward force is produced. The lift gets greater as the velocity increases, until it is larger than the weight and the plane takes off.|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	plane getts of the ground when lift produced is more than tht of gravity|`|TxexyXMCaa	gravity, lift, drag, and something else???

Thus, there is always the chance that any animal with eyes can have eye related issues such as near-sightedness, far, blind, cataracts, etc, etc, etc.    However, what is found most often and generally the term that is used is that there are animals that just have flat our poor vision.  Rhinos are an excellent example of this.  I have lost track of how many times I have watched a rhino charge a tree or rock thinking it is a predator.  Many species of fish also have poor eye sight, but that tends to be more of an environment factor.  Another example with that is sharks and how many times humans are mistaken for food and bit by mistake.    Most of the time though when an animal has poor vision or cannot see due to their environment (example moles, deep sea fish, animals that live in caves) make up for it with other senses be it hearing, sense of smell or even taste.|`|5iHnNGHxaa	Awww wouldn't it just be adorable if animals had glasses???

This is usually the same as species. For example, dogs and dogs can produce fertile offspring, so they are the same kind. Lions and tigers can also produce fertile offspring (ligers), so are of the same kind, as are the species of whales and dolphins which produce the wholphin.  Hope that helps.

He2WsvBcaa	Intermolecular forces are forces between molecules that hold a substance in a certain state at a certain temperature. Take ice for example, it a solid and is compact because the molecules are held together tightly since the temperature is so low. Heat is needed to loosen and break these intermolecular forces, because when you apply heat to a substance, its particles vibrate more rapidly and will eventually have enough force to break the intermolecular forces to melt or evaporate.

RxukJqL5aa	(a) There are three things we need to show for ~ to be an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.    First, let's show that ~ is reflexive.  Since = is reflexive, we have y = y.  Therefore we have (x, y) ~ (x, y).    Next, let's show that ~ is symmetric.    For this, we assume that (x1, y1) ~ (x2, y2).  Then by the definition of ~, y1 = y2.  By the symmetry of =, we have y2 = y1.  Finally, (x2, y2) ~ (x1, y1), so that ~ is symmetric.    Finally, we'll show that ~ is transitive.  Assume (x1, y1) ~ (x2, y2) and (x2, y2) ~ (x3, y3).  By the defn. of ~, we have y1 = y2 and y2 = y3.  By the transitivity of =, we have y1 = y3.  Thus (x1, y1) ~ (x3, y3).    This completes the proof that ~ is an equivalence relation.    --------    (b) In the equivalence class containing (x, y), we have all the points such that the y-value is constant.  Therefore, these equivalence classes are horizontal (and hence parallel) lines on the euclidean plane.    --------    (c) Since the equivalence classes are horizontal lines, each one will intersect the line x=0 somewhere.  This intersection provides a way to write the class representatives.  Namely, (0,y) for y any real number.    Note that for any point (x,y), (x,y) ~ (0,y) so that this is a complete set of class representatives.
7VcF2pXVaa	Use the suggestion:    ac = (b + un)(d + vn)  ac = bd +bvn + und + un^2  ac = bd + n(bv + ud + un)    Clearly, this last expression is congruent to bd since the second term is divisible by n.
CjMMjtJSaa	The number of valence electrons in the transition metals is somewhat different than main group elements. As you go from left to right across the periodic table, the electrons added to the transition metals go into the d-orbitals. However, because the energy of the 4s orbital is lower than the 3d orbital (and the 5s is lower than the 4d, etc.), the 4s orbital fills first. Therefore the electron configuration of iron for instance is [Ar]4s23d6.    Because the valence electrons are defined as the electrons in the outermost or highest energy shell, for iron, that would be the 4th shell. So the 6 electrons in the 3d orbital don't count. Only the 2 electrons in the 4s orbital count since they are in the 4th shell. Most transition metals thus have 2 valence electrons (although some, such as chromium, only have one because of exceptions to the filling rules -- the configuration of chromium is [Ar]4s13d5).    However, despite this, when drawing Lewis dot structures or drawing molecular orbital diagrams for transition metals, which are the main reasons to count valence electrons, all of them count. In fact, while the main group elements follow the "octet rule" (for a complete valence shell of 8 electrons), the transition metals follow the "18 electron rule" since the 10 electrons in the d-orbitals are now included. When counting electrons for Lewis dot structures, they all go into the count for the structure and transition metals are most stable when they have 18 electrons in the structure in the same way that main group elements are most stable when they have 8.

Light wave can be both in material medium as well as vacuum. In sound wave particle of the medium vibrate in the same direction as the direction of propagation. In light wave electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of propagation and they too fluctuate. Particle associated with light waves are called photons and those associated with sound waves are called phonons. Both can be considered as waves but their velocities are different.

axKQq9nXaa	Mythbusters did a test about this and acutally as much as I love myth busters I was extremely upset at that episode... why? It was a very poor test and it gave false facts. Elephants are not scared of mice.    On that test they used a white mouse, something that does not live in the wild around elephants. The elephants did not avoid it because it was a mouse, they avoided the mouse because it was not something they were used to seeing and took caution. Elephants might be large but they are extremely smart and know to avoid something that they have never seen before until they know what it is. Not to mention the color of the mouse stood out far more than a normal rodent making it easier for the elephant to see.    Heck I have seen our elephants given new toys that are extremely large and they are very cautious around it until they know or understand what it is. It is no different with any animal really, be it a lion with a mouth full of fangs and paws full of claws or even a tiny mouse... when they happen across something new they are careful around it.    In the wild and in captivity mice happen across elephants all the time and no one is scared. They are not scared for two reasons, for one, the elephants have established that they mice are nothing to fear... or two, the elephants never even see them due to size difference. Look at it this way, do you notice every single bug that happens across your path? Probably not, just as they do not notice every little creature that passes by them.    And to the person who said that mice bite the feet of elephants in their sleep.  Are you serious?

If in high school or lower, you can just get styrofoam ball's or even wooden spheres at any craft store and spray paint 'em, then hang them of a clothes hangers.    For college, you'll probably need to do a lot more research.  Copernicus didn't make a physical model so much as theoretical idea.  By charting out the positions of the planets and how they moved in the sky, he was able to defer that we were moving faster than the rest of them in a synchronous orbit about the sun.  If you were to chart out the map of the sky with just the planets , you'd notice that all of the planets moved in a looping pattern throughout the sky.  That was the real Copernicus model - an intricate movement of the planets in the sky that dictated where the planets were located -- and that was how if discovered the theoretical model of the universe.

This pumping function reduces osmotic pressure and prevents the cell from bursting, a condition called cytolysis or osmotic lysis.      ~  The contractile vacuole stores extra water in euglena, paramecia and amoebas. If the cell has a need for water, the contractile vacuole can release more water into the cell. But if water is in excess, the contractile vacuole will remove it to maintain homeostasis.    Example:  - In paramecium, osmoregulation is aided by 2 contractile vacuoles. This is necessary because paramecium constantly take in water from the hypotonic environment by osmosis. The contractile vacuoles periodically expand, filling with water, and then contract to expel their contents to the exterior of the cell.  - In amoeba, water diffuses into the cell and fills the contractile vacuole. When the vacuole is filled to its maximum size, it contrasts to expel its contents from time to time.

AA12351398	The answer is basically pneumatic but a spray can is basically a hybrid.  A hydraulic system requires an ancillary source to pressurize the fluid (like a pump or gas pressure).  A spray can has a fluid in it but the fluid is propelled by a gas under pressure inside of the can. However, the fluid traveling up the down-tube is capable of doing work so there is a hydrulic component.  hydrofoil - hydraulic  piston pump - either  fire extinguisher - same as a paint can  dishwasher - hydraulic  car brakes - hydraulic  airplane wing - pneumatic  dentists drill - pneumatic or mechanical  rocket - pneumatic  vacuum cleaner - pneumatic    You get the idea  .|`|AA10232434	do your own homework     pneumatic = pressurized gas power  hydraulic= pressurized fluid|`|AA11602341	Hydraulics involve using liquids to do work whereas pneumatics use gases.

MKrx6a2saa	This is a tricky question, because the answer depends on your frame of reference.  In other words, where you measure the velocity makes all the difference.    I'll use c to denote the speed of light in vacuum.    If you are an observer floating in space (Frame A), and watch the Earth whiz by at a relative speed of (c-1) mph then yes, nothing can go more than 1mph faster in that direction.    However, if you are an observer on Earth (Frame B), the Earth has zero velocity from your point of reference.  If you were to look at the observer in space (A) he will be whizzing by you at a speed of (c-1) mph.  If you were to, for example, launch a rocket from Earth, you could see it travel away from Earth at any velocity approaching c (depending on the size of its boosters, etc).    However for A, the observer in space, the rocket's measured speed would never exceed c.|`|	This is a tricky question, because the answer depends on your frame of reference.

8c92619e70aba244d3e7c464492fe4e0aa	a) The gene that determines fur color is on the X chromosome.  A black male has only one X chromosome, so his contribution to the cross is either a Y chromosome or an X chromosome with a B allele.  A heterozygous female can pass on either of her B or b alleles.  The cross would look something like this:    Female B + male B = female BB or male B  Female b + male B = female Bb or male b    So half of the offspring would be male, the other half female.  Half of the male offspring would be black, the other half yellow.  Half of the female offspring would be black, the other half tortoise shell.      b) I suppose you could get a tortoise shell male with XXY or Kleinfelter's syndrome.  During Anaphase I of spermatozoa meiosis, instead of the X & Y chromosomes separating into two daughter cells, they both migrate to the same daughter cell. The result is a sperm that has both XY instead of just X or Y.  If this sperm fertilizes an egg with an X chromosome, the genotype of the zygote will be XXY.      Also, there has to be a recessive b gene in one of the parents.  This could arise from a female is yellow (bb) or tortoise shell (Bb) and the male is black.  Another could arise from a yellow male and a black (BB) or tortoise shell (Bb) female that lends it's (B) allele to the offspring.    Another mechanism that might produce a tortoise shell male is chimerism.  This is where two fertilized embryos fuse together to form one organism.  In the tortoise shell case, it would be from the embryos of a yellow and a black male.

4BqjVDxaaa	Elastic collisions conserve kinetic energy. This means that the total kinetic energy of two objects colliding are the same before and after the collision. No energy is lost as a result of the collision.    An inelastic collision is where the kinetic energy is not conserved. As a result of the collision, energy is lost through means such as sound energy and heat energy. Looking at the total kinetic energy of two objects before and after a collision, we will see that there is less total kinetic energy.|`|8U1aivfwaa	They both demonstrate the conservation of momentum and conservation of  energy!    Two objects headed on a collision course is the way to show the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions.   if  object A is traveling east at k km/s and has a mass of one kg, and object B is traveling west at one kg//sec and  has a mass of 1 kg,   in an inelastic collision, they both crash, and stop moving.   in an elastic collision, they bounce off of each other and transfer their momentum to each other.

If you go the Mech Eng'g Technology route, the curriculum is concentrated more on the technical aspects of Mechanical Engineering.    Now, it is up to you to decide on what you want to do.    Hope this helps.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	In many areas of mechanical engineering you have opportunities to do field work.  Not that you will get your hands that dirty, but you will deal with real field problems not just a bunch of numbers or drawings. A mechanical engineer in a refinery will deal with new designs of equipment and probably do some oversight of the installation of the equipment.  But the engineer will also deal with workers installing the equipment and possibly others like electrical engineers who are also involved with the equipment and controls systems engineers who are dealing with the operating and monitoring of the equipment.  So you have to understand the theory, but as an engineer you can get involved with a higher level of design and decision making than as a technician.  The engineer tells the technician what to do, but if the engineer is smart they will also ask the technician what they think about how things will work best as the technician usually does a lot of the same type of things regularly and is more familiar with the equipment than the engineer may be. Been there, done that.|`|DorePwVOaa	I'm not a Mech E, but I go to RIT, so maybe I can help a little. Mech E Tech, the program you were accepted into, is in the CAST college at RIT (College of Applied Science and Technology), where as regular Mech E is in the Engineering school (KGCOE - Kate Gleason College of Engineering). From what I know about it, you're more likely to get useful co-ops (paid internships, RIT requires them for most programs) and jobs after college if you go with Mech E, as opposed to Mech E Tech.    But you're probably right - Mech E Tech is a more hands-on program, where as Mech E is more "theoretical" (book learning). Although most programs at RIT are more hands-on than other schools in the first place, so there's that to consider as well.     In general, RIT is a great school for engineering, and has a diverse set of other programs, in case you decide it's not for you and want to change your major. Just make sure they give you a decent financial aid package (if you need it)... that was the one thing I didn't do before I came here.

3k8A4ufcaa	Benzene chemistry is often difficult, as mixtures of ortho/meta/para compounds result. Then you will have to distill/column your product.    Here's one idea: brominate nitrobenzene. The nitro group will deactivate the ring, so you will probably need forcing conditions (e.g. FeBr3/Br2 reflux), but the ortho and para positions are specifically deactivated. This means your major product should be 1-bromo,3-nitrobenzene (meta).    Another cool one is Sandmeyer chemistry. This involves forming a diazonium intermediate which is displaced by nucleophiles (e.g. copper salts like cyanide, iodide etc.).    You could take 4-aminotoluene and treat it with NaNO2 at 0 degC, then quench with the nucleophile.    Trust me, if you avoid mixtures, it's better!

You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the History Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened so, whats the point of worrying? And if you keep asking questions about 2012, do you want to die instead of enjoying life?|`|a86HbDIZaa	"He determines that both cultures arose from an antediluvian civilization which was able to calculate the previous polar shifts "...

Xcri5qeTaa	Sheesh. I saw a video on this somewhere online, but I don't recall.    What I remember is that vertical movement evolved as sea animals adapted to land, and has a lot to do with the skeletal structure. Vertical movement as in the spine bending forward and back, as opposed to horizontal movement which is side-to-side.    The ancestors of mammals developed the vertical movement. Ocean-dwelling mammals like whales, dolphins and manatees evolved from ancestors who returned to the sea with the newer vertical movement, and evolved more ocean-appropriate features.    The skeletal and muscular system which allows vertical movement of the spine also allows for greater speed and quick moves in different directions without having to turn. Vertical spinal movement also allows for evolution toward standing on hind feet, forward facing heads, rotational body movement, and head pivoting (i think all land animals's heads face the horizon, so standing erect requires a skeletal structure which allows the face to orient forward to the horizon). Bending forward is essential to animals which stand on hind legs.    Mammals which returned to the sea are thought to have never stood on hind legs.|`|axKQq9nXaa	Most argue that the reason aquatic mammals have tails that are flat is because they share a common ancestor that had feet.  Thus each tip of the tail was once part of a leg/foot.    Its kinda easier to picture in seals.  They clearly have feet, but if you toss a hunk of skin between the two you would have something that would look similar to a whale tail.    Does it really matter if the tail is horizontal or vertical?  In modern times I do not think so because clearly it does not affect eithers ability to swim, hunt or breed.  However if you are someone who looks more at genetics and the history of evolution/adaptations then it probably matters far more.

AA10711210	If you think of sea waves, wavelength is the distance between one wavecrest (or trough) and the next. Frequency is how fast the waves are travelling in to the shore.|`|6kC9me0baa	Imagine you're standing in the middle of a pool. At one end is a machine that makes waves in the pool. For the sake of simplicity, we're going to pretend that you don't affect the waves at all.    A useful thing to know would be how many waves are going to go past you. Now since the machine could make waves for all of time, a number like 1238947 waves is kinda useless. So we need to know how many waves are going to go past you in a certain length of time, like a minute, or in an hour. That's what frequency is. The number of waves that pass a certain point in a given length of time. The standard measurement is HERTZ.    1 Hertz  means 1 wave passes you every second  10 hertz means 10 waves pass you every second    The wavelength tells you how far apart the waves are. If you measure from one wave to the next, a get a number like 5m. Then the wave length is 5 m.     Think of wavelength as the length of one wave, and frequency as how often waves pass a certain point      Frequency is important because it defines the way an audio tone sounds. If you change the frequency of an audio tone, you'll change the way it sounds.    Wavelength is important in RF and microwave communications. Since microwaves have very small wavelengths using longer wires in your circuitry will cause undesired results.|`|SwKPJRNvaa	imagine waves in the sea  How far between the top of one wave, and the top the the nearest wave is the wavelength.

If you were to draw it you could see when the wave constantly repeats itself.  If you were to take a ruler and measure the distance from the begining of one repeating structure (begining of a wave) to the end of that repeating thing (end of the wave) you have just mesured a wavelenght.   The Standard units are in 'meters' its a distance    frequency:  If you were to look at this wave it would be repeating this pattern over and over.  What if you looked at a stop watch and counted the amount of waves you saw fly by within 1 second of your watch.   You just measured the frequency   it has standard units of 1/second also reffered to as a Hertz|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Frequency is the rate at which the waves arrive, per second. For example, 5 waves per second is 5Hz.    Wavelength is, as the name suggests, the length of a single wave. Waves have troughs and peaks, so the length is measured from a trough to a trough, or from a peak to a peak. Wavelength is measured in the metric units of length (mm, cm, meter, km).|`|L1KN7i0aaa	Wavelenth is the distance between the pitch's and trough's of the wave..    Frequency is the amount of pitch's and troughs in any given amount of time..|`|13qQYRX0aa	I will try to answer your question simply.   frequency is the number of cycles per second as the Electric supply is 50 cycles per second.   wavelength is the width of a radio wave.   eg.a wave of 40metres is 7 mega hertz in frequency.   radio waves travel at the speed of light 300,000,000 metres per second.  it is easy to work our the lenght of a radio wave dived 300 by the fequency you do not need to use all the noughts.300 div by 29.5 mhz = 10.1 metres. I hope this will of been some help.

bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	Almost everyone here (except fractal scatter) gave the wrong answer. Yes the mass can and does increase as more matter falls into the black hole. However...    The wording for the question is: "*WHEN* a star collapses to become a black hole...", not AFTER. Therefore, the correct answer for the intents of the particular question is A. At the time of collapse the density increases, but the mass remains the same -- for the time being.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	Increases.  Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter.|`|5al0K3N0aa	It's mass stays the same; only the volume changes (gets very very small).|`|6db82c1b800fa3265fb33558203952ddaa	B. increases...|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Depends on what you mean by its mass - do you mean over time or just at the moment of collapse?    A black hole's mass will only remain unchanged if there is no matter anywhere near the black hole to add to it.  This is not a likely situation, since stars are never alone in space (and even if they were, there is still mass in the form of dust and gas even between stars).    A black hole will increase in mass as matter crosses the event horizon and adds mass to the black hole.     A black hole can lose mass through evaporation due to Hawking radiation, but stellar-mass black holes will lose mass this way so slowly that the mass gained through incoming matter more than compensates for the loss.    So the answer is b.|`|cQilUAcxaa	I would venture to say it decreases.  The supernova that precedes the black hole formation will 'blow off' a lot of mass of the original star, and so the mass of the black hole will be sufficiently less than the mass of former star, at least typically.    *EDIT*    Malcolm G:  Stellar collapse to a black hole involves a supernova, in which a lot of mass is lost from the star.  However, the question is poorly worded, which is evidenced by the multiple ways it has been interpreted.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	Its mass will become infinite.Black holes are in the middle of each galaxy and furnished the gravity for every thing to orbit around it...|`|JdIabzQaaa	c. decreases

f1beDbKIaa	In Panspermia, live migrates from one place to another.  For example, it might have gone from an early Venus to Earth, or Earth to Mars, or Mars to Earth.  Analysis of bacteria stuck in Antarctic ice for various amounts of time suggest that they don't survive more than about 5 or 10 million years.  That's not enough for interstellar trips.  So it appears that though Panspermia is possible, it doesn't seed life everywhere.    And, Panspermia doesn't solve the abiogenesis problem.  Life had to start from non-living chemicals somewhere.  This is an unsolved problem.    The Big Bang relates to the evolution of the Universe, not the evolution of life.  And it has it's own unsolved "how did it get started" issue.  But in some ways, it's an easier problem.  Once physics is understood "all the way down" to the smallest bits, and the rules for how things interact are understood, the start of the Universe will likely smack us in the face.  Whereas, all traces of early life on Earth are likely erased, for various reasons.|`|FT4mVJMzaa	There is nothing that requires "life comes only from non life." In fact, exactly the opposite. It had to form at some point from nonliving matter.|`|W2suykEtaa	good point.    its not true.|`|ViZH5twNaa	Abiogenesis is the slow process of self-replicating systems becoming cellular life. No one says life can from nowhere, except maybe a few religions.    Panspermia is the spread of life from one world to another. Perhaps abiogenesis didn't take place on Earth. Instead maybe it hitched a ride from another world across space and collided with our young Earth and seeded life here. If this is true life would still have had to of been created via abiogenesis on the world of origin. The idea that abiogenesis took place on Earth is simpler however as it cuts out the middleman and is thus accepted by the vast majority of the scientific community.

01otUZeCaa	First, we write a balanced equation for this reaction as we will need to use stoichiometry.     S + O2 ---> SO2    (160g. S)*(1 mol. S / 32.065g. S)*(1 mol. O2 / 1 mol. S) = 4.99 mol. O2 required.    We can then use the Ideal Gas Law.    PV = nRT    (1.00 atm.)(x L) = (4.99 mol.)(0.0821)(273K)    We solve for x and we get that we need 111.8 L of O2 at STP.    Because the ratio of O2 to SO2 is 1:1 according to our balanced equation, we will get 4.99 moles of SO2 gas formed.     We again use the Ideal Gas Law.    PV = nRT    (740 mm Hg)*(1 atm. / 760 mm Hg) = 0.974 atm. You do not have to convert the pressure to atmospheres, however if you don't then you will need to use a different R constant.    (0.974 atm.)(x L) = (4.99 mol.)(0.0821)(293)    We get that the volume of SO2 collected will be 123.2 L.
81c1606e8b69fbf385e8ccb9d683032eaa	a standard deviation is the average distance of each point in the distribution from the sample mean.    a z score is a standardize score from the Z distribution, which is always normally distributed and has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.  if you know your data is normally distributed, or you have a large sample size you can convert your raw scores in Z scores by the following formula: Z = observation - sample mean/standard deviation.  once you figure out the Z score you can make inferences about the population, because one of the most important properties of the Z distribution is: that approximately 68% of the population falls within -1/+1 Z from the mean, 95% fall within -2/+2 Z, and 99% fall within -3/+3 Z.    say for example you wanted to see how a math class performed on their math exam.  you find that the average in the class is 80, with a standard deviation of 5.  now you want to decide how well a person who got a 99 did compared to his/her classmates.  you calculate the Z score: 99-80/5=19/5= about 4.  the means that this individual did better than 99% of the class.

AA11133450	Regardless of the size of the culture, certain conditions must be provided for efficient growth of plankton. The majority of cultured plankton is marine, and seawater of a specific gravity of 1.010 to 1.026 may be used as a culture medium. This water must be sterilized, usually by either high temperatures in an autoclave or by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, to prevent biological contamination of the culture. Various fertilizers are added to the culture medium to facilitate the growth of plankton. A culture must be aerated or agitated in some way to keep plankton suspended, as well as to provide dissolved carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. In addition to constant aeration, most cultures are manually mixed or stirred on a regular basis. Light must be provided for the growth of phytoplankton. The colour temperature of illumination should be approximately 6,500K, but values from 4,000K to upwards of 20,000K have been used successfully. The duration of light exposure should be approximately 16 hours daily; this is the most efficient artificial day length[6].

ACToJVljaa	To answer this question, you're first going to have to find out how many moles of CuSO4 you ended with.    First, look up the relevant atomic masses  Copper:  63.54  Sulfur: 32.06  Oxygen: 16.00    1*63.54 + 1*32.06 + 4*16.00 = 159.6 g/mol  This number means that for every ONE mol of CuSO4 you have, there is 159.6 grams of it. But you don't have 159.6 grams; you have 1.25 (2 minus the .75 grams of water lost). So, divide 2 by 159.6 and you get the number of moles that you actually have: 1.25/159.6 = .00783 mol.    Since the number of moles of CuSO4 should be the same as the number of moles of CuSO4xH2O, the rest of the math is pretty simple. First, find out how many moles of water is in .75 g:  Hydrogen: 1.00  Oxygen: 16.00  2*(1.00) + 1*(16.00) = 18.00 g/mol  .75/18.00 = .0417 mol of water  Then take .0417 (moles of water) and divide it by .00783 (moles of CuSO4) and you'll get moles of water per mol of CuSO4: 5.32    That's fairly close to 5, especially for a number found from lab data, so you could feel pretty confident that x should equal 5.|`|HoqbrYYxaa	DOES`NT YOUR SCHOOL SUPPLY TEXTBOOKS?

b1b911398e5752977033f736afe9e07caa	The most valuable "whale puke"  is known as ambergris and comes from sperm whales. It's used as a base for perfumes. It's most often found washed up on beaches and sometimes floating at sea.     It's believed that the dense waxy ambergris is secreted by the whale's stomach to protect it from sharp beaks from the squid it eats.     As for the garden variety of whale vomit, I suspect the best way to collect it is to follow whales around until they throw up and then put a net/bucket in the water and pick it up. (Pretty much what scientists do when collecting whale poop.)|`|W7alu42Kaa	dude! why do ya want to get  whale PUKE!!!! its so sicko

Gmvldblraa	Come on. This site is not about fantasy - those words you use are out of context and meaningless ( outside of your game) . Hertz is frequency - you don't (can't!) amplify frequency, thats a meaningless idea. You could take a loud noise, like a sonic boom and amplify it with an amplifier, but the out put would have to be played back through speakers - no speakers could actually make the sound  any louder than the original bang itself; the  amplifier would drive the speakers to the ends of their amplitudes and the sound would just stop ( and the speakers would be wrecked.)  And 150 MHz sound.....you wouldn't hear it,  - nothing would happen; molecules vibrating that fast wouldn't have time to achieve any significant amplitude........Sorry and all, theres no physical meaning behind the words used in your game.
eUiaQe1Paa	if u have a bar magnet the surrounding space contains a magnetic field which is an eg. of a vector field. This is because at each point in the surrounding space there is a magnetic force( which can b felt by placing a second magnet there)  and this force has both magnitude and direction ie. is a vector.    Electric fields work the same way but r generated by charges not magnets.    In a room at any point there is a definite temperature. Temperature has magnitude (say 60Farheinheit) but no direction. This is a scalar field.     To know whether its a scalar or vector field look at a few places inside the field. If the quantity has only magnitude it forms a scalar field. If it has both magnitude and direction its a vector field.|`|xbma9SuWaa	Because it has been experimentally obseved that if you place an electric charge close enough to a field that the charge will move radially out ward from the source of the field.    The charge itself is not a vector and we also know that Force is a vector.  The equation for the Force is  Force = E*charge.  If charge is not a vector but force is and the charge moves in manner as stated above then it must be the case that E is a vector.  A  similar argument could be made for the B field

YrOTZsjtaa	When the knights collide, the sum of their individual distances will be 96.5m. Or :    x(George) + x(Alfred) = 96.5m    Since displacement is :    x = v?t + 0.5at2, then :    v?t + 0.5at2(George) + v?t + 0.5at2(Alfred) = 96.5m    Both knight's initial velocity is zero, so this bcomes :    0 + 0.5(0.259m/s2)t2 + 0 + 0.5(0.333m/s2)t2 = 96.5m    Solving for t we get t 18.1s. In this time, George travels through a distance of :    x = v?t + 0.5at2  = 0 + 0.5(0.259m/s2) (18.1s)2  = 42.4m|`|bed8QNUaaa	o(?)o...  ...|`|l4anfnt7aa	s = ut + 1/2 at2    Where s is distance traveled, u is initial velocity, t is time, and a is acceleration.    In this case, u for Sir George and Sir Alfred are both 0. Since they are 96.5m apart, we know that when they meet:  sg(George's distance) = 96.5 + sa(Alfred's distance, which will be negative because he is moving in the opposite direction).    And we are given that ag(George's acceleration) = .259m/s2 and aa(Alfred's acceleration) = -.333m/s2    So, sg = 1/2*ag*t2 and sa = 1/2*aa*t2    We can first solve for t. Then we can use either equation to solve for sg or sa which will tell us where the knights collide.    1/2*ag*t2 = 96.5 - (1/2*aa*t2)  1/2*.259m/s2*t2 = 96.5 + (1/2*-.333m/s2*t2)  If you work this out you will get t2=326.01s2 (approximately)    Now we can plug t2 back into the original formula for George's distance:  sg = 1/2 * .259m/s2 * 326.01s2 = 42.21875m|`|eUiaQe1Paa	easier if u assume alf is at rest and geo accelerates at 0.333 + 0.259 = 0.592 find time he takes to reach alf. by the root of 2 x 96.5 / 0.592 this is the same as the time when they are both accelerating.     now in the time just found calculate how far geo travels if accelerating 0nly at 0.259. s= 0.5a t^2

w2nfvZ0caa	Sounds like you've had a rough week. Hopefully this will help. :)    One-step equations are the easiest to understand. It's just an equation that can be solved in one step. For example:    x + 10 = 15  Subtract "10" from each side:  x = 5    That's a one-step equation. They can involve any operation, as long as the problem can be solved in one step.    Two step equations are basically the same thing, just that they are solved in two steps. Example:    3x - 7 = 14  Add "7" to both sides (first step). Divide both sides by "3" (second step).  3x = 21  x = 7    The next easiest thing to explain is the combining like terms equation. I don't really see why they name it an equation, because normally it's a step in solving for a variable; "combine like terms." It's just as it sounds:    2x - 5 = 10x + 2  Subtract "10x" from each side.  2x - 5 - 10x = 2  Add "5" to each side:  2x - 10x = 2 - 5  Combine like terms. This is the part that it probably means. "2x - 10x = 8x" and "2 - 5 = 3"  8x = 3  Now you can solve for "x":  x = 3/8    Distributive property equations aren't that hard to learn about, but it can be a little confusing (especially trying to explain it over the internet. I'll tell you what the distributive property is using an equation:    2(x + 3)  This is the distributive property. You need to DISTRIBUTE the "2" to the "x" AND to the "3":  2(x + 3) = 2x + 6    Another example:    11(3x - 5)  Distribute the "11" to the "3x" AND to the "-5":  11(3x - 5) = 33x - 55    One last example:    5x(6 + x)  Distribute the "5x" to the "6" AND to the "x":  5x(6 + x) = 30x + 5x2    Here's a link to a site that might help explain further (using arrows):  http://www.purplemath.com/modules/simpar...

If an item sinks but does go to the bottom of the liquid it is nuetral boyant or equal in weight to the water it displaced or it weighs the same.

IcPhsY7Eaa	So for radicals, you have to try to find a square number that is a factor of the number you are looking for! So for example, *32 = *16 X *2. We know that 16 is the square of 4 so your answer is 4 X *2. Keep this in mind and it'll be way easier. Sometimes a factoring tree helps a lot so that you can look for squares in a number. Oh, and remember that multiplying two radicals is like multiplying normal numbers, except your answer is under a root sign!    *27 = *9 X *3 = 3 times *3    *6 X *8 = *48 = *16 X *3 = 4 times *3    *15 X *45 = *15 X *15 X *3 = 15 times *3    *18 X *12 = *6 X *3 X *6 X *2 = *6 X *6 X *3 X *2 = 6 times *6    *20 X *35 = *5 X *4 X *5 X *7 = *5 X *5 X *4 X *7 = 5 X 2 X *7 = 10 times *7    *300 X *500 = *100 X *3 X *100 X *5 = *100 X *100 X *3 X *5 = 100 times *15    *14 X *21 = *7 X *2 X *7 X *3 = *7 X *7 X *2 X *3 = 7 times *6    *24 X *42 = *6 X *4 X *6 X *7 = *6 X *6 X *4 X *7 = 6 X 2 X *7 = 12 times *7    And that's how you simplify radicals:) On a lot of them, I found two radicals of the same number, and I was able to simplify them pretty easily because you know that *x times *x equals x. Sorry about all the X's, but I didn't want to type "times" on every single step:)

It just doesn't.    2) There is no such thing as the "First Law of Science". More to the point, evolution isn't about the origin of life anyway. Life could have been started by Mr T. for all the Theory of Evolution cares. Evolution still happens.     That said, there is no reason that "life" couldn't have evolved from "non-life". There is not a clear-cut boundary between life and non-life. And all evolution requires is the ability to self-replicate.|`|NQLfzZ1eaa	Are you asking the question of how God was created?  How could nothing turn into God?|`|AA6Aq94vaa	Are you asking how one species evolves into another?   Simple, when cells replicate themselves or reproduce sexually usually it happens as expected but sometimes an error occurs. This error is called a mutation. These errors almost always a change in one nucleotides of the amino acids that make up DNA. There are 4 nucleotides in DNA: Adenenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine. These four nucleotides form in groups of three to form amino acids, and the amino acids form long chains to form genes on each strand of DNA    When a mutation occurs it is a change in one of these nucleotides, for example a guanine might become a cytosine, or an extra guanine might appear. Usually these mutations are harmful and the organism with the mutation dies. Sometimes they are beneficial, when this happens that organism is more likely to reproduce than its neighbors, before long, most members of that community have that beneficial trait. Enough beneficial mutations and the organisms with them will be too genetically different from those without and will not be able to breed with them, and that will be a new species.    Now if you are curious where life came from, I can also help you. The most likely hypothesis is that life formed in a naturally occurring undersea geothermal vent called a black smoker. A black smoker ejects superheated water with dissolved organic chemicals in it. These organic chemicals include sugars, lipids (kinda like fats) and amino acids. Many of these organic chemicals react with each other and will form long polymer chains. It is most likely life stated in one of these black smokers.  Black smokers still occur. They were discovered in the 1980's, and have been heavily studied since then. The organic chemicals produced by black smokers contain many nutrients and bacteria feed off of them. Other creatures feed off that bacteria and form an entire food chain around each black smoker.|`|Bm42jAnVaa	I am assuming that you are referring to Pre-biotic earth, or before earth was inhabited by living creatures. There are three major hypotheses that explain how non-life turned into life. Note that just because its a hypothesis doesn't mean it is any less true, it just means that we cant go back in time and watch it happen. First up is the is the Pre-boitic Soup Hypothesis, which says that after a spark of energy, ,most likely a lightning bolt, caused non-organic compounds to change into organic compounds. The second is the Iron World Hypothesis which says that non-organic compounds to change into organic compounds, this time at the bottom of the ocean, somewhere near an underwater chasm. The final hypothesis says that an meteoroid/comet brought these organic compounds to earth. Hope that helps

iTqj9QCkaa	Where I work, we use "working load" to mean the maximum load that the equipment is subjected to.  We use "capacity" or "rated load" to indicate the maximum load the equipment is designed to handle, and we normally  design for a capacity greater than the current "working load" so that a redesign is not required when the working load "grows" a little.  Our safety factors and analysis are applied to the capacity (or rated load).  I'm not sure what your "static load" means but that might be the "ultimate" or breaking strength of the part, the maximum static load that it can withstand without breaking.

RxukJqL5aa	Ever wonder why professional writers still require editors?    Also, I'm pretty sure that this phenomenon is well-documented in psychology.  We simply are blind to our own mistakes.  I figure (speculation follows) that it's because if we saw all of our mistakes we make on a daily basis, we'd be paralyzed with hopelessness; hence it, oddly enough, might be a survival mechanism @_@.    Anyway... I usually post and later sit back down to read what I wrote.  When I do this, I allow myself to enter into the same "mode" I grade papers in, so it allows me to be critical of something even though I wrote it.

7N9NPCq4aa	1.  Yes, they are transformed because only bacteria with the gene for ampicillian resistance can grow on the amp plates.  The bacteria that fluoresce are also transformed, because they are expressing the pGLO gene.    2.  The splicing product contains DNA from both the host and the insert, recombined into one molecule.    3.  each restriction enzyme leaves a different sequence on the sticky ends, so if you used different kinds your host DNA and the insert would not recombine.    4.  I can't answer this one    5.  So that, even if the gene of interest was not expressed, you could tell if the cloning was successful.
s5X71mhyaa	A)    The time that it takes for the ball to reach the highest point is:    t = Vo * sin? / g  t = 10,6 * sin (55) / 9,8  t = 0,886s    After that time the ball reaches the height:    H = Vo^2 * sin^2(?) /2*g  H = 10,6^2 * sin^2 (55) / 2*9,8  H = 3,85m    The speed in the east direction in that moment is:    V = Vo * cos?  V = 10,6 * cos55  V = 6,08m/s    There is no speed in vertical direction because the eagle hits the ball at the highest point where vertical component of the speed is 0.    What distance in east direction did the ball travel?  x = Vo * cos? * t  x = 10,6 * cos55 * 0,886s  x = 5,39m     Now the eagle hits the ball and the ball bounces back with 1.5 times the speed it had just before the collision.     New speed of the ball is:  V = 6,08m/s * 1,5 = 9,12m/s    At the moment when eagle hits the ball, the ball:  - has a speed of 9,12m/s  - has traveled 5,39m east  - is 3,85m high (of its original position)  - it traveled 0,886 seconds to get at that position.    How long does it take for the ball to fall back on it's original position (verticaly)? The same time that it took for the ball to climb. So the drop time is the same as climb time before --> 0,886s.    What distance in the direction of west will the ball travel?    x = V * t  x = 9,12m/s * 0,886s  x = 8,08m    First the ball traveled 5,39m east and then 8,08m west. So the ball landed 2,69m behind the player (8,08 - 5,39).       B)    The angle IS NOT necessarily negative (below the horizontal). The eagle could hit the ball at the positive angle (above the horizontal) so that the ball would go up and then drop in the hands of the athlete. Or it could hit the ball at the negative angle below the horizontal and the ball would land again in the hands of athlete. The only difference between two situations is in the angle and in the time that it takes for the ball to return to the athlete. A situation with a positive angle above the horizontal would take more time.
SvmZlLdaaa	They are different species. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is the most adaptable and widespread of the large cats, found across Africa and Asia. It stands shorter than the cheetah, but is much stockier and more muscular. Its spots are arranged in small rings, and its head is longer and more rectangular. Image:  http://www.lioncrusher.com/images/Leopar...    The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is found in Africa, with a small relict population of around 30 animals in Iran. It is slender and lightly-built, with long legs that mean it stands taller than the leopard. Its head is small and rounded, and its spots are solid. It has distinctive 'tear-marks' on the face - black lines running from the corner of each eye to the corner of the mouth. These are a very good way of telling cheetahs from leopards if the body-shape doesn't make it clear.

There are a few easy ways to tell the difference. 1.) Cheetahs have black markings on there face that look like black "tear" lines starting at the inside of the eye and extending down to the muzzle area--this is the easiest way to tell.  2.) Leopards tend to be stronger and more bulky, where cheetah's are more lean.  3.) The spots are different. Cheetah spots look more like polka dots. Solid black spots. Leopards have spots like this too, but the spots are bigger and on the body of the leopard, they are not always solid. I think these spots look sort of like flowers, or horse shoes, but that's just my observation.|`|hHjfoKEHaa	Leopards have rosette shaped shots and cheetahs have solid spots.

4CMENEKnaa	You might have to make it yourself if you need it this weekend.  Fear not, however, it is relatively easy to do using commonly available chemicals.  First, Biuret Reagent is described here:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biuret_reag...    and is a mixture of KOH, CuSO4.6H2O, and potassium sodium tartrate.  KOH, potassium hydroxide, is basically (no pun intended) Drain-O and sold under the name caustic potash.  So you can go to a hardware store and buy some drain cleaner crystals that contain caustic potash or potassium hydroxide and that is part 1.  CuSO4, copper sulfate, is used as a fungicide and root killer and I am betting garden supply stores will have it on the shelf.  (Ok, I checked, see link below, find root killers in the hardware store when you get the drain cleaner.)  The potassium sodium tartrate you will have to make out of things you buy at the grocery store (see reference below).  The final link tells you how to make Biuret's reagent.    Good luck

Std7Ela5aa	the answer i get is different: 3/5    the assumptions i make are that the machine has an equal  number of screws of each type and that each size of screw  has an equal probability to be missing,     suppose the screws sizes are A, B, C & D.  there are 10 equi-probable combinations of missing screws  AA,BB,CC,DD and AB,AC,AD,BC,BD & CD  the requirements will be met only if the 2 screws are different   thus the probability that the screws sent are the needed ones  = 6/10 = 3/5    NOTE:   i do not think it is appropriate to make assumptions   so that somehow an answer of 3/4 results|`|hHVMrnK3aa	Let the four sizes be s1, s2, s3, s4.    The requirements are for one of the following  sa, sa (same size)   sa, sb (different size)  (where a, b are from 1,2,3,4)    The shipment contains one of each possible size,  so if we are missing some (sa, sb) we are home free,  but in the (sa, sa) case we lose.    Assume the machine has roughly the same number  of screws of each size, and it's large enough that 1 doesn't   make a big difference.    The first screw is of some size, sa.    Since there are three times as many non-matching screws  as matching ones, the likelihood that the two are not the  same size is three times the likelihood of a match.    So the chances are: 3/4 non-match, 1/4 match,  and 3/4 chance the shipment will have the required items.|`|AA11613518	It has been 40 years since I had statistics but I find your question interesting.  I will check back to see the answer and how it was computed.  That said:  If we needed 1 screw and they randomly sent 4 the probability that they would NOT send the correct screw is 3/4*3/4*3/4*3/4or 32%.  If the probability is 32% they did NOT send the correct screw then the probability is 68% they did send the correct screw.    In your question they have to send 2 correct screws, therefore I think the probability would be less than 68%.     Hope this helped, I'll try to get this tired old brain going.    I finally see, the question is: what is the probability the missing screws are the same size.  From there it is easy.  Very good TG.  Thanks for the question on this cold February day.
xBsrCN4Yaa	log stands for logarithm.  If you're in high school in the U.S. log is usually "log base 10".      log(x) means "10 to what power is equal to x?", so for instance  log(1000) = 3, since 10^3 = 1000    sometimes in college log can mean "log base e", where e is a set number around 2.71 (kind of like how we use pi to represent about 3.14).  The definition is similar,  but usually "log base e" is written ln, not log.    If you are looking at an angle in a right triangle, where the side lengths are all written, you can use the "SOHCAHTOA" acronym to remember that sin(x) = opposite/hypoteneuse, cos(x) = adjacent/hypoteneuse, and tan(x) = opposite/adjacent, where for instance "opposite" means the length of the side that is not touching the angle x.    If you are just given a number x, you can find sin(x) and cos(x) by memorizing the unit circle (you'll probably have to learn this at some point).  There is a copy of it on:    http://mason.gmu.edu/~tlong1/math113    and then you can find tan(x), since tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)|`|YR5NWRe2aa	log is logithrms.

xBsrCN4Yaa	your last answer is correct.    For the first, break everything up into factors that are perfect cubes and factors that are not.  For instance 54 27*2, and 27 is a perfect cube 27 = 3*3*3.  Then you can pull a 3 out front, so the cuberoot(54) part becomes 3*cuberoot(2).  Be careful with the variables if the power is not some multiple of 3.  The cuberoot(x^6) becomes x^2, but the cuberoot(y^4) becomes y^(4/3) or stays in the cuberoot, your choice.    The second one is somewhat similar for the simplification part.

The stars went in circles around the earth.    The only problem was that the visible planets, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn could be seen and they did NOT go in circles, sometimes they went backwards for a short time and then went forward again.

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    You are correct that 4(x - 6) = 4x - 24.    But then, you must multiply (4x - 24) times (1x - 2) by multiplying 4x through (1x - 2) and then multiplying -24 times (1x - 2).    (4x - 24)(1x - 2) = 4x(1x - 2) - 24(1x - 2) =    4x2 - 8x - 24x + 48 =    4x2 - 32x + 48     I hope that helps!! :-)|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	(x-6)(x-2) = x^2 -8x +12  So 4(x^2-8x+12) = 4x^2 -32x + 48 |`|gjeOKI52aa	1.    4(x-6)(x-2)  2.

OuNXvoh4aa	OK, lithium doesn't form a sphere, but potassium and sodium do (the others won't appear in the school lab.) That's because potassium and sodium are both more reactive and have lower melting points. The heat generated from the reaction with water is enough to melt the metal into a liquid, so it forms a sphere (lowest surface area stuff.)    Basically because the reaction melts it.

Personally, I like decimals so I convert all my answers into decimals:    3.07, 3.7 or 37/10, 3.0712, 3.078, 3.71 or 371/100, 3.0717, 3.072, 3.071    So in order to find the smallest numbers, we need to check each number to be sure that they have the smallest ones, tenths, hundredths, and thousandths place. Because they all have the same one's place, let's look at the tenths place. The smallest number in the tenths place is 0. The smallest number in the hundredths place is 7, and the smallest number in the thousandths place is nothing. So your smallest number was right, 3.07. Now look at the other numbers with 3 ones, no tenths, and 7 hundredths. The number with the smallest thousandths place that fits these requirements goes next, which is 3.071. You need to check each place to make sure that the numbers are in the right order. After going through and checking all your numbers, your order from smallest to greatest is:    3.07, 3.071, 3.0712, 3.0717, 3.072, 3.078, 37/10, 371/100

ThYN1mFFaa	Sorry, Jess is incorrect. Molarity is expressed as moles/liter which is the same as a concentration.  Moles, however, is not a concentration.  But as long as it has liters or some volume in the denominator, it is a concentration.  So, bottom line .... molarity most certainly IS the same as concentration.  I wouldn't necessarily say it is another NAME for concentration,but it is one form of expressing concentration.|`|Ps8FtPYHaa	No they are two different things, molarity refers to the concept of the mole, (how many moles are present), eg. 2HCL there are two moles of Hydrochloric acid, the number of moles has nothing to do with the amount of solution it in or anything like that, therefore no relation to concentration.  Concentration however is the amount of moles, per litre.  So if there is the ooriginal two moles of HCl, and water is added to this, the number of moles or the molarity as you said does NOT change but the concentation DOES.

The sorts of veneral diseases and flu viruses the spanish brought with them to South America has been kicking around europe for some centuries.  In that time an amount of resistence had evolved.      The Azetcs not exposed before to this pathogens were very susceptable and had no immunity.  They probably lived in relatively few numbers so less chance of lucky genetic resistence happening.    Before we think that the Azetecs were 'weak' the great flu pandemic after WWI killed a third of the population of europe    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu    when the asian bird flu cross over does happen the asians will be best set to resist it and the west will suffer proportinately more|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Antibodies aren't passed down, but there are several things that contribute to a population's resistance to disease.  Inherited traits is one of them.      Also, low level exposure due to the environment greatly helps immunity, which is why polio was not a major epidemic until we developed sanitation.    As to your question, it would depend on chance.  Which alleles did you inherit, ect.|`|b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	A person with mixed ethnicity might or might not inherit a trait from his/her parents.  As humans have, essentially, removed themselves from the selection pressures of the environment, the evolutionary control of fitting the environment (for humans) no longer exists.  Thus, those humans, due to modern medicine, with strong AND weak immune systems will continue to proliferate and live to reproduce.|`|097CKwBWaa	Certain traits or diseases are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups because of a genetic predisposition... that being said, I don't think there is any real correlation between ethnicity and immune response since there is so much variation from person to person.    Parents do not pass down antibodies to their children... the mother passes them through the placenta to the fetus... but this is only temporary, eventually the baby has to develop its own.    ...the Aztecs were not exposed to the disease climate that the spanish had grown up in, so diseases that the Spanish were immune to were brought with them inadvertantly and given to the natives who had no defense for those particular germs.

eUgwHzeqaa	Calling a nurse a doctor's slave is something that could only be done by someone who has never worked with either.      If you don't want to go to med school, there *is* no up side to being a doctor.  No one should go down that road if it isn't something they truly want to do.  It's too many years and too much money and too much work to head down that path without a true desire to be there.    There's an old med school truism that "if you really want to take care of patients, be a nurse."  Like any other catchphrase, it's not entirely true--of course you take care of patients as a doctor too--but it's the nurses who do the bulk of the day-to-day care of patients in hospitals.  Nurses are, in any event, highly trained professionals in their own right who carry out duties that are associated with those of doctors, that may overlap those of doctors, but that aren't all directed by doctors.  Nurses also have a lot more freedom to move around to different specialties, if they want to--some nurses focus on one area like pediatrics for all of their careers, but many don't.      If you like having a lot of patient contact and you don't see yourself spending four years in college, four years in med school, and three to seven years in residency, nursing is a great option to think about.|`|GBZQP5pAaa	I am in nursing school. I look at it like this...    Less school-less tuition  Less liability  When you leave work, you're done. You're not on call.  (These are just a few of the advantages.)    Personally, I don't have the patience or the time/money to become a doctor, and I give them credit.     Becoming a nurse will give me financial stability and there is always a need for nurses. There is actually a shortage of nurses. You can always move your way up. There are hundreds of things and areas nurses can work in. It is a very broad field. You could even go into healthcare management. Best wishes!|`|097CKwBWaa	The responsibilities are great for both, but the accountability in terms of medical malpractice is much greater for doctors.

Your are not only a doctor's 'slave' but you are also responsible to know MORE than a doctor. If the Dr tells yo to give a med to a patient & he's wrong causing the patient to die, you TOO will be sued because you actually gave the drug. So, you need to know more about meds & the interactions than the doctors.  Good luck in your decision.|`|2Dw0jHP9aa	THese other people don't know what they are talking about. I am an RN, I absolutely love my job im not a doctor's "slave." Actually the docs i work with treat most of the nurses like equals. They ask us for our opinions and love to teach us something if we are unsure. We work together to accomplish the same goal to get people feeling well enough to not be at the hospital. The doctors diagnose a problem and tell us what meds to give or what treatment they think the patient needs. We do make less money but we do have less school to attend and we have less accountability than the doctors. If there are any doctors out there who feel any different then they are only in medicine for the money.

A tomato (the red part you eat) is swollen, seed-bearing ovary of a flowering plant. Botanically, anything that meets this criterion is a fruit. That applies to acorns, squash, peanuts, and beans. More specifically, the tomato is a berry, a type of fruit.     Apparently, the idea of a tomato being a fruit rather than a vegetable was rather disturbing to a lot of people 100 years ago for folk and economic reasons.

IUmAflSqaa	The solution exists and is unique.  This is because permutations form a group.  To solve this, we multiply both sides by the inverse of (1432)(76).  The inverse can be computed by reversing each cycle and multiplying them in the reverse order, i.e.:    [(1432)(76)]^(-1) = (67)(2341)    (We actually don't care which order we multiply here, since the two cycles are "disjoint", i.e. don't contain any of the same elements, so they commute.)  If you're not sure why this is the case, take a second to ponder why the inverse of any cycle (a1 a2 ... an) is (an ... a2 1).  Multiplying this on the left on both sides, we have:    x = (67)(2341)(5241)    Now multiply the cycles together, say the rightmost twp.  Start from the rightmost cycle, choose an element, and see where it goes.  So we have 5 goes to 2 in the 1st cycle, 2 goes to 3 in the 2nd.  So our product starts (53..).  Now follow 3: 3 stays put in the 1st, goes to 4 in the 2nd, so we have (534...).  Follow 4: 4 goes to 1, 1 goes to 2.  So we have (5342...).  Follow 2: 2 goes to 4, 4 goes to 1.  So we have (53421...).  We can figure out that 1 has to go to 5 now, since 1 has to go to something between 1 and 5 and everybody else is accounted for; but note that the same method as for the other numbers shows 1 goes to 5 anyways.  So we get:    x = (67)(53421)    Now there's no reason to multiply this out, since the cycles are disjoint.  So this is x.

Transfer RNA reads a mRNA strand and inputs the proper Amino acid to each codon... this is call translation whereas the creation of mRNA from a DNA parent strand is called transcription.    Adenine and thyamine form base pairs and so do cytosine and guanine... sadly this is just somethign that needs to be memorized because there aren't a ton of really clever mnemonic devices for remembering them.

Seriously, you can SEE that there is a rod across the top edge of the flag in the photos, never mind in the actual film and video footage of it being set up.

You would KNOW why the flag was out (a thin rod along the top to hold it up because they knew there was no air on the moon).  You would KNOW how they took pictures (a camera mounted in one of the lander legs that they deployed before Armstrong stepped out).  You would KNOW why you don't see stars in the sky (it has to do with overexposure of the foreground).    People that weren't around in 1969 know they missed the single most important event in human history - so instead of learning about it for themselves they look for anything they can find to discredit this magnificent achievement.  Nut nothing you claim as proof of some conspiracy will do one tiny bit to erase history.    You will get your chance - when man first steps on Mars, or when we find life on another planet.

C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) ==> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)  What is the amount (in moles) of water produced from 0.61 mol C2H5OH?     The mole ratio of C2H5OH to H2O is 1:3 (i'm looking at the numbers in front of each formula i.e C2H5OH has no number which you immdiately take as 1 and H20 has a 3 in front of it.  Your question is asking you to find the moles of H2O.  This is a bit of maths. So as i said earlier the mole ratio is 1:3.  The moles in C2H5OH is 0.61 therefore the moles in H2O is 0.61 x 3 (using the mole ratio)  Therefore the answer is 1.83 moles.    I hope you understand =)
mmWeBRRtaa	I think what you might be looking at is the Hyades, in the constellation Taurus.  This is a faint but easily seen loose star cluster, and it is near the bright star Aldebaran.    If the Hyades are to the right of Orion's belt, then farther to the right you'll see the Pleiades, the "seven sisters."  Unlike the Hyades, however, the Pleiades don't have a bright star dominating them.    Here's a photo of this region of the sky from a dark location:  http://www.davidmalin.com/fujii/source/a...    Orion and its belt are in the lower part of the picture, slightly right of center.  The Hyades are to the upper right of Orion -- a V-shaped group of stars, along with the bright star Aldebaran.  To the upper right of this are the Pleiades.  (The Pleiades don't show up very clearly in this photo.  They are a tighter and brighter group of stars than the Hyades.)    The Hyades are the closest star cluster to earth.  Aldebaran is not actually part of the Hyades, but happens to lie in the same direction (and is closer than the cluster).    --- edit    Your additional information that there are 15 to 20 stars makes it virtually certain that you're looking at the Hyades.  The Wikipedia article has a star map of the cluster:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyades_(sta...    There are roughly a dozen naked-eye stars in the Hyades (but the precise number depends on the quality of your vision and the darkness of the sky).    --- edit    Here's a nice photo of the Hyades (including lots of stars too dim to be seen naked-eye):  http://www.ne.jp/asahi/stellar/scenes/ob...    Note the two distinctive features:  1) a V-shaped group of stars  2) the bright star Aldebaran in the midst of the cluster    --- edit  Here's a sky chart of the Hyades, along with star magnitudes:  http://www.weasner.com/etx/buyer-newuser...    (The star magnitudes are given without decimal points -- e.g., a magnitude 6.0 star is labeled "60".)  Your estimate of 15 to 20 stars sounds just about right for a dark sky with a limiting magnitude of about 6.    Conclusion:  I'm about certain that you were looking at the Hyades, not the Pleiades.    --- edit    JAXX: I don't understand your answer.  The Trapezium is within M42 (which is the fuzzy nebula in Orion's sword), but I don't see how that's related to the question or to my answer.  To a naked-eye observer in a dark sky, the Pleiades has about 6 stars, the Hyades about 15 to 20.  The Trapezium is clearly visible in a telescope, but it is not resolvable to the naked eye.  Also, the Trapezium is not "quite a bit to the right" of Orion's belt, but below the belt.    You're questioning "to the right" versus "above".  All these things depend on what time you look at the sky.  At about 9 PM tonight, for instance, the belt is aligned from lower-left to upper-right, and the question says "parallel to the belt", so I'm assuming that an object to the upper right is a reasonable interpretation.  The Hyades are to the upper right of the belt (at 9 PM in late January), and the Pleiades are even more so.    ---     I apologize for the length of this answer.  Let me briefly summarize why I think you were looking at the Hyades rather than the Pleiades (as most other answers here say):    1) In a reasonably dark sky, most people can see 6 or 7 stars in the Pleiades, but 12 to 20 (or maybe more) stars in the Hyades.    2) There is no single star in the Pleiades that's significantly brighter than the others, but the bright star Aldebaran is located among the stars of the Hyades.|`|un0C52G8aa	As the other people have mentioned, you probably did see the Pleiades.

It's an open star cluster about 440 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus. The brightest stars are    Alcyone (apparent visual magnitude 2.86), Atlas (3.62), Electra (3.70), Maia (3.86), Merope (4.17), Taygeta (4.29), Pleione (5.09), Celaeno (5.44), Sterope (5.20). These stars are all of spectral type B, ranging in mass from 3 to 6 solar masses.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M45map...    There are more than 1000 stars in the cluster, but most of them require good telescopes and photographic exposures to see. (Binoculars will show you about 40 of them.)    The cluster's total mass is about 800 suns. The radius of the cluster core is 8 light years, and the cluster's tidal radius is about 43 light years. The Pleiades are estimated to be about 100 million years old and are predicted to have dispersed about 300 million years in the future from gravitational slingshot ejections and from tidal losses.|`|rTJeVb6Aaa	It's probably Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters.  With the naked eye, one sees only six stars but in reality there are seven.|`|juMKsO6laa	idk. the only group of stars that i know of is the '7 sisters'. six are bright and one is barely visable.|`|yOTcaxzzaa	That will be the Pleiades cluster, which is sometimes called the Seven Sisters. It's what's called an "open cluster".     The stars formed together at about the same time from the same cloud of gas and dust, and they're moving through space together. Over hundreds of millions of years, they'll start moving apart because of the gravitational influence of other stars.    Have a look at them through good binoculars. It's a gorgeous sight. There are actually a few hundred stars in the cluster.     BTW, the Japanese know the Pleiades as "Subaru". Remember the logo on the cars?

1Q9ldcWSaa	What does the C mean?  Does that mean to multiply e^t by some constant?    Here's how I solved it:    ln[x / (x-1)] = t  x / (x-1) = e^t  x = (x-1)e^t  x = xe^t - e^t  x (e^t-1) = e^t  x = e^t / (e^t - 1) = -e^t/(1 - e^t).  This resembles the suggested answer, with C = -1.        --------------  check (using the first version of the solution):    -ln((x-1)/x) = ln[x/(x-1)] = ln(x) - ln(x-1)  = ln[e^t/(e^t - 1)] - ln[e^t/(e^t - 1) - 1]  = ln[e^t/(e^t - 1)] - ln[(e^t - e^t + 1)/(e^t-1)]  = ln[e^t/(e^t - 1)] - ln[1/(e^t-1)]  = ln[e^t/(e^t-1)*(e^t-1)]  = ln(e^t)  =t    Therefore, the solution is correct.
BMEdL7lzaa	Hi,    The Mayans marked the year 2012 as the end of their CALENDAR not the end of the world. People have been looking for the end of the world to happen since it began, these predictions, all of them since the first one, which predates even the birth of Christ considerably, are merely humans attempt to deal with the concept of something that will exist beyond them because they are mortal. Another reason is merely extortion, there was one major occurance in medieval times when the Catholic Church announced an end date merely to cause peasants to donate what little wealth and assets they had in hopes of getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. Now in modern times we move to science for answers because we are slowly realizing that religion of any form or creed does not provide us with the answers we seek, so in essence science is becoming our new God, so needless to say we look to science for answers for everything including a date and time when the world ends. Unfortunatly however, as with any new mass movment in a cultured society, much ignorance is combined with what few facts we do have thus spreading mass rumor and in some cases, panic. The media, of course, milking it for all it is worth and selling it while it sells...that is why we are seeing increased programs on T.V. about doomsday scenarios, because thats the mindset of people right now, once 2012 blows over they will merely set the "End Date" back a few more years after all, werent we supposed to be royally doomed on the year 2000? So dont worry, if the world does end within the next 1,000 years, it will all be because of something humans did to themselves not some asteroid, or supernatural being, or outer space anomally we cannot control.

Sometimes it is a big difference, sometimes small. eg, the green veined white, the males have one black spot, the female have two.   This is noticable, only if youre looking for it. Similarly, the monarchs has a small difference, in the presence of webbing in one sex. Howver, some butterflies have an obvious difference - some species of swallowtail have brown females, and brightly coloured males.   Looking through a microscope will of course make it much easier.....but for your normal garden butterfly, look at the colours, and if you dont know, just enjoy their beauty.

What you have is called a 'mixture' problem. There are two ways to go about this, the easier way involves two variables but I'm not sure if you have the techniques to solve with two variables show I will show you how to do it in one variable. If you know substitution, elimination or any other 2-variable method, please feel free to say so and I will help you restructure the problem...    To begin, state that x =  of liters of orange juice at 20%.    Then, if x represents your 20% and you know you want 15L total, you will have the following:      of L at 20% = x    of L at  5% = 15 - x ..... (the total minus the x part)    Now, think about what it means to have a percentage. Percents must -always- be OF something. Which means your 20% and your 5% must be multiplied (hence the OF) by some value. So what are we taking a percentage of? We're taking the percent OF juice in a certain   of liters. We model this by:    .20(x) + .05(15 - x) = .09(15)    So what does -that- mean? It means... if I take the 20% juice and add to it some 5% juice, I'll get 9% juice. Of course, that will only happen if we figure out HOW MANY LITERS are required. To do that, we solve our equation:    .20x + .75 - .05x = 1.35    .15x = .60     x = 4    In other words, it will take 4L of the 20% (remember that we called x the number of liters of 20%) and 15-4... 11L of 5% juice to create a 9% mixture.     Hope that helps!    ~Tava
hHVMrnK3aa	With today's computing power (or even that of 10 or 15 years ago),  this doesn't pose much of a problem, at least for any relatively small set of possible addends.    The number of possible two-number sums is n * (n-1) / 2  So even if you have a hundred numbers, that is only 50 * 99 = 4950.  With 500 numbers it would be 500 * 499 / 2 = 124750.  And 1000 numbers it would be 1000 * 999 / 2 = 499500.  Even that is manageable on just a modern PC.    Read the list of numbers and store them in an array.  Compute every two-number sum and store it in another array.    For each query, you simply search the array for the closest sum.  If had a lot of queries, sort the array and use a binary search.|`|384b50a9588fff9cd42f502cf8c17721aa	cool another uwindsor student looking for solutions online.

The Sun's temperature, about 6,000 degrees at the photosphere, gives us this color. I would guess that 5.6 times 6000 would be the temperature of the other star, or there abouts. My opinion.

It did.  The evidence is overwhelming.    However, some details are not known.  Which exact lineage of therapods gave rise to birds (that a group if dinosaurs evolved into birds is certain) is one such detail.    Claiming evolution is false because of these unknown details would be the equivalent of disregarding atoms because we don't know if string theory is valid or not.|`|AA11513203	Well ... you've hit on the problem ... he has fundamental misconceptions about the nature and process of *science* itself!    There is no point in talking about phylogenetic systematics ... or even *BASIC* evolution, for that matter ... until you can explain to him how science works.    The fact that most scientists actually agree that birds evolved from dinosaurs is not the point.    The point is that disagreements over evolutionary relationships do NOT indicate that evolution *itself* is in doubt!    It is a *LOGICAL FALLACY* to think that if scientists debate whether (A) birds evolved from dinosaurs; or (B) birds evolved directly from reptiles; that it is therefore equally valid to choose (C) birds did not evolve at all!    It is the same "logic" I've seen Creationists use about the age of the earth.   If scientists are "uncertain" whether earth is (A) 4.4 billion, or (B) 4.6 billion years old; then any "uncertainty" *AT ALL* makes it just as valid to pick (C) 6,000 years old!    You need to point out that LOGICAL FALLACY.  Nothing else is relevant until you do.     The fact that scientists disagree about things does  NOT indicate a lack of confidence in the underlying theory ... but *PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE* ... their very willingness to argue openly should inspire *more* confidence in the things these scientists DO agree on!    It is always baffling to me how Creationists simultaneously complain that scientists are dogmatic and accept things without question ... and then point to the vigor with which scientists debate each other over even the tiniest of details as "evidence" of this "dogmatic thinking"!       This is why Creationists make *terrible* scientists!  It's NOT just about acceptance or rejection of scientific "dogma".   It's about the weak, muddled *thought process* that results when otherwise intelligent people have to tie logic and evidence into knots in order to justify their rejection of something that is almost universally accepted by the scientific community who do logic and evidence *for a living*.|`|1oMjCTGVaa	i don't know what "controversy" he is talking about.  he is using this word to confuse the topic when you talk with him.    firstly I think you are talking about BIOLOGICAL evolution (microevolution).  this is about the evolution of organisms, not the evolution of the universe, that is a different topic alltogether.. so specify when you are talking to anyone in the science field! just a note          there may be a lack of extensive evidence surrounding birds and their relation to dinosaurs, but this is not controversy    maybe what he is referring to is when scientists dont agree immediately on a topic.      this is the BEAUTY of science! because many scientists that disagree will work for their life to find evidence to support their ideas, and if they can find such evidence, countless scientists around the world will then re-examine their evidence, some will peer review, some will look for evidence supporting it, and others will re-test the experiments used to find the data.    this is the scientific process at its finest, not controversy.  whenever ANY new data/evidence comes up, most scientists take differing viewpoints on what it means/implicates, and in doing so ensure that it is true science (all data is accurately reported/ experiment can be repeated by anyone at anytime / evidence is solid and can be tested for its age/validity/ etc etc)        no matter what we know or dont know about the relation of birds and dinosaurs, we can examine pre human hominid skeletons  that are unquestionably related to us, yet hundreds of thousands to millions of years old.      we can also trace fossil lineage of countless current-day living (and so many non-living) organisms back to common ancestors,     so whether or not he thinks birds an dinosaurs are related (which there is immeasurable evidence to support this) he must understand the common ancestry exhibited by organism today and those fossilized remnants we continually find worldwide        the process of biological evolution seems counter intuitive, and most people I speak to who dont understand it seem to only be going on their assumptions about things "must" have happened.  with some calm, rational explanation on how genetic variation occurs, combined with natural selective processes and factors.. most people can atleast understand the basics of how biological evolution occurs|`|b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	Any discussion about the relationship of birds to dinosaurs is only a discussion of degree, not about whether evolution exists or does not exist.    There is absolutely NO CONTROVERSY within the scientific community as to the facts of evolution.  The only controversy is within the fundagelical community that comes up with ridiculous claims that they think disqualifies evolution.  Thus far, those fundagelicals have lost on every single occasion since Darwin (his 200 birthday is 2/12 ... born the same day as Abraham Lincoln) explained how life came to be on the Earth.      Tell your friend to go to college and take a SCIENCE course that has, as part of its name 'evolution' and is part of the science department, not the magic/supernatural/religious beliefs department.      Evolution is science.  Creation is religion and religion invokes the supernatural.  Once you do that, you've removed yourself from science.  Creation is an explanation looking for evidence where evolution is evidence looking for an explanation.    BTW ... evolution is called a theory because it is the unifying theme that ties all of the facts surrounding evolution (and biology) together.  Without evolution, biology makes no sense whatsoever.     Nate's reply is pure hogwash.|`|oL6FUbshaa	Fossilization is caused by flooding. Dinosaur remains worldwide are associated with water-laid sediment.    Kind of sounds like a worldwide flood doesn't it?         You see, reptiles never stop growing. It's just a simple biological fact that reptiles grow all their life and never stop until the day they die.          With that in mind, look at the genealogies from Adam and Eve up until Noah. You'll find that just about everyone back then lived to be about 900 years old, which is about 10 times longer than the average lifespan today.          Whatever it was that allowed people to live 900 years back then more than likely would not have just effected people. It probably would have effected the whole ecosystem, including lizards. If lizards lived 10 times longer back then, and reptiles keep growing until the day they die, then you can imagine how big they would have gotten.          Scientists have found fossilized remains of crocodiles that reached 40 to 50 feet in length. They've found remains of sea turtles that reached enormous sizes, much bigger than any sea turtles today.         Fossilization is a very rare and unusual occurance, not an everyday event. According to the best available evidence, animals and plants cannot become fossils unless they are buried relatively quickly and deeply in the appropriate materials.          What conditions would be most ideal for the kind of massive fossil formations found in the sediments? Creation Scientists believe it would be a violent, global flood catastrophe.         Well, it just so happens that the Bible talks about a flood like that. And isn't it a coincidence that it occurred in the days when reptiles and lizards would have gotten really big?          The fact that we are digging up remains of enormous reptiles and lizards up out of the ground, most of which are completely fossilized, this gives us ample scientific evidence that living things really did live 10 times longer back then, and there really was a worldwide flood.         Dinosaur remains do not contradict the Bible, they confirm the Bible.         Radiometric dating methods have been found to be very questionable and many times inaccurate. New rock in the form of hardened lava flows produced estimated ages as great as 3 billion to 10.5 billion years when they were actually less than 200 years old. (Journal of Geophysical Research)    Shells from living snails were carbondated around 27,000 years.(Science Magazine)  They were still alive! But according to carbondating, they died 27,000 years ago. Yea right.    Creation Scienists suspect dinosaurs did not become extinct until about 3 or 4 thousand years ago.|`|SR0hYSqGaa	One way to explain it would be to say all life on Earth is united by evolutionary history; we are all evolutionary cousins  twigs on the tree of life. Phylogenetic systematics is the formal name for the field within biology that reconstructs evolutionary history and studies the patterns of relationships among organisms. Unfortunately, history is not something we can see. It has only happened once and only leaves behind clues as to what happened. Systematists use these clues to try to reconstruct evolutionary history.     Faith can be stronger than science - but the 2 do not have to contradict each other.|`|MzJ4qLQ8aa	Its because evolution is not true. Many scientists use examples of microevolution as macroevolution, which is completely dishonest. Microevolution is evolution between a species of animal such as a robin changing into a blue jay over time or all the finch types that are out there. Macroevolution is the transition between two totally different types of animals, like a pig evolving into a dog. If such a crazy thing did occur, there would always be the remanants of these "transitional" animals. An example of that would be a creature half way in between a pig in a dog. There is no record of any transitional fossils EVER being found. If animals were evolving into new types of animals, there would be transitional fossils all over the place. Evolution is just not factual; I have no idea why they even teach it in schools.|`|DXrdrEJraa	Evolution is a natural process that happens over thousands and millions of years. We as human beings have only been around for a relatively small fraction of the Earth's existence, so we don't know exactly how things took place millions of years ago. We have to investigate through the relatedness of organisms' DNA and life processes, and through the fossil record and the geology of the Earth. Of course there is controversy when studying million-year-old history. None of us were there, nor could we live long enough to actually witness evolution taking place anyway!    The important things that people need to remember about evolution are:  1) It "starts" with a random mutation that is genetically encoded (i.e. a mutated gene), and those genes are passed along to an organism's progeny. Reproduction = passing genes along.  2) If a mutation is harmful to an organism, it does not help the organism survive and/or reproduce. Therefore it would not be passed on (because the organism dies before it is able to reproduce or it is hindered from reproducing in some way) and nothing evolves to possess that mutation. But if the mutation is helpful to the organism's survival and/or reproduction, it passes the mutation along (in the genes!) until most or all of its species possess the mutation. This is called natural selection, because nature is "selecting" the mutations that best benefit a species. (Note there is no actual, cognitive decision-making here. "Selection" is a personifying quality given to natural biological processes.)  3) Evolution happens over MILLIONS of years. People say "I did not evolve from a monkey," and this is an ignorant statement. The theory is that people and apes evolved from a common ancestor, not from each other. And again, it's called a "theory" because none of us can witness it personally!    Hope this helps :)      **Oh, and as for Nate's response...what do you think of the lungfish? This is a living example of the transition between life in the water and life on land! Do some research before you go saying that there are NO transitional fossils out there. Check out http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-tran... - especially the "Why are there gaps?" section.**|`|knnOfPw8aa	I agree with nate. there is no real evidence for evolution. It is just an excuse not to believe in God. they use evolution to prove evolution which obviously doesn't work. The fossil record and geologic record don't even match up with what is in the ground. And there are no transitional fossils. Its not even a law that's why they call it a THEORY

3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	Spain to inaugurate world's biggest telescope          July 13 2007 at 01:07AM          BY Sinikka Tarvainen    Madrid - How was the universe born? What happens in distant galaxies? Are we alone in the universe?    The study of astrophysics is about to take a step forward when Spain inaugurates the world's biggest optical telescope, known as the GTC or Grantecan, which are abbreviations for "large telescope of the Canary Islands."    On Friday night, the gigantic telescope is due to peer into space for the first time. The ceremony, to be attended by Crown Prince Felipe, launches a final test phase after which the GTC is due to become operational next year.    'The bigger the mirror, the more light the telescope can capture'   The telescope has a primary mirror measuring 10.4m in diameter, the biggest among only about 10 telescopes of a comparable size in the world.    "The bigger the mirror, the more light the telescope can capture and the further it can see," Pedro Alvarez, director of the GTC project, explained.    The telescope will be able to see into galaxies millions of light years away and to spot dim planets which have gone undetected by less powerful equipment.    The telescope costing nearly 130-million (about R1,3-billion) took seven years to build, four years longer than planned.    The delay was caused partly by difficulties in hauling parts of the telescope weighing a total of 500 tons to a height of 2 400m in the rough weather conditions of the winter months.    The GTC is located at the astrophysical research station of Roque de los Muchachos at the highest point of the Canary Island of La Palma, where it rises above the clouds to watch a clear sky.    In contrast to an older generation of telescopes, the primary mirror of which consists of one piece, the curved mirror of the Canaries telescope will be formed by 36 hexagonal pieces.    Only 12 of the pieces have been installed so far, but that is sufficient for initial test runs.    Because light travels at a speed of 300 000km per second, telescopes are able to record images of events which occurred thousands of millions of years ago.    The GTC will look into galaxies in their formation process, enhancing understanding about how the universe was born.    It may also discover new planetary systems.    "It would be wonderful if this telescope allowed us to detect a planet like ours," Alvarez said, adding that the Earth was unlikely to be the only planet with conditions favourable to life.    "The problem is, that the universe is so immense in size and time, that the possibility of detecting other planets with characteristics similar to ours is really remote," he told the daily El Mundo.    The telescope has been financed by the Spanish and regional Canaries authorities, with partner universities in Mexico and the United States covering about 10 percent of the cost. - Sapa-dpa    Also see http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/SKA.asp

In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which three phases (for example, gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium.[1] For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of ?38.8344 C and a pressure of 0.2 mPa.    In addition to the triple point between solid, liquid, and gas, there can be triple points involving more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. Helium-4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases (see lambda point). In general, for a system with p possible phases, there are  triple points.[1]    The triple point of water is used to define the kelvin, the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature.[2] The number given for the temperature of the triple point of water is an exact definition rather than a measured quantity. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in the ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K).    Contents [hide]  1 Triple point of water   2 Triple point cells   3 Table of triple points   4 References   5 See also          [edit] Triple point of water  Main article: Water (molecule) Triple point     A typical phase diagram. The dotted green line gives the anomalous behaviour of waterThe single combination of pressure and temperature at which water, ice, and water vapour can coexist in a stable equilibrium occurs at exactly 273.16 K (0.01 C) and a partial vapour pressure of 611.73 pascals (ca. 6.1173 millibars, 0.0060373057 atm). At that point, it is possible to change all of the substance to ice, water, or vapor by making arbitrarily small changes in pressure and temperature. Note that even if the total pressure of a system is well above 611.73 pascals (e.g. normal atmospheric pressure), if the partial pressure of the water vapour is 611.73 pascals then the system can still be brought to the triple point of water. Strictly speaking, the surfaces separating the different phases should also be perfectly flat, to avoid the effects of surface tensions.    Water has an unusual and complex phase diagram, although this does not affect general comments about the triple point. At high temperatures, increasing pressure results first in liquid and then solid water. (Above around 109 Pa a crystalline form of ice forms that is denser than liquid water.) At lower temperatures under compression, the liquid state ceases to appear, and water passes directly from gas to solid.    At constant pressures above the triple point, heating ice causes it to pass from solid to liquid to gas, or steam, also known as water vapor. At pressures below the triple point, such as those that occur in outer space, where the pressure is near zero, liquid water cannot exist. In a process known as sublimation, ice skips the liquid stage and becomes steam when heated.    The triple point pressure of water was used during the Mariner 9 mission to Mars as a reference point to define "sea level". More recent missions use laser altimetry and gravity measurements instead of pressure to define elevation on Mars.[3]      [edit] Triple point cells  Triple point cells are useful in the calibration of thermometers. For exacting work, triple point cells are typically filled with a highly pure chemical substance such as hydrogen, argon, mercury, or water (depending on the desired temperature). The purity of these substances can be such that only one part in a million is a contaminant; what is called six-nines" because it is 99.9999 % pure. When it is a water-based cell, a special isotopic composition called VSMOW is used because it is very pure and produces temperatures that are more comparable from lab to lab. Triple point cells are so effective at achieving highly precise, reproducible temperatures, an international calibration standard for thermometers called ITS90 relies upon triple point cells of hydrogen, neon, oxygen, argon, mercury, and water for delineating six of its defined temperature points.

So to not see something you would either have to     1.make light go completely through the object so it reflects to your eyes from whatever is behind it.    2. Bend light around the object from the back to the front of it, so that the light reflecting off whatever is behind the object enters your eyes and you dont see the object itself.

b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	One of the effects of exercise in a poorly conditioned person is that they produce lactic acid (LA).  LA is produced because they cannot supply enough oxygen to oxidize (in the mitochondria) pyruvic acid (PA).  PA comes from the anaerobic breakdown of glucose.  LA interferes with the enzymatic breakdown of ATP (ATP is the only direct source of energy for cellular function).  Thus, the muscles remain tight.    However, a side effect of LA is it also stimulates the body to grow more capillaries in the lungs and muscles (actually, everywhere) as well as more mitochondria.  With more capillaries, more oxygen can get into the blood and muscle cells.  Thus, when PA is formed, there are more mitochondria to use the increased amount of oxygen and more energy is released for the rephosphorlation of ADP back into ATP.  When this situation exists, more carbon dioxide (co2) and water (h2o) is produced.      When you exercise, the rate of cellular respiration increases ... that means more co2 is produced.  When co2 is mixed with water, it forms an acid, carbonic acid (h2co3).  Thus, the bromothyl blue (BTB) turned yellow.  The better shape you're in, the more co2 you'll produce and the more h2co3 will be made immediately after exercising and the BTB will change more quickly.      If you're in good shape, the rate of co2 will peak and drop off quickly.   If you're in poor shape, the rate of co2 will rise some and stay increased for a longer period of time.      The simple formula for cellular respiration is glucose + oxygen gives co2 and h2o (c6h12o6 + 6 o2 -> 6 co2 +  6 h2o.

73D8PfMQaa	Enzyme (usually proteins sometimes RNA, as in ribozyme) are catalyst. The speed the rate of a chemical reaction but are not permanently altered in the reaction. Enzymes combine with their substrate to form a temporary enzyme-substrate complex. The chemical reaction takes place but the products are still in the ACTIVE SITE of the enzyme (the site that binds the initial substrate) and know we have an enzyme-product complex, finally the product is released into the cytoplasm, or the nucleus, etc. Many enzyme also have a site remote from the active site called an ALLOSTERIC site which can bind allosteric ACTIVATORS or INHIBITORS, this will cause a conformational change ( a shift in the three-dimensional structure of a protein) so that it will have higher affinity for the substrate (Allosteric activators) or less affinity (with allosteric inhibitors). These inhibitors are called Non-competitive inhibitors, competitive inhibitors bind to the ACTIVE SITE and until they are present the substrate cannot bind hence the enzyme is INHIBITED. Many enzyme that catalyze the rate-limiting step of a metabolic pathway are allosteric types, when a product accumulates down the pathway it merely binds to the allosteric site and acts as an inhibitor to prevent the cell from making more of a product when it is not needed and is accumulating, this prevents the cell from wasting energy. The specificity of an enzyme is determined by two factors: first and foremost the 3D structure of the active site and the 3D structure of the substrate, weather or not the substrate can fit into the active site of an enzyme. It also depends on what amino acid side chains are present in the active site and weather or not the substrate is able to bind to the active site chemically. I am not able to draw a graph hear but if you imagine one where the rate of the reaction increases as a function of substrate concentration until the maximum velocity (Vm) is reached and then levels off at high substrate concentrations as all available binding sites become saturated. If you take half of the maximum velocity you will get the Km value which basically gives the amount of substrate required for the enzyme to operate at 1/2 of the maximum velocity. This is more ore less the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, hence the smaller the Km, the less substrate is required to run at 1/2 of the maximum velocity therefore the enzyme has a higher specificity for that particular substrate.<br>  <br>  Well, hope that explains everything

Ip34YW45aa	The birds weight times its velocity is its momentum. So 320*6. The insects velocity is 12*30. Once they hit their momentum will be (320*6)-(12*30) since they are traveling in opposite directions. That will give you the final momentum. To find the speed divide the final momentum by the total weight which is the birds weight plus the insects weight since they are one mass now. Good Luck
irFvDZmNaa	They are all related, but also distinct. Ok, DNA never leaves the nucleus of your cells. DNA is all of the instructions for your body/cells/organs/appearance, etc. In order to make a protein, you need ribosomes. However, ribosomes are NOT in the nucleus. Therefore, DNA must somehow make proteins without leaving the nucleus. <br>  <br>  This is where RNA comes in. First, DNA transcribes a message, RNA enters the nucleus and copies the message. Therefore, Transcription occurs in the nucleus. RNA is then carried OUT of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm in search for a ribosome. The ribosome then translate the message. <br>  <br>  This message could be for a hormone, enzyme, or any other type of protein. Anyway, the point is, RNA goes into the nucleus and transcribes the DNA message, and then, RNA leaves the nucleus and translate it on a ribosome. These RNA also have special names. For instance, the RNA that carries the message from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is called "transfer RNA (tRNA). Also, where proteins are made, are called Ribosomal RNA (rRNA). <br>  <br>  So the main theme is this. DNA makes RNA makes Proteins.

Conduction is not as fast.<br>  myelinated: impulses kinda jump.  Conduction is faster. Depends on saltatory conduction (which is otherwise known as action potential).

Without enzymes, most biochemical reactions would be too slow to even carry out life processes.  Enzymes display great specificity and are not permanently modified by their participation in reactions.  Since they are not changed during the reactions, it is cost-effective to use them more than once.  However, if the enzymes are in solution with the reactants and/or products it is difficult to separate them.  Therefore, if they can be attached to the reactor in some way, they can be used again after the products have been removed.  The term "immobilized" means unable to move or stationary.  And that is exactly what an immobilized enzyme is:  an enzyme that is physically attached to a solid support over which a substrate is passed and converted to product.

4dfb50c93c55cdae3f91ba3dc5f1d89baa	Der Zuckerschock, auch hypoglyk?mischer Schock genannt, tritt bei Diabetikern ein, wenn eine extreme Unterzuckerung vorliegt. Diese kann durch überm??ige Zufuhr von Insulin, das Auslassen einer oder mehrer Mahlzeiten oder extreme k?rperliche Belastung ohne entsprechender Therapieanpassung verursacht werden.<br>  <br>  <br>  Der Zuckerschock kann schon innerhalb weniger Minuten eintreten und wird vor allem von Diabetikern, die schon lange mit ihrer Krankheit leben, untersch?tzt und unter Umst?nden gar nicht erkannt.<br>  <br>  <br>  Die Folge dieses schwerwiegenden Zuckermangels reichen von Unwohlsein bis zu Bewusstlosigkeit, die von blasser Hautf?rbung und der Neigung zum Schwitzen begleitet wird. Bei sehr tiefen Glukosewerten kann die Ohnmacht in einzelnen F?llen auch zum Tod führen.<br>  <br>  Wichtig ist hier:<br>  <br>  So lange die Person noch ansprechbar und f?hig ist, etwas zu schlucken, kann Traubenzucker oder ein zuckerhaltiges Getr?nk gegeben werden. Geht es der Person besser sollte sie etwas essen (Brot, Kekse, Banane, Gummib?rchen etc.) und es sollte umgehend nach der Ursache dieses Zustandes geforscht werden!!!<br>  <br>  Ist die Person bewusstlos AUF KEINEN FALL versuchen Traubenzucker oder ein Getr?nk zu geben.<br>  SOFORT den Notarzt informieren, die Person in die stabile Seitenlage bringen und zusehen, das die Atemwege frei bleiben.<br>  <br>  Menschen mit einem Typ1 Diabetes tragen in den meisten F?llen ein kleines orangenes K?stchen mit sich herum. Das ist ein sog. Hypo-Kit. Darin befindet sich eine Ampulle mit Glucagon die man mit Wasser aufl?sen muss und dem Patienten spritzen muss.  Eine Kurzanleitung ist in diesem K?stchen als Piktogramm dagestellt, so das auch ein Laie diese L?sung spritzen kann. Hierbei ist es nicht wichtig, das man voher die Injektionsstelle desinfiziert, oder den Menschen auszieht, um eine geeignete Stelle zu suchen. Die L?sung kann einfach z.B. durch die Hose in den Oberschenkel gespritzt werden. DAS KANN LEBEN RETTEN! Im Normalfall ist der Patient nach ca. 10 Min. wieder bei Bewusstsein.<br>  <br>  Trotzdem sollte der Notarzt kommen um weitere therapeutische Massnahmen ein zu leiten!!<br>  <br>  Auch hier muss nach der Ursache des Zustandes geforscht werden.<br>  <br>  Sollte sich hier heraus stellen, das der Patient wegen eines zu hohen Zuckes bewusstlos geworden ist, ist die zus?tzliche Gabe von Glucose durch diese Spritze troztdem kein Fehler!!!<br>  <br>  H?rt sich komisch an, aber das was man dann an Glucose auf den sowieso zu hohen Zucker noch drauf legt, ist dann nicht der Rede wert.<br>  <br>  Und noch eine Bitte:<br>  <br>  In solchen Situationen, in denen man meint, man selbst oder jemand anderes steckt grad in einem Unterzucker: Keine Zeit mit aufwendigen Blutzuckermessungen verschwenden!!<br>  Dafür ist die Zeit zu knapp!!<br>  <br>  Devise bei einem Unterzucker:<br>  <br>  ERST essen, DANN messen!!<br>  <br>  Es ist nicht wichtig zu wissen, ob der Zucker grad nur 24 mg/dl ist, oder ob man grad seinen pers?nlichen Rekord gebrochen hat.

MMUGLjsPaa	The first usable star map (that we have a record of) comes from the cave at Lascaux, France (see link below) from roughly Circa 16000 BCE. Many ancient a prehistoric peoples kept and published detailed star maps and catalogs.  <br>  <br>  The ancient Babylonians scheme of constellations, excepting for the development of the zodiacal scheme of 12 constellations, was mostly finalised by the late 2nd-millennium BCE (i.e., near the end of the Cassite Period circa 1160 BCE)<br>  <br>  The oldest catalog that we can tie an author to is the Chinese astronomer Shin Shen (Circa 350 BCE) who created a star Catalog of about 800 stars.  <br>  <br>  Next we have the Phainomena of Aratus (circa 275 BCE) 44 constellations are named. <br>  <br>  Next Hipparchus established the concepts star magnitude and the "celestial sphere". However, Hipparchus did not survive antiquity. Ptolemy in the Almagest (circa 140 CE) largely copied and commented on Hipparchus's work. This is really the first star catalog.<br>  <br>  Star catalogs and maps have continued to be improved in modern times but they still have there roots in the works of pre-historic and ancient man.
Gnfc4wRlaa	The Greek Aristarchus of Samos, in the 3rd century BC, was the first known person to speculate that the Earth revolved around a stationary sun, although this teaching was also considered Pythagorean.  (Pythagoras however, speculated that the planets and the Sun revolved around a central fire).  It was not until 1,800 years later, however, in the 16th century, that the Polish mathematician and astronomer Copernicus presented a fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric system, which was later elaborated and expanded by Johannes Kepler.|`|O8qyhAegaa	Yajnavalkya was from India|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Contrary to popular belief, Copernicus was not the first person to propose a sun-centered Solar System.

AwKsLPsBaa	It depends where you are working and where you go in that part. I was working as a structural engineer and got 43,000. But with the current economic state I was laid off and now going back to school... It really depends on your location, the company your working with, and type of work that you are doing. If you work with the government you typically make a few grand less than private firms. Here its like 38,000 for just a general engineer for the governement. When I say here I mean Buffalo New York. So I would say expect a slight increase in major cities. Plus you could do google searches of who makes what in different cities and its pretty accurate.|`|Dv7340P0aa	$28,000 a year.
