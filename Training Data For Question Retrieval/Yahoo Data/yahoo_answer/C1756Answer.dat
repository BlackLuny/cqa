There is no way you can hope to train entire armies up to SF levels, as the costs are too high.

Failure to look properly is a killer and will not and cannot ever be tackled by camera's and limiters.<br>  <br>  Look further into the galileo requirements and points used to force it on the EU. Among them is taking control of your car should it (spy in the sky) think you are going to have an accident. Recent white paper also mentions the cost, you guessed it, we pay.|`|4SZyaMHEaa	Its time for your mum to be controlled by satellite|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	That is absolutely off the wall!|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! Imagine travelling along a main road behind a pootler who only drives at 35-40 mph everywhere....you go to overtake, as soon as you'd touch 60mph, your engine would cut out. If a car came in the other direction it could prove fatal. What would you suggest...everyone stay behind the pootler in a mile long snake?<br>  It's important to be able to exceed the limit at times....it's the wallies that drive at 40-50 through a 30 limit that are dangerous.<br>  The 70mph limit on motorways is much too low...it was introduced in the 1960s when cars could only go around 80mph max and they took ages to stop. Today cars are capable of going much faster, more safely and stop in a fraction of the distance that the old Ford Anglias, Austin A40s etc could. Has the limit been raised??...no...it's still a lumbering 70mph.<br>  Drive along any motorway on a dry , clear day and the MAJORITY of cars will be travelling at over the speed limit....80-90mph. Are these people ALL nutters and boy racers?...of course not....but in the eyes of the law, they are all criminals.<br>  As most think that 80-90 is a safe speed to drive and they're comfortable with it, why don't they raise the limit to 90mph?<br>  Sure you'll get the odd nutter driving at 122mph and tail-gating, but they do that now anyway. It's about time the real menaces are targetted, not ordinary people driving at a safe speed, leaving a safe gap.<br>  <br>  As for morons putting people's lives at risk...what about the pootlers who refuse to overtake, say, a tractor travelling at 20mph....the person behind him/her doesn't have the acceleration to overtake two vehicles safely, the fourth in line is then forced to overtake 3 vehicles....OK if you've got a Porsche or Subaru but dangerous in a family car.<br>  If there was a crash....the pootler who caused it would probably be oblivious to the carnage he/she will have caused and go pootling on their way as usual.<br>  <br>  Dick F....you've hit the nail on the head...well said!|`|uuqGd9GWaa	No, I don't think so.  If I'm rushing a family member to the hospital I want to be able to exceed the limits when it's safe for me to do so.  I would much rather see a change in the way they decide speed limits.  If the DOT was required to leave a stretch of road unregulated for a few weeks while monitoring the average speed of motorist using that road, they would learn what the real and comfortable limit is.  If the majority of drivers are driving between 45 and 50mph and there are no accidents or no more than the average number of accidents for comparable stretches of road, then set the limit at 50.  Many times you will find such roads marked as a 35mph speed zone and not one car in fifty will stay within the limit.  Moving violation laws are all on the books so the police can stop and ticket people who are endangering others.  Once the law is on the books they will stop you just because it's the law, whether anyone else is endangered or not.  I'd love the law to require the officer to cite how you were endangering others, or the ticket would be invalid.  It's never effected me one way or another.  I've been a licensed driver for 53 years and never cited into court for a moving violation.  I've been careful, driven defensive, and lucky because there wasn't a cop around when I've wanted to see "what the car had".|`|bxlYleZkaa	NO!! This is yet another way of controlling peoples movements and making sure the government knows where they are and what they are doing..
WT7Gub0Xaa	As someone who lives in a very rural area, i can say that reducing the speed limit to 50mph on rural roads will cause problems in terms of more accidents.<br>  The reason is <br>  People from city areas and tourists are not familiar with driving on rural roads and quite often usually drive at 30mph when it is perfectly safe to travel faster.<br>  Local people who are more familiar with driving at higher speeds therefore overtake in order to drive at there normal journey speeds.<br>  if the speed limits were changed, then it would make overtaking a more dangerous manoeuvre as more time would be needed to overtake safely <br>  It would als lead to longer tailbacks of traffic, with local drivers becoming impatient, and people driving too close to the vehicle in front so rear end shunts would increase.<br>  Unfortunately we live in a country where descisions are made without proper research, or consultation, and this will obvisously happen in this case, with the  population of rural communities will having no say in the reduction of speed limits.,  It will be decided by politicians who proberbly can not even drive a car<br>  .|`|MR9iBgafaa	Rural roads aren't usually congested.  We live in the hills and the one rural road leading out of the village has a 50mph speed limit.  I have to say it's a good idea as there's a lot of blind bends and dips in the road.  Average speed cameras will ensure obedience rather than the traffic doing 80mph and then slowing down for speed cameras.<br>  <br>  I do hate the number of speed cameras in the UK though, as it is used as a tax on the motorist.  They should only be used in accident prone areas.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	It's pathetic. Modern vehicles are capable of travelling at higher speeds and the braking systems are much better, so this has nothing to do with avoiding accidents. I don't think a reduction of ten miles per hour will do anything to reduce carbon emissions either. What about the ever-growing increase in the number of aircraft using our airspace and the emissions from power stations? I see it as yet another way to extract money from motorists as there will no doubt be more cameras and more fines, as you have pointed out.|`|AA12121752	They won't be happy until the country is completely stationary in every way.|`|5jxEyMoPaa	it has only ever been about raising funds if you sit down and think where some of the speed cameras are, it does not make sense, in built up areas fine i agree with them it may and note i did say may stop people getting run over but on the m25 variable speed limit there, s cameras that,s about controlling traffic not saving life , who is going to walk across the m25 in rush hour. The A38 in devon straight duel carriageway for miles no houses around  and yes another speed camera just in front of a bridge so you can,t see it, you would need a taxi for 10 miles to get there to cross the road, the reason i say it may save life's is because where i live there is a camera and now they have put a zebra crossing about 30 metres away from it,now i don,t know about you but when i go through a camera my eyes are on my speedo because i don,t want points and a fine, by the time i have gone through and look up i am already on the crossing, some one will get killed there|`|skgN9TJLaa	I think you'll find on some country roads it's hard to do 60 with all the twists and turns, I think it's a good idea on some country roads but i can't see the police been on the remote country roads with speed cameras. Maybe fixed cameras.|`|xboDUtI2aa	It's a fine, not a tax.  Don't go over 50, you don't get fined.  It's quite simple really.|`|26t0dbQ5aa	No its a good idea. I would reduce it to 40mph. Also more speed cameras would be a good idea.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Nope. It's a way of reducing CO2 emissions and to save lives.

sBKun272aa	Cyclones get weaker as they get further away from the equator because they lose the warm water they need to gain their energy from.

f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	The Arts have a lot of use during times of recession. Encouraging them in any way is welcome and necessary.

xU7AaQOdaa	I was young when the Aberfan tragedy took place- link below-, and at the time my Brother in Law, a Miner, worked all the hours sent in order to rescue anyone who could still be alive in the slurry. He was not alone in this, as he told me that Miners from as far afield as Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire made a quick dash to South Wales to assist in any way they could. <br>  <br>  When all that could be done had been done, he tells me that they went for a Pint, and some smart a**e made a "joke".

It's almost self preservation. Healthcare, armed forces, etc..<br>  <br>  Of course there are times when it is not appropriate - seen it many times on here, it is often just another form of attention seeking. However there is undoubtedly a new phenomena of humour at things that are no laughing matter and circulating them via mobile cameras and the Internet...sociopaths appear to be on the increase as people seem numbed to the pain of others.

However, as a counsellor I also understood that it's human nature to deal with darkness and fear via humour.  <br>  <br>  Incidents like 9/11 are so overwhelming and incomprehensible.  They scare, worry and confuse us, and we use humour as a defence.<br>  <br>  There will always be "humourous" responses to terrible events, but there will also always be a time and a place.

But as with most groups there are the die hard ones and the moderates.Obama is looking for cooperation from the moderates. Al Quaida on the other hand is a group founded by Osama Bin Laded originally to fight the Russian presence in Afghanistan. Once the Russians were chased out with the help of the US Al Quaida was left holding the bag. We used them and then abandoned them. That's when Osama turned from alley to bitter enemy of the US. Moderates among the Taliban could be an organizing force to end the violence while Al Quaida looks like they will be oppositional to the end.

That leaves American sympathisers and even they may not be so keen on supporting terrorism post 9/11. <br>  <br>  PSNI Chief Constable has said that soldiers will not be patrolling the street again and having seen the difference between pre and post peace Northern Ireland, I don't think the dissidents will get the popular support that the IRA did.|`|DEglvDGDaa	This attack I think has nothing to do directly with the economic situation, We have a group of players here who after PIRA decided on the peace route have sat and stewed for a few years and grown to hate peace.<br>  <br>  People need to realise the scum who did this are trying to destroy the peace process. They are hoping it will be put down to PIRA and the old dark days would return through resentment etc.<br>  <br>  I do not think PIRA have gone away but I do not believe them now to be involved in any form of terrorism,  but I have a feeling that if PIRA get their hands on those responsible for this attack there will not be much left for the Northern Ireland Police force to clean up afterwards<br>  <br>  only the mad, evil  and the sick want a return to the old days|`|bGuVAltxaa	It doesn't have anything to do with the state of the economy, the last year or so has seen a bit of a rise in attacks on Police and Army but nothing that even compares to what is used to be like, these dissident Republicans are very small in number but they will never accept anything but the British out of all of Ireland, but they won't be allowed to wreck peace in this country, the consequences would be too much if they where.|`|8tcaTrIvaa	That attack was more similar to those in Iraq.

fWP8aBpsaa	I think we need a full public inquiry into what happened.  The air needs clearing, no matter how bad it might be for former US/UK politicians.<br>  <br>  HM Government appears to be attempting to cover up that it not only lied when it said it didn't know of torture happening but was complicit in rendering people to other countries to be tortured and present when some of this torture took place.<br>  <br>  Torture is unacceptable if only because of the following SELFISH reasons:<br>  1.  It produces unreliable information.  Those being tortured have a tendency to tell you want you want to hear, regardless of whether they know what they are talking about.<br>  2. In the vain hope that other nations won't do it to us.  If we don't torture, we maintain the moral high ground.  When one of out soldiers is captured, we can quite rightly kick up a stink to high heaven about how unacceptable torture is.  How can we do that with a straight face when we have done it our self?<br>  <br>  The second point is perhaps the golden reason why the Geneva Conventions exist.  It isn't about "liberal do-gooders" and all that rubbish, its about the slightly selfish notion of preventing it the worst excesses of war happening to ourselves.<br>  <br>  At the moment, it appears that the UK and US may have broken that protocol.

It is up to Gerry Adams and his bunch of IRA/SINN FEIN brigade who know exactly who these people are that carried out the awful murders last night to get rid off them right away, because he is under pressure, big time. The IRA war is all about creating a united Ireland and at this moment in time nobody wants a united ireland because there economy is in dire straights, to the point they may not have money in the next few months to meet public spending, which will soon create civil unrest due to greed.

4bqm1zTCaa	Most people that are against it have NEVER even smoked it !!!  It's ironic when it's an acceptable behavior in society to drink and get drunk and pop as many pills as you want, as long as they are from a doctor, but smoke a little weed and IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD. Our government in the USA is the biggest drug dealer in the world with all the pills for everything they CRAM DOWN OUR THROATS with all there ads on tv to take a pill for this and take a pill for that BUT THAT'S fine, so people think. Shows us all how STUPID you all are for falling into the GENOCIDE that our government has put upon us with all of these TOXIC CHEMICALS. Think about it this way. Weed is NATURAL and God made it. ALL OTHERS are made by man. WHO DO YOU TRUST ? Man or God !!!!|`|SjTAVdcKaa	That's a tuf call.

If I was stoned at the time, no way! all I wanna do is chill - voting would be too much like hard work, and I'd probably be paranoid that they're only doing it so they can tax us on it.<br>  <br>  Without the weed I'd probably be a lot less peaceful & intimidate fellow voters into voting for it ;)<br>  <br>  EDIT: I cannot agree with the next answer [Sunday morning NIkki]. I don't have the stats to hand but the majority of people have tried it before adulthood. Many teenagers try it BECAUSE it's illegal & therefore taboo  & non-conformist. Prohibition of any kind doesn't work, it just drives the market underground and by virtue, out of control.|`|krgtMHx7aa	I would vote to legalize it.  That being said I am a middle class 40 something married woman, not your typical "pothead".  There are legitimate uses for weed.  I have severe chronic pain that no prescription drug seems to help.  The only thing that gives me any relief is weed.  I only smoke 1-2 times a month (although not right now due to other reasons) and I can function.  My doctor had me taking vicodin, ultram, and flexeral all at the same time and it didn't even begin to touch my pain.  Can people abuse it?  Of course, just like they can abuse alcohol and "legal" prescription drugs.  Can it become a "gateway drug"?  It can, but then so can any other drug legal or otherwise.  If someone wants to be a junkie they will find a way no matter what the substance.|`|cIttXzrwaa	Yes!  With restrictive laws providing it only be sold to persons over the age of 21.  The sale of hemp would create a lot of tax dollars and stimulate the economy.  Not only can you smoke it, it is used in many medicines and it makes great rope.|`|zhahn0oRaa	Yes I would vote to have it legalized, <br>  because it will still be used even if it remains illegal.<br>  Now if it were legalized then you could just buy it without the danger of being offered class "A" drugs which is the current situation|`|JW1tsvDnaa	Yes I would but only for over 21s.|`|1gTfgzNtaa	I would have to say I would vote to make it marijuana legal.  The reason why I say that is because alcohol is legal and that is a much more dangerous drug.  Alcohol alters your reaction time, your thought process, and your frame of mind, the same as weed.  The only difference is that weed is illegal right now.  Most countries have legalized it and seen a drop in crime since having it done.  And just because it is legal, that does not mean that more people would do it.  The best way to compare it to look at the prohibition time with alcohol in the 1920's.  Crime was at an all time high, gangsters came into the picture and crime just ran rampant.  After prohibition was repeal, the crime stopped and all violence related to it had ceased and they turned to other things instead.  Now look at today, weed has the same thing happen and legalizing it would stop a lot of violence over a simple plant.  <br>  <br>  I would legalize it for personal use for growing and transporting but not for someone carrying a certain amount over the limit.  That way, you still can fight the war against the large cartel trafficking but cease to load up our jails with people who were caught with stems and joints(complete waist of time and taxpayer money).  This way it would cut down our jail population for use of real criminals and save the taxpayer some money by letting law enforcement fight real crime.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind you would still have to pass drug tests if you have that kind of job that requires it and not drive or work under the influence(same as alcohol), but at least you would not get in trouble for smoking a joint on your porch.<br>  <br>  Weed is not a gateway drug as I am proof.  I smoke weed when I was younger several times a week, but never did anything else.  I barely drink alcohol anymore.  Marijuana needs to be legal period, we would be much happier as a whole and not so stressed out.|`|AvHeAvvVaa	I would vote to legalize it. I don't smoke it.  I don't like it.  I live in California where medical marijuana is legal.  My mom ate it cooked in brownies when she was dying of cancer.  I walked into the house and noticed she was happier and excited to see that I had brought some pastries.  I immediately knew without asking that she was stoned - well after all, I grew up in the 70's near Berkeley.  lol.  <br>  <br>  The trouble with the medical marijuana law in California is that there are many people who have the cards who really don't qualify. It makes the whole thing look silly.   They've had some issues with problems at the dispensing clubs.  It would be a whole lot better if they would legalize it, and place restrictions on it so that minors don't buy it.  They could be the same restrictions we already place on alcohol and cigarettes.  The government would be able to control its sale, just like they already do with alcohol, cigarettes and presumption drugs.  Prohibition didn't work in the 20's/30's.  It isn't working now.  Anyone who wants to can buy marijuana.|`|uuqGd9GWaa	I would decriminalize all drugs, and control and tax their sales much as we do alcoholic products.  That would take all the profit margin out of it for the illegal trafficers, and that whole chaotic mess would go quietly into history like the Chicago mobs of prohibition days.  We've been fighting "the war on drugs" for decades, and untold billions of taxpayer dollars later.  The results?  We've lost the war.  You can buy any kind of drug you want in almost any little town or burg in the nation.  If we decriminalize drugs it won't flood the streets with them, because the streets are already flooded with them.  The only difference will be the government will take in a fortune in taxes rather than spending a fortune in taxpayers money to fight it.  The druggy wins too.  He would have a controlled and regulated product.  In the illegal trade you can never know for sure what you are buying.  Of course Congress would have it's feelings hurt because they seem to think you can fix a problem by passing a law.  This would be one more classic example proving them wrong.  Outlawing drugs has been on their books longer than I've been alive (and I was born during the depression), and their laws haven't even slowed the manufacture, importation, and sales of illegal drugs.  By the way, I've never used recreational drugs even once.  The few times I've wanted to "party" alcohol was readily available and legal, quality controlled and a known effect, so the only personal axe I have to grind is my taxpayer dollars being blown on jousting with windmills.|`|muX5G72Vaa	No. A lot of people take drugs to escape from the real world, from all the stress, etc. But it's dangerous because you can get addicted and it could ruin your life forever. You could end up losing friends, falling out with your family, becoming violent and getting into trouble with the police....<br>  <br>  So I say no, I wouldn't.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Absolutely not.

I read in some magazine that they were calling her a 'national treasure' and that I definitely disagree on that one.   I can't help thinking that the one thing which is missing from all of this is dignity.  I've had people close to me die of cancer and it is not very nice to see them suffering and her two children when they are older are going to see all this publicity and see pictures of their mother suffering.   If I was in that position, I don't think I'd like that all that much.|`|tod8jy9Paa	Bothered is not the correct word to use in her case, the majority of caring people feel great sympathy for her however there are a few that  I can only describe as callous who enjoy hitting a woman when she is down perhaps a better word to use for these few is cowards.

UkaBy2Hyaa	To put it context the last british soldier to die in Northern Ireland was 12 years ago so while I agree with you that people shouldn't fall into a panic there should be grounds for serious concern.<br>  <br>  If we look at the last year alone here's a few dissident activities.<br>  <br>  Feb 08: Andrew Burns shot dead by his own origination who thought he was an informer.<br>  June 08: failed landmine attack on 2 PSNI officers in Co Fermanagh. <br>  August 08: there was a rocket attack on a Catholic PSNI officer in Lisnaskea, dissidents used semtex to propel the rocket, before this it was thought they didn't have access to plastic explosives.<br>   there was a landmine attack on a Catholic PSNI officer,<br>  Sep 08,  Bomb blast attacks and riots in Cragavon orchestrated by dissidents<br>  Jan 09, police destroy a bomb packed with 300lb of explosive in Castlewellan, south of Belfast. A splinter republican group claims responsibility.<br>  Feb 09:  Jim McConnell shot dead by dissidents in Derry.<br>  <br>  So while I don't think this latest act of cowardly terror is a sign the troubles are returning I don't think we should underestimate what the dissidents are capable of.|`|Mp9Q9An4aa	No. If someone is going to such lengths to destabilise relations between Britain & Irish republicans then it's world headline material.<br>  <br>  Although I still object to the methods used in the peace process [would you free a person who had raped & killed 10,000 children from prison if they promised not to do it again???], the ends does appear to have justified the means until now.<br>  <br>  Whoever instigated this needs to be brought down immediately before we return to the bad old days of bombing civilian targets [London, Manchester, Warrington, Eniskillen to name but a few. that's from the top of my head even though they were many years ago].|`|AA11530144	Its called the politics of fear,haven't you noticed a lot of the American questions on here,we laugh at the unfounded fear in the American psyche<br>  but it keeps them where their politicians want them,we are going along the same path and its annoying, I have had to shout at some British questioners on here doing it,can you imagine waking up in fear of your own shadow it must be crap|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	yeah, but it does deserve attention.

I no longer support charities providing funding to Africa because I believe that this encourages the growth of a corrupt government.  Instead, I support a charity which trains volunteers in all kinds of skills from bookkeeping to carpentry and then sends them to Africa, where they in turn train locals.  This means that African people are able to develop skills, self-respect and the ability to fend for themselves.  And the government doesn't have anything to cream off for itself.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Two "massive " charity days on main stream TV- Comic Relief and Children in need- yet who has told the BBC that we want any fund raising efforts centred on just these 2 causes!<br>  <br>  There are other deserving causes in this Country- RSPCA, Blind, Parkinsons, Hospices, etc etc, yet Broadcasting House just pick these 2. How Democratic is that?|`|LPO8RlVdaa	You are so right!!!!

His movies are ******* ****<br>  <br>  : (|`|26t0dbQ5aa	No. Look what happened when Michael Winner was released.|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	First of all Stormy, his name is Charles Bronson not Manson and he should never be released, doesn't anyone read the nespapers?<br>  <br>  He has been described as Britain's most violent man and has spent most of his life in prison, 120 prisons in all.<br>  <br>  Some people have said they shouldn't make a film about him, why not? they've made countless films of Jack the ripper and John Christie.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I live near Luton and he was front page news this week in the local paper, if I can find it I'll put it on here tomorrow, it's often reported that he was born in Luton while in fact he was born to a respectable family in Aberystwyth in West Wales.|`|gYThMID8aa	He is pure scum and hardly worth a mention let alone make a film about him.<br>  I knew him for many years and he was his own worst enemy because of his evil ways.<br>  He took an art teacher hostage and kept him on a dog lead for days on end when he criticised his freaky drawings.<br>  Perhaps you would like him living next door to you when he gets out!|`|WaI693jHaa	You are very confused.<br>  Charles Bronson was an actor.<br>  Charles Manson was a power mad psychopath who convinced young people to brutally murder people.<br>  <br>  Every time a new generation comes along they think that people like Manson should be freed because they never lived through the times when these people spread their evil.<br>  <br>  As to what a new film coming out has to do with it, the mind boggles. Freedom through Hollywood perhaps?<br>  <br>  EDIT: OK - my mistake. Maybe a few more details and I'd have known which bloke you were on about.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Charles Bronson died six years ago, and I don't recall him ever being sequestered in a way that would make the notion of release relevant.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	I think you are asking about Manson, who should be killed, not released.|`|9PqAOQu1aa	Absolutely not!|`|qDLT1eh6aa	Do you mean Charles Manson?<br>  Bronson was an actor.|`|inST4SlAaa	you have to serve your time no matter how long it is.  plain and simple
4rfEWg1qaa	only 50% of the time. lol<br>  <br>  the rationalist above: hey, don't you like an extra hour of daylight while it's warm and beautiful in the region of the northern hemisphere that gets to see the difference of seasons?|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	I love it.  I like coming home in the light from work instead of in the dark.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Daylight Saving Time is a massive waste of resources.  I've always wondered why people cling to such an irrational notion.  The length of the daylight period is the same at a given time of year no matter how one sets the local time, and the exact moment of solar noon only moves by 20 minutes or so back and forth over the course of a year, so DST accomplishes nothing. It's an example of how superstitious traditions can override rational thought, even in those who are capable of rational thought.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Has it changed (UK)?  My computer is still saying the same time as my clocks ......... did I miss somat?<br>  <br>  And yes, I hate the Spring change because it's forward ....... getting up earlier.<br>  <br>  To the person who can't remember - Spring Forward,  Fall Back.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I actually like it.  It makes the day seem longer when it stays light out later.  When I get home from work I have some daylight to enjoy.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	yes i do............|`|AA11530144	I know how you feel, I've tried putting it in bottles, jars tins all sorts of containers and when I look its gone|`|9SDL2Mivaa	The people who love daylight savings should get up an hour early and let the rest of us sleep.|`|WUc9TbHCaa	No, I love it.|`|inST4SlAaa	something that happens twice a year will not bother me|`|g2MKwVCWaa	ALWAYS CONFUSE ME ONE HOUR AHEAD OR BACK|`|xywgBurHaa	Yep !! 'Sure do !!<br>  <br>  I'm filthy stinking rich.|`|imZDI6hyaa	only in the spring...<br>  lol
qXvFsnOcaa	Probably only if the preacher held up these banks as an example of greed during the sermon. These two organizations don't inspire thoughts of charity right now.<br>  <br>  People may think of the staff working there, such as the clerks and tellers who are suffering through no fault of their own. Many of them may even be in the congregation.|`|eNl8GhPUaa	the gm people are on the brink of not even being able to add to the collection plate. so, yeah, i think it's on a lot of people's minds.
v5fEfmO8aa	In my experiences, It has always turned a person for the worst. I have seen some of the nicest and loving people turn really nasty. But I do agree and believe that some individuals may not.|`|9KOjKZoMaa	I think yes for worse. <br>  <br>  With exception to the law and the powers that be, which in the wrong hands can be disastrous, the power of money and ‘working forces’ has proven to control, dictate and all for the worst reasons. Many a good person has tried to make change but has been blocked all the way or simply disappears. The worst power is the sheeple power, as they neither have the insight or courage to stand up and be counted, or the blind fools who follow their conniving leaders. As for personal power, I believe the only power a person can have over you is the power you give them.|`|c9sXhnKpaa	Well power can be bad to certain people and it can be good for others, but it doesn't depend on the person.  Majority of people change when they get a bit of power, they seem to make sure you know they're in charge, but I couldn't be like that.  If I became a supervisor or Manager and I wanted another member of staff to do a job for me then I would ask them to do it rather than tell them.|`|52ViykGPaa	I would say yes for the worse because "the ones that never had power dont know how to use it" meaning they might abuse it and start changing into something there not!!!!|`|QG6TlDGcaa	No, power merely gives people the ability to really be the bastards they always were inside.|`|6X10GhWsaa	It depends on the individual.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Absolutely and usually not in a positive way|`|yguqhf7Xaa	Money power, yes it change people life alot|`|5kYgkSBgaa	It does depend on the person but most likely they will change them for the worst because people, not all people but most people will start going power mad and turn for the worse.|`|zhahn0oRaa	it would depend on the person|`|muX5G72Vaa	Usually for worse.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	In our world power is what is always sought as the goal. It has many forms, but it is always held as the one solution to cure fear. Fear is based on "what if's" it is an ingrained part of our world that is counted on to fuel interest in news reporting and in our television program and movies, video games etc. So earthly power is covetted and once attained guarded so that it is not lost. It is guarded with paranoid anti-social behaviour. All of this is seen as positive to the majority of society because we cultivate this belief system that is based on what we see touch taste hear and can arrive at intellectually and scientifically. So earthly power changes people to hoard and compete. when they win someone loses, so it is a constant negative that is never enough.<br>  True power is eternal and unlimited. It is the polar opposite of earthly power because it is of the sixth sense...our deepest calling of our spirit to reconnect with our inner knowledge. It is not defined but glimpsed, and once glimpsed it is sought as an end to suffering. Power of the spirit transforms people in truth, so that they creatively give as they build and grow, then others win with them, so it is a constant positive that is always enough...and then some.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men."<br>  -John Dalberg Acton|`|AA11049477	I think power makes people worse.<br>  Absolute power corrupts, absolutely.|`|LPO8RlVdaa	Those who WANT power, it will corrupt absolutely.<br>  Those who have power thrust upon them but do not want it, it can make them stronger.|`|rJ4V4NkIaa	i think so as every one wants to be top dog

Lyjy3xO7aa	You are wise beyond your years.<br>  <br>  The Japanese have a saying about people like you though:<br>  <br>  "The nail that sticks out, is the one that gets hammered."|`|xZwwb3kVaa	They are like every other Country in the World... they have their          heroes, and their freaks. Plus we are all heroes in one way or another, as we all do things during our lifetime, of which some we are proud of and others which we are not, so do not class the USA as anyone different.In  parts of the USA you will find like I did that they value their heroes, and do not hide them, and also their past lives.Every thing  they cherish, and they exhibit and you can see many parts  which show this which is more than I can say for this Country, which at the present moment are destroying parts of Britain which can never be replaced, so being a sick freak does not qualify in this instance.|`|AA11280073	Oh, brother. These people are trying to destroy this country with their hate messages and negativity. There is no way that they are great Americans. They are close to being traitors.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Yeah, I've heard of all of these fools. <br>  <br>  Because they say irresponsible things that incite people.<br>  <br>  Because they play fast and loose with the facts.<br>  <br>  Because they make big money out of shooting off their mouths.<br>  <br>  Because their egos are bigger than the solar system.<br>  <br>  Because they use their listeners to do their dirty work.|`|9rhmeb7raa	Don't follow either of them. But, I'm pretty sure you misspelled the names of the first two.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	i like glenn beck because he tells the truth along with rush limbaugh|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Only heard of Rush Limbaugh.  <br>  <br>  When my son was 11 y.o. & we were sitting to dinner, he asked if we could put on that comedy show.  We only had 3 channels w/ no comedies except for "Married w/ Children " later in the evening.  He said, "No, the one with that comedian, the fat man."  I flipped channels to show there were none & he stopped me at Rush Limbaugh & laughed 'cause he says such stupid stuff.  He didn't know this guy was for real.  I thought that was funny.|`|eNl8GhPUaa	you have got to be kidding. when i think of "great" americans, not a single one of those douchebags makes the list. and if you love rush, at least spell his last name correctly.

c516704e5edca9c37dc1801993d8316eaa	Go to StephenieMeyer.com to read everything about it. I'll give you a little summary of whats going on. Stephenie wrote the first 12 chapters of Midnight Sun. Someone got a hold of it and illegally posted it on the internet. She is upset and does'nt want to finish writing the rest of it. She wanted readers to experience the whole thing edited. So as of right now it will not be published for a while. Or ever. She is so upset that she just put the 12 chapters on her website for people to read. I'm not going to read it until it's published. So there you go. It should be on her website. Hopefully that helped.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	At midnight.
